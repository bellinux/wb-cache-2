40|$|In this article, we {{will study}} how the mind/brain can individuate {{perceived}} objects and ascribe attributes or predicates to them for identification. Our analysis focuses on multiple <b>deictic</b> <b>reference.</b> Many conceptions of object perception are dependent on an hypothesis which suggests that perception relies essentially on the extraction and storage of object-intrinsic information, and especially on the reconstruction of an internal model of the 3 D spatial structures. A growing literature now criticizes the grounds of this assumption and instead emphasizes <b>deictic</b> <b>reference</b> or indexical representations. This literature postulates that the explanation of perception requires {{the study of the}} interactions between agent and environment, and of the different ways sensory-motor information connects to cognition through deictic (or demonstrative) reference. Following this trend of research, we question the role of spatial information and predicate ascription in visuo-motor <b>deictic</b> <b>reference.</b> For this purpose, we study an experimental paradigm called Modified Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) which shows that subjects can perform a task of multiple <b>deictic</b> <b>reference</b> in a context of spatial impoverishment. The task requires to reach targets in a 2 D display in which only the directions (and not the locations) of targets are displayed. According to our results, this task can be performed for a non-trivial number o...|$|E

In that context, in which collaborative learning processes are scattered above two distinct spaces, <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> to the objects in both spaces, the time of learners' actions, and the identity of participants are very important.

40|$|The debater {{system is}} an {{implementation}} of a model for argumentative discourse which aids in processing argumentative discussions on both the discourse level (the processing of what is said) and the surface syntactic level (the processing of certain syntactic phenomena like anaphora). The mechanism developed for processing argumentative discourse is called a multi-stack hierarchy. This tree-like structure proves useful in evaluating statements {{in the context of}} a debate and in responding to arguments in a coherent, organized manner. The multi-stack hierarchy provides a mechanism superior to Augmented Transition Network (ATN) grammars for processing discussions. The multi-stack hierarchy also can account for the usage of pronominal references as well as the presence of <b>deictic</b> <b>references.</b> These accounts are more satisfactory than explanations of pronominal and <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> using a single focus stack. The multi-stack hierarchy is an amalgam of the structures postulated by Cohen and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Deictic</b> <b>reference</b> – {{pointing}} at things during conversation – is ubiquitous in human communication, and {{should also be}} an important tool in distributed collaborative virtual environments (CVEs). Pointing gestures can be complex and subtle, however, and pointing {{is much more difficult}} in the virtual world. In order to improve the richness of interaction in CVEs, it is important to provide better support for pointing and <b>deictic</b> <b>reference,</b> and a first step in this support is to determine how well people can interpret the direction that another person is pointing. To investigate this question, we carried out two studies. The first identified several ways that people point towards distant targets, and established that not all pointing requires high accuracy. This suggested that natural CVE pointing could potentially be successful; but no knowledge is available about whether even moderate accuracy is possible in CVEs. Therefore, our second study looked more closely at how accurately people can produce and interpret the direction of pointing gestures in CVEs. We found that although people are more accurate in the real world, the differences are smaller than expected; our results show that deixis can be successful in CVEs for many pointing situations, and provide a foundation for more comprehensive support of deictic pointing...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares pronominal gender {{agreement}} in Dutch and German. Pronouns {{do not always}} agree with the gender of their antecedent: instead of agreeing with the lexical gender of the noun, they show semantic gender agreement. This is known to occur with human referents in both Dutch and German. In Dutch, pronouns can agree semantically with non-human referents as well, based on their degree of individuation. This type of agreement {{has been found in}} several Germanic varieties. It has been suggested for Dutch that this type of agreement resulted from the loss of the three-way nominal gender system. However, it has not been systematically investigated to what extent this type of agreement also exists in Germanic varieties that still distinguish three nominal genders, such as German. This paper presents the results of a pronoun elicitation experiment conducted both in Dutch and in German, testing pronominal reference to non-human referents with varying degrees of individuation. Two types of pronominal reference were tested: anaphoric and <b>deictic</b> <b>reference.</b> The results show that semantic agreement based on individuation occurs in both languages, in particular with animals, abstracts and masses. Semantic agreement is more frequent in <b>deictic</b> <b>reference</b> than in anaphoric reference in both languages. The languages differ with respect to the total frequency of semantic agreement, which is significantly higher in Dutch. This difference may be explained by the reduced visibility of lexical gender in Dutch compared to German. The findings suggest that semantic agreement based on individuation is a shared Germanic feature and that the difference between Dutch and German with respect to this kind of agreement is mainly one of degree...|$|E

They also have the temporal function in common to mark the time-relations between different parts of utterances which refer to a sequence of actions, events or slate of affairs. Each has, however, its own unique features. Toe for example could be described as "marked", since it can be used only to be indicative of the past, while nou and dan, on the other hand, are applicable in the broader spectrum of <b>deictic</b> <b>reference,</b> but not exactly parallel {{to each other in the}} different tenses...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} the results of a study that was conducted based on the analysis of Russian-speaking emigrant blogs. The study aimed at determining the set of group belongings (Turner et al., 1987; Baumeister & Leary, 1995) through the analysis of the <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> “we”, “you”, “they” and their forms. The novelty of this approach consists in directing our attention to the emigrants’ relationship with their context of origin. The results show the bloggers of our study desire to ensure and strengthen their belonging to the large Russian group. The stories in the posts and the negotiations that emigrants conduct in the comments section reveal an “insecure” identity (Tajfel, 1974), as opposed to the “secure” and at times hostile attitude of Russian commentators living in Russia...|$|R
40|$|A common {{assumption}} {{in recent}} criticism is that <b>deictic</b> <b>reference</b> in archaic Greek lyric (which was usually composed for an oral performance) {{should always be}} analyzed {{in relation to the}} place and time of the performance and to the persons of the performers, just as in ordinary face-to-face communication. In the first sections of this paper, Giovann Battista D'Alessio argues, focusing on temporal deixis and using comparative evidence, that this is not always the case, and that, on the contrary, the texts often emphasize the gap between the moment of composition and that of the performance, which can be projected into the future. In the final part, he examines some cases in which the past time of myth is re-enacted in the ritual present through texts whose deictic references merge both temporal levels together...|$|E

In this paper we significantly unpack the effects of remote gesturing on collaborative language, arguing for a more complex role for remote gestures in interaction. We demonstrate how remote gestures influence the structure of collaborative discourse, and how their use can also influence the temporal nature of the grounding process. Through generating a deeper understanding of these effects of remote gesturing on collaborative language we derive implications for the development and deployment of these technologies...|$|R

We {{developed}} and studied an experimental system, RealTourist, which lets a user {{to plan a}} conference trip {{with the help of}} a remote tourist consultant who could view the tourist’s eye-gaze superimposed onto a shared map. Data collected from the experiment were analyzed in conjunction with literature review on speech and eye-gaze patterns. This inspective, exploratory research identified various functions of gaze-overlay on shared spatial material including: accurate and direct display of partner’s eye-gaze, implicit <b>deictic</b> <b>referencing,</b> interest detection, common focus and topic switching, increased redundancy and ambiguity reduction, and an increase of assurance, confidence, and understanding. This study serves two purposes. The first is to identify patterns that can serve as a basis for designing multimodal human-computer dialogue systems with eye-gaze locus as a contributing channel. The second is to investigate how computer-mediated communication can be supported by the display of the partner’s eye-gaze. ...|$|R

Results show that subjects used twice as many <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> to persons when head orientation cues were present. We also found a linear relationship {{between the amount of}} actor gaze perceived by subjects and the number of speaking turns taken by subjects. Lack of gaze can decrease turn-taking efficiency of multiparty mediated systems by 25 %. This is because gaze conveys whether one is being addressed or expected to speak, and is used to regulate social intimacy.

40|$|Tracking user's visual {{attention}} {{is a fundamental}} aspect in novel human-computer interaction paradigms found in Virtual Reality. For example, multimodal interfaces or dialogue-based communications with virtual and real agents greatly benefit from {{the analysis of the}} user's visual attention as a vital source for <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> or turn-taking signals. Current approaches to determine visual attention rely primarily on monocular eye trackers. Hence they are restricted to the interpretation of two-dimensional fixations relative to a defined area of projection. The study presented in this article compares precision, accuracy and application performance of two binocular eye tracking devices. Two algorithms are compared which derive depth information as required for visual attention-based 3 D interfaces. This information is further applied to an improved VR selection task in which a binocular eye tracker and an adaptive neural network algorithm is used during the disambiguation of partly occluded objects. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{multimodal}} interface that learns words from natural interactions with users. In light {{of studies of}} human language development, the learning system is trained in an unsupervised mode in which users perform everyday tasks while providing natural language descriptions of their behaviors.

A multimodal learning algorithm uses this data to first spot words from continuous speech and then associate action verbs and object names with their perceptually grounded meanings. The central ideas are {{to make use of}} nonspeech contextual information to facilitate word spotting, and utilize body movements as <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> to associate temporally cooccurring data from different modalities and build hypothesized lexical items.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present our {{research}} on multimodal interaction in and with virtual environments. The {{aim of this}} presentation is to emphasize the necessity to spend more research on reference resolution in multimodal contexts. In multi-modal interaction the human conversational partner can apply more than one modality in conveying his or her message to {{the environment in which}} a computer detects and interprets signals from different modalities. We show some naturally arising problems but do not give general solutions. Rather we decide to perform more detailed research on reference resolution in uni-modal contexts to obtain methods generalizable to multi-modal contexts. Since we try to build applications for a Dutch audience and since hardly any research has been done on reference resolution for Dutch, we give results on the resolution of anaphoric and <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> in Dutch texts.

40|$|We present teleassistance, a two-tiered control {{structure}} for robotic manipulation that combines {{the advantages of}} autonomy and teleoperation. At the top level, a teleoperator provides global, <b>deictic</b> <b>references</b> via a natural sign language. Each sign indicates the next action to perform and a relative and hand-centered coordinate frame in which to perform it. For example, the teleoperator may point to an object for reaching, or preshape the hand for grasping. At the lower level autonomous servo routines run within the reference frames provided. Teleassistance offers two benefits. First, the servo routines can position the robot in relative coordinates and interpret feedback within a constrained context. This significantly simplifies the computational load of the autonomous routines and requires only a sparse model of the task. Second, the operator’s actions are symbolic, conveying intent without requiring the person to literally control the robot. This helps to alleviate {{many of the problems}} inherent to teleoperation, including poor mappings between operator and robot physiology, reliance on a broad communication bandwidth, and the potential for robot damage when solely under remote control.
