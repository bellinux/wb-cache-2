40|$|Introduction: This survey {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} German ambulatory physicians' opinions about mandatory {{continuing medical education}} (CME) and CME resources shortly before the introduction of mandatory CME in 2004. Methods: A structured national telephone survey of general practitioners and specialists was conducted. Main outcome measures were opinions about mandatory CME, preferred CME media, and financial aspects of CME. Data analysis applied Pearson's correlation coefficient for explorative analysis of correlations, analysis of variance for group comparison, and 2 -test for investigation of distribution of 2 or more categorical variables. Results: Of the 511 participants, 73 % felt that CME supported them in keeping up to date with new medical knowledge, yet only half believed {{in its ability to}} minimize medical errors or increase quality of patient care. Traditional ways of learning were preferred. Significant differences in CME behavior were found between primary-care physicians and specialists, the latter using more communicative media. Also, a small group of very skeptical physicians who do not agree with the need for CME in <b>general</b> was identified. <b>Average</b> <b>expenditure</b> for CME was estimated between 500 and 1000 Euros per year. A majority of physicians called for other parties, eg, health insurances or government, to share the financial responsibility for CME. Discussion: Mandatory CME was accepted as a necessity already before the new legislation took effect, with prevailing skepticism at the same time. Future research is needed on how to motivate physicians and especially certain subgroups of physicians to use CME methods shown to be effective in changing clinical behavior...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} information feedback in rent-seeking games with two different contest structures. In the stochastic contest a contestant wins the entire rent with probability equal to her share of rent-seeking expenditures; in the deterministic contest she receives {{a share of the}} rent equal to her share of rent-seeking expenditures. Information feedback has very different effects depending on the contest structure. We observe the highest rent dissipation in stochastic contests when players only get feedback on own choices and earnings. In these contests aggregate expenditures usually exceed the value of the rent. We find that giving additional feedback about rivals' choices and earnings moderates <b>average</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In contrast, in deterministic contests <b>average</b> <b>expenditures</b> converge to equilibrium levels when subjects only get feedback about own choices and earnings. In these contests additional feedback about rivals' choices and earnings has the opposite effect of raising <b>average</b> <b>expenditures...</b>|$|R
