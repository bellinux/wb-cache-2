5|$|Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is {{considered}} inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, {{the head of}} Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and <b>human</b> <b>values.</b> Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in {{the ground with the}} head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. <b>Human</b> <b>values</b> are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E

The paper identifies recommendations for management theory and practice regarding the scope and limits of action that could be taken by business organisations to improve <b>human</b> <b>value.</b> The need for management theory to develop a typology of factors determining positive, negative or mixed effects of for-profit activity on <b>human</b> <b>value</b> is identified, and preliminary suggestions are advanced...|$|R

25|$|Though {{hopeful that}} {{humanity}} will ultimately prosper {{by the use}} of automatons, he mentions a few ways this relationship with technology could be detrimental. Automatons must not be taken for granted, because with advances in technology that allow them to learn, the machines may be able to escape human control if humans do not continue proper supervision of them. We might become entirely dependent on them, or even controlled by them. There is danger in trusting decisions to something which cannot think abstractly, and may therefore be unlikely to identify with intellectual <b>human</b> <b>values</b> which are not purely utilitarian.|$|E

At the Nuremberg Tribunal, three categories of wartime criminality were established: waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

25|$|Tulsidas was {{inspired}} by Adhyatma Ramayana, where Rama and other characters of the Valmiki Ramayana along with their attributes (saguna narrative) were transposed into spiritual terms and abstract rendering of an Atma (soul, self, Brahman) without attributes (nirguna reality). According to Kapoor, Rama's life story in the Ramacharitamanasa combines mythology, philosophy and religious beliefs into a story of life, a code of ethics, a treatise on universal <b>human</b> <b>values.</b> It debates in its dialogues the human dilemmas, the ideal standards of behavior, duties to those one loves, and mutual responsibilities. It inspires the audience to view their own lives from a spiritual plane, encouraging the virtuous to keep going, and comforting those oppressed with a healing balm.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 Maezumi {{married his}} second wife, Martha Ekyo Maezumi, {{and later the}} couple had three {{children}} (his daughter Kyrie Maezumi is an actress). In 1976, Maezumi founded the non-profit Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism and <b>Human</b> <b>Values,</b> promoting academic scholarship on Buddhist topics. The White Plum Asanga was also established during this period. His senior student Tetsugen Bernard Glassman opened the Zen Community of New York in 1979 with Maezumi's blessing and encouragement. Another student, John Daido Loori, acquired land in the Catskill Mountains of New York and in 1980 established Zen Mountain Monastery (ZMM) with Maezumi; Loori was installed as Abbot at ZMM in 1989. That following year Maezumi founded a summer retreat for the ZCLA called the Yokoji Zen Mountain Center, which today serves as a year-round residential and non-residential Zen training center. In 1984 another student, Dennis Merzel, left ZCLA to establish the Kanzeon Sangha, an international network practicing in the Sanbo Kyodan lineage.|$|E
