In {{order to}} minimize the chance of bacteria or viruses entering the bloodstream, people are advised to wash their hands with soap and warm water. However, as people do not always have access to hot water and soap when they are injecting, the philosophy of harm reduction seeks {{to find the most}} realistic and reliable option that drug users will take; a process that takes much time or access to material is unlikely to be used frequently. Alcohol swabs are commonly distributed with injecting equipment, and while they are less effective than hand washing, their use is more effective than nothing. Any sharing of injecting equipment, even tourniquets, is highly discouraged, due to the high danger of transmitting bacteria and viruses via the equipment.|$|E

40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} fibrous filters made of microfibers, the nanofibrous filters exhibit some special performances. Here, PVA nanofibrous membrane with thickness 28. 37 um {{was made by}} electrospinning 8 % PVA solution on conventional cotton scaffold. The air filtration test system was built to test the filtration performance between PVA nanofibrous membrane and conventional fibrous filters which include meltblown PP nonwoven <b>filter</b> and common <b>cotton</b> <b>filter</b> with 12 layers. In experiments, the filtration efficiencies of particles distribution 0. 3 - 5 um were attained, at the same times, another important parameter, pressure-drops, were observed. Through data analysis, {{it is found that}} the pressure-drop of <b>cotton</b> <b>filter</b> is the least, while the filtration efficiency is the least. The meltblown nonwoven filter has higher filtration efficiency, but pressure-drop increases accordingly. The nanofibrous filter has the best efficiency, while the pressure-drop is beyond respirator request. In addition, SEM is used to observe the particles distribution in filter, from the SEMS images of filters, the different filtration mechanisms are analyzed and discussed. Finally it is found that the direct inception and the inertial impact get obvious as diameter of nanofiber decreasing rapidly, so filtration process mainly concentrates on the surface of PVA nanofibrous membrane, almost no particles distribute in cotton scaffold. Generally speaking, nanofibrous membranes are very promising and economic tools to enhance filtration performances of filters...|$|R
40|$|Specialized {{analytical}} methods {{are required for}} identification of components of agricultural dusts such as those generated in harvesting, transportation, storage, and processing of cotton, corn, and soybeans. The larger particles and trash components of the dusts can often be identified visually or {{with the aid of}} an optical microscope (OM). The respirable portion of the dust, that which causes lung dysfunction, retains few structural features for identification. Electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis, together with special optical microscopical techniques, can be used to characterize these microdusts. Combination studies with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of cotton dusts have shown the presence of mineralogical particles probably of a soil origin and materials that can be associated with plant parts. Even in screened and <b>filtered</b> <b>cotton</b> dusts, fibrillar fragments are usually present due to their ability to penetrate openings the size of their diameters. The corn and soybean dusts studied were different from the cotton dust in that the large fibrillar component of the cotton dust was absent in the screened grain dusts. However, these dusts consisted of structurally unrecognizable particles that appeared similar to those found in cotton dust. In addition they contained many spheroid particles identified as starch. Dusts from all three sources were found to agglomerate into larger particles, some of which were still < 10,um. This agglomeration could confuse the instrumental measurement of dust particle size...|$|R

40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} to develop affordable, energy-saving, and highly-effective technologies {{to alleviate the}} current water crisis. In this work, we reported a low-cost electrochemical filtration device composing of a conductive <b>cotton</b> <b>filter</b> anode and a Ti foil cathode. The device was operated by gravity feed. The conductive <b>cotton</b> <b>filter</b> anodes were fabricated by a facile dying method to incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as fillers. The CNTs could serve as adsorbents for pollutants adsorption, as electrocatalysts for pollutants electrooxidation, and as conductive additives to render the <b>cotton</b> <b>filters</b> highly conductive. Cellulose-based cotton could serve as low-cost support to ‘host’ these CNTs. Upon application of external potential, the developed filtration device could not only achieve physically adsorption of organic compounds, but also chemically oxide these compounds on site. Three model organic compounds were employed to evaluate the oxidative capability of the device, i. e., ferrocyanide (a model single-electron-transfer electron donor), methyl orange (MO, a common recalcitrant azo-dye found in aqueous environments), and antibiotic tetracycline (TC, a common antibiotic released from the wastewater treatment plants). The devices exhibited a maximum electrooxidation flux of 0. 37 mol/h/m 2 for 5. 0 mmol/L ferrocyanide, of 0. 26 mol/h/m 2 for 0. 06 mmol/L MO, and of 0. 9 mol/h/m 2 for 0. 2 mmol/L TC under given experimental conditions. The effects of several key operational parameters (e. g., total cell potential, CNT amount, and compound concentration) on the device performance were also studied.

The response to the upper limit of the calibration range is stable for more than 50 injection cycles recorded within 3 days.

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of drugs are injected. Among the most popular in many {{countries}} are morphine, heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. Prescription drugs—including tablets, capsules, and even liquids and suppositories—are also occasionally injected. This applies particularly to prescription opioids, since some opioid addicts already inject heroin. Injecting preparations which were not intended for this purpose is particularly dangerous {{because of the presence}} of excipients (fillers), which can cause blood clots. Injecting codeine into the bloodstream directly is dangerous because it causes a rapid histamine release, which can lead to potentially fatal anaphylaxis and pulmonary edema. Dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, nicocodeine, and other codeine-based products carry similar risks. Codeine may instead be injected by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route. The effect will not be instant, but the dangerous and unpleasant massive histamine release from the intravenous injection of codeine is avoided. To minimize the amount of undissolved material in fluids prepared for injection, a <b>filter</b> of <b>cotton</b> or synthetic fiber is typically used, such as a cotton-swab tip or a small piece of cigarette filter.|$|R

The relationship between the volumetric solid : water ratio and the isotopic fractionation between adsorbed water and unconfined water was investigated for the materials silage, hay, organic soil (litter), <b>filter</b> paper, <b>cotton,</b> casein and flour. Each of these materials was equilibrated via the gas phase with unconfined water of known isotopic composition to quantify the isotopic difference between adsorbed water and unconfined water.

The observed isotopic fractionation was not caused by solutes, volatiles or old water because the fractionation did not disappear for washed or oven-dried silage, the isotopic fractionation was also found in <b>filter</b> paper and <b>cotton,</b> and the fractionation was independent of the isotopic composition of the unconfined water.
