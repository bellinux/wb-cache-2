5|$|<b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance {{occurs in}} the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series; {{the premise of the}} series centers on the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Set fifty years after Simon Belmont vanquished Dracula's curse, <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance focuses on his grandson Juste Belmont and his quest to rescue a kidnapped childhood friend.|$|E
5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the visual quality of <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania: <b>Harmony</b> <b>of</b> Dissonance was re-released in North America in January 2006, {{along with}} Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, {{as part of}} Castlevania Double Pack. Both games are {{contained}} on a single GBA Game Pak. This pack also appeared in Europe later that year. It was picked as the IGN Game Boy Game of the Month for January 2006.|$|E

5|$|Taoist temples in {{southern}} China and Taiwan may often {{be identified by}} their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, {{as well as on}} the hairpin of a Celestial Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.|$|E
5|$|Although Uncle Tupelo {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for {{its impact on the}} alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E
5|$|Music critics {{gave the}} record mixed reviews, praising the <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> its {{material}} but also criticizing it for being repetitive. Commercially, I Am the Club Rocker experienced success in selected countries, peaking at number eight in Mexico {{and within the}} top 30 in Czech Republic, Belgium and France. It was certified Gold by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV) for selling 10,000 copies in Poland, and was also {{named one of the}} best albums of 2011 by Inna's label Roton, alongside Wounded Rhymes (2011) by Lykke Li and Christmas (2011) by Michael Bublé.|$|E
5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the <b>harmony</b> <b>of</b> nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E
