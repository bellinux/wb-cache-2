25|$|On {{the level}} of {{developmental}} psychology the Gestaltkreis teachings correspond to Jean Piaget's observances {{on the development of}} the early childhood structures of perception, attitude and thought. In continual assimilation and accommodation processes, the motor cognitive and the emotional development work together and determine each other. The development of the senses, the continually differentiating thought and comportment structures, and the experience of space and time are, for Piaget, the prerequisites for developing the ability to symbolize. Compatible with this are the theories of development in depth psychology, where the main emphasis is on early childhood experience with the people with whom one has relationships and where the condition for a healthy development <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> relationship with the person to whom one relates most closely (Balint, Mahler, Ericson, Winnicott, Kohut and Kernberg).|$|E

Though it is often {{hard for people to}} understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E

500|$|The nightingale's song {{within the}} poem is {{connected}} to the art of music {{in a way that the}} urn in [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] {{is connected to the}} art of sculpture. As such, the nightingale would represent an enchanting presence and, unlike the urn, is directly connected to nature. As natural music, the song is for beauty and lacks a message of truth. Keats follows Coleridge's belief, as found in [...] "The Nightingale", in separating from the world by losing himself in the bird's song. Although Keats favours a female nightingale over Coleridge's masculine bird, both reject the traditional depiction of the nightingale as related to the tragedy of Philomela. Their songbird <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> nightingale that lacks the melancholic feel of previous poetic depictions. The bird is only a voice within the poem, but it is a voice that compels the narrator to join with in and forget the sorrows of the world. However, there is tension in that the narrator holds Keats's guilt regarding the death of Tom Keats, his brother. The song's conclusion represents the result of trying to escape into the realm of fancy.|$|E
500|$|Boucher and McComas's {{original}} {{goal for}} the new magazine was to imitate the formula that had made Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine successful: classic reprints, along with quality fiction that avoided {{the excesses of the}} pulps. [...] The initial proposal called for the magazine to include fantasy, but not science fiction. [...] Even before the launch, the editors found they were having trouble deciding exactly where the boundary lay, so when in February 1949 Joseph Ferman, Spivak's general manager, asked them to add sf to the lineup as a way to broaden the readership, they were happy to comply. [...] The first issue included only one story that could be called science fiction: Theodore Sturgeon's [...] "The Hurkle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Happy</b> Beast"; it also included reprints from the slick magazines by writers such as Richard Sale, and Guy Endore. [...] The interior layout was quite different from the existing fantasy and sf magazines: there were no interior illustrations, and the text was printed in a single column, instead of two as was usual elsewhere. [...] There was a book review column, but no letters page. [...] According to sf historian Mike Ashley, this [...] "set F apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine". [...] The logo design and layout were the work of Mercury Press's art director, George Salter, whose background was in book design rather than in pulp magazines. [...] Salter remained with the magazine until 1958. [...] He was responsible for many of the surreal early covers; these gave way to work by other artists, but his design for F remained intact for decades, and in Ashley's opinion the consistency of appearance has been [...] "one of the major selling points" [...] of the magazine.|$|E

2500|$|... "Desiree's Baby" [...] {{was first}} {{published}} in an 1893 issue of Vogue magazine, alongside another of Kate Chopin's short stories, [...] "A Visit to Avoyelles", under the heading [...] "Character Studies: The Father of Desiree's Baby - The Lover of Mentine." [...] "A Visit to Avoyelles" [...] typifies the local color writing that Chopin was known for, and is one of her stories that shows a couple in a completely fulfilled marriage. While Doudouce is hoping otherwise, he sees ample evidence that Mentine and Jules' marriage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> and fulfilling one, despite the poverty-stricken circumstances that they live in. In contrast, in [...] "Desiree's Baby", which is much more controversial, due to the topic of miscegenation, portrays a marriage in trouble. The other contrasts to [...] "A Visit to Avoyelles" [...] are very clear, although some are more subtle than others. Unlike Mentine and Jules, Armand and Desiree are rich and own slaves and a plantation. Mentine and Jules' marriage has weathered many hard times, while Armand and Desiree's falls apart {{at the first sign of}} trouble. Kate Chopin was very talented at showing various sides of marriages and local people and their lives, making her writing very broad and sweeping in topic, even as she had many common themes in her work.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Abe's Oddysee, Abe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy,</b> ignorant worker at RuptureFarms, a meat-packing plant. Working late at RuptureFarms, he passes an advertisement billboard for the upcoming latest product, and eavesdrops on the factory’s annual board meeting. Because wildlife have become depleted, Abe's boss Molluck the Glukkon has {{decided to use the}} factory's Mudokon slaves as a source of saleable meat: [...] "Mudokon Pops!". After this epiphany (reminiscent {{of the end of the}} film Soylent Green), Abe panics and escapes from his workplace. At the end of the game's introductory sequence- a retrospective voiced by Abe- Abe runs for his life. Outside the factory, Abe falls from a cliff, and the Mudokons’ spiritual leader, Big Face, informs him that the animals slaughtered and processed to manufacture 'Tasty Treats', were formerly held sacred by the Mudokuns, and that Abe must relight holy flames extinguished by the Glukkons, in the abandoned temples containing these species. Abe does this with the aid of his steed 'Elum', and is thereafter empowered by Big Face to destroy the Glukkons and their technology. This done, Abe infiltrates RuptureFarms, frees the remaining slaves, and destroys the board of executives; but is himself captured by Molluck's security guards. If a sufficient number of Mudokuns have been rescued in gameplay, the free Modokuns electrocute Molluck, and Big Face presents Abe to a jubilant crowd; if not, the free Modokuns abandon Abe, and Molluck's servitor drops him into a shredding-machine.|$|E

[...] Washington added, [...] "Such content isn’t unusual in today’s pop culture landscape, where cable TV’s raunch is stealing viewers and awards from broadcast networks and the Cat in the Hat tells dirty jokes on movie screens."

The critique regarded Jackson to [...] "freely pursues her sexual and love fantasies", noting [...] "If she ever seemed tentative in her erotic explorations in the past, she's completely self-assured here.

2500|$|Mr. Freeze is {{featured}} in [...] Mr. Freeze's freeze gun {{can be found}} in the evidence room at the Gotham City Police Department. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side misson [...] "In From The Cold". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryochamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies [...] "merely days". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> or sad outcome for the Fries'.|$|E
