50|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, 1,350 {{workers on}} {{offshore}} oil drilling platforms were evacuated {{in preparation for the}} storm. The oil <b>drilling</b> <b>tender</b> Murmanill No. 1 sunk due to the strong waves, though the two people on board at the time were evacuated by helicopter. At the coast, the maximum storm surge height measured was 4.7 ft at the Schooner Bayou Control Structure. Bertha dropped heavy rainfall primarily as a remnant low across much of The Ozarks. Rainfall peaked at 13.77 in near Damascus, Arkansas, which set a 24-hour rainfall record for the city and made August 1957 the wettest month on record. Across Arkansas, the heavy rains triggered flash floods after numerous rivers exceeded flood stage. The flash floods caused property damage in cities adjacent to rivers. Though damage estimates were difficult to accurately obtain, four Arkansas counties reported combined losses of $925,000, and two deaths were reported.|$|E
5000|$|Assigned to Division Two (Training and Experimental Division), Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, G-3 {{combined}} {{the training of}} new student crews in submarine operations and torpedo firing with experimental work as needed. The latter included harbor net defense deployment <b>drills</b> with <b>tender</b> [...] in June and stationary dives with a submarine rescue bell in the Thames River in September. In late October, G-3 carried out instructional sound work with , a task resumed in early 1918 in company with a succession of submarine chasers and patrol boats.|$|R
50|$|On 2 May, Thrush {{arrived at}} Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to begin {{training}} operations which lasted through the summer. Engaged in antisubmarine <b>drills,</b> the seaplane <b>tender</b> towed targets for dive-bomber practices; retrieved practice torpedoes; and acted as an escort for R class submarines engaged in training exercises with aircraft. Upon completion of this duty, the ship moved south and made port at Norfolk on 9 August for availability which lasted through 11 September. Heading further south, Thrush {{took part in}} the dismantling of naval air bases at Almirante Bay, Panama, and at Moneypenny Anchorage, Nicaragua. She then deployed to Baltra Island in the Galápagos group during November and returned to Panamanian waters in December. Operating in the Panama Canal Zone through January 1944, Thrush subsequently carried a U.S. Army surveying party to the Cocos Islands and to the Honduran coast in March before towing a Navy oil barge back to Panama. From April through September, the ship participated in submarine training exercises off Key West, Florida, and towed targets for submarines and aircraft before putting into the Norfolk Navy Yard for availability. Following repairs, she headed south, via Trinidad, to Surinam and arrived at Paramaribo on 19 November. She anchored off the mouth of the Surinam River and commenced tending Martin PBM's—a duty which lasted through March 1945, punctuated briefly by an inspection at Trinidad. Subsequently, Thrush returned to the routine operations of beaching and repairing aircraft, fueling them, and feeding their crews. Acting also as a floating radio station, the seaplane tender continued these duties from her return from Trinidad on 24 March to 4 June.|$|R
