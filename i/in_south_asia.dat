Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} {{the population of}} the fulvous whistling duck to be from 1.3–1.5million individuals. This may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1million birds in the Americas, 1.1million in Africa and at least 20,000 <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> Although the population appear to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by the IUCN as being of Least Concern. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.|$|E

5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is vital for our {{understanding}} of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental shelf shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the continental shelf to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E

5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period.

The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, as the Indian {{independence}} movement intensified, an upsurge of Muslim nationalism helmed by the All-India Muslim League took place, of which Muhammad Ali Jinnah {{was the most}} prominent leader.

In 1956, 23 March also became the date on which Pakistan transitioned from a dominion to a republic, and is known as Pakistan Day.|$|E
