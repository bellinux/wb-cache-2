50|$|Menemerus bivittatus is {{a spider}} in the Salticidae family {{commonly}} known as the <b>gray</b> <b>wall</b> <b>jumper.</b> It is a pantropical species and is usually found on the walls of buildings or on tree trunks where it stalks its prey.|$|E
5000|$|The female <b>gray</b> <b>wall</b> <b>jumper</b> builds an eggsac in a crack {{or other}} {{concealed}} {{position in which}} she lays 25 to 40 eggs in a purse-like silken case. She guards the eggs until they hatch in about three weeks time after which the young spiders disperse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>wall</b> <b>jumpers</b> are dorso-ventrally {{flattened}} and {{are covered}} with short dense, grayish-white hairs. There are tufts of dark brown bristles near the large, forward-facing eyes. The spiders are about nine millimetres long, the male being slightly smaller than the female. The male has a blackish longitudinal dorsal stripe with a brownish-white stripe {{on either side of}} the abdomen. The carapace and chelicerae are also black and white and the legs have transverse bandings of the same colours. The female is generally paler and more brown, with a larger carapace and abdomen. Her carapace is edged with two black bands and a thin white stripe and her abdomen is edged with broad black stripes on each side which unite at the posterior end. Her legs are banded but are paler than those of the male. Immature spiders resemble the female.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} used spatial {{reorientation}} task paradigms to identify underlying cognitive mecha-nisms of navigation in children, adults, {{and a range}} of animal species. Despite broad interest in this task across disciplines, {{little is known about the}} brain bases of reorientation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural activity in adults during a virtual reality version of the reorientation task. Three environments that varied in the cues provided were studied: a rectangular room with 4 identical <b>gray</b> <b>walls</b> (Geometry), a square room with 3 <b>gray</b> <b>walls</b> and 1 red wall (Feature), and a rectangular room with 3 <b>gray</b> <b>walls</b> and 1 red wall (Feature Geometry). Multiple areas within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) showed increased activation when a feature was present compared with when reorientation was based only on geometric cues. In contrast, reliance on geometric cues signifi-cantly activated a number of non-MTL structures, including the prefrontal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus. These results provide neural evidence for processing differences between the 2 types of cue as well as insight into developmental and comparative aspects of reorientation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} East and West Berlin society {{before and}} shortly after the Wende, the social changes that occurred {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall and German reunification. This is best depicted in the stories The <b>Wall</b> <b>Jumper.</b> The Lives of Others and Good Bye Lenin!. These stories about German society illustrate the attitudes of East and West Berliners in their respective societies by showing good and bad aspects of democracy and socialism...|$|R

50|$|The {{color of}} the walls is used to {{structure}} the collection. Italian artwork is exhibited in rooms with deep red walls. Dutch and Flemish paintings are shown on green backgrounds. Spanish and French pictures from the 17th century are displayed on <b>gray</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Towards Irwin’s {{last years}} {{of working with the}} discs he reintroduced the line into his work. He sliced a thin three-inch wide line through the middle of the discs to add a pop of color (the <b>gray</b> <b>wall)</b> and disrupt the minimalism.|$|R
60|$|But Lancelot's sadness {{reached its}} crisis, as {{he met the}} hounds just outside the churchyard.

60|$|For some minutes Nigel {{remained}} motionless upon {{the crest of}} the hill, his heart, like lead within him, and his eyes fixed upon the huge <b>gray</b> <b>walls</b> which contained his unhappy henchman.

60|$|The {{rest was}} an easy task enough. First the twine was drawn up to and over the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine, and last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin, slender black line against the silent <b>gray</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Near neutrals are {{obtained}} by mixing pure colors with white, black or grey, or by mixing two complementary colors.

25|$|That morning {{observers}} on the 16th {{floor of}} the M Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a <b>gray</b> <b>wall</b> covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer. A blast of wind hit the building that caused the floor to move and the glass window to creak, and then the wall of white enveloped the building. It was 11:10 am.|$|R

50|$|In 1953, CBS {{strongly}} persuaded Irna Phillips to let The Guiding Light {{experiment with}} television's first color broadcast.

60|$|By and by {{we reached}} Assisi, which is magnificently {{situated}} for pictorial purposes, with a gray castle above it, and a <b>gray</b> <b>wall</b> around it, itself on a mountain, and {{looking over the}} great plain which we had been traversing, and through which lay our onward way.
