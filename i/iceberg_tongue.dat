5000|$|Blodgett <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> (...) {{is a large}} <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongue</b> {{that extends}} seaward from the {{vicinity}} of Cape Morse and Cape Carr {{on the east side}} of Porpoise Bay. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Gardner D. Blodgett, Office of Geography, Department of Interior, who, in 1955, prepared a sketch map of the coastal features of Antarctica between 84°E and 144°E from U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946-47) aerial photographs. Since the <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongue</b> was partially delineated for the first time on the 1955 sketch map by Blodgett, use of his name for it is considered appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|Dibble <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> (...) is an <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongue</b> at the seaward end of Dibble Glacier Tongue. The names Dibble Glacier and Dibble Glacier Tongue {{were applied}} by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in 1955, {{concurrent}} with G.D. Blodgett's delineation {{of the features}} from aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946-47). The offshore segment of these two related features was photographed by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions in 1956 and 1959, and the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia subsequently recommended that it be named Dibble <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue.</b> US-ACAN has approved the latter name only for the portion lying seaward of Dibble Glacier Tongue.|$|E
5000|$|The Dalton <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> (...) {{is a large}} <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongue</b> {{that extends}} seaward from {{the eastern part of}} Moscow University Ice Shelf. The feature was partly {{delineated}} from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946-47). It was mapped on the basis of observation by Phillip Law from Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE [...] ) aircraft in 1958, and visited in February 1960 by the ANARE (Magga Dan) led by Phillip Law, and named by the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia for R.F.M. Dalton, second-in-command of the latter expedition.|$|E

40|$|The Greenland Ice Sheet covers {{an area of}} 1, 720, 000 sq. km and {{contains}} approximately 2, 600, 000 cu km of ice. Most of the ice sheet receives an excess of snow accumulation over the amount of ice lost to wind, meltwater run-off or other ablative processes. The majority of mass loss occurs at {{the margin of the}} ice sheet as either surface melt, which flows into the sea or calving of <b>icebergs</b> from the <b>tongues</b> of outlet glaciers. Many estimates of these processes were published. An average of five published estimates is summarized. If these estimates are correct, then the Greenland Ice Sheet is in approximate equilibrium and contributes 490 cu km/a of fresh water to the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Climate effects, ice sheet flow, and application of remote sensing to tracking of the ice sheet are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{present a}} study of {{seasonal}} and interannual ice velocity changes at Polar Record Glacier, East Antarctica, using ERS- 1 / 2, Envisat and PALSAR data with D-InSAR and intensity tracking. Ice flow showed seasonal variations {{at the front of}} the glacier tongue. Velocities in winter were 19 % less than velocities during summer. No significant interannual changes were detected. Ice velocities in the grounding zone and grounded glacier did not show clear seasonal or interannual changes. The distribution of the seasonal variations suggests that the cause for the changes should be localized. Possible causes are seasonal sea-ice changes and iceberg blocking. Satellite images show that the sea ice surrounding Polar Record Glacier undergoes seasonal changes. Frozen sea ice in winter slowed the huge iceberg, and provided increased resistance to the glacier flow. The interaction between the glacier <b>tongue,</b> <b>iceberg</b> and sea ice significantly influences their flow pattern...|$|R
5000|$|The Thwaites <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> (...) {{was a large}} <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongue</b> {{which was}} aground in the Amundsen Sea, about 32 km {{northeast}} of Bear Peninsula. The feature was about 112 km long and 32 km wide, and in January 1966 its southern extent was only 5 km north of Thwaites Glacier Tongue. It consisted of icebergs which had broken off from the Thwaites Ice Tongue and ran aground, {{and should not be}} confused with the latter, which is still attached to the grounded ice. It was delineated by the USGS from aerial photographs collected during Operation Highjump and Operation Deepfreeze. It was first noted in the 1930s, but finally detached from the ice tongue and broke up in the late 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Dibble Glacier Tongue (...) {{is a large}} {{glacier tongue}} {{extending}} seaward from Dibble Glacier in Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The seaward end of the glacier tongue is named Dibble <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue.</b> It was delineated from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946-47), and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Jonas Dibble and the unsung crew members of the United States Exploring Expedition squadron under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, 1838-42.|$|E
5000|$|Moscow University Ice Shelf (...) is {{a narrow}} ice shelf, about 120 nmi km long, which fringes the Sabrina Coast of Antarctica between Totten Glacier and Paulding Bay. Dalton <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> extends north {{from the eastern}} part of the shelf. The feature was partly {{delineated}} from aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump in 1946-47, and further photographed and mapped by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions and the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1958. It was named by the Soviet expedition after Moscow University.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} meltwater {{events in the}} North Atlantic, a simple iceberg generation, drift, and melting routine was implemented in a high-resolution OGCM. Starting from the modelled last glacial state, every 25 th day cylindrical model icebergs 300 meters high were released at 32 specific points along the coasts. Icebergs launched at the Barents Shelf margin spread a light meltwater lid over the Norwegian and Greenland Seas, shutting down the deep convection and the anti-clockwise circulation in this area. Due to the constraining ocean circulation, the <b>icebergs</b> produce a <b>tongue</b> of relatively cold and fresh water extending eastward from Hudson Strait that must develop at this location, regardless of iceberg origin. From {{the total amount of}} freshwater inferred by the icebergs, the thickness of the deposited IRD could be calculated in dependance of iceberg sediment concentration. In this way, typical extent and thickness of Heinrich layers could be reproduced, running the model for 250 years of steady state with constant iceberg meltwater inflow. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the evolution of}} two major rifts cutting across Mertz Glacier Tongue, East Antarctica, {{using a combination of}} satellite images and 60 day sets of GPS data from two stations deployed either side of the western rift in 2007. The eastern rift began to open in the early 1990 s, and the western rift initiated in 2002 in conjunction with the collision of a large <b>iceberg</b> with the <b>tongue.</b> Velocity time series derived from the 2007 GPS data exhibited strong variations at tidal periods modulated by sea-surface height and sea-surface slope and reproduced here with a conceptually simple model. We found that opening of the western rift in 2002 leads to a dramatic change in behavior of the tongue as the large range in velocity (700 - 2400 m a(- 1)) observed in 2000 was largely reduced (1075 - 1225 m a(- 1)) in 2007. Opening of the western rift decoupled the glacier from the transverse loading on the tongue driven by east-west tidal circulation. This loading previously induced time-varying lateral drag, which caused the large velocity range. Our results suggest changes in the mechanical behavior of an ice tongue impact the dynamics of the outlet glacier system and should be considered in longer-term mass-balance evaluations...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{continuous}} monitoring of ice break-up on ice shelves and icebergs in Antarctica {{is essential for}} a global observation system of climate change and its consequences. While calving of massive pieces of ice from the Antarctic ice shelf is well observed from satellites, numerous ice breaks of smaller volume cannot be systematically monitored and statistically analysed by the existing means of remote sensing and local in-situ observations. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of an alternative monitoring approach based on remote acoustic observations of ice rifting and breaking events on Antarctic ice shelves and icebergs using distant underwater acoustic listening stations in the ocean. This investigation was carried out using long-term continuous sea noise recordings made from 2002 to 2007 at two hydroacoustic stations deployed in the Indian Ocean {{as part of the}} International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: off Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (HA 01) and off Chagos Archipelago (HA 08). Investigations of a number of scientific and technical issues relevant to the main objective were carried out in this study. They include: 1) processing of the CTBT hydroacoustic data from the two IMS stations with the aim of detecting and identifying signals received from Antarctic ice breaking events; 2) investigating the time-frequency arrival structure of the signals expected from ice events using experimental data and numerical modelling of acoustic propagation from Antarctica to the IMS stations in the Indian Ocean; 3) analysing the bearing accuracy of the IMS stations; 4) examining three different schemes for localization of ice events using either one or two IMS stations; 5) analysing the spatial distribution of Antarctic ice events observed over 6 years of data collection and its correlation with the major glacial features of the Eastern Antarctic coastal zone which are most likely sources of newly calved icebergs and underwater noise produced by ice breakup; 6) analysing long-term variations in the occurrence of ice events and their links with changes in climate related metocean characteristics of the Eastern Antarctic coastal zone. A number of important findings and conclusions were made {{based on the results of}} this study. It was revealed that Antarctica is one of the major sources of low-frequency underwater noise at the two IMS stations in the Indian Ocean. The transient signals received at the IMS stations from Antarctic ice events consist mainly of a mode one arrival pulse with strong frequency dispersion, which is due to the acoustic propagation characteristics in the near-surface acoustic channel of the polar ocean environment south of the Antarctic Convergence Zone (ACZ). Both HA 01 and H 08 S stations have bearing estimate accuracy for transient acoustic noise in Antarctica of about 0. 2 ° RMS. The bearing error of HA 01 also has a systematic component of around 0. 8 ° clockwise. The bearing deviation induced by horizontal refraction of acoustic propagation across the ACZ polar frontal zone and over the continental slopes can be considerable, up to 1 ° for sources located in the easternmost and westernmost parts of the Eastern Antarctic coastal zone observed from the IMS stations. The localization of Antarctic ice events can be achieved either by triangulation using bearing estimates, if the same event can be detected at both stations, or by estimating the range to the noise source through inversion of mode 1 dispersion characteristic when the signal is detected only at one station. The location of ice events in the Antarctic coastal zone can also be coarsely estimated from the low cut-off frequency of mode 1 measured at the receive station. The majority of ice events observed at HA 01 were located within a number of back-azimuth sectors which correspond to the directions to the ice shelves and <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongues</b> which are known as active zones of ice break-up in Eastern Antarctica. The temporal changes in the occurrence frequency of ice events detected at HA 01 reveal strong seasonal variations but no significant interannual trend. Based on the main results and findings, this study achieved its primary aim to demonstrate the feasibility of remote monitoring of ice rifting and breaking events on Antarctic ice shelves and icebergs using the IMS hydroacoustic listening stations deployed in the Indian Ocean...|$|R
40|$|The first {{velocity}} {{measurements for}} Thwaites Glacier {{were made by}} R. J. Allen in 1977. He compared features of Thwaites Glacier and <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> on aerial photography from 1947 and 1967 with 1972 Landsat images, and measured average annual displacements of 3. 7 and 2. 3 km/a. Using his photogrammetric experience and taking into consideration the lack of definable features and the poor control in the area, he estimated an average velocity of 2. 0 to 2. 9 km/a to be more accurate. In 1985, Lindstrom and Tyler also made velocity estimates for Thwaites Glacier. Using Landsat imagery from 1972 and 1983, their estimates of the velocities of 33 points ranged from 2. 99 to 4. 02 km/a, {{with an average of}} 3. 6 km/a. The accuracy of their estimates is uncertain, however, because in the absence of fixed control points, they assumed that the velocities of icebergs in the fast ice were uniform. Using additional Landsat imagery in 1984 and 1990, accurate coregistration with the 1972 image was achieved based on fixed rock points. For the period 1972 to 1984, 25 points on the glacier surface ranged in average velocity from 2. 47 to 2. 76 km/a, with an overall average velocity of 2. 62 +/- 0. 02 km/a. For the period 1984 to 1990, 101 points ranged in velocity from 2. 54 to 3. 15 km/a, with an overall average of 2. 84 km/a. During both time periods, the velocity pattern showed the same spatial relationship for three longitudinal paths. The 8 -percent acceleration in a decade is significant. This recent acceleration may be associated with changes observed in this region since 1986. Fast ice melted and several icebergs calved {{from the base of the}} <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> and the terminus of Thwaites Glacier. However, as early as 1972, the <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> had very little contact with the glacier...|$|E
30|$|High sea-ice {{production}} in the Cape Darnley polynya results from the ice barrier (grounded <b>iceberg</b> <b>tongue)</b> blocking the westward advection of sea ice. The change or collapse of the barrier can cause a pronounced change in sea ice and AABW production. Such a scenario {{can be applied to}} other high ice production polynyas which are potentially areas of AABW source. These imply that a drastic change in fast ice extent, which is vulnerable to climate change (Fraser et al. 2012), causes dramatic changes in the polynyas and possibly AABW formation that can potentially contribute to further climate change.|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of thin sea ice thickness and its variability {{is a key}} to accurate estimation of surface albedo, oceanatmosphere heat-fluxes, and rates of ice production and salt-flux. For the validation and improvement of the thin ice thickness algorithm using the satellite passive microwave data, we have done in-situ observations in thin ice region in the Southern Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk, using a helicopter-borne portable passive microwave radiometer same sensor as the satellite launched Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer- 2 (AMSR- 2). High-resolution helicopter-borne results show good agreement with low-resolution AMSR-E/AMSR- 2 results, within the range of the standard deviation. In the Sea of Okhotsk experiment, the results derived from the helicopter-borne sensor are fitting to the past thin ice thickness algorithm. In the Southern Ocean experiment, the polarization ratio of 36 GHz vertical and horizontal temperatures in the Dalton <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> Polynya in October is estimated to be 0. 137 in average. This value does not conflict with past in-situ observations, theoretical models, and thin ice thickness algorithms. We further found the microwave characteristics of fast versus pack ice, leading to the improvement for the fast ice detection algorithm. 第 4 回極域科学シンポジウム個別セッション：[OM] 気水圏 11 月 15 日（金） 統計数理研究所 ３階セミナー室１（D 305...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{attention}} {{has focused on}} accelerated glacial losses along the Amundsen Sea coast that result from changes in atmosphere and ocean circulation, with sea ice playing a mediating but not well-understood role. Here, we investigated how sea ice {{has changed in the}} Amundsen Sea over the period of 1979 to 2014, focusing on spatio-temporal changes in ice edge advance/retreat and percent sea ice cover in relation to changes in winds. In contrast to the widespread sea ice decreases to the east and increases {{to the west of the}} Amundsen Sea, sea ice changes in the Amundsen Sea were confined to three areas: (i) offshore of the shelf break, (ii) the southern Pine Island Polynya, and (iii) the eastern Amundsen Sea Polynya. Offshore, a 2 -month decrease in ice season duration coincided with seasonal shifts in wind speed and direction from March to May (relating to later ice advance) and from September to August (relating to earlier retreat), consistent with reported changes in the depth/location of the Amundsen Sea Low. In contrast, sea ice decreases in the polynya areas corresponded to episodic or step changes in spring ice retreat (earlier by 1 – 2 months) and were coincident with changes to Thwaites <b>Iceberg</b> <b>Tongue</b> (located between the two polynyas) and increased southeasterly winds. Temporal correlations among these three areas were weak, indicating different local forcing and/or differential response to large-scale forcing. Although our analysis has shown that part of the variability can be explained by changes in winds or to the coastal icescape, an additional but unknown factor is how sea ice has responded to changes in ocean heat and freshwater inputs. Unraveling cause and effect, critical for predicting changes to this rapidly evolving ocean-ice shelf-sea ice system, will require in situ observations, along with improved remote sensing capabilities and ocean modeling...|$|E
