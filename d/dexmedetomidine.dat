5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or <b>dexmedetomidine).</b> SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and <b>dexmedetomidine.</b> Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
2500|$|Clonidine {{also has}} several off-label uses, {{and has been}} {{prescribed}} to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders, and hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. [...] Clonidine is also a mild sedative, {{and can be used}} as premedication before surgery or procedures. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. [...] Clonidine has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of <b>dexmedetomidine</b> withdrawal. Clonidine can be used in restless legs syndrome. It {{can also be used to}} treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine has also been used to treat diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, withdrawal-associated diarrhea, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors and cholera.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexmedetomidine</b> is {{a highly}} {{selective}} α2-adrenergic agonist. Unlike opioids and other sedatives such as propofol, <b>dexmedetomidine</b> is able to achieve its effects without causing respiratory depression. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> induces sedation by decreasing activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus in the brain stem, thereby increasing the activity of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. In contrast, other sedatives like propofol and benzodiazepines directly increase activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons. Sedation by dexemeditomidine mirrors natural sleep. As such, <b>dexmedetomidine</b> provides less amnesia than benzodiazepines. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> also has analgesic effects at the spinal cord level and other supraspinal sites. Thus, unlike other hypnotic agents like propofol, <b>dexmedetomidine</b> {{can be used as}} an adjunct medication to help decrease the opioid requirements of people in pain while still providing similar analgesia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexmedetomidine</b> {{may enhance}} {{the effects of}} other {{sedatives}} and anesthetics when co-administered. Similarly, drugs that lower blood pressure and heart rate, such as beta blockers, may also have enhanced effects when co-administered with <b>dexmedetomidine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies suggest}} <b>dexmedetomidine</b> for {{sedation}} in mechanically ventilated adults may reduce time to extubation and ICU stay. People on <b>dexmedetomidine</b> are arousable and cooperative, {{and as such}} are able to actively cooperate with various procedures.|$|E
5000|$|Compared {{with other}} sedatives, {{some studies suggest}} <b>dexmedetomidine</b> may be {{associated}} with less delirium. However, this finding is not consistent across multiple studies. At the very least, when aggregating many study results together, usage of <b>dexmedetomidine</b> appears to be associated with less neurocognitive dysfunction compared to other sedatives. Whether this has beneficial psychological impact is unclear. [...] From an economic perspective, <b>dexmedetomidine</b> is associated with lower ICU costs. These decreased costs are largely due to a shorter time to extubation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dexmedetomidine,</b> {{sold under}} the trade names Precedex among others, is an anxiety reducing, sedative, and pain medication. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> is notable {{for its ability}} to provide {{sedation}} without risk of respiratory depression (unlike other commonly used sedatives such as propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam) and can provide cooperative or semi-arousable sedation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexmedetomidine</b> {{can also}} be used as sedoanalgesic for {{procedural}} sedation, such as during colonoscopy. It can be used as an adjunct with other sedatives like benzodiazepines, opioids, and propofol to enhance sedation and help maintain hemodynamic stability by decreasing the requirement of other sedatives. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> is also used for procedural sedation in children.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of metabolized <b>dexmedetomidine</b> is excreted {{in the urine}} ~95%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexmedetomidine</b> is {{most often}} used in the {{intensive}} care setting for light to moderate sedation. It is not recommended for long term deep sedation. A unique feature of <b>dexmedetomidine</b> is that it has analgesic properties in addition to its role as a hypnotic, but is opioid sparing, and is therefore not associated with significant respiratory depression (unlike propofol).|$|E
50|$|There are no {{absolute}} contraindications {{to the use}} of <b>dexmedetomidine.</b> <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> has a biphasic {{effect on}} blood pressure with decreased blood pressure observed at lower concentrations and elevated blood pressure at higher concentrations. Rapid IV administration or bolus has been associated with slow heart rate (bradycardia) and low blood pressure (hypotension) due to peripheral α2-receptor stimulation.|$|E

50|$|Intravenous <b>dexmedetomidine</b> {{exhibits}} linear pharmacokinetics with a rapid distribution half-life {{of approximately}} 6 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. Plasma protein binding of dexemedotomindine is ~94% (mostly albumin).|$|E
50|$|Midazolam, a {{benzodiazepine}} {{characterized by}} a rapid onset and short duration, is effective in reducing preoperative anxiety, including separation anxiety in children. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> and certain atypical antipsychotic agents {{may be used in}} uncooperative children.|$|E
50|$|Similar to clonidine, {{it is an}} agonist of α2-adrenergic receptors {{in certain}} parts of the brain. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> {{hydrochloride}} is also used in veterinary medicine for dogs and cats. The drug was developed by Orion Pharma.|$|E
50|$|In the European Union, <b>dexmedetomidine</b> {{received}} a marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on August 10, 2012 under {{the brand name}} of Dexdor. It is indicated for sedation in the ICU for patients needing mechanical ventilation.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{intraspinal}} {{injection of}} the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the α-adrenergic agents <b>dexmedetomidine</b> and clonidine, produce a dose-dependent elevation of pain thresholds in the Northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens).

50|$|Ketamine {{has been}} proven safe, when used in servals, {{together}} with medetomidine (Domitor, Dorbene, Dormilan, Medetor, Sedastart, Sedator, Sededorm) and butorphanol (Alvegesic, Dolorex, Torbugesic, Torbutrol, Torphasol) with the antagonist atipamezole (Alzane, Antisedan, Atipam, Revertor, Sedastop). <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> (Dexdomitor) is {{a new version of}} medetomidine, with fewer side effects.|$|E
50|$|Inhibitors of CYP27A1 may be {{effective}} as adjuvants {{in the treatment}} of ER-positive breast cancer due to inhibition of the production of 27-hydroxycholesterol (which has estrogenic actions and stimulates the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells).

For this reason, the dose must be carefully adjusted to achieve the desired clinical effect.|$|E
50|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine.

50|$|Agitated {{patients}} are best treated with benzodiazepines, but antipsychotics such as haloperidol and olanzapine {{may also be}} useful. The alpha-2 agonist <b>dexmedetomidine</b> may also be useful for treatment of agitation, but effects on heart rate and blood pressure are variable based on several studies and case reports. Lidocaine and intravenous lipid emulsion have been successfully used for serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias in several case reports.|$|E

50|$|A {{link between}} high {{cholesterol}} {{and breast cancer}} has been identified, {{and it has been}} proposed that this is due to 27-HC production by CYP27A1. Because of its estrogenic action, 27-HC stimulates the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells, and has been implicated in limiting the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer. As such, identified CYP27A1 inhibitors, including the marketed drugs anastrozole, fadrozole, bicalutamide, <b>dexmedetomidine,</b> ravuconazole, and posaconazole, have been proposed as potential adjuvant therapies in ER-positive breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexmedetomidine</b> was {{approved}} in 1999 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a short term sedative and analgesic (<24 hours) for critically ill or injured people on mechanical ventilation {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU). The rationale for its use short term was due to concerns over withdrawal side effects, such as rebound high blood pressure. These withdrawal side effects have not been consistently observed in research studies, however. More recently, in 2008 the FDA expanded its indication to include nonintubated people requiring sedation for surgical or non-surgical procedures, such as colonoscopy.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{induction}} of targeted temperature management, pharmacological agents to control shivering must be administered. When body temperature drops below a certain threshold—typically around 36 C—people {{may begin to}} shiver. It appears that regardless of the technique used to induce hypothermia, people begin to shiver when temperature drops below this threshold. Drugs commonly used to prevent and treat shivering in targeted temperature management include acetaminophen, buspirone, opioids including pethidine (meperidine), <b>dexmedetomidine,</b> fentanyl, and/or propofol. [...] If shivering is unable to be controlled with these drugs, patients are often placed under general anesthesia and/or are given paralytic medication like vecuronium. People should be rewarmed slowly and steadily {{in order to avoid}} harmful spikes in intracranial pressure.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-NEMD is {{a potent}} {{sedative}} drug which acts as a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It {{is closely related to}} <b>dexmedetomidine</b> but is several times more potent. Like other alpha-2 agonists, it produces sedative and muscle relaxant effects but without producing respiratory depression. It is not currently used in medicine but has been researched as the basis for a potential new generation of alpha-2 agonist drugs, which may have selectivity for the different subtypes of the alpha-2 receptor. It has two isomers, with the (S) isomer being the more potent, as with medetomidine. 4-NEMD was also investigated by the United States military as an anaesthetic agent, most likely for use in surgery but possibly also for use as a non-lethal incapacitating agent.|$|E
50|$|Medetomidine is a {{synthetic}} drug used {{as both a}} surgical anesthetic and analgesic. It is often used as the hydrochloride salt, medetomidine hydrochloride, a crystalline white solid. It is an α2 adrenergic agonist that can be administered as an intravenous drug solution with sterile water. The drug has been developed by Orion Pharma. It is currently approved for dogs in the United States, and distributed in the United States by Pfizer Animal Health and by Novartis Animal Health in Canada under the product name Domitor. Other alpha-two agonists used in veterinary medicine include xylazine and detomidine, but their use is less common in small animal surgery. The marketed product is a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers; <b>dexmedetomidine</b> is the isomer with more useful effects, and is now marketed as Dexdomitor.|$|E
50|$|Midazolam is {{effective}} in children in reducing anxiety associated with separation from parents and induction of anesthesia. Sufentanil is also sometimes used as a premedication. Clonidine is becoming increasingly popular as a premedication for children. One drawback of clonidine {{is that it can}} take up to 45 minutes to take full effect. In children, clonidine {{has been found to be}} equal to and possibly superior to benzodiazepines as a premedication. It has a more favourable side effect profile. It also reduces the need for an induction agent. It improves post-operative pain relief, is better at inducing sedation at induction, reduces agitated emergence, reduces shivering and post-operative nausea and vomiting and reduces post-operative delirium associated with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam are more commonly used due largely to a lack of a marketing effort by the pharmaceutical companies. As a result, clonidine is becoming increasingly popular with anesthesiologists. <b>Dexmedetomidine</b> and atypical antipsychotic agents are other premedications which are used particularly in very uncooperative children.|$|E
5000|$|Clonidine {{also has}} several off-label uses, {{and has been}} {{prescribed}} to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders, and hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders.

50|$|Norepinephrine has higher {{affinity}} for the α2 receptor than has epinephrine, and therefore relates less to the latter's functions. Nonselective agonists include the antihypertensive drug clonidine, used to lower blood pressure and hot flashes associated with menopausal symptoms. Clonidine has also been successfully used in indications that exceed what would be expected from a simple blood-pressure lowering drug: it has recently shown positive results in children with ADHD who suffer from tics resulting from the treatment with a CNS stimulant drug, such as Adderall XR or methylphenidate; clonidine also helps alleviate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The hypotensive effect of clonidine was initially attributed through its agonist action on presynaptic α2 receptors, which act as a down-regulator {{on the amount of}} norepinephrine released in the synaptic cleft, an example of autoreceptor. However, it is now known that clonidine binds to imidazoline receptors with a much greater affinity than α2 receptors, which would account for its applications outside the field of hypertension alone. Imidazoline receptors occur in the nucleus tractus solitarii and also the centrolateral medulla. Clonidine is now thought to decrease blood pressure via this central mechanism. Other nonselective agonists include <b>dexmedetomidine,</b> lofexidine (another antihypertensive), TDIQ (partial agonist), tizanidine (in spasms, cramping) and xylazine. Xylazine has veterinary use.|$|E
