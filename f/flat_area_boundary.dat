25|$|The Dock Ward {{was one of}} 15 wards of Belfast City Council {{prior to}} 1973. Its {{boundaries}} were the Antrim Road, Clifton Street, North Queen St, Great George's Street and Brougham Street. From 1973–1985 the eastern boundary of the New Lodge ward was North Queen Street. The boundaries were extended to York Street and Clifton Park Avenue in 1985. In 1993 the Antrim Road boundary was restored with the Unity <b>flats</b> <b>area</b> added. These <b>boundaries</b> are used for census information.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} area {{as a whole is}} {{dominated}} by hills and valleys, there are several <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> within the <b>boundaries</b> of the commune. These include the areas Pietra Lata, Casone e Macchie near the provincial road [...] "Marrucina" [...] (ex SS 538), at Fonte Roberto and Ciaò (between Villa Mascitti and Casino Vezzani), in the areas surrounding Villa Tucci (Padule, Pozzo e Capo Lemare) and at S. Maria Cardetola. The elevation slowly decreases from southwest to northeast. The minimum elevation of 86 m above sea level is at Piano di Morrecine in the valley of the Arielli stream (northern areas) while the maximum elevation is 276 m at the old railway station near the border with the commune of Arielli.|$|R
30|$|In [14], binary {{information}} is inserted into an HDR image encoded in RGBe format by substituting the least significant bits (LSBs) of each pixel with bits {{taken from the}} secret message. In more detail, the HDR image is divided into <b>flat</b> and <b>boundary</b> <b>areas</b> by comparing the exponents associated to neighboring pixels. The number of bits which can be embedded into each color channel is then adaptively determined {{on the basis of}} local contrast and depending on the considered area, embedding more bits in high contrast and dark regions than in smooth and bright ones. The method capacity, tested on seven HDR images, is around 10 bits per pixel (bpp). Its imperceptibility is evaluated by converting the HDR images into their LDR counterparts by means of a TMO and measuring the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the tone-mapped cover image and the tone-mapped watermarked image, obtaining values around 30 dB.|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{elevation}} models may {{not provide}} the accuracy and detail necessary to accurately delineate small watersheds. Moreover, they may not accurately reflect the impact of roads and their ditches on these small watersheds, particularly in <b>flat</b> <b>areas.</b> This research study investigates the differences of utilizing high resolution LiDAR and standard USGS-based elevation data for watershed and drainage pattern delineation along the Iowa 1 corridor between Iowa City and Mount Vernon. Given the limited breadth of the analysis corridor (approximately 18 miles long with LiDAR data available immediately proximate to the road centerline, 0. 25 to 1. 5 miles), areas of particular emphasis are the location of drainage <b>area</b> <b>boundaries</b> and flow patterns parallel to and intersecting the road cross section.

50|$|The {{municipality}} has {{an average}} altitude of forty meters above sea level. There are three main terrain types, mountain terrain, semi <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>areas.</b> The mountains consist of the Sierra de la Laguna and the Sierra de San Lázaro, both formed of volcanic rock, covering about fifteen {{percent of the}} total territory with peaks between 400 and 1000 meters. The semi <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> are located between the coast and the mountain ranges, mostly of sedimentary rock and account for sixty percent of the territory. The <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> are along the coast, beaches and alluvial plains, which account for twenty five percent of the territory.|$|R

50|$|The {{municipality}} {{is found}} in the southwest of the Sierra Norte de Puebla in a transition zone.

The municipality proper is in one of these larger <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> about fourteen km long and nine km wide with an average altitude of 2,500 meters above sea level with variations between 1,360 and 2,600. Main elevations include Moxhuite, Kiosco, Matlahuacala, Los Cazares, Tecoxcalman, Peña Blanca, Xahuatl, Tampol Tenampulco, Titicanale, Chignahuimazatla, Texis Proterito, Pelón and Zempoala.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects on upper limb and lower back muscles activities during prolonged sitting in two different work <b>area</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The effects are measured from the muscle activities of subjects performing two repetitive tasks at the near work <b>area</b> <b>boundary</b> and at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary.</b> Subjects consisted of 10 males (age 27. 7 +/- 5. 42) and 10 females (age 27. 5 +/- 5. 91) with no history of musculoskeletal injury or back problem at the time of participation. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal were recorded from the right and left Levator Scapulae, Upper Trapezius, Anterior Deltoid and Erector Spinae which are known as the weaken and tighten muscles due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The EMG signal was processed and normalized in the form of % MVC for analysis. The overall results indicated that muscle activities in the upper limb and lower back increased significantly when performing work at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary.</b> The most active muscle is the Left Erector Spinae (2. 37 % MVC at the near, 2. 91 % MVC at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary),</b> while the lowest active muscle is the Left Anterior Deltoid (0. 09 % MVC at the near, 0. 13 % MVC at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary).</b> The muscle activity at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary</b> is on average 17 % greater than at the near work <b>area</b> <b>boundary.</b> Females showed greater muscular activity compared to males at the near (average difference, 1. 28 % MVC) and at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary</b> (average difference, 1. 56 % MVC). The result of independent sample t-test showed significant differences on muscle activities at the near and at the far work <b>area</b> <b>boundary</b> between males and females. The results above indicate the importance to predict the muscle activity and time to fatigue. A regression equation model to predict muscle activity and time to fatigue is developed in this research...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany real objects, such as faces, sculptures, or low-reliefs are {{composed}} of many detailed parts {{that can not be}} easily modeled by an artist nor by 3 D scanning. In this paper, we propose a new shape from shading (SfS) approach to rapidly model details of these objects such as wrinkles and reliefs of surfaces from one photograph. The method first determines the surface's <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> in the photograph. Then, it constructs a graph of relative altitudes between each of these <b>flat</b> <b>areas.</b> We circumvent the ill-posed problem of shape from shading by having the user set if some of these <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> are a local maximum or a local minimum; additional points can be added by the user (e. g. at discontinuous creases) – this is the only user input. We use an intuitive mass-spring based minimization to determine the final position of these <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> and a fast-marching method to generate the surface. This process can be iterated until the user is satisfied with the resulting surface. We illustrate our approach on real faces and low-relief photographs...|$|R
