5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone {{on the outside of}} the skull. The jugals <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider than in any other known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E

500|$|The flowers {{themselves}} {{are composed of}} five petals which are fused at one end. The throat, {{the portion of the}} flower near the attachment point which holds the reproductive organs, is funnel shaped, and the petals <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> from there into a five-lobed zygomorphic corolla. The flowers 30 to 50 millimeters (1¼–2in.) long. [...] Below the attachment point to the stem the petals are fused into a 15–30millimeter long spur which protrudes backwards roughly perpendicular {{to the rest of the}} flower.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} of Plectania nannfeldtii is shallowly cup- or goblet-shaped {{and may be}} up to [...] in diameter. The edges of the cup are {{somewhat}} wavy, and remain curled inward until they <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> when they are very old. The external surface is covered with delicate blackish-brown hairs, while {{the color of the}} surface underneath is also brownish-black. The surface wrinkles when the fruit body is dry. The internal, convex surface of the cup contains the spore-producing tissue layer known as the hymenium; it is black. The stem is thin and may be up to [...] long with a diameter of 2–3mm, tapering towards the base. Like the fruit body, it is covered in delicate brownish-black hairs, and it is similar in color to the outer surface of the cup. The dense, coarse mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem is black. The flesh is thin and blackish-gray.|$|E

2500|$|Zamorros {{somewhat}} resemble batwing chaps, in {{that the}} leggings are closely fitted at the thigh and <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> below the knee, but unlike batwings, the leggings extend far below the boot with a distinctive triangular flare. [...] Zamorros are commonly made of cowhide, either plain tanned leather or hides with the hair on. [...] They are popular with Paso Fino aficionados, and are derived from styles seen in Colombia. Historically, the word zamorros simply referred to a basic shotgun-like style of either smooth or hair-on chaps worn by Colombian riders.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} types of images that were made throughout the century are single-mandorla triads. [...] The similarities between the triads found in the former Baekje and Goguryeo kingdoms suggest that the introduction of such images came from both Goguryeo itself as well as China. [...] An example of the [...] influence of the Northern Wei style is the statue now at the National [...] Museum of Korea. [...] This image, probably once {{a part of a}} single-mandorla triad, has robes draped in the same style as the Yong'a Buddha. [...] However, the [...] Baekje-specific [...] modifications, such as the gentleness of the face, Omega-like folds in the under robe, and a sense of stability exhibited in the expansiveness of the robes as they <b>flare</b> <b>out,</b> clearly differentiate this image from those from Goguryeo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{globular}} N-terminal {{domains of}} each subunit are identical. [...] They {{are made up}} of two, antiparallel beta sheets that face each other in a beta sandwich-like structure (i.e., a [...] "flattened" [...] beta barrel) and are separated by two alpha helices on one side. [...] The N-terminus begins with one beta sheet composed of strands 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by a helix-turn-helix motif of the two alpha helices, αA and αB, which continues into strands 5, 6, 7, and ending with one alpha-helical stalk at the C-terminus. [...] αA and αB are perpendicular to one another, and because one end of αB is partially inserted between the two beta sheets, it causes them to <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> away from each other. [...] The beta sandwich structure is held together through three hydrogen bonds between antiparallel strands 4 and 7 and one hydrogen bond between strands 1 and 5.|$|E

2500|$|The terms ama and aka {{have been}} adopted for the modern trimaran. Since trimarans are {{generally}} designed to sail with one ama out of the water, they are similar to an Atlantic proa, with the buoyant leeward ama providing {{the bulk of the}} stability for the long, relatively thin main hull. Some modern proa designers have borrowed trimaran design elements for use in proas. [...] Trimarans often have main hulls that are very narrow at the waterline, and <b>flare</b> <b>out</b> and extend over {{a significant portion of the}} akas. [...] This topheavy design is only practical in a multihull, and it has been adapted by some proa designers. [...] Notable examples are the designs of Russell Brown, a boat-fittings maker who designed and built his first proa, Jzero, in the mid-1970s. [...] He has created a number of proa designs, all of which follow the same theme.|$|E
2500|$|For a given {{frequency}} and horn length, {{there is some}} flare angle that gives minimum reflection and maximum gain. [...] The internal reflections in straight-sided horns come from the two locations along the wave path where the impedance changes abruptly; the mouth or aperture of the horn, and the throat where the sides begin to <b>flare</b> <b>out.</b> [...] The amount of reflection at these two sites varies with the flare angle of the horn (the angle the sides make with the axis). [...] In narrow horns with small flare angles most of the reflection occurs {{at the mouth of}} the horn. [...] The gain of the antenna is low because the small mouth approximates an open-ended waveguide. [...] As the angle is increased, the reflection at the mouth decreases rapidly and the antenna's gain increases. [...] In contrast, in wide horns with flare angles approaching 90° most of the reflection is at the throat. [...] The horn's gain is again low because the throat approximates an open-ended waveguide. [...] As the angle is decreased, the amount of reflection at this site drops, and the horn's gain again increases.|$|E
