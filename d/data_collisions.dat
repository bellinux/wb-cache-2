The malware targets specific users of Microsoft Windows-based computers {{and has been}} linked to the US intelligence gathering agency NSA and its British counterpart, the GCHQ. The Intercept provided samples of Regin for download including malware discovered at Belgian telecommunications provider, Belgacom. Kaspersky Lab says it first became aware of Regin in spring 2012, but that some of the earliest samples date from 2003. (The name Regin is first found on the VirusTotal website on 9 March 2011.) Among computers infected worldwide by Regin, 28 percent were in Russia, 24 percent in Saudi Arabia, 9 percent each in Mexico and Ireland, and 5 percent in each of India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria and Pakistan. Kaspersky Lab have recently discovered multiple attack vectors used. USB, & BIOS modification allows the bulk of malware to be injected through ports 1,2,3 & 5. Many extra services & processes are visible to the victim. The 'back room' of the creators finds collisions in SHA2 message digests, suggesting a lot of CPU time is taken up.

40|$|In {{order to}} process {{continuous}} queries over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), sensors are typically organized in a Query Routing Tree (denoted as T) that provides each sensor with a path over which query {{results can be}} transmitted to the querying node. We found that current methods deployed in predominant data acquisition systems construct T in a sub-optimal manner which leads to significant waste of energy. In particular, since T is constructed in an ad hoc manner {{there is no guarantee}} that a given query workload will be distributed equally among all sensors. That leads to <b>data</b> <b>collisions</b> which represent a major source of energy waste. Additionally, current methods only provide a topological-based method, rather than a query-based method, to define the interval during which a sensing device should enable its transceiver in order to collect the query results from its children. We found that this imposes an order of magnitude increase in energy consumption. In this paper we present MicroPulse+, a novel framework for minimizing the consumption of energy during data acquisition in WSNs. MicroPulse+ continuously optimizes the operation of T by eliminating data transmission and data reception inefficiencies using a collection of in-network algorithms. In particular, MicroPulse+ introduces: (i) the Workload-Aware Routing Tree (WART) algorithm, which is established on profiling recent data acquisition activity and on identifying the bottlenecks using an in-network execution of the critical path method; and (ii) the Energy-driven Tree Construction (ETC) algorithm, which balances the workload among nodes and minimizes <b>data</b> <b>collisions.</b> We show through micro-benchmarks on the CC 2420 radio chip and trace-driven experimentation with real datasets from Intel Research and UC-Berkeley that MicroPulse+ provides significant energy reductions under a variety of conditions thus prolonging the longevity of a wireless sensor network...|$|E
