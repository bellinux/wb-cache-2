30|$|The skin {{friction}} is investigated mainly by numerical simulation {{by means of}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurement with wind tunnel experiment. Measurement of {{skin friction}} is important in providing insight into the flow mechanism as well as validation for CFD techniques. Traditionally, skin friction is directly measured by friction balance [4]. Even though friction balance has high precision, there are some disadvantages to this method. It cannot get the local distribution of the skin friction in a specific component. Moreover, the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> may change the local shape and {{make it difficult to}} achieve accurate measurement in the joint area or thinner area. Therefore, advanced high-precision surface friction measurement technology must be developed.|$|R

40|$|Achieving high quality, consistency, {{and testing}} {{efficiency}} in wind tunnel tests using internal balances is accomplished {{through the use}} of new testing methods, analysis of data output, and standardized documentation of test procedures at the Texas A&M Low Speed Wind Tunnel. The wind tunnel is capable <b>of</b> performing internal <b>balance</b> testing on models that experience less than 500 pounds of normal force.

Documentation of procedures and check- lists for <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>balance</b> testing equipment and test execution provide higher efficiency and consistency during a test. A step-by-step examination of the data analysis routines and associated uncertainty equations show uncertainty in the force and moment coefficients for the Mark XIII internal balance to be approximately ? 0. 05 and ? 0. 02, respectively. Quantifying the uncertainty of the primary output parameters and showing repeatability of the data within the defined uncertainty limits achieved higher quality results...|$|R
40|$|Centralized and {{decentralized}} {{mechanical ventilation}} have become state-of-the-art in modern energy-efficient residential buildings. Calculations {{for the energy}} demand of buildings are done with nominal values of the ventilation units, assuming a proper function of the devices. The used ventilation concepts may {{be divided into two}} main categories- centralized and decentralized units and both come with advantages and disadvantages in terms of energy efficiency. In Luxembourg, a comprehensive field test has been performed in order to evaluate and compare their performance in practice. It could be shown that ventilation systems often do not meet the expectations. High unbalances in volume flows, high sensitivity to pressure differences and recirculation were measured in several cases. Only a proper <b>installation</b> and <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> the systems can ensure an energy efficient function...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 A {{catalytic}} gas process compressor experienced {{low frequency}} vibrations {{in excess of}} trip levels following <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a honeycomb <b>balance</b> piston. After 12 years of operation, low seal oil differential forced an unplanned unit shutdown. The source was identified as caustic corrosion <b>of</b> the aluminum <b>balance</b> piston. A stainless steel (SS) honeycomb seal was installed {{in place of the}} aluminum labyrinth seal. During the next two weeks, several trips of the compressor train were experienced caused by high levels of subsynchronous vibrations. Ties of the vibration problem to process conditions were studied and tested. Rotordynamic analysis identified the combination of damper bearing and honeycomb balance piston seal as the source of the low frequency vibrations. This paper describes the operating history of compressor, the vibration data recorded during a vibration event, teardown inspection results, and the subsequent rotordynamic analysis. The combination of low support stiffness with negative honeycomb stiffness lowered the frequency of the first natural frequency to a point that the honeycomb seal became destabilizing. To minimize unplanned capacity loss of the unit, an aluminum labyrinth seal was reinstalled, the caustic source corrected, and the unit restarted. The high levels of low frequency vibration have been eliminated and the unit has operated without vibration incidents for over 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{of several}} modern {{airplanes}} indicate that control surfaces {{with a high}} degree <b>of</b> aerodynamic <b>balance</b> are likely to possess characteristics which make them unsatisfactory or dangerous in high-speed flight. Dive tests made in the spring of 1940 at the NACA on a naval fighter-type airplane illustrate one form of instability that may be encountered. During a dive at an indicated airspeed of 365 miles per hour, the ailerons suddenly overbalanced. The efforts of the pilot to bring the ailerons back to neutral resulted in a violent oscillation of the control stick from side to side. Fortunately, the force required to return the ailerons to neutral was within the pilot's capabilities. A time history of the maneuver is given in figure 1 and typical frames from motion pictures of the cockpit and of the wing, taken during the maneuver, are given in figure 2. In the illustrated case, the occurrence of aerodynamic overbalance was attributed to a slight bulge, approximately 1 / 16 inch thick, on the lower surface of the leading edges of the ailerons, caused by the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> additional mass <b>balance</b> ahead <b>of</b> the hinge line. A drawing showing the shape of the bulge is given in figure 3. After this slight protuberance had been eliminated, dives were successfully made at higher speeds...|$|R
40|$|Three {{building}} typologies {{are analyzed}} in this report, {{where the first}} one is apartment blocks built before 1956, the second one is apartment blocks built in the period 1956 - 1970, and the last typology is apartment blocks built in the period 1971 - 1980. A literature study of typical dwellings throughout time is completed and typical apartments from each of the time periods are defined. The model used to calculate the building s energy need for space heating and domestic hot water is based on the TABULA methodology, but is constructed as an energy balance model that uses the principles of a material flow analysis. This model is used to calculate the energy need before and after renovation. For each time period two building states are analyzed; original building state and historical refurbished building state. This is done since {{a big part of the}} buildings built before 1980 have already gone through some sort of renovation, and the energy saving potential by implementing new energy efficiency measures to these partly refurbished buildings are smaller than the energy saving potential for the same building types in original state. A life cycle costing model that uses the principles of net present value is used to calculate the economical output of each renovation package analyzed in this Master Thesis. A scenario model, that uses inputs from the segmented building stock model (see chapter 3. 3. 1) and the energy model (see chapter 3. 1), is used to estimate the future energy need for space heating and domestic hot water for the part of the Norwegian dwelling stock analyzed in this report. The energy reduction potential for improving a typical building constructed before 1956 from original state to TEK 10 level is 68 % for space heating. Improving it further down to a passive house level gives a reduction potential of 81 %, which shows that these buildings have a major improvement potential. Only a minority (16 %) of the apartment blocks from this period are however in original state, which means that a more realistic reduction potential is seen from historical refurbished state to TEK 10 - or passive house level. The reduction potential for a TEK 10 -refurbishment is then 46 % and 67 % for a passive house refurbishment. For the two other building typologies the general pattern is that the energy savings decrease as the quality of the building in original and historical refurbished state improves. Apartment blocks built between 1971 and 1980 have the lowest saving potential since the quality before new renovation is high. This also makes these building types less economical efficient for different renovation projects. General it is shown that almost all renovations are efficient for apartment blocks built before 1956 and between 1956 - 1970 in original state, as these building types have the highest energy use before renovation. However, improving the building envelope to TEK 10 or passive house level, as well as installing air-to-air heat pumps as supplementary measures are seen profitable for all the building types analyzed over a period <b>of</b> 36 years. <b>Installation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>balanced</b> ventilation system is only estimated to be profitable for apartment blocks built before 1956 and between 1956 - 1970 in original state. However, when upgrading the building envelope to passive house level it is recommended to install a balanced ventilation system to ensure a satisfactory air quality (Thomsen & Berge, 2012). Since there is high willingness to pay for comfort it is anticipated that <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>balanced</b> ventilation system combined with a passive house envelope upgrade is realistic for all building types even though the net present value is up to 400 NOK/m 2 BRA higher than for base case (no energy-related upgrades to the building) ...|$|R

5000|$|The Achilles {{heel of the}} 195 was engine shake. An inline {{four-cylinder engine}} suffers from {{secondary}} imbalance. This is caused because of the 180 degree crankshaft. In this design, the two outside cylinders are always moving together and the two inside cylinders are doing the same. But due to geometry, a piston descending from top dead center will always move quicker through the first 30 degrees of crankshaft travel than a piston moving upward from bottom dead center, meaning that more mass is moving downward than is moving upward, causing a shaking in the vertical plane. Modern engineers consider the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> twin counter-rotating <b>balance</b> shafts necessary for engines much larger than 122 cui (2.0 L). The V8-based design of the 195 had no such balance shafts since costs prohibited adding them. The 195 was instead cushioned by flexible rubber engine mounts designed to isolate the engine {{from the rest of}} the car, and its forces were further dampened by the Tempest's unusual driveshaft (which connected to a transaxle mounted in the rear). However, if the engine was out of tune or if a spark plug became fouled, the shaking overwhelmed the dampening of the mounts. The timing chain in the 195 was originally the same as the 389, but was prone to stretch and break from engine vibration; a special high-strength version was developed as a replacement. This also works on the V8 engines as a high strength upgrade.|$|R
