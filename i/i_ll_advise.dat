40|$|Fat {{network is}} known as one {{essential}} element in development of ice cream infrastructure. The main goal {{in the study was}} to understand the effect of stabilizers on fat agglomeration during freezing in the presence and absence of emulsifier. Eight commercial ice creams were analyzed for particle size and melting properties. Additionally, ice cream mix was formulated to contain 10 % milk fat, 10 % milk solids-not-fat, 12 % sucrose, 6 % corn syrup solids, and 0. 15 % carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The formulations also included mixes with and without 0. 15 % mono-and di-glycerides (MDG). Fat aggregation was indicated by D[4. 3] and % particles above 10 μm as measured by a Malvern Mastersizer. Melting rate was defined as amount of dripped loss divided by melting time. Commercial ice cream analysis showed that ice cream with egg yolks (EY) and no stabilizers had no fat aggregates. Particle size distributions varied between ice cream brands. Ice creams with MDG or those with gums in addition to EY showed an increased aggregation. Ice cream without stabilizer had no fat aggregates and melted at the fastest rate. Gums decreased the melting rate and the melting properties were independent from particle size. Ice cream with only CMC showed the highest amount of fat aggregates and highest melting resistance. The effect was followed by ice cream made with both CMC and MDG, and only MDG. The amount of fat aggregates was highly correlated to the melting resistance of the ice creams. Ice cream with most melting resistance had greater amount of fat aggregates. i i l l i l i i i l i ili l i i i i l i i i i l i l i l i l i <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>ll</b> <b>i</b> i l i il il li li l <b>ll</b> l l <b>i</b> l i l i i i i l i i i i i l l i l i i i l i i l i i i l i l i i i l ili i l i i i i i i i i i i i i i i ili l l i l i i i i l i i l i i l <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>ll</b> <b>i</b> i l i l l l i i i i l i...|$|R

The goal of this research project {{is to develop a}} high resolution overhead greenhouse insect scouting device that efficiently detect and collect insect pests population. Three greenhouse insect scouting methods (yellow sticky card, mobile overhead sticky card and mobile overhead vacuum) were compared to determinate collection efficiency (CE) of adult whiteflies (B. tabaci) from a Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) crop. The main objective was to estimate CE of two mobile overhead scouting methods and study the Conclusions • Since insect activity increases with temperature, collection efficiency (CE) increased for all methods at high greenhouse temperature T 2 = 28. 5 ° C. •We observed the control had significantly higher CE at T 2 = 28. 5 °C.

5000|$|At {{least since}} the days of Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson, {{analysis}} of the play has centred on the question of Macbeth's ambition, commonly seen as so dominant a trait that it defines the character. Johnson asserted that Macbeth, though esteemed for his military bravery, is wholly reviled. This opinion recurs in critical literature, and, according to Caroline Spurgeon, is supported by Shakespeare himself, who apparently intended to degrade his hero by vesting him with clothes unsuited to him and to make Macbeth look ridiculous by several nimisms he applies: His garments seem either too big or too small for him - as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. When he feels as if [...] "dressed in borrowed robes", after his new title as Thane of Cawdor, prophesied by the witches, has been confirmed by Ross (<b>I,</b> 3, <b>ll.</b> 108-09), Banquo comments: [...] "New honours come upon him, / Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould, / But with the aid of use" [...] (<b>I,</b> 3, <b>ll.</b> 145-46). And, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt: [...] "He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause / Within the belt of rule" [...] (V, 2, ll. 14-15), while Angus, in a similar nimism, sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power: [...] "now does he feel his title / Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe / upon a dwarfish thief" [...] (V, 2, ll. 18-20).|$|R
