The player can freely switch their view between different cameras to keep watch over the girls and <b>eavesdrop</b> on conversations to follow the story and listen for clues.|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{surveillance}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important {{to protect the public}} security by legitimately <b>eavesdropping</b> suspicious wireless communications. This paper studies the wireless surveillance of a two-hop suspicious communication link by a half-duplex legitimate monitor. By exploring the suspicious link's two-hop nature, the monitor can adaptively choose among the following three <b>eavesdropping</b> modes to improve the <b>eavesdropping</b> performance: (I) passive <b>eavesdropping</b> to intercept both hops to decode the message collectively, (II) proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> via noise jamming over the first hop, and (III) proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> via hybrid jamming over the second hop. In both proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> modes, the (noise/hybrid) jamming over one hop is for the purpose of reducing the end-to-end communication rate of the suspicious link and accordingly making the interception more easily over the other hop. Under this setup, we maximize the <b>eavesdropping</b> rate at the monitor by jointly optimizing the <b>eavesdropping</b> mode selection as well as the transmit power for noise and hybrid jamming. Numerical results show that the <b>eavesdropping</b> mode selection significantly improves the <b>eavesdropping</b> rate as compared to each individual <b>eavesdropping</b> mode.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>eavesdropping</b> {{security}} of wireless ad hoc net-works has attracted considerable attention recently. However, most of current studies only consider OMN networks, where each node is mounted {{with a single}} omni-directional antenna, which radiates radio signals in all directions and consequently leads to the high <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. Compared with an omni-directional antenna, a directional antenna can concentrate the radio signals on some desired directions {{so that it can}} potentially reduce the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. This paper investigates the <b>eavesdropping</b> {{security of}} wireless ad hoc networks equipped with directional antennas. In particular, we study the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility of OMN networks, SDA networks in which each node is equipped with a simplistic directional antenna and RDA networks in which each node is equipped with a realistic directional antenna. More specifically, we identify the <b>eavesdropping</b> activity in wireless networks and propose an <b>eavesdropping</b> model to measure the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility of OMN networks, SDA networks and RDA networks with considering various environment factors, such as path loss attenuation and shadowing effects. Our simulation results show that using a simplistic directional antenna or a realistic antenna in wireless networks can reduce the <b>eavesdropping</b> possibility. I...|$|R

5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and <b>eavesdrop</b> on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{defend against}} {{reconnaissance}} activity in ad hoc wireless networks, we propose transmission power control {{as an effective}} mechanism for minimizing the <b>eavesdropping</b> risk. Our main contributions are given as follows. First, we cast the wth-order <b>eavesdropping</b> risk as the maximum probability of packets being <b>eavesdropped</b> when there are w adversarial nodes in the network. Second, we derive the closed-form solution of the first-order <b>eavesdropping</b> risk as a polynomial function of the normalized transmission radius. This derivation assumes a uniform distribution of user nodes. Then, we generalize the model to allow arbitrary user nodes distribution and prove that the uniform user distribution minimizes the first-order <b>eavesdropping</b> risk. This result plays {{an essential role in}} deriving analytical bounds for the <b>eavesdropping</b> risk given arbitrary user distributions. Our simulation results show that, {{for a wide range of}} nonuniform traffic patterns, the difference in their <b>eavesdropping</b> risk values from the corresponding lower bounds is 3 dB or less.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{concerns}} the <b>eavesdropping</b> attacks in wireless ad hoc networks under a shadow fading environment.

We then conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the <b>eavesdropping</b> success rate with different eavesdroppers.

25|$|An {{important}} and unique property of {{quantum key distribution}} {{is the ability of}} the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to <b>eavesdrop</b> on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{wireless}} surveillance of a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) based suspicious communication link over Rayleigh fading channels. We propose a proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> approach, where a half-duplex monitor can opportunistically jam the suspicious link to exploit its potential retransmissions for overhearing more efficiently. In particular, we {{consider that the}} suspicious link uses at most two HARQ rounds for transmitting the same data packet, and we focus on two cases without and with HARQ combining at the monitor receiver. In both cases, we aim to maximize the successful <b>eavesdropping</b> probability at the monitor, by adaptively allocating the jamming power in the first HARQ round according to fading channel conditions, subject to an average jamming power constraint. For both cases, we show that the optimal jamming power allocation follows a threshold-based policy, and the monitor jams with constant power when the <b>eavesdropping</b> channel gain {{is less than the}} threshold. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive <b>eavesdropping</b> scheme achieves higher successful <b>eavesdropping</b> probability than the conventional passive <b>eavesdropping,</b> and HARQ combining can help further improve the <b>eavesdropping</b> performance.
