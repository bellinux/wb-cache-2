6000|$|To {{the account}} of the 22d of May, of the indorsement, is added the {{declaration}} <b>upon</b> <b>oath.</b> But why any man need to declare <b>upon</b> <b>oath</b> that the money which he has fraudulently taken and concealed from another person is not his is the most extraordinary thing in the world. If he had a mind to have it placed to his credit as his own, then an oath would be necessary; but in this case any one would believe him upon his word. He comes, however, and says, [...] "This is indorsed <b>upon</b> oath." [...] <b>Oath!</b> before what magistrate? In whose possession were the bonds? Were they given up? There is no trace of that upon the record, and it stands for him to prove that they were ever given up, and in any hands but Mr. Larkins's and his own.

This is all we see of these bonds, till Mr. Larkins, to whom he writes some letter concerning them which does not appear, is called to read a funeral sermon over them.|$|R

6000|$|Philip {{actually}} made {{a leap of}} indignation; Berenger, better prepared, said to the officer, 'Sir, I am happy {{to be placed in}} charged of a King's servant, who will no doubt see justice done, and shelter us from the private malice that could alone devise so monstrous an accusation.

60|$|Seeing it thus, {{they agreed}} to treat, and the king grants them conditions, upon laying down their arms, to march off free. This was too much.

He therefore used the evasive word [...] "printed," [...] and left it to his opponents to detect the fallacy. The methods, however, by which Pope had obtained his priority would not permit him to plead it, nor was he likely, by mooting the question, to risk the revelation of his plot.] ...|$|R
