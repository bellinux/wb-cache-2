In May 2007, UBS announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM) division. Before that time, there was little understanding of the troubles at DRCM or the massive expansion of risk engineered by the investment banking division {{under the leadership of}} the newly placed CEO Huw Jenkins.|$|E

40|$|Does {{investment}} liberalization {{in developing}} economies affect FDI decisions differently across individual <b>firms?</b> <b>To</b> address this question, we simulate {{the response of}} individual <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> reductions in investment costs across developing economies. We explore two policy experiments: elimination of setup-procedure requirements for foreign investors {{and a reduction in}} corporate tax rates on foreign-owned multinationals. We find that a relaxing of discriminatory foreign investment procedures induces middle productive <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> increase their entry and production in developing economies substantially, but the most productive <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> expand moderately. Multinationals expand their entry and production in developing economies more substantially following a decline in entry barriers than following a decrease in corporate tax rates...|$|R

Thus, FTAs would entail high administrative fixed costs for firms, precluding smaller <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> fully enjoy preferential tariffs, and depleting member-countries’ overall competitiveness.|$|R

5|$|The Corporation {{stipulated that}} several {{manufacturing}} industries should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or <b>firm</b> <b>to</b> dominate. It {{did not seek}} to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms {{to build their own}} premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.|$|E
5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime engineering <b>firm</b> <b>to</b> make {{a survey of}} the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
40|$|Globalization {{of markets}} has opened many new {{opportunities}} for <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> reap profits through exploiting potential sources of economies of scope. In intensely-competitive global arenas, the firms should identify their skill and competency gaps and fill them rapidly. Each firm has specific/unique skills and resources. These, in turn, generate competency-gap filling potential through formation of strategic partnerships. Strategic alliances as manifestation of strategic partnerships have been flourishing {{for more than two}} decades and becoming preferable modes of transaction. Strategic alliances have therefore been emerging not only as optional modes, but also as the necessary ones. This paper examines antecedents of propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances in Indonesia. The focus of this research is on the influences of external characteristics (industry and environment characteristics) on the propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances using internal characteristics (firm characteristics) as a mediator. Path analysis is used to examine existence of effects. Structural models resulted from this research show as follows: Model 1 : Y = - 0. 006 X 1 + 0. 391 X 2 + 0. 394 Model 2 : Z = 0. 205 X 1 – 0. 104 X 2 + 0. 458 Y + 0. 171 Furthermore, research findings indicate that: 1. Environment characteristics significantly influence firm characteristics, but do not significantly influence the propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances. 2. Industry characteristics significantly influence the propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances, but do not significantly influence firms characteristics. 3. Firm characteristics significantly influence the propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances. 4. Environment characteristics mediated by firm characteristics become an important factor that indirectly influences the propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances. 5. <b>Firm</b> characteristics appear <b>to</b> be a dominant factor influencing the propensity of <b>firms</b> <b>to</b> enter into strategic alliances...|$|R

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the <b>firm</b> <b>to</b> whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the <b>firm</b> <b>to</b> annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the <b>firm</b> <b>to</b> its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E

5|$|During the 1870s ice {{began to}} be used by Timothy Eastman, of the Bell Brothers <b>firm,</b> <b>to</b> {{transport}} American meat to Britain; the first shipment successfully arrived in 1875 and by the following year 9,888 tons (8,909,000kg) of meat was shipped. The chilled meat was retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that chilled American meat might flood the market and harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat transport market in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of chilled Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E

5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the <b>firm</b> <b>to</b> continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E
5|$|Formed in 1903 as {{a result}} of the {{amalgamation}} of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old <b>Firm</b> <b>to</b> win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.|$|E
