40|$|The demands {{imposed by}} the optimal design process form {{a unique set of}} {{criteria}} {{for the development of a}} computational model for vehicle simulation. Due to the large number of simulations that must be performed to obtain an optimized design the model must be computationally efficient. A competing criterion is that the computational model must realistically model the vehicle. Current trends in vehicle simulation codes have tackled the problem of realism by constructing elaborate full vehicle models containing dozens if not hundreds of distinct bodies. Each body in a model of this type is associated with six degrees of freedom. Numerous constraint equations are applied to the bodies to represent the physical connections. While the formulation of the equations is not particularly difficult, and in fact has been automated in several software packages, the resulting model requires a considerable amount of computational time to run. This makes the model unsuitable for the application of computational optimal design techniques. Past research in the field of vehicle dynamics has produced numerous computational models which are small enough and fast enough to satisfy the speeddemands of the optimal design process. These models typically use less than a dozen degrees of freedom to model the vehicle. They do a good job of predicting the general motion of the vehicle and they are useful as design tools but they lack the accuracy required for optimal design. A model that bridges the gap between these two existing classes of models and is suitable for performing optimal design was developed. The model possesses twenty-eight degrees of freedom and consists of eight bodies which represent the sprung mass, the rear suspension, the left <b>front</b> <b>spindle,</b> the right <b>front</b> <b>spindle,</b> and the four wheels. A driver control algorithm was developed which is capable of driving the car near its handling limits.

50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle cylinder gear of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the <b>front</b> valve <b>spindles.</b> This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and pivot bracket, affecting the valve events when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination lever assembly to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{the company}} {{developed}} {{a series of}} motorcycles based on the T35. Designed by George Halliday, these featured Douglas [...] "Radialraulic" [...] forks with the <b>front</b> wheel <b>spindle</b> carried on short leading links pivoted {{at the rear of}} the fork stanchions - with springs and a damping mechanism inside the stanchions. Although the frame and suspension were innovative, the engine was essentially a generator, designed to run for long periods at a steady speed and it did not cope well with the varying engine speeds of motorcycling. There was also a tendency to sideways shaking at low engine speeds which was a feature of the horizontally opposed engine. Douglas hired former Sunbeam motorcycles designer Erling Poppe as Technical Director, Freddie Dixon as their specialist engine tuner and Walter Moore (who designed the Norton CS1) as Works Superintendent. The result was the 1949 Douglas Mark III, which had improved performance through an uprated cylinder head, combustion chambers, and pistons. Douglas also produced a Mark III [...] "De Luxe", a Mark III Sports, and a rigid-framed motorcycle trials Competition version with high-level exhausts and a less deeply valanced front mudguard. There never was a Douglas Mark II, and the Mark IV was short-lived, so the end of the line of development was the Mark V produced between 1951 and 1954, when it was replaced by the Douglas Dragonfly.|$|R

40|$|Background: The SAE MiniBaja is an {{international}} competition amongst engineering colleges, sponsored by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to develop and compete with a high performance, yet cost effective off-road vehicle. Boise State University has had a MiniBaja team since 2004 and every year the team is striving to produce the optimal vehicle. In 2005 the team used a trailing arm rear suspension that gave them substantial suspension travel as well as CNC machined <b>front</b> <b>spindles</b> {{that proved to be}} a light weight and durable feature to the car. In 2009 the car was built with durability in mind and all though nothing failed on the car it was too heavy and large to be competitive. Lastly in 2011 the MiniBaja had trouble with maneuverability due to a small cockpit and unsatisfactory steering geometry. One thing that has remained unchanged throughout several years was the use of a multi-speed gear box. The multi-speed gear box has been a major hindrance due to having a gear ratio that was not optimal for power transfer from the motor to wheels. The 2012 Boise State MiniBaja team proposes to build the most advanced vehicle to date by addressing each of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the previous cars. Purpose: The team will use the vehicle in a competition that stresses the need for a fast, lightweight vehicle that is capable of conquering any terrain. To this end, the following criterion will be addressed during the development of the vehicle: Weight Safety Max speed 42 MPH Well handling suspension Drive train function Aggressive steering Solution: The critical areas of design will be the suspension, drive train, and frame. Each of these subcategories must be designed in a way to achieve the fastest most maneuverable MiniBaja. These goals will be attained through a light frame, well designed drive train, and precision suspension geometry; all of which will be designed and optimized using the computer program SolidWorks and Microsoft Excel. To save weight, items on the car that were previously made out of steel will be replaced by aluminum or a composite material. Safety will be regulated by strictly following the SAE rules for designing a MiniBaja race vehicle. To obtain a max speed of 42 miles per hour a gear box has been designed and will be machined here at BSU, which will give a top speed of 42 MPH while also reducing the rotating mass in the gear box by 30 %. In addition, the drive chain has been removed from the system, which will increase efficiency by about 15 %. The last criterion to be addressed is the need for improved steering which will be accomplished by using a custom designed steering quickener. The quickener will increase the amount of front wheel deflection per revolution of the steering wheel by 1 : 2. These changes will make the car more agile and increase the cars overall performance giving Boise State an advantage over other competitors...|$|R

40|$|Propagation of {{discharges}} in cortical and thalamic systems, {{which is}} used as a probe for examining network circuitry, is studied by constructing a one-dimensional model of integrate-and-fire neurons that are coupled by excitatory synapses with delay. Each neuron fires only one spike. The velocity and stability of propagating continuous pulses are calculated analytically. Above a certain critical value of the constant delay, these pulses lose stability. Instead, lurching pulses propagate with discontinuous and periodic spatio-temporal characteristics. The parameter regime for which lurching occurs is strongly affected by the footprint (connectivity) shape; bistability may occur with a square footprint shape but not with an exponential footprint shape. For strong synaptic coupling, the velocity of both continuous and lurching pulses increases logarithmically with the synaptic coupling strength gsyn for an exponential footprint shape, and it is bounded for a step footprint shape. We conclude that the differences in velocity and shape between the <b>front</b> of thalamic <b>spindle</b> waves in vitro and cortical paroxysmal discharges stem from their different effective delay; in thalamic networks, large effective delay between inhibitory neurons arises from their effective interaction via the excitatory cells which display postinhibitory rebound...|$|R

50|$|McDuffie was {{involved}} in an accident on the fifth lap of the 1991 Budweiser at The Glen race at Watkins Glen International. On the straight between the esses and the loop-chute, at 170 mph, McDuffie collided with Jimmy Means after suffering a mechanical failure. McDuffie's left <b>front</b> wheel <b>spindle</b> broke off of the car, causing him to lose brakes and hit Means in the right front. This left him no way of stopping the car or steering it, and to further complicate matters, there was no gravel trap in the corner that McDuffie was headed toward. As a result, McDuffie skidded across the grass and hit the outside retaining wall and tire barrier {{with such force that}} the car shot into the air, rotated, and then came to rest upside-down. Means also crashed into the same corner but was able to slow his vehicle down before the impact; his car went under McDuffie's as it was in mid-air.Means, a fellow independent racer, suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the accident, and got out of his car to check on McDuffie. After peering into McDuffie's car, he began frantically signaling for assistance, and a host of medical personnel and track workers rushed to the scene.The race was delayed for two hours as McDuffie was removed from his car and his Pontiac was removed from the infield. Also, the wall that McDuffie and Means struck had to be repaired. As the cars got back on the track and cruised under yellow flag conditions, the media attention turned to Chip Williams, NASCAR's PR director, who disclosed that McDuffie had lost his life in the accident. He had died instantly from head and brain injuries. The direct cause of death was a basilar skull fracture caused by rapid head movement to the right. The 52-year-old was survived by wife Ima Jean, son, Jeff (who himself drove in five Winston Cup events), and daughter, Linda. Williams, in the live interview where McDuffie's death was confirmed, erroneously reported that McDuffie was 53; he would not have been 53 until December 5 of that year. NASCAR also erroneously reported that McDuffie was 53.|$|R
40|$|Chromatin is {{distributed}} non-randomly within the cell nucleus. Its spatial organization {{has been demonstrated}} to be important for nuclear metabolism such as, DNA replication, reparation or transcription. However, {{little is known about}} the functional implications resulting from its organization or the molecular driving forces responsible for chromatin organization. In the course of this thesis, I studied the budding yeast HMG-box protein Hmo 1. An initial screen demonstrated that this chromatin-associated protein is genetically linked to the RNA polymerase (Pol) I, to genes coding for ribosomal proteins (RPGs) as well as to genes implicated in stress response. I could show that Hmo 1 physically interacts with the rRNA coding gene transcribed by Pol I and with a subset of RPG promoters. Global expression analyses showed a clear dependence on Hmo 1 for the expression of a sub-set of RPGs. An hmo 1 deletion strain is also largely alleviated in repressing RPG transcription after TOR complex 1 inhibition. These results suggested that Hmo 1 is implicated in Pol I transcription as well as RPG regulation. Preliminary in vitro transcription assays suggest a role of Hmo 1 in Pol I initiation and elongation events. Since Hmo 1 is a bona fide nucleolar factor, I wanted to test the hypothesis if Pol II transcribed RPGs associated with Hmo 1 are localized in the proximity of the nucleolus, as previously reported for Pol III encoded tRNA genes. Due to the small size of the yeast nucleus and the stochastic, sub-diffusive movement of DNA, we first needed to develop a new method allowing determination of gene localization probabilities with very high accuracy and with respect to the nucleolus. As a result of this collaborative approach, we could demonstrate by analyzing thousands of cells, that genes are confined into sub-nuclear volumes. These �gene territories� show a locus specific size and can be remodeled upon transcriptional activation. Applying this new method to Pol II transcribed genes required for ribosome biogenesis, such as the RPGs, indicates that the localization of the gene on the chromatin fiber has important implications for its three dimensional positioning. Genes in proximity to the centromere localize in <b>front</b> of the <b>spindle</b> pole body while RPGs further away from the extremities of the chromosome arm can also occupy a nucleolar-close territory. Furthermore, it also seems that neighboring genes are important positioning determinants. All together, these results show that Hmo 1 participates in mediating Pol I and RPG transcription regulation in response to growth conditions and that this important cross-talk between different RNA polymerases could be mediated by spatial co-positioning of the genes. Further analyses will be required to reveal the potential function of Hmo 1 in this interplay...|$|R
