5|$|If a Poisson {{process is}} defined {{with a single}} {{positive}} constant, then the process is called a <b>homogeneous</b> Poisson process. The <b>homogeneous</b> Poisson process (in continuous time) {{is a member of}} important classes of stochastic processes such as Markov processes and Lévy processes.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (90.4%) and is ethnically the most <b>homogeneous</b> {{of the six}} countries of former Yugoslavia. Minority groups include Serbs (4.4%), Bosniaks, Hungarians, Italians, Slovenes, Germans, Czechs, Romani people and others (5.9%).|$|E

5|$|Imidazol-2-ylidenes and dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes, e.g. IMes, {{have been}} {{prepared}} by the deprotonation of the respective imidazolium and dihydroimidazolium salts. The acyclic carbenes and the tetrahydropyrimidinyl based carbenes were prepared by deprotonation using strong <b>homogeneous</b> bases.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of <b>homogeneous</b> societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for <b>homogeneous</b> nations began to weaken.|$|E
5|$|In combustion, Frank-Kamenetskii theory {{explains}} the thermal explosion of a <b>homogeneous</b> mixture of reactants, kept inside a closed vessel with constant temperature walls. It {{is named after}} a Russian scientist David A. Frank-Kamenetskii, who along with Nikolay Semenov developed the theory in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a <b>homogeneous</b> blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested {{that the amount of}} heat generated for an Io with a <b>homogeneous</b> interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang theory {{depends on}} two major assumptions: the {{universality}} of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is <b>homogeneous</b> and isotropic.|$|E
5|$|The Carme {{group is}} spread over only 1.2Gm in semi-major axis, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (165.7±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27. It is very <b>homogeneous</b> in color (light red) and {{is believed to}} have originated from a D-type asteroid progenitor, possibly a Jupiter Trojan.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: <b>homogeneous,</b> in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the <b>homogeneous</b> type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is <b>homogeneous</b> and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A Universe that is both <b>homogeneous</b> and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E

25|$|<b>Homogeneous</b> cakes are {{desirable}} as if {{the feed}} slurry is too dilute the filter cake will contain higher moisture content {{as a result of}} stratification. The minimum feed concentration that results in a <b>homogeneous</b> cake is determined by observing a sample of the slurry. If rapid settling occurs the filter cake formed will not be <b>homogeneous</b> and the filtration rate is decreased.|$|E

25|$|The {{equation}} of the tangents at a singular point {{is given by}} the nonzero <b>homogeneous</b> part of lowest degree in the Taylor series of the polynomial at the singular point. When one changes the coordinates to put the singular point at the origin, the {{equation of}} the tangents at the singular point is thus the nonzero <b>homogeneous</b> part of lowest degree of the polynomial, and the multiplicity of the singular point is the degree of this <b>homogeneous</b> part.|$|E
