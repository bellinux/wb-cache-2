40|$|Machine {{direction}} orientation (MDO) greatly enhances film properties, {{namely the}} modulus, barrier, tensile strength and optics. By utilizing MDO films, a packaging producer can significantly reduce packaging costs by <b>downgauging,</b> replacement of less desirable materials and/or {{the elimination of}} secondary conversion processes. Doing so effectively reduces the amounts and types of material sourced and processing steps needed to manufacture a given package...|$|E
40|$|Conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyzed LLDPEs combine good {{mechanical}} properties with moderate processability. Efforts to enhance LLDPE properties further, through metallocene catalysts for example, generally {{result in a}} processability penalty. The present work describes a new development in LLDPE technology that produces resins with significant improvement in {{mechanical properties}} without sacrificing processability. Detailed blown film results show the performance improvement achieved by the new resins, compared to conventional LLDPEs, and the <b>downgauging</b> potential offered by the property improvement...|$|E

It also describes how the technical requirements of the sack are determined. Finally, it shows how gas phase metallocene-catalyzed hexene copolymer {{linear low density polyethylene}} resins are used to produce <b>downgauged</b> sacks with tailored properties {{to meet the needs of}} this industry...|$|R
40|$|The cut-edge {{characteristic}} properties of automotive structures formed during the mechanical blanking and laser-cutting processes significantly influence fatigue life performance. This factor {{is becoming increasingly}} important as S 355 MC and DP 600 high strength steels (HSS) grades under investigation exhibit an increased sensitivity to fatigue cracks initiating from cut-edge regions. It was determined that by manipulating the critical cutting process parameters, clearance in terms of mechanical blanking, and by controlling the interrelationship between power and traverse cutting speed during the laser cutting process can result in optimised fatigue lives being achieved. Optimal fatigue lives were attained by minimising the cut-edge surface damage and by controlling the near edge microstructural deformations during each cutting process. It is the critical significance of fatigue which is the limiting factor towards being able to effectively <b>downgauge</b> steel grades used as automotive chassis and suspension components. This research {{is some of the}} first that considers the influence of mechanical and laser cut-edge surface quality and internal properties, which has then been partnered to the critical fatigue performance of HSS grades.

5000|$|LDPE and LLDPE have unique {{rheological}} or {{melt flow}} properties. LLDPE is less shear sensitive {{because of its}} narrower molecular weight distribution and shorter chain branching. During a shearing process, such as extrusion, LLDPE remains more viscous and, therefore, harder to process than an LDPE of equivalent melt index. The lower shear sensitivity of LLDPE allows for a faster stress relaxation of the polymer chains during extrusion, and, therefore, the physical properties are susceptible to changes in blow-up ratios. In melt extension, LLDPE has lower viscosity at all strain rates. This means it will not strain harden the way LDPE does when elongated. As the deformation rate of the polyethylene increases, LDPE demonstrates a dramatic rise in viscosity because of chain entanglement. This phenomenon is not observed with LLDPE {{because of the lack}} of long-chain branching in LLDPE allows the chains to slide by one another upon elongation without becoming entangled. This characteristic is important for film applications because LLDPE films can be <b>downgauged</b> easily while maintaining high strength and toughness. The rheological properties of LLDPE are summarized as [...] "stiff in shear" [...] and [...] "soft in extension". It is not taken in most curbside pickups in communities. LLDPE can be recycled though into other things like trash can liners, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tiles, compost bins, and shipping envelopes ...|$|R
40|$|Ths {{strain rate}} {{behavior}} of mild-steel and {{high strength steel}} qualities has been investigated. The hardening {{as a function of}} the strain rate of a set of steel qualities was determined, and it was found that the gain in strength for high-strength steels is not in proportion to the static yield-strength. The absolute increase in strength for high-strength steels is often less than for mild steel (although this fact depends on the microstructure of the steel). This fact is reflected in the absorption of energy for square crash-columns that were tested on a sled-impact facility. <b>Downgauging</b> parts from mild-steel to high-strength steel must be therefore be done carefully to maintain its crashworthiness properties. Special attention should be given to the strain rate sensitivity of the next generation of high strength steel. Moreover we have tested and simulated spotwelded columns to test the failure criterion for spotwelds. It appeared that using a failure criterion with standard tensile- and cross-tension forces for rupture of spot-welded specimens gives quite satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|Several {{series of}} {{polyethylene}} (PE) blends were prepared where one component is a conventional PE {{and the second}} is a conventional linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or a metallocene-catalyzed LLDPE. A two-step isothermal annealing (TSIA) procedure is developed enabling the satisfactorily resolution of endothermic peaks of blends of low-density polyethylene with LLDPE using standard thermoanalytical techniques. The TSIA procedure enables the quantification of components in an unknown, previously calibrated blend. The quantitative analysis of PE blends by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is explored and achieved by the development of a linear relationship based on the ratio of two absorbances in an FT-IR spectrum. The method exhibits potential for routine analyses of PE blends that have been previously calibrated. Chemiluminescence (CL) monitoring is successfully applied to study the oxidative degradation of PE blends. The CL data are consistent with the thermal and physicomechanical properties of the blends with a decreased blend miscibility reflected in the CL data as a departure from the idealized behaviour observed for more miscible blends. The physicomechanical and optical properties of PE blends are investigated and the results used to optimize the composition of particular film blends and assess the effects of <b>downgauging</b> the film thickness...|$|E
