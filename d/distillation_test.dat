40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} effect of reductive pretreatments of low-rank coals through the use of electron-transfer agents. This potential was explored in laboratory studies through determination of the impact on the evolution of oxygen functions, crosslinking, and conversion. The pretreatments explored include treatment with CO/water/base and hydroquinones or other electron-transfer agents in various combinations. The effects of these pretreatments on functional group distribution, macromolecular structure, and liquefaction were compared with those of pretreatments that have in the past shown promise for improved conversions, such as simple hydrothermal pretreatment, mild hydrogenation with dispersed catalysts, and demineralization. Additional objectives were to improve test procedures for assessing the effect of the pretreatment on subsequent liquefaction and to achieve some understanding of the chemical origins of the effects observed. These tests are: (1) proton magnetic resonance thermal analysis, (PMRTA) for determining the effect of pretreatment on fluidity as liquefaction conditions (temperature, pressure) are approached and (2) a thermogravimetric assay (TGA) -based simulated distillation for convenient measurement of product volatility following small-scale batch-liquefaction experiments. The purpose of the PMRTA test is to gain additional insight into whether beneficial pretreatments primarily affect pre-existing crosslinks in the coals or primarily limit additional crosslinking during liquefaction. The TGA-based simulated <b>distillation</b> <b>test</b> is being developed so that the authors can obtain conversion data and also assess the nature of the product (distillation profile) instead of only a single-point measure of conversion such as wt% conversion to THF-solubles or the yield of 975 F-distillates...|$|E
40|$|Staff has {{conducted}} in-house evaluations of various test methods, participated in interlaboratory studies of test method precision, and held four workshops which were attended {{by members of}} the refining industry, instrument manufacturers, and other interested parties. Staff is recommending the adoption of ASTM D 6550 - 00 for the measurement of olefins in gasoline because it is 2 to 3 times more precise than the current designated method, ASTM D 1319 - 95 a. Staff is also recommending that the precision statement and scope statement be superseded by revised statements derived from a CARBANSPA interlaboratory study. Additionally, staff is recommending the addition of a correlation equation between weight percent and volume percent. Two other methods, ASTM D 6293 - 98 and ASTM D 6296 - 98, were considered, but not recommended, due to concerns about increased costs, longer analysis times, and the presence of only a single vendor for the required instrumentation. Staff is recommending the adoption of ASTM D 86 - 99 aEl for measuring distillation temperatures because it is easier to run and has eliminated mathematical errors from the currently adopted method, ASTM D 86 - 90. SUMMARY AND IMPACTS: The proposal does not change existing gasoline standards and thus will not impact emissions. The improved precision of ASTM 06550 - 00 will reduce the uncertainty in the measurement of olefins in RFG. The changes to the <b>distillation</b> <b>test</b> method should reduce the need for repeated tests. Gasoline producers have expressed concerns about certain quantitative aspects of the new olefin test method regulations. Staff has agreed to consider new data relating to these concerns as they become available.

The Department of Energy (DOE) awarded Petro Star Inc. a contract to fund Phase III of the CED process development. Phase III consisted of testing a continuous-flow process, optimization of the process steps, design of a pilot plant, and completion of a market study for licensing the process. Petro Star and the Degussa Corporation in coordination with Koch Modular Process Systems (KMPS) tested six key process steps in a 7. 6 -centimeter (cm) (3. 0 -inch) inside diameter (ID) column at gas oil feed rates of 7. 8 to 93. 3 liters per hour (l/h) (2. 1 to 24. 6 gallons per hour). The team verified the technical feasibility with respect to hydraulics for each unit operation tested and successfully demonstrated pre-extraction and solvent recovery <b>distillation.</b> <b>Test</b> operations conducted at KMPS demonstrated that the oxidation reaction converted a maximum of 97 % of the thiophenes.

When the convex and concave type stepped solar stills are used, the average daily water production has been found to be 56. 60 % and 29. 24 % higher than that of flat type stepped solar still respectively. Also an economic analysis was made. The payback period of flat type, convex type and concave type stepped solar still is 823 days, 525 days and 637 days respectively. Thus, the convex type solar still gives the returns within the least possible time as compared to other two types of stepped solar stills. The laboratory tests were conducted to test the quality of water after <b>distillation.</b> The <b>tests</b> indicate that the quality of water in terms of pH...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} oil extracted from Piper betle L. leaf using pilot plant steam <b>distillation</b> was <b>tested</b> against the adult housefly, Musca domestica, for insecticidal activity. LC 50 values {{at the end}} of 24 and 48 h exposure periods were 10. 3 and 8. 7 mg/dm 3, respectively. Ceylon citronella oil (Cymbopogon nardus) used as a standard showed LC 50 s of 26. 5 and 24. 2 mg/dm 3 for the same exposure periods. Bioassay-guided fractionation of P. betle leaf oil revealed safrole and eugenol as the active principles against M. domestica, safrole showing LC 50 values of 4. 8 and 4. 7 mg/dm 3, and eugenol 7. 3 and 6. 2 mg/dm 3 for the 24 and 48 h exposure periods, respectively, while citronellal (synthetic standard) showed equal LC 50 values of 14. 3 mg/dm 3 for the same exposure periods. Using safrole as the starting compound, eight analogues were prepared to study structure–activity relationships. Among the eight analogues, dihydrosafrole gave almost equal mortality at LC 50 4. 7 mg/dm 3 as that of the parent compound safrole after 24 and 48 h exposure, but isosafrole was twice as active as safrole, showing LC 50 values of 2. 3 and 2. 2 mg/dm 3 for the 24 and 48 h exposure periods. Our GC–MS studies on Sri Lankan P. betle leaf oil show that it contains safrole (52. 7 %), allylpyrocatechol diacetate (15. 4 %), eugenol (6. 4 %) and eugenyl acetate (5. 8 %) as the major components. Here we also present the GC–MS profile of fractions of Sri Lankan P. betle leaf oil...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This study {{addresses}} the fatigue {{life of the}} head–to–skirt welds of tall <b>distillation</b> columns. Fatigue <b>tests</b> were done on two types of weld geometries which approximate the head–toskirt configurations. From the fatigue tests {{it was determined that}} the fatigue life of the experimental samples can be substantially improved by applying weld build–up between the head and the skirt. The expected fatigue life of the test samples was determined by way of calculation employing the so called Nominal–Stress–Approach, the Effective–Notch–Stress–Approach and the Stress–Life–Approach. For both the Nominal–Stress–Approach and the Effective–Notch–Stress–Approach the predicted fatigue life was found to be overly conservative compared to the experimental results. The Stress–Life–Approach predicted the fatigue life to within a factor of 1. 3 for both the geometries under investigation when displacements due to welding are taken into account. If displacements due to welding is omitted this factor is increased, for the geometry without weld build–up, to 2. For the geometry with weld build–up the factor remains 1. 3. Master...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{distillation}} is {{an emerging}} technology that has great {{potential as a}} process alternative for carrying out liquid-phase chemical reactions. Systematic design methods for reactive distillation systems have only recently begun to appear, and so far these have been restricted to systems at chemical equilibrium. It is not always desirable, however, to operate reactive distillation columns close to reaction equilibrium conditions. In this dissertation we present a design procedure for kinetically controlled reactive distillation columns. We show {{that the amount of}} liquid holdup per stage has a significant effect on the design. The procedure is based on fixed-point methods. Using these methods we have developed an algorithm for calculating the minimum flows in a reactive distillation column as well as the number of stages required to achieve a specified conversion/separation. For the examples studied, we show that the minimum reflux ratio in a kinetically controlled distillation is equal to that for an equilibrium reaction. We also show how to choose specifications that will lead to feasible reactive <b>distillation</b> columns. We <b>tested</b> our design results against column simulations and found them to be in good agreement. ...|$|R
