Why the Interest in <b>Rotation</b> <b>Sensors?</b> The measurement of rotation is of considerable interest {{in a number of}} areas. For example, inertial navigation systems as used in aircraft and spacecraft depend critically on accurate inertial <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors.</b> The allowable errors in <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> performance depend on the particular application.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{implements}} and analyzes a CMOS an-gular velocity- and direction-selective <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> with a retinal processing circuit. The proposed <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> has a polar {{structure and}} is selective of the angular velocity and direc-tion (clockwise and counterclockwise) of {{the rotation of}} images. The correlation-based algorithm is adopted and each pixel in the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> is correlated with the pixel that is 45 apart. The angular velocity selectivity is enhanced by placing more than one pixel between two correlated pixels. The angular velocity selectivity is related to both the number and {{the positions of the}} edges in an image. Detailed analysis characterizes angular velocity selectivity for different edges. An experimental chip consisting 104 pixels, which form five concentric circles, is fabricated. The single pixel has an area of 91 84 m 2 and a fill factor of 20 %, whereas the area of the chip is 1812 1825 m 2. The experimental results concerning the fabricated chip successfully verified the an-alyzed characteristics of angular velocity and direction selectivity.

Harvesting capacity and fuel consumption per hour, per area and per ton of harvested sugarcane were analyzed. The results were subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared by Tukey test.

All datasets recorded during the SINAPS@ post-seismic survey are open (Perron et al. 2017, see “Availability of data and materials” section for more information).

30|$|Initially, the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> was {{collocated}} with a translational accelerometer (Güralp CMG 5; {{linked to}} a Nanometrics Taurus digitizer), from February 6, 2014, to February 19, 2014 (i.e., for around 2  weeks), within the Koutavos park at a soft-soil location (see below {{for more information on}} the soil conditions). This period is defined as “phase 1.” Within the available open dataset described in Perron et al. (2017), this <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> location is called “ROSA.” Using this procedure (as described above), 421 events were extracted. Unfortunately, the analysis of these data showed that one of the horizontal components of the translational accelerometer did not work correctly, which prevented true six-component analysis. Hence, in the present study, the data from phase 1 are only used for the analysis of the rotation records. Note that the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> was “virtually” placed here in the center of a dense array that had been installed previously in the framework of the NERA program (funded by the European Union), which allowed complete analysis of the ground-motion coherency and the wavefield composition (Imtiaz 2015).

40|$|Abstract — A <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> {{with a wide}} {{dynamic range}} is {{designed}} based on tapered U-shaped resonators. The proposed device is composed of a rounded microstrip transmission line that couples to two meandered resonators that are stacked {{on top of each}} other. By rotating the upper resonator, the overlapping area between the two resonators is increased causing a stronger coupling that shifts down the resonance frequency of the device. This frequency shift can be read out in the transmission response from which the rotation angle is determined. The operation principle of the sensor is explained in detail by using a cir-cuit model. A sensor prototype is designed for the microwave frequency range and an experiment is presented for validating the proposed sensing approach. This sensing device is well suited for further miniaturization using microelectromechanical systems technology.
