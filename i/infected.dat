5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively <b>infected</b> T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of <b>infected</b> cells, and killing of <b>infected</b> CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize <b>infected</b> cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|E
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of {{transmission}} is through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes <b>infected</b> with T. cruzi by feeding on the blood of an <b>infected</b> person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
5|$|In the US, 58% of the {{population}} is <b>infected</b> with HSV-1 and 16% are <b>infected</b> with HSV-2. Among those HSV-2-seropositive, only 19% were aware they were <b>infected.</b> During 2005–2008, the prevalence of HSV-2 was 39% in blacks and 21% in women.|$|E
50|$|Animal viruses are {{viruses that}} <b>infect</b> animals. Viruses <b>infect</b> all {{cellular}} life and although viruses <b>infect</b> every animal, plant and protist species, each {{has their own}} specific range of viruses that often <b>infect</b> only that species.|$|R

Species <b>infecting</b> lemurs have also been included in this subgenus. Plasmodium species can <b>infect</b> {{a wide variety of}} mammals including rodents, ungulates, and bats.

It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from <b>infected</b> saliva. Those who are <b>infected</b> may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E

50|$|The {{families}} Bidnaviridae and Parvoviridae have linear genomes {{while the}} other families have circular genomes. The Bidnaviridae have a two part genome and <b>infect</b> invertebrates. The Inoviridae and Microviridae <b>infect</b> bacteria; the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae <b>infect</b> animals (mammals and birds respectively); and the Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae <b>infect</b> plants. In both the Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae the genome is composed {{of more than a}} single chromosome. The Bacillariodnaviridae <b>infect</b> diatoms and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the Spiraviridae <b>infect</b> archaea. Members of the Genomoviridae <b>infect</b> fungi.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{agents are}} deemed a biosecurity concern by the US Government through the Select agent list. The list is divided between agents that can <b>infect</b> only humans, zoonotic agents (which can <b>infect</b> both humans and animals), agents {{that can only}} <b>infect</b> animals, and agents that can <b>infect</b> only plants.|$|R
5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants <b>infected</b> with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants <b>infected</b> one year after spraying; yet most plants <b>infected</b> shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants <b>infected</b> seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} before the Joker died, his <b>infected</b> blood was used in blood transfusions, infecting five people including Batman; Batman, concealing his infection from others, imprisoned the four other recipients who were physically and mentally transforming into the Joker. The Joker, now existing as a mental projection produced by the <b>infected</b> blood and fear toxin, frequently appears to taunt Batman, and manipulate his perception {{of the world around}} him. After Batman escapes the exploding Ace Chemicals, he alerts Gordon to Oracle's kidnapping, who angrily leaves to find Scarecrow.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are <b>infected</b> by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are <b>infected</b> with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of <b>infected</b> females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with <b>infected</b> prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with <b>infected</b> domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become <b>infected</b> as adults or older {{children}} will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those <b>infected</b> between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed.
