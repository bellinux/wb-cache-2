5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had <b>home</b> <b>advantage.</b> England's morale was also surging following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected to do well in One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was held}} at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which was Roma's home ground. UEFA decided that the match would still be played at the stadium, despite it being Roma's home ground. Therefore, the match was {{effectively}} a home match for them. The stadium was significant for Liverpool as well, as their victory in 1977 came at the ground. With <b>home</b> <b>advantage</b> Roma went into the match as favourites, and were 13–8 with bookmakers to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Kirkcaldy club Raith Rovers used Easter Road {{as a home}} venue once, for {{the home}} leg of a UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich in 1995. The match was moved from Rovers' normal home ground of Stark's Park due to Easter Road's greater capacity. Easter Road has {{sometimes}} played host to Scottish League Cup semi-final matches, {{such as in the}} 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2014 competitions. Team managers Terry Butcher and Gus MacPherson have objected to playing semi-finals at Easter Road, on the grounds that their players should have the chance to play at Hampden Park, or that playing against Hearts in Edinburgh gives them a form of <b>home</b> <b>advantage.</b> The 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final between Raith Rovers and Rangers was hosted at Easter Road.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, the entry point for First Division clubs. Everton were drawn to play Leicester City at Filbert Street, an all First Division tie. The match was close; Dixie Dean scored for Everton after three minutes, but Leicester quickly levelled the score. A goal by Jimmy Stein gave Everton a 2–1 half-time lead, but Leicester again equalised. James Dunn eventually scored to secure a 3–2 win for Everton. Second Division Bury provided the opposition in the fourth round. Tommy Johnson scored twice for Everton in the opening half-hour. From that point, though Bury enjoyed significant spells of possession, Everton thwarted their efforts by preying on Bury mistakes. In the second half Dean added a third goal from a rebounded Cliff Britton free-kick, and Bury scored a late consolation goal. Everton were drawn at to play Leeds United {{at home in the}} fifth round. Leeds' strong league form meant Everton entered the match as slight underdogs despite <b>home</b> <b>advantage.</b> Everton goalkeeper Ted Sagar made two important saves in the first half to deny Arthur Hydes and Billy Furness. Everton the gained the upper hand and scored twice, Dean with the first, and Stein with the second, direct from a corner.|$|E
5|$|In 2009–10, Benfica had an {{noteworthy}} run in {{the newly}} created UEFA Europa League, progressing {{all the way from}} the play-off round to the quarter-finals. Their campaign featured a 5–0 thrashing of English side Everton in the group stage, and an aggregate 3–2 defeat of Marseille in the round of 16, with an injury-time goal from Alan Kardec. Bringing a 2–1 <b>home</b> <b>advantage</b> from the first leg of the quarter-finals against Liverpool, Benfica's manager Jorge Jesus made a surprising change for the second leg at Anfield, putting centre-back David Luiz as left-back; the team eventually lost the match 4–1 and were eliminated. In the following season, Benfica returned to the Champions League, but as in 2006–07 and 2007–08, were demoted to the Europa League. This time, however, the team overcame the quarter-final stage to reach their first European semi-final in 17 years. In the first European match ever between Portuguese teams, Benfica were surprised by Braga and missed the chance to qualify to the final. For the 2011–12 season, Benfica strengthened their squad with Axel Witsel and improved their performance in the Champions League, progressing all the way to the quarter-finals. In the group stage, Benfica topped their group – knocking Manchester United out of European competitions once again – and defeated Zenit Saint Petersbourg in the last 16, before losing 3–1 on aggregate to Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualifier}} round, in atrocious {{conditions the}} Crusaders defeated the Highlanders 17-0. The game was notable for the Crusaders defence, which kept the highly-talented Highlanders scoreless. The Crusaders then defeated the Chiefs comfortably 27-13, repaying earlier playoff losses to the team. The Crusaders faced the Lions in the final, and {{owing to the}} Lions holding <b>home</b> <b>advantage,</b> had to fly nearly 12,000km. The Crusaders confronted a daunting task to win the 2017 title. The Crusaders would have to battle a formidable Lions team, altitude and 61,000 Lions fans in the fortress of Ellis Park Stadium. The Crusaders started strongly with two tries, jumping out to a 12-0 lead. In the 38th minute Kwagga Smith took out David Havili in the air, causing Havili to fall dangerously. Smith was given a red card. At half time the Crusaders led 15-3. Kieran Read scored a try immediately after half time to extend the lead to 22-3. However, the travel, altitude and fast pace of the game took a toll on the Crusaders. The attacking Lions scored two tries {{to reduce the deficit}} to 25-17. But the defence of the Crusaders held out giving the Crusaders a record eighth title 25-17, while avenging last years result.|$|E
25|$|The ALCS and NLCS, {{since the}} {{expansion}} to best-of-seven, are always {{played in a}} 2–3–2 format: Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium {{of the team that}} has <b>home</b> field <b>advantage,</b> and Games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. The series concludes when one team records its fourth win. Since 1998, <b>home</b> field <b>advantage</b> has been given to the team that has the better regular season record, unless that team happens to be the Wild Card team. In that case, the other team gets <b>home</b> field <b>advantage,</b> because by rule the Wild Card team is never allowed <b>home</b> field <b>advantage</b> in a Division Series or LCS. In the event that both teams have identical records in the regular season, <b>home</b> field <b>advantage</b> goes to the team that has the winning head-to-head record.

A common and unfounded myth is that since Wrigley Field did not have lights at that time the National League decided to give the <b>home</b> field <b>advantage</b> to the winner of the NL West. In fact, <b>home</b> field <b>advantage</b> had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of sport generally stimulates widespread interest but unfortunately {{a great deal}} of the statistical detail made available for public consumption is not as informative as it. could be. One area of sport that attracts constant discussion is <b>home</b> ground <b>advantage.</b> A team's perceived <b>home</b> ground <b>advantage</b> is generally considered to be a contributing factor to their winning potential when playing at home, Familiarity of conditions and home crowd support are just two factors that could contribute to a team's <b>advantage</b> on its <b>home</b> turf, As a consequence <b>home</b> ground <b>advantage</b> has undergone extensive analysis in a range of sports but the game of cricket has only attracted marginal interest.
