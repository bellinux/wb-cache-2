40|$|Many time-series {{smoothing}} {{methods can}} be used for reducing noise and <b>extracting</b> <b>plant</b> phenological parameters from remotely-sensed data, but there is still no conclusive evidence in favor of one method over others. Here we use moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate five smoothing methods: Savitzky-Golay fitting (SG), locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing (LO), spline smoothing (SP), asymmetric Gaussian function fitting (AG), and double logistic function fitting (DL). We use ground tower measured NDVI (10 sites) and gross primary productivity (GPP, 4 sites) to evaluate the smoothed satellite-derived NDVI time-series, and elevation data to evaluate phenology parameters derived from smoothed NDVI. The results indicate that all smoothing methods can reduce noise and improve signal quality, but that no single method always performs better than others. Overall, the local filtering methods (SG and LO) can generate very accurate results if smoothing parameters are optimally calibrated. If local calibration cannot be performed, cross validation is a way to automatically determine the smoothing parameter. However, this method may in some cases generate poor fits, and when calibration is not possible the function fitting methods (AG and DL) provide the most robust description of the seasonal dynamics...|$|E

Plants have complex object structures in which images can help extract, however, not all plant features can be recognised through a single image.

Stereovision is a technique that produces a disparity map of a scene {{through the use of}} two or more images taken from different points of view. Depth information can be used to enhance the detection of fruit and plant parts; however research in using Stereovision for <b>extracting</b> <b>plant</b> structures is sparse.

From the colour images, colour and shape segmentation are evaluated on their ability to extract certain plant features, such as stems, branches and leaf. Depth images are also evaluated on their accuracy, coverage, and ability to improve image segmentation for colour images. The depth images have some gaps and missing data. The new algorithm develops the depth images by interpolating the gap data and smoothing depth images. Preliminary results show good plant feature can be extracted from depth images at indoor environment, while depth data from an outdoor environment contains more noise due to the variation in lighting conditions. ...|$|E

However, {{there have been}} only a few successful attempts to temporarily match satellite observations (Land Surface Phenology or LSP) with ground based phenological observations (Ground Phenology or GP). The classical pixel to point matching problem along with the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data are some of the many issues encountered. In this study, MODIS-sensor’s Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data were smoothed using two filtering techniques for comparison. Several start of season (SOS) methods established in the literature, namely thresholds of amplitude, derivatives and delayed moving average, were tested for determination of LSP-SOS for broadleaf forests at a site in southwestern Germany using 2001 – 2013 time series of NDVI data. The different LSP-SOS estimates when compared with species-rich GP dataset revealed that different LSP-SOS extraction methods agree better with specific phases of GP, and the choice of data processing or smoothing strongly affects the LSP-SOS extracted. LSP methods mirroring late SOS dates, i. e., 75 % amplitude and 1 st derivative, indicated a better match in means and trends, and high, significant correlations of up to 0. 7 with leaf unfolding and greening of late understory and broadleaf tree species. GP-SOS of early understory leaf unfolding partly were significantly correlated with earlier detecting LSP-SOS, i. e., 20 % amplitude and 3 rd derivative.

In this study, extractions of bioactive polyphenolic com-pounds from fruits and vegetables were per-formed using a pressurised solvent extraction technique. Variables including solvent, extrac-tion temperature and time, and number of ex-traction cycles, were optimised to develop a rapid and efficient extraction protocol. The re-sulting extracts were then analysed for antioxi-dant capacity, total phenolic content and com-position. The optimal parameters found were 19 : 1 methanol/water (95 % methanol) as solvent and three extraction cycles, of 10 minutes at 40 ºC or 2 minutes at 100 ºC. High performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry did not detect any difference in extract composition between low and high temperatures. Extraction at 100 °C generally gave a moderately higher yield of polyphenolics for some fruit and vege-table extracts but appeared to reduce the anti-oxidant activity particularly for turnip leaf, el-derberry and sour cherry extracts as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay. We found that all 40 °C extracts were better at protecting cells from H 2 O 2 -induced cellular damage than their 100 °C counterparts.

Due to its simplicity, the use of plant or whole <b>plant</b> <b>extract</b> and <b>plant</b> tissue for reduction of metal ions has attracted significant attention within the last 30  years [5]. Use of <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> for making nanoparticles is quite simple and easy as compare to use of whole <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> and <b>plant</b> tissues. A diverse range of plant species has been reported for synthesis of metal nanoparticles. In <b>plant</b> <b>extracts,</b> some biomolecules are found which can be reducing metal ions to nanosized materials by a single-step mediated green synthesis approaches.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringAjay ShardaPrecise water {{application}} conserves resources, reduces costs, and optimizes plant performance and quality. Existing irrigation scheduling utilizes single, localized measurements {{that do not}} account for spatial crop water need; but, quick, single-point sensors are impractical for measuring discrete variations across large coverage areas. Thermography is an alternate approach for measuring spatial temperatures to quantify crop health. However, agricultural studies using thermography are limited due to previous camera expense, unfamiliar use and calibration, software for image acquisition and high-throughput processing specifically designed for thermal imagery mapping and monitoring spatial crop water need. Recent advancements in thermal detectors and sensing platforms have allowed uncooled thermal infrared (TIR) cameras to become suited for crop sensing. Therefore, a small, lightweight thermal infrared imaging system (TIRIS) was developed capable of radiometric temperature measurements. One-time (OT) and real-time (RT) radiometric calibrations methods were developed and validated for repeatable, temperature measurements while compensating for strict environmental conditions within a climate chamber. The Tamarisk® 320 and 640 analog output yielded a measurement accuracy of ± 0. 82 °C or 0. 62 ºC with OT and RT radiometric calibration, respectively. The Tamarisk® 320 digital output yielded a measurement accuracy of ± 0. 43 or 0. 29 ºC with OT and RT radiometric calibration, respectively. Similarly, the FLIR® Tau 2 analog output yielded a measurement accuracy of ± 0. 87 or 0. 63 ºC with OT and RT radiometric calibration, respectively. A TIRIS was then built for high-throughput image capture, correction, and processing and RT environmental compensation for monitoring crop water stress within a greenhouse and temperature mapping aboard a small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). The greenhouse TIRIS was evaluated by <b>extracting</b> <b>plant</b> temperatures for monitoring full-season crop water stress index (CWSI) measurements. Canopy temperatures demonstrated that CWSI explained 82 % of the soil moisture variation. Similarly, validation aboard a sUAS provided radiometric thermal maps with a ± 1. 38 °C (α= 0. 05) measurement accuracy. Due to the TIR cameras’ performance aboard sUAS and greenhouse platforms, a TIRIS provides unparalleled spatial coverage and measurement accuracy capable of monitoring subtle crop stress indicators. Further studies need to be conducted to produce spatial crop water stress maps at scales necessary for variable rate irrigation systems...|$|E
40|$|Using {{biofuels}} {{based on}} coconuts, soybeans or sugarcane for energy generation {{has been around}} for some time. In the late 1990 s, several applications of coconut oil caught on in the Pacific. Major problems with using copra oil in engines are clogging filters and the oil turning solid at 24 ºC. A heat exchanger and using filtered clean copra oil can solve these problems. The motor has to be equipped with a diesel fuel system to start the engine and a coconut oil fuel system to run it. A controlled device heats the coconut oil and, once liquid, automatically switches from diesel to coconut oil. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the international centre for cooperation on development-oriented agricultural research (CIRAD) have established electricity generators on Vanuabalavu and Taveuni islands, Fiji, supplying electricity to 198 and 60 households, respectively, and a small oil <b>extracting</b> <b>plant</b> that supplies half of its oil yield for electricity generation. In Vanuatu s capital, Port Vila, a car company runs its vehicles on a blend of coconut oil and diesel in an attempt to convince motorists to fit their engines with a 75 heat exchanger and use a coconut/ diesel blend. This blend, named island fuel, contains 60 % clean copra oil and sells in Port Vila at 12 Vatu or 0. 09 /litre less than diesel. In 2002, more than 100 local buses were driving on this island fuel. A group of coconut producers from Lorevulko and Port Olry on the east coast of Espiritu Santo Island have formed Lory Coop to take up the challenge and are using copra oil for rural electrification, including for running a copra oil mill, cooling facilities and cassava and taro milling. POPACA, a rural development project funded by the European Commission and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will supply the generator. In Vanuatu s agricultural economy coconut is the most important commodity, and low and fluctuating world market prices make it attractive to sell it locally with an added value for the production of affordable electricity. In Port Olry, the cost of diesel is 1 /litre, whereas copra oil processed locally costs only 0. 43 /litre.

This study examined the designs of two phenotyping platforms and developed machine vision (MV) technology to estimate wheat growth status and count wheat head. The GreenSeeker, an infrared thermometer (IRT), a web camera, and a global positioning system (GPS) receiver were integrated into one handheld phenotyping platform, named as Phenocorn. The Phenocorn allowed simultaneous collection of the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) and canopy temperature (CT) with precise assignment of all measurements to plot location by GPS data points. The Phenocorn was tested using a field trial of 10 historical and current elite wheat (Triticum aestivium) breeding lines at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. Results showed that the NDVI data, PVC (percent vegetation coverage) data, and temperature data obtained by the handheld phenocorn could availably reflect the wheat growing status in the field, and the handheld phenocorn could be used as an instrument to do plant phenotyping information collection. This study also used the modular design method to design the mechanical structures of a robot-based phenotyping platform, named as Phenorobot. Its control system was based on a Controller Area Network (CAN bus). The basic function performances such as steering function, lifter load, and movement features were tested in the laboratory. Proposed design indicators were achieved, demonstrating its potential utilization for field experiments. Image acquisition {{is one of the main}} data collection methods for plant phenotyping research. The method for <b>extracting</b> <b>plant</b> phenotyping traits based on MV was explored in this research. Experiments for detecting the wheat development based on the images taken in the field were designed and carried out from March to June 2015, and a method based on color analysis to estimate percent vegetation coverage (PVC) of wheat was developed. A wheat growth model based on the PVC was used for the wheat growth status analysis. In addition, a wheat head counting method was developed and divided into three steps: wheat head image segmentation, leaf debris elimination, and wheat head counting. This paper proposes the first wheat head counting model (WCM) based on the pixels group measurement of wheat heads. Compared to the Joint Points Counting (JPC) method (Liu et al., 2014) and the Wheatear Shape Index (WSI) method (Frédéric et al., 2012), the WCM more accurately counted wheat heads from images taken in the experiments...|$|E
