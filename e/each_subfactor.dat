Datas about frame validity of the scale were tested with factoranalyze. At the end of this analyiz, four sub factors (sensibility to workers, trust to administrator,openes to modernity and communication climate) were reached. Total reliabiliyt coefficient ofscale was found 0. 97. <b>Each</b> <b>subfactor</b> reliability coefficient was found for sensibility to workers 0, 95, for trust to administrator 0, 95, for openes to modernity 0, 75 and for communicationclimate 0, 92. Findings show that internal-structure reliability coefficients of subfactors werefound high.

40|$|The study {{developed}} and validated {{a scale of}} elementary school classroom culture through sequential application of Rasch model and traditional statistics. The conceptual framework for the study was a theoretical model of elementary school classroom culture comprised of two educational outcome factors (six sub-factors), two class group factors (seven sub-factors), a teacher factor (four sub-factors) and a parental involvement factor. Likert scale items were written for each factor and sub-factors to produce a 108 -item scale. The scale was administered to {{a convenience sample of}} 622 students in 27 elementary school classrooms. The psychometric properties of the data were analysed using the computer programs SPSS and Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Models (RUMM). Both programs were then used for scale development and validation. The refined scale contained 59 items organised into five factors and 15 sub-factors. Each sub-factor was internally reliable and factors elicited data on a discreet construct. The items within <b>each</b> <b>subfactor</b> were arranged in Guttman patterns from ‘easy ’ to ‘hard’. Scale development ensured the data from the refined scale fitted the theoretical model. The study shows that the measurement capacity of a scale can be enhanced by application of both Rasch model and traditional statistics in scale development...|$|E
40|$|Public-private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{are increasingly}} used to procure Australian infrastructure projects. As with all construction projects, the early briefing stages {{are often the}} most crucial in determining a successful outcome. There is, however, a lack of systematic research on the type {{and nature of the}} critical factors affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of PPP during this period. A literature review is presented of PPP usage in Australia, in which four main categories of factors (procurement, stakeholder, risk, and finance) are identified, <b>each</b> with several <b>subfactors.</b> A questionnaire survey involving state government stakeholders is also described, and a mathematical model that ranks the factors involved is developed. This is followed by an examination of the potential of the factors to help improve the PPP briefing stage for both public and private sectors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the school climate in three {{secondary}} schools whose personnel had gone through a formalized group planning process with the school climate in three secondary schools whose personnel had not participated in a formalized group planning process. The certificated staffs of the three secondary schools which had completed the formalized group planning process were identified as the intervention group. The certificated staffs of the three secondary schools which had not participated in the formalized group planning process were identified as the control group. The intervention group and control group were chosen on the basis of similar student populations. The certificated staffs of the six schools responded to the abridged Discipline Context Inventory. Data from the instrument provided an overall school climate score as well as scores for eight subfactors within school climate. Nine null hypotheses were formulated. The null hypothesis regarding overall school climate was tested using the Hotelling T 2 statistic. Eight null hypotheses relating to <b>each</b> of the <b>subfactors</b> of the instrument were tested using a t-test statistic. All tests used the. 05 level of significance. The null hypothesis for the overall school climate was rejected. There was a significant difference in overall school climate between the two groups. The control group had the higher overall school climate score. No significant difference existed between the two groups on five subfactors: problem-solving and decision-making; distribution of authority and status; student belongingness; curriculum and instructional practices; dealing with personal problems. The hypotheses for three subfactors were rejected. The control group scored significantly higher in the subfactor developing and implementing rules. The intervention group scored significantly higher in the subfactors relationships with parents and other community members and physical environment. Title from approval sheet. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Let ω ≥ 2 be a {{cardinal}} and S {{a class of}} semisimple left R-modules (closed under isomorphisms). A module RM is called ω-thick relative to S, if dim S < ω for <b>each</b> <b>subfactor</b> S of M with S ∈ S. This notion allows to study from a unified point of view ω-distributive modules, i. e., modules satisfying A + Bλ = (A + Bµ) λ∈Λ λ∈Λ µ∈Λ{λ for all submodules A and families BλΛ of submodules with cardinality |Λ | = ω, and ω-thick modules, i. e., modules which are ω-thick relative to the class of all semisimple left R-modules. In particular 2 -distributive modules coincide with distributive modules, 2 -thick modules coincide with uniserial modules, ℵ 0 -thick modules coincide with q. f. d. modules, i. e., modules whose factor modules have finite uniform dimension. We also consider relative ω-quasi-invariant, relative ω-noetherian and relative ω-Bézout modules. Properties of modules from these classes are investigated including the relationship between them. Moreover, for modules RM and RU, the relationship between ω-distributivity of M and properties of the left EndR(U) module HomR(U, M) and the right EndR(U) -module HomR(M, U) are studied. 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} students’ attitudes toward the media literacy courses in Turkey. The study is designed as a quantitative study, and “Media Literacy Education Attitude Scale” (MLEAS) was used for the survey. The research population covers all seventh grade students who took a media literacy course during the academic year 2006 - 2007 in five pilot cities (İstanbul, İzmir, Ankara, Erzurum and Adana). In order to evaluate the reliability and validity of MLEAS, the scale was applied to 120 students from Ahmet Vefik Paşa Primary School, one of the pilot schools, in June 2006. For MLEA, four sub- factors were determined, and Internal Consistency Reliability (Cronbach alpha) and total item correlations were calculated for <b>each</b> <b>subfactor.</b> Collected data was analyzed with SPSS® 15. 0 statistical package program. In order to compare the data according to pilot city variable; the frequency, percentage and arithmetic mean of the data were calculated, and one way variance analysis was used. According to the study results, the students who took a media literacy course point out that media fails to show concern about protecting cultural and social values and does not fulfill its responsibilities regarding informing people about news and facts. The students state that the instructional materials and class discussions were adequate, but they did not like the teaching activities used by the teachers. They also point out that the classroom activities and teaching strategies were insufficient for the course. Finally, the results of study show that the students shared their learning with their families and friends, and this sharing created a positive effect both on families and friends...|$|E
