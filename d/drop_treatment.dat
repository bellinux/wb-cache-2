40|$|Purpose:Favorable {{outcomes}} of glaucoma are largely {{dependent on the}} patient’s ability to comply with prescribed eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment.</b> Yet, compliance studies are usually single-center studies, including {{a small number of}} patients. The goal of the multi-center Belgian Compliance Study in Ophthalmology (BSCO) was to substantiate the magnitude of non-compliance (NC) with eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment</b> in a large sample of glaucoma patients and to determine a possible association between NC and selected demographic & treatment characteristics. Methods:A cross-sectional survey was performed in 876 glaucoma patients treated in 60 different ophthalmologic centers in Belgium. NC with eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment</b> was assessed anonymously using a written self-report questionnaire developed {{for the purpose of this}} study. More specifically, patients were asked how many times they had forgotten to administer eye drops during the past 2 weeks. Patients had 4 answer options: never, seldom, once a week or daily. Two definitions of NC were explored: (1) missing one or more doses; (2) missing two or more doses in the past 2 weeks. Results: 731 out of 876 (83. 5 %) questionnaires were available for data analyses. 39. 7 % and 12. 3 % of the patients admitted not being compliant to their treatment regimen in the last 2 weeks for resp. chosen definitions. Correlates of NC were robust as similar correlates were found for the 2 definitions. Significantly more male patients ((1) 2 = 10. 46; p= 0. 001; (2) 2 = 9. 15; p= 0. 002) and younger patients ((1) Mann-Whitney U= 54296; p< 0. 001; (2) Mann-Whitney U= 25669; p= 0. 073) were NC. Moreover, a higher number of daily doses was also positively associated with NC ((1) Mann-Whitney U= 56580; p= 0. 013; (2) Mann-Whitney-U= 22386; p< 0. 001). Within the group of NC patients, the evening doses were mentioned to be most frequently missed in 59. 6 % (1) and 56. 7 % (2) of the patients respectively. 47 % (1) and 31. 1 % (2) suggested fewer doses per day as a valuable compliance enhancing intervention. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of patients had problems with complying with eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment</b> similar to previous evidence in smaller samples. Correlates of NC, male gender, younger patients and fewer doses, seemed quite robust. Clinicians should regularly screen for NC during routine follow-up. Patients at risk should be referred for compliance enhancing interventions. A possible pathway to improve compliance may be the reduction of daily doses. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|The in vivo {{inhibitory}} effect of r-hirudin variant III (rHV 3) on streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic cataracts in rats was investigated. SD-rats were firstly made diabetic {{by a single}} intraperitoneal injection of 2 % (W/V) STZ (65 [*]mg/kg). Two weeks later, cataract formation was examined by slit lamp microscope, and the cataracted animals were randomly grouped. The animals in the treated groups received rHV 3 drops administration to the eyes with various doses. After 4 weeks treatment, the animals were sacrificed to evaluate the biochemical changes of aldose reductase (AR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the eye lens. Meanwhile, the cataract progression was monitored by slit lamp microscope. As a result, rHV 3 <b>drops</b> <b>treatment</b> significantly increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the lens in a dose-dependent manner, whereas AR activity and MDA level in the lens were dramatically decreased.

While a VEGF-NGF cross talk has been recently shown to modulate corneal healing in rats, {{it is not known}} whether it also plays a role in the regulation of lacrimal function. In this study we aim to investigate the effects of anti-VEGF eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment</b> on lacrimal gland function and on the local expression of VEGF and NGF in rats. Tear function was measured in 3 months old rats by modified Schirmer test at baseline and after 3 weeks of topical anti-VEGF eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment.</b> Whole lacrimal glands from rats were removed after treatment and analysed by ELISA for VEGF and NGF levels. To investigate if the effects of anti-VEGF were mediated by changes in the NGF-pathway, we repeated the experiments in RCS rats, a strain with NGF-pathway impairment associated with decreased tear flow. After topical treatment with anti-VEGF eye drops, an increase in tear secretion was observed in both wild-type and RCS rats. A significant decrease of VEGF levels was also observed in lacrimal glands of both RCS and SD rats, accompanied by a significant increase in NGF levels. Inhibition of VEGF at the ocular surface in rats results in changes of tear function and lacrimal gland levels of VEGF and NGF.

Methods A multi-center cross-sectional survey was performed in 973 patients in 60 ophthalmologic centers in Belgium. NA was assessed by a written self-report question asking patients how many times he/she had forgotten to administer eye drops during the past 2 weeks. Answer options ranged from never, seldom, once a week to daily. ! e patients indicating they had skipped 1 or more administrations were classifi ed as NA. Current IOP (mmHg) and VF defects were measured with a Goldmann applanation tonometer and perimeter, respectively, at the same time as the NA assessment. Results 603 out of 937 (64 %) questionnaires were available for analysis. 39. 5 % of the patients reported to be NA. NA patients showed a signifi cant higher current IOP of the left eye than A patients (16. 12 +/- 3. 15 vs 15. 58 +/- 2. 83; p= 0. 030). No signifi cant diff erence in IOP of the right eye was found between NA and A patients (16. 13 +/- 3. 53 vs 16. 02 +/- 7. 61; p= 0. 843). ! e degree of visual fi eld defects was not signifi cantly related to NA.

40|$|In {{clinical}} drug development, {{searching for the}} true dose-response curve is ethically and logistically challenging. Establishing evidence of dose-response or Proof of Concept (PoC) {{is the first step}} for both determining the best dose-response model and optimizing a treatment dose correctly for clinical use. To overcome these challenges, we employ an adaptive two-stage design where both adding and <b>dropping</b> <b>treatment</b> arms is possible between stages. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we develop a method extending the Multiple Comparison Procedures and Modeling (MCP-Mod) approach into this adaptive two-stage design. Our goal is to establish "global" PoC across the stages. Between stages, we propose using an Adding and/or <b>Dropping</b> <b>Treatment</b> Adaptation Rule (ADTAR). In the ADTAR method, dose specifications in the second stage depend on the first stage's results. Treating the unobserved doses and imbalanced aggregate sample sizes in the second stage as missing data, we derive weights and adjust the test statistics in the second stage. Specifically, we assume that the missing data mechanism caused by ADTAR is missing at random. At the end of the second stage, we perform the global PoC test combining the test results from both stages. To preserve the family-wise error rate, we use a Conditional Error Function. Using simulation studies, we evaluated our design method and compared it to a conventional (one-stage) study design and different fixed two-stage designs. Our method showed overall robust high power for detecting the global PoC across three forms of true dose-response curves. In the second part of this dissertation, we find constraints for choosing doses in the original and extended MCP-Mod methods. Specifically, we establish lower bounds of the number and levels of doses for each method using simulation studies. Our proposed method is a viable tool in searching for a dose-response relationship. In accordance with ICH guidelines, our method helps to provide optimal doses of drugs for treating or preventing different diseases. Since drugs are widely used in human populations, such methods have a great Public Health impact in appropriately treating or preventing many types of diseases...|$|R

40|$|WOS: 000255724600003 International audiencePredicting the {{macroscopic}} {{properties of}} porous media used in treatment processes {{is a complex}} task regarding 3 -D structures at micro-, meso- and macro-levels. Currently, information is scarce concerning the influence, at a microscopic level, of the 3 -D structure of fibrous media on the physical laws governing their macroscopic behaviour. Nevertheless, the relationship between macroscopic properties (pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>treatment</b> efficiency) and microstructure can be assessed thanks to suitable structure modelling theories. In this context, the present study proposes and compares different methods (mercury porosimetry and image analysis) for the structure characterization at a microscopic level Of filtering fibrous media, such as nonwoven and woven fabrics. The results obtained show a porous structure gradient in {{the thickness of the}} nonwoven media studied in terms of porosity, pore size and tortuosity factor. Moreover, the influence on structural parameters of media compression, when submitted to friction forces exerted by flow during filtration tests, is established. A model for the determination of multi-level pore size distributions from mercury porosimetry data is proposed. The "equivalent pore" model is used to estimate the tortuosity factor. The influence of measured structural parameters on fibrous media permeability is studied in a classical model for flow through fibrous media...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) is a {{pleiotropic}} neurotrophin that extends its biological activity from the CNS and {{peripheral nervous system}} to the immune, endocrine and visual systems. A recombinant human NGF (rhNGF) was developed for systemic administration in diabetic and HIV-related neuropathy {{but it did not}} reach the market due to the failure of a Phase III study. More recently, experimental and clinical data showed that NGF eye <b>drop</b> <b>treatment</b> may be effective in several ophthalmic diseases, and clinical trials with a new rhNGF eye drops are currently ongoing. Areas covered: rhNGF produced in Escherichia coli was approved in Europe and in the United States for use in clinical trials in ophthalmic diseases. A Phase I study showed that rhNGF eye drops are safe and well tolerated. rhNGF has recently obtained Orphan Drug Designation for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and neurotrophic keratopathy and Phase II clinical trials on these conditions are currently ongoing. The authors examine preclinical, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data from the studies using topical ocular NGF. Expert opinion: Results from preclinical, clinical and safety studies have indicated that rhNGF eye drops represent a promising treatment for ophthalmic diseases currently lacking an effective therapy such as neurotrophic keratitis, RP, dry eye and glaucom...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{hydrothermal}} treatment on the pasting, hydration properties and colour quality of commercial fresh pasta were studied following an Instantaneous Controlled Pressure <b>Drop</b> <b>treatment.</b> This hydrothermal procedure involves a physical modification at high temperature (< 144 °C) and restricted moisture content (< 30 %) during {{a very short}} time (15 – 40 s) followed by a rapid pressure drop to a vacuum (50 mbar). Two process variables (steam pressure level and processing time) were investigated using response surface methodology. Steam pressure level had the greatest effect on hydration and pasting parameters. Increased pressure resulted in elevation of mass ratio between cooked and uncooked pasta (Wi/W 0) 100 °C and reduction of for all treated pasta. The optimum cooking time of untreated pasta was 7 min (W/W 0 = 2. 4), whereas for the same ratio it was less than 1 min for pasta treated at pressures ranging between 2. 5 and 3. 5 bar. The viscosity at 10 min (V 10) increased linearly when the pressure level increased. V 10 was 146 cP for untreated pasta whereas it reached 2659 cP for pasta treated at 3. 9 bar (144 °C) for 25 s. The cold paste viscosity and setback viscosity decreased when the pressure varied from 1 to 3. 9 bar...|$|E
