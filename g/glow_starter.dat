25|$|Resistive {{ballasts}} {{were the}} only type that was usable when the only supply available to power the fluorescent lamp was DC. Such fittings used the thermal type of starter (mostly because they had gone out use long before the <b>glow</b> <b>starter</b> was invented), but {{it was possible to}} include a choke in the circuit whose sole purpose was to provide a pulse on opening of the starter switch to improve starting.

2500|$|With {{automated}} starters such as glow starters, {{a failing}} tube will cycle endlessly, flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the emission mix {{is insufficient to}} keep the lamp current high {{enough to keep the}} <b>glow</b> <b>starter</b> open. This runs the ballast at higher temperature. Some more advanced starters time out in this situation, and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset. Some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset.

2500|$|Electronic {{starters}} only {{attempt to}} start a lamp {{for a short time}} when power is initially applied, and do not repeatedly attempt to restrike a lamp that is dead and unable to sustain an arc; some automatically shut down a failed lamp. This eliminates the re-striking of a lamp and the continuous flickering of a failing lamp with a <b>glow</b> <b>starter.</b> Electronic starters are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically, although they may fail like any other electronic circuit.

Starters are inexpensive, typically less than 50¢ for the short-lived glow type (depending upon lamp power), and perhaps ten times more for the electronic type [...]|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent <b>glow</b> <b>starters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lighting is {{generally}} by fluorescent lamps and LED lamps, and most frequently in living areas features a 4-way switch. The lamp has two separate circular fluorescent tubes, {{together with a}} nightlight (formally 常夜灯, informally a ナツメ球, natume-kyū, [...] "jujube-bulb" [...] (so-named for the shape)), and the switch cycles between [...] "both bulbs on", [...] "only one bulb on", [...] "night light only" [...] and [...] "off". Replaceable <b>glow</b> <b>starters</b> (formally 点灯管, informally グロー球 gurō-kyū [...] "glow bulb") are common in the older fixtures.|$|R
50|$|A <b>glow</b> switch <b>starter</b> {{is a type}} of preheat starter {{used with}} {{fluorescent}} lamp. It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode. The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit. One disadvantage of <b>glow</b> switch <b>starters</b> is that when the lamp {{is at the end of}} its life it will continuously blink on and off until the <b>glow</b> switch <b>starter</b> wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out.|$|R

25|$|Before the 1960s, four-pin thermal {{starters}} and manual switches were used. A mechanism then {{widely used}} for preheating, still in common use, is a <b>glow</b> switch <b>starter</b> (illustrated). It {{consists of a}} normally open bi-metallic switch in a small sealed gas-discharge lamp containing inert gas (neon or argon).|$|R
2500|$|More {{recently}} introduced electronic starters {{use a different}} method to preheat the cathodes. They may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with <b>glow</b> <b>starters</b> for use in standard fittings. They commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and [...] "soft start" [...] the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart. This is claimed to prolong lamp life {{by a factor of}} typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use, and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. The circuit is typically complex, but the complexity is built into the IC. Electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds), or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds. The faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up.|$|R
5000|$|Traxxas brought {{on-board}} {{electric starting}} systems into widespread use for nitro fuel powered models. Most of their nitro-powered models carry this [...] "EZ Start" [...] system. It {{consists of a}} small electric motor geared to a rear engine shaft and a wiring harness to start the nitro engine in a way similar to full size automobiles. The wiring has leads to the electric motor and the electrically heated <b>glow</b> plug. The <b>starter</b> battery is kept separate from the model in a wand-like device. The end of the wand is inserted into the vehicle's receiver, and then the user presses the button on the wand. The electric motor turns the rear shaft until ignition, or until the wand's battery drains. Traxxas has also released pull start systems for their engines, so that the EZ Start system can be replaced if the owner so chooses. Some models may be started with starter or [...] "bump" [...] boxes, allowing the installation of engines with no on-car starting method, no rear shaft (and no leaking shaft seal), and less rotating and overall ...|$|R
40|$|Due to silicon {{supplier}} {{failures to}} produce the 03 / 04 triac silicon as specified in the original proposal, {{the direction of the}} starter program was migrated to use available off the shelf power semiconductors. This had unexpected positive side effects including a reduction in component price, improved quality, and the refocus of engineering efforts to concentrate on the Super ASIC core technology. The starter program has begun shipments employing this new architecture, and is being well received both in the US and abroad. In its present form, the starter meets original cost projections within 20 %. Work is continuing on the 0. 8 micron ASIC, which will allow for the starter to sell below $ 1. 00 in volume. Even at the slightly higher price, interest is strong in replacing the low performance <b>glow</b> <b>starter</b> for small fluorescent applications with a high performance alternative...|$|E
