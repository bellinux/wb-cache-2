30|$|Common to {{geothermal}} {{areas are}} hard, volcanic, abrasive, nonhomogenous and heavily fractured rock formations which {{are prone to}} circulation loss, increased tortuosity, heavy dog legs, high tool wear and low rates of penetration.

40|$|Due to the {{exhaustion}} of conventional reservoirs of oil, gas and mineral resources over the recent years, {{the need to}} drill to unconventional, hard-to-reach wells has increased. Directional drilling techniques allow to drill the complex borehole geometries necessary to reach those wells. In practice, boreholes drilled with a <b>directional</b> drilling <b>system</b> often show undesired spiraling behavior. A large amount of research has been performed {{in the past to}} model the <b>directional</b> drilling <b>system,</b> {{in order to understand the}} causes of these unwanted effects. However, current models generally are based on many greatly simplifying assumptions, such as ideal contact of the stabilizers. With ideal stabilizer contact, the stabilizers of the <b>directional</b> drilling <b>system</b> always remain in contact with the borehole wall. However, the diameter of the borehole is generally larger than the diameter of the stabilizers in practice, thus resulting in non-ideal stabilizer contact. In this research, a hybrid model of a two-dimensional <b>directional</b> drilling <b>system</b> is derived, by taking non-ideal stabilizer contact into account. The BHA dynamics are described by a two-stabilizer distributed model. Combining the BHA model with a model for the kinematic relationships and bit-rock interaction, results in a borehole propagation model. The borehole propagation model is transformed into a delay differential state-space model, subject to a complementarity condition. By analysis of this hybrid model, an explanation can be given of the effect of non-ideal stabilizer contact on the occurrence and stability of the (quasi-) stationary trajectories. Furthermore, numerical simulations provide insight in the limit cycling behavior of the <b>directional</b> drilling <b>system.</b> These limit cycle are believed to be closely related to borehole spiraling, and thus the presented model provides more insight in these oscillating effects.

50|$|The Army, meanwhile, {{had visited}} GEC on several {{occasions}} during 1940 and seen their progress using conventional tube electronics at shorter wavelengths.

These {{could be used in}} a <b>directional</b> <b>system</b> with an antenna a metre or less in size. In contrast to the Airborne Group, who needed even shorter wavelengths to make very small antennas that could fit in the nose of an aircraft, or the Navy, who needed a system with enough resolution to pick up periscopes, the Army was looking only for a practical improvement in accuracy and smaller antennas. This could be met with GEC's solution, and by the middle of 1940, the Army's Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE) was working on a system using a klystron transmitter and a receiver from British Thomson-Houston (BTH), who had built the earlier 5 m GL sets.|$|E
