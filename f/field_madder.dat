Her father, however, was merely a man and hence Echo was not herself a nymph but mortal. Echo spent her days dancing with the Nymphæ and singing with the Muses who taught her all manner of musical instruments. Pan then grew angry with her, envious of her musical virtuosity and covetous of her virginity, which she would yield neither to men nor gods. Pan drove the men of the <b>fields</b> <b>mad,</b> and, like wild animals, they tore Echo apart and scattered the still singing fragments of her body across the earth.|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{systematic}} investigations on the operating properties of detectors based on the gas electron multiplier (GEM). The dependence of gain and charge collection efficiency on the external fields has been studied {{in a range of}} values for the hole diameter and pitch. The collection efficiency of ionization electrons into the multiplier, after an initial increase, reaches a plateau extending to higher values of drift field the larger the GEM voltage and its optical transparency. The effective gain, fraction of electrons collected ba an electrode following the multiplier, increases almost linearly with the collection field, until entering a steeper parallel plate multiplication regime. The maximum effective gain attainable increases with the reduction in the hole diameter, stabilizing to a constant value at a diameter approximately corresponding to the foil thickness. Charge transfer properties appear to depend only on ratios of <b>fields</b> outside <b>mad</b> and the channels, with no interaction between the external fields. With proper design, GEM detectors can be optimized to satisfy a wide range of experimental requirements : fast tracking of minimum ionizing particles, good electron collection with small distortions in high magnetic fields, improved multi-track resolution and strong ion feedback suppression in large volume and time projection chambers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} civil mental health laws operate to constrict how people think, understand, and speak about psychosocial disability, madness, and mental distress. It does so with {{reference}} to views and experiences of mental health service users and psychiatric survivors (users and survivors) and their/our accounts of disability, madness, and distress, such as those articulated by the emerging <b>field</b> of <b>Mad</b> studies. The analysis considers {{the application of the}} rights to freedom of opinion and expression that are enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights instruments to the mental health context. The article explores the suppression of freedom of opinion and expression that is effected through the symbolic violence of psychiatry and the mental health paradigm. Focusing on Australian legal frameworks, the article discusses how the material violence and coercion characterising mental health laws compound this process. It is further argued that civil mental health laws, by codifying the tenets of psychiatry and the mental health paradigm so as to render them largely unassailable, validate the ontological nullification of users and survivors. The foregoing analysis exposes dangers of adopting a functional test of mental capacity as the pre-eminent legal standard for authorising involuntary mental health interventions. It is suggested that considering freedom of opinion and expression from the perspective of psychosocial disability and madness reinforces the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities’ interpretation that such interventions are incompatible with international human rights standards...|$|R
40|$|In 2002 {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 1. 5 million people admitted into casualty emergency units within the Republic of South Africa. Many of these admissions dealt with events that were traumatic for both families and practitioners and these traumatic events have effects on the biological, psychological and social wellbeing of these individuals. Coupled with this is an ever increasing demand for mental health services and a worldwide shortage of qualified individuals to provide these services. Registered nurses in casualty units deal {{with the majority of}} these issues and the effect of these traumatic events. The crisis intervention model may provide these registered nurses with the necessary skills to deal with these problems not only for patients but possibly for themselves. Furthermore the biopsychosocial model of health allows these registered nurses {{to assess the impact of}} these events on the individuals. Yet, some registered nurses feel that they lack the necessary skills to deal with and assess these problems and intervene in these crisis situations. This study was exploratory descriptive in nature and aimed to examine whether there was a perceived need for registered casualty unit nurses to engage in supplementary counselling skills training. These perceptions were obtained through purposively sampled interviews and analysed qualitatively, using Tesch’s model of content analysis. Findings indicated that the registered nurses do perceive a need for supplementary counselling training, both for use with the patients and for themselves, and are willing to engage in this training although there are problems that inhibit this willingness.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of nonpotential characteristics of magnetic fields in AR 5747 is presented using Mees Solar Observatory magnetograms taken on Oct. 20, 1989 to Oct. 22, 1989. The active region showed such violent flaring activities during the observational span that strong X-ray flares took place including a 2 B/X 3 flare.

A nonlinear least square method was adopted to derive the magnetic field vectors from the observed Stokes profiles and a multi-step ambiguity solution method was employed to resolve the 180 degree ambiguity. From the ambiguity-resolved vector magnetograms, we have derived a set of physical quantities characterizing the field configuration, which are magnetic flux, vertical current density, magnetic shear angle, angular shear, magnetic free energy density and a measure of magnetic <b>field</b> discontinuity <b>MAD</b> (Maximum Angular Difference between two adjacent field vectors). In our results, all the physical parameters decreased with time, which implies that the active region was in a relaxation stage of its evolution. To examine the force-free characteristics of the field, we calculated the integrated Lorentz force and and also compared the longitudinal field component with the corresponding vertical current density. In this investigation, {{we found that the}} magnetic field in this active region was approximately linearly force-free throughout the observing period. The time variation of the linear force-free coefficient is consistent with the evolutionary trend of other nonpotentiality parameters. This suggests that the linear force-free coefficient could be a good indicator of the evolutionary status of active regions.

40|$|Magnetically arrested {{accretion}} discs (MADs), {{where the}} magnetic {{pressure in the}} inner disc is dynamically important, provide an alternative mechanism for regulating accretion to what is commonly assumed in black hole systems. We show that a global magnetic field inversion in the MAD state can destroy the jet, significantly increase the accretion rate, and move the effective inner disc edge in to the marginally stable orbit. Reconnection of the <b>MAD</b> <b>field</b> in the inner radii launches {{a new type of}} transient outflow containing hot plasma generated by magnetic dissipation. This transient outflow can be as powerful as the steady magnetically dominated Blandford-Znajek jet in the <b>MAD</b> state. The <b>field</b> inversion qualitatively describes many of the observational features associated with the high-luminosity hard-to-soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries: the jet line, the transient ballistic jet, and the drop in rms variability. These results demonstrate that the magnetic field configuration can influence the accretion state directly, and hence the magnetic field structure is an important second parameter in explaining observations of accreting black holes across the mass and luminosity scales...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} the composite luminosity function (LF) for galaxies in 60 clusters from the 2 dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. The LF spans the range - 22. 5 <M_b_ J<- 15, and is well-fitted by a Schechter function with M_b_ J^*=- 20. 07 ± 0. 07 and α=- 1. 28 ± 0. 03 (H_ 0 = 100 km s^- 1 Mpc^- 1, Ω_M= 0. 3, Ω_Λ= 0. 7).

There is no evidence for variations in the LF across {{a wide range of}} cluster properties. However the LF of early-type galaxies in clusters is both brighter and steeper than its field counterpart. The differences between the field and cluster LFs for the various spectral types can be qualitatively explained by the suppression of star formation in the dense cluster environment, together with mergers to produce the brightest early-type galaxies.

40|$|Tracer tests {{performed}} under natural or forced gradient flow conditions can provide useful information for characterizing subsurface properties, through monitoring, modeling, {{and interpretation of}} the tracer plume migration in an aquifer. Nonreactive tracer experiments were conducted at the Hanford 300 Area, along with constant-rate injection tests and electromagnetic borehole flow meter tests. A Bayesian data assimilation technique, the method of anchored distributions (MAD) (Rubin et al., 2010), was applied to assimilate the experimental tracer test data with the other types of data and to infer the three-dimensional heterogeneous structure of the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone of the Hanford formation. In this study, the Bayesian prior information on the underlying random hydraulic conductivity field was obtained from previous field characterization efforts using constant-rate injection and borehole flow meter test data. The posterior distribution of the conductivity field was obtained by further conditioning the field on the temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves at various observation wells. MAD was implemented with the massively parallel three-dimensional flow and transport code PFLOTRAN {{to cope with the}} highly transient flow boundary conditions at the site and to meet the computational demands of MAD. A synthetic study proved that the proposed method could effectively invert tracer test data to capture the essential spatial heterogeneity of the three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity <b>field.</b> Application of <b>MAD</b> to actual <b>field</b> tracer data at the Hanford 300 Area demonstrates that inverting for spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity under transient flow conditions is challenging and more work is needed...|$|R
40|$|We present general {{relativistic}} radiation MHD {{simulations of}} super-Eddington accretion on a 10 M_ black hole. We {{consider a range}} of mass accretion rates, black hole spins, and magnetic field configurations. We compute the spectra and images of the models {{as a function of}} viewing angle, and compare them with the observed properties of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The models easily produce apparent luminosities in excess of 10 ^ 40 erg s^- 1 for pole-on observers. However, the angle-integrated radiative luminosities rarely exceed 2. 5 × 10 ^ 39 erg s^- 1 even for mass accretion rates of tens of Eddington. The systems are thus radiatively inefficient, though they are energetically efficient when the energy output in winds and jets is also counted. The simulated models reproduce the main empirical types of spectra [...] - disk-like, supersoft, soft, hard [...] - observed in ULXs. The magnetic <b>field</b> configuration, whether <b>MAD</b> ("magnetically arrested disk") or SANE ("standard and normal evolution"), has a strong effect on the results. In SANE models, the X-ray spectral hardness is almost independent of accretion rate, but decreases steeply with increasing inclination. MAD models with non-spinning black holes produce significantly softer spectra at higher values of Ṁ, even at low inclinations. MAD models with rapidly spinning black holes are quite different from all other models. They are radiatively efficient (efficiency factor ∼ 10 - 20 %), super-efficient when the mechanical energy output is also included (70 %), and produce hard blazar-like spectra. In all models, the emission shows strong geometrical beaming, which disagrees with the more isotropic illumination favored by observations of ULX bubbles.

40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} and service {{life of a}} pavement is affected adversely {{by the presence of}} undrained water in the pavement layers. In cold winter climates like in Iowa, this problem is magnified further by the risk of frost damage when water is present. Therefore, well-performing subsurface drainage systems form an important aspect of pavement design by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). However, controversial findings are also reported in the literature regarding the benefits of subsurface drainage. The goal of this research was not to investigate whether subdrains are needed in Iowa pavements, but to conduct an extensive performance review of primary interstate pavement subdrains in Iowa, determine the cause of the problem if there are drains that are not functioning properly, and investigate the effect of poor subdrain performance due to improper design, construction, and maintenance on pavement surface distresses, if any. An extensive literature review was performed covering national-level and state-level research studies mainly focusing on the effects of subsurface drainage on performance of asphalt and concrete pavements. Several studies concerning the effects of a recycled portland cement concrete (RPCC) subbase on PCC pavement drainage systems were also reviewed. A detailed forensic test plan was developed in consultation with the project technical advisory committee (TAC) for inspecting and evaluating the Iowa pavement subdrains. Field investigations were conducted on 64 selected (jointed plain concrete pavement/JPCP and hot-mix asphalt/HMA) pavement sites during the fall season of 2012 and were mainly focused on the drainage outlet conditions. Statistical analysis was conducted on the compiled data from field investigations to further investigate the effect of drainage on pavement performance. Most Iowa subsurface drainage system outlet blockage is due to tufa, sediment, and soil. Although higher blockage rates reduce the flow rate of water inside outlet pipes, it does not always stop water flowing from inside the outlet pipe to outside the outlet pipe unless the outlet is completely blocked. Few pavement surface distresses were observed near blocked subsurface drainage outlet spots. More shoulder distresses (shoulder drop or cracking) were observed near blocked drainage outlet spots compared to open ones. Both field observations and limited performance analysis indicate that drainage outlet conditions do not {{have a significant effect on}} pavement performance. The use of RPCC subbase in PCC pavements results in tufa formation, a primary cause of drainage outlet blockage in JPCP. Several useful recommendations to potentially improve Iowa subdrain performance, which warrant detailed <b>field</b> investigations, were <b>mad...</b>|$|R
