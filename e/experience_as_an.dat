5|$|James E. Boyd, who {{had assumed}} the vice chancellorship of the University System of Georgia the {{previous}} month, was appointed Acting President of Georgia Tech by Chancellor George L. Simpson in May 1971. Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president {{was influenced by}} Boyd's previous <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> academic administrator, his experience {{as director of the}} Engineering Experiment Station, and his ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the EES should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.|$|E

Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue. Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.|$|E

5|$|Moffat's first {{television}} work was the teen drama series Press Gang. His first sitcom, Joking Apart, {{was inspired by}} the breakdown of his first marriage; conversely, his later sitcom Coupling was based upon the development of his relationship with television producer Sue Vertue.

5|$|The Commandos were aided {{in their}} {{planning}} for the operation by Captain Bill Pritchard of the Royal Engineers, who had pre-war <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> apprentice in the Great Western Railway dockyards and whose father was the dock master of Cardiff Docks. In 1940 while part of the British Expeditionary Force in France, his duties had included determining how to disable the French dockyards if they were captured. One of the dockyards he had studied was St Nazaire, and he had submitted a report detailing how to put the dock out of action.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E

5|$|Ralph Edward Flanders (September 28, 1880 – February 19, 1970) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer, industrialist and Republican U.S. Senator {{from the}} state of Vermont. He grew up on subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, and was an apprentice machinist and draftsman, before training as a mechanical engineer. He spent five years in New York City as an editor for a machine tool magazine. After moving to Vermont, he managed and then became president of a successful machine tool company. Flanders used his <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> industrialist to advise state and national commissions in Vermont, New England and Washington, D.C. on public economic policy. He was president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank for two years before being elected U.S. Senator from Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Simpson's {{selection}} of Boyd as interim president {{was influenced by}} Boyd's previous <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> academic administrator, his experience {{as director of the}} Engineering Experiment Station, and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money. The station had sizable and growing support from the state of Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry. However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the Experiment Station began to suffer due to a combination of a sharp decline in state funds and cuts to federal science, research, and education funding {{after the end of the}} Space Race funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the Battelle Memorial Institute, Stanford Research Institute, and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 2002–03, saw the Avalanche {{claim the}} NHL {{record for most}} consecutive division titles, nine, breaking the Montreal Canadiens streak of eight, won between 1974–82. The division title came after a bad start by the team, {{that led to the}} exit of head coach Bob Hartley, in December. General Manager Pierre Lacroix promoted assistant coach Tony Granato, who had only three months of coaching <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> assistant, to the head coach position. The team's playoff spot seemed in doubt at one point, but the Avalanche managed to finish with 105 points, ahead of the Vancouver Canucks by one. The race to the title was exciting, namely the second-to-last game of the season, as the Avalanche needed to win the game to stay in the race, and Milan Hejduk scored with 10 seconds left in overtime to beat Anaheim. The title was guaranteed in {{the final day of the}} regular season, when the Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 5–2 and the Vancouver Canucks lost against the Los Angeles Kings 2–0. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, the Avalanche blew a 3–1 series lead over the Minnesota Wild, and lost in overtime in Game 7. Peter Forsberg won the Art Ross Trophy for the leading scorer of the regular season, which he finished with 106 points (29 goals, 77 assists). Forsberg also won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the regular season's most valuable player and shared the NHL Plus/Minus Award with teammate Milan Hejduk. Hejduk scored 50 goals to win the Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the NHL. Forsberg was elected to the league's first All-Star team. Hejduk was elected to the second All-Star team.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately Chongju was {{the furthest}} north that the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was to penetrate, and on 1 November, {{while still in}} divisional reserve, the brigade was ordered to pull back to Pakchon {{in an attempt to}} {{consolidate}} the western flank. Immediately following their success at Unsan, the Chinese 117th Division of the 39th Army—under the overall command of Zhang Jiecheng—attacked southward, intending to cut off the retreating UN forces and in so doing eliminate the remnants of the ROK 1st Infantry Division and US 1st Cavalry Division by cutting the road junction at Pakchon. Meanwhile, the Chinese 38th and 40th Armies approached along the Chongchon River from the east. 3 RAR remained at Chongju, however, {{due to a lack of}} transport, while the remainder of the brigade moved south; now the most forward element on the US Eighth Army's left flank, the battalion soon became isolated without communications or armour and artillery support. Finally, on 2 November, US Army trucks became available, and the battalion completed its move south without incident, harbouring in the bed of the Taeryong River that evening. Meanwhile, it was announced that Green would be temporarily replaced by Walsh, who he had himself replaced in Japan several months before. Walsh, by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters, was urgently posted back to 3 RAR to resume command, despite his lack of operational <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infantry commander. Taking over amid difficult circumstances following Green's death, and with little time to become acquainted with the battalion, Walsh's inexperience soon told as the local situation deteriorated.|$|E
