5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{released}} statements on various issues not addressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statement</b> of Fundamental Truths.

5|$|Less {{than four}} years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah {{was asked by the}} Holy Synod, in a {{unanimous}} decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement,</b> the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} {{interview}} was videotaped, {{at the beginning of}} the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in {{the first interview}} are not included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement,</b> although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|On January 4, 2012, {{the band}} {{announced}} via the band's official website, {{along with their}} other official sources, that Howard Jones had left the band after his nine-year membership with them. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement,</b> the band did not disclose {{the reason for this}} decision out of respect for Jones, but simply thanked him for his nine years with the band and wished him well, as well as thanking the fans for their support as they began the search for a new lead singer; Jones later explained he departed the band to manage his type 2 diabetes which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. Soon after the announcement of Jones's departure, rumors began that Phil Labonte of All That Remains would officially take over lead vocals due to his previous history with the band, although Labonte quickly dispelled the rumor. Many vocalists were considered in the search for a new one for the band. The band's search for a new singer concluded in February with the announcement that original lead vocalist Jesse Leach would return to the band, as the band felt that Leach's energy, as well as his overall comfort and command of both the old and new material, made him the clear choice during auditions. Following Leach's return, the band continued to the process of recording their new album and touring. On April 22, 2012, the band performed Leach's first show since 2002 at the New England Metal and Hardcore Fest.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> 2011, <b>the</b> Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2011 - 05, which {{mandates}} that Comprehensive Income (CI) and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) be reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>statements</b> (i. e., either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> income <b>statement</b> or a separate statement of comprehensive income) rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previously-allowed equity <b>statement.</b> Using this issuance as an exogenous event, I examine whether {{the presentation of}} accounting information in different statements affects earnings management behavior. In particular, I investigate whether the required presentation of CI/OCI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>statements</b> reduces earnings management through selective sales of available-for-sale (AFS) securities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banking industry. I first document that prior to ASU 2011 - 05, banks presenting CI/OCI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equity <b>statements</b> engage <b>in</b> more management of realized gains and losses on AFS securities compared to banks presenting CI/OCI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>statements.</b> More importantly, employing a difference-in-differences design, I show a larger reduction in (though not complete elimination of) earnings management for banks mandated to switch the reporting position of CI/OCI, relative to a control group of banks voluntarily using performance <b>statements</b> prior to <b>the</b> mandatory adoption. Overall, this evidence suggests that mandated reporting of CI/OCI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>statements</b> reduces banks’ earnings smoothing behavior...|$|R
