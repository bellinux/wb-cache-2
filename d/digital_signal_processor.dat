The Snapdragon system on chip (SoC) was announced in November 2006 and included the Scorpion processor, {{as well as other}} semiconductors.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JP¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> <b>processor</b> (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Maxtor {{entered the}} mass market with its {{purchase}} of the assets (but not the liabilities) of bankrupt MiniScribe in Longmont, Colorado. The transition was a tough one as the early products of this union (notably the 7120AT 3.5-inch 120MB drive) had many quality and design problems. Later products managed to sell well despite the initial problems.

500|$|Notable in the {{development}} of Super Mario Kart was its use of Mode 7 graphics. First seen in F-Zero, Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a plane to be rotated and scaled freely, achieving a pseudo-three-dimensional appearance. 1UP.com have credited the use of Mode 7 with giving the game graphics which at the time of release were considered to be [...] "breathtaking". Retrospective reflection on the Mode 7 visuals was mixed, with IGN stating that the once revolutionary technology now looks [...] "crude and flickery" [...] while the Video Game Bible describes them as [...] "beautiful" [...] and adding to the game. Super Mario Kart featured a DSP (<b>Digital</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>Processor)</b> chip; DSPs were used in SNES games as they provided a better handling of floating point calculations to assist with three-dimensional maths. The DSP-1 chip that was used in Super Mario Kart went on to be the most popular DSP chip to be used in SNES games. The music for the title was created by composer Soyo Oka.|$|E
