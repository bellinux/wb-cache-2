500|$|The {{day after}} {{recording}} [...] "Yoda", Yankovic started recording [...] "Like a Surgeon", the lead single for the album.

This friend was a mutual friend of Al's manager, Jay Levey. When word got back to Yankovic, he decided it was a good idea and wrote the song.

500|$|After {{four or five}} New World Alliance {{governing}} council meetings, Satin became tired of {{what he saw as}} empty rhetoric, and decided to do something practical– start a political newsletter. [...] He raised $91,000 to launch the venture, from 517 people he had met on his travels, and within a few years had built it into what think-tank scholar George Weigel described as [...] "one of the hottest political newsletters in Washington.... <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> fair amount of [...] attention, and perhaps even some influence, because it self-consciously styles itself 'post-liberal'." [...] Satin published 75 issues of New Options from 1984 to 1992, virtually half a million words. [...] He wrote nearly all the articles. [...] In 1989 New Options received Utne Readers first [...] "Alternative Press Award for General Excellence: Best Publication from 10,000 to 30,000 Circulation". [...] In 1990 The Washington Post identified New Options as one of 10 periodicals spearheading [...] "The Ideology Shuffle".

Bruckman describes Mulder's death as the killer sees it: getting his throat slit by the killer after stepping in a pie in a kitchen. However Bruckman tells Mulder he's not able to see what happens afterwards. Meanwhile, the inconspicuous man consults a tarot card reader (Alex Diakun), who says that the killer seeks answers from [...] "a man with special wisdom" [...] and that his confusion will soon abruptly end [...] "with the arrival of a woman - a blonde or a brunette, possibly a redhead." [...] When there is just one card left unturned, the killer says that it is not meant for him but for the reader, and turns it over to reveal the [...] "death" [...] card.|$|E

[...] This episode portrays a country full of Bob and Doug McKenzies; Toronto is but a highway town en route to Buffalo." [...] "Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus" [...] was among the episodes featured in a 2006 list by the Winnipeg Free Press of the ten most memorable South Park episodes. The Toronto Sun listed the episode {{as one of the most}} memorable television moments of 1998, and the single most memorable moment from the month of April. The prank played by the airing of this episode was revisited a number of times in subsequent episodes. The episode [...] "Cartoon Wars Part II" [...] revisits it by appearing to begin with a similar spoof, though the episode then cuts to the actual plot. The [...] episode, [...] "", also references the controversy over the airing of this episode, as does the thirteenth season episode, [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef".|$|E
2500|$|The show {{features}} a laugh track, something Ullman was hesitant about using. [...] "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate {{things like that}} on a show. But when we played it, it kind of worked. It makes it sound like you're connecting with people. Comedy <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> bit cold lately, and neurotic and depressed. This is a nice BBC One family show. It's not too arch or bleak." [...] All laughter is genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at BBC Radio Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, when Cairn Energy found initial {{traces of}} natural gas {{in one of its}} test wells that {{indicate}} the possibility of much larger hydrocarbon deposits, Greenpeace sent its ship, the Esperanza, into a stand-off with the Danish navy near Cairn's oil platforms. Many members of the community were angry with Greenpeace telling youngsters not to eat whale or seal, which the Inuit have eaten for centuries. As a result, Cairn Energy <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> warmer welcome than many environmentalists have hoped for. One person said this was [...] "because it is for the greater good."

2500|$|The Fragile was {{included}} on several magazines' [...] "end-of-year" [...] album lists, including The Village Voice (number 14), Rolling Stone (number four), and Spin (number one). In a retrospective review, The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) gave it three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and wrote that, as [...] "NIN's monumental double-disc bid for the art-rock crown, The Fragile sounds fantastic from start to finish, but there aren't enough memorable tunes underneath the alluring surfaces." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine offered similar criticism, writing that [...] "Reznor's music is immaculately crafted and arranged, with every note and nuance gliding into the next — but he spent more time constructing surfaces than songs. Those surfaces can be enticing but since it's just surface, The Fragile winds up being vaguely unsatisfying." [...] In 2005, The Fragile was ranked number 341 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. But, even if initial reception was mixed, the album <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> cult following from Nine Inch Nails fans. In 2016, Exclaim! listed The Fragile at number two on their [...] "Essential Albums" [...] list for Nine Inch Nails, citing it as their most ambitious work and [...] "a tragic if not stunning portrait of depression." [...] Pitchfork would later reassess the album in their review of the album's 2017 [...] "Definitive Edition", describing it as Reznor's [...] "magnum opus... The Fragile scrapes the sky like never before." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the teasing}} of the Nick–Jess {{relationship}} in the first season, critics named Jake Johnson the breakout star of season 2 as the characters' romance unfolded. Saying that [...] "Not since Ross and Rachel's tango on Friends has watching a comedy romance been so satisfying", The Hollywood Reporter said the producers [...] "did the impossible by engaging their leads in a love story, which only strengthened the artistry of the single-cam comedy". The New York Times said season 2 [...] "erupted in fantastic and bizarre fits and starts" [...] because of the characters' unmatched personalities, and lauded the writers for not playing up the will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. By emphasing how the characters got together, the show [...] "made for hilarious setups [...] to high-level Abbott and Costello slapstick. They have a modern love. [...] Together, they are fully functional. They make each other human." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan was unconcerned about getting Jess and Nick together, as because of immaturity [...] "they're bound to keep on {{making a lot of}} amusing and painful mistakes, sometimes with each other. Those choices can be both hilarious and sad, and New Girl <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> lot of mileage out of both those areas." [...] The continued Nick–Jess relationship was criticized in season 3 for dropping the characters' personalities, lack of tension, and for neglecting the show's female friendship between Jess and Cece. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt that {{during the first half of}} season 3 that [...] "bringing them together caused that [...] spark [...] to diminish", while Hitfix Alan Sepinwall and The A.V. Club David Sims found that the show's perceived decline in quality had less to do with the Nick–Jess relationship but with the handling of Schmidt's cheating arc and the re-introduction of Coach.|$|E
