40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture for data analytics targeting an anticipatory learning {{process in the}} context of the Internet of Mobile Things. The architecture is geo-distributed and composed by <b>edge,</b> <b>fog,</b> and cloud resources that operate collectively to support such an anticipatory learning process. We designed the architecture to manage large volumes of data streams coming from the IoMT devices, analyze in successive phases climbing up in the hierarchy of resources from <b>edge,</b> <b>fog</b> and cloud. We discuss the characteristics of the analytical tasks at each layer. We notice that the amount of data being transported in the network decreases going from the edge, to the fog and finally to the cloud, while the complexity of the computation increases. Such design allows to support different kind of analytical needs, from real-time to historical according to the type of resource being utilized. We have implemented the proposed architecture as a proof-of-concept using the transit data feeds from the area of Greater Moncton, Canada.

40|$|Fog computing, {{characterized}} by extending cloud computing {{to the edge}} of the network, has recently received considerable attention. The fog is not a substitute but a powerful complement to the cloud. It is worthy of studying the interplay and cooperation between the <b>edge</b> (<b>fog)</b> and the core (cloud). To address this issue, we study the tradeoff between power consumption and delay in a cloud-fog computing system. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst mathematically formulate the workload allocation problem. After that, we develop an approximate solution to decompose the primal problem into three subproblems of corresponding subsystems, which can be independently solved. Finally, based on extensive simulations and numerical results, we show that by sacriﬁcing modest computation resources to save communication bandwidth and reduce transmission latency, fog computing can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of cloud computing...|$|E
40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) has {{accelerated}} {{the deployment of}} millions of sensors {{at the edge of}} the network, through Smart City infrastructure and lifestyle devices. Cloud computing platforms are often tasked with handling these large volumes and fast streams of data from the edge.

In this paper, we review various dimensions of system architecture, application characteristics and platform abstractions that are manifest in this <b>Edge,</b> <b>Fog</b> and Cloud eco-system. We highlight novel capabilities of the Edge and Fog layers, such as physical and application mobility, privacy sensitivity, and a nascent runtime environment. IoT application case studies based on first-hand experiences across diverse domains drive this categorization. We also highlight the gap between the potential and the reality of Fog computing, and identify challenges that need to be overcome for the solution to be sustainable.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) is {{offering}} unprecedented observational {{data that are}} used for managing Smart City utilities. Edge and Fog gateway devices {{are an integral part}} of IoT deployments to acquire real-time data and enact controls. Recently, Edge-computing is emerging as first-class paradigm to complement Cloud-centric analytics. But a key limitation is the lack of a platform-as-a-service for applications spanning Edge and Cloud. Here, we propose ECHO, an orchestration platform for dataflows across distributed resources. ECHO's hybrid dataflow composition can operate on diverse data models [...] streams, micro-batches and files, and interface with native runtime engines like TensorFlow and Storm to execute them. It manages the application's lifecycle, including container-based deployment and a registry for state management. ECHO can schedule the dataflow on different <b>Edge,</b> <b>Fog</b> and Cloud resources, and also perform dynamic task migration between resources. We validate the ECHO platform for executing video analytics and sensor streams for Smart Traffic and Smart Utility applications on Raspberry Pi, NVidia TX 1, ARM 64 and Azure Cloud VM resources, and present our results.

METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the milling <b>edge</b> and <b>fog</b> seal methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the milling <b>edge</b> sealing and <b>fog</b> seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the milling <b>edge</b> sealing and <b>fog</b> seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little.

40|$|The {{upcoming}} {{big data}} era {{is likely to}} demand tremendous computation and storage resources for communications. By pushing computation and storage to network <b>edges,</b> <b>fog</b> radio access networks (Fog-RAN) can effectively increase network throughput and reduce transmission latency. Furthermore, we can exploit the benefits of cache enabled architecture in Fog-RAN to deliver contents with low latency. Radio access units (RAUs) need content delivery from fog servers through wireline links whereas multiple mobile devices acquire contents from RAUs wirelessly. This work proposes a unified low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) approach to solving the content delivery problem in both wireline and wireless parts of Fog-RAN. To attain a low caching latency, we present a high precision approach with Riemannian trust-region method to solve the challenging LRMC problem by exploiting the quotient manifold geometry of fixed-rank matrices.

40|$|Fog {{computing}} is an end-to-end horizontal {{architecture that}} distributes computing, storage, control, and networking functions closer to users along the cloud-to-thing continuum. The word "edge" may carry different meanings. A common {{usage of the}} term refers to the edge network {{as opposed to the}} core network, with equipment such as edge routers, base stations, and home gateways. In that sense, there are several differences between <b>fog</b> and <b>edge.</b> First, <b>fog</b> is inclusive of cloud, core, metro, edge, clients, and things. The fog architecture will further enable pooling, orchestrating, managing, and securing the resources and functions distributed in the cloud, anywhere along the cloud-to-thing continuum, and on the things to support end-to-end services and applications. Second, fog seeks to realize a seamless continuum of computing services from the cloud to the things rather than treating the network edges as isolated computing platforms. Third, fog envisions a horizontal platform that will support the common fog computing functions for multiple industries and application domains, including but not limited to traditional telco services. Fourth, a dominant part of edge is mobile <b>edge,</b> whereas the <b>fog</b> computing architecture will be flexible enough to work over wireline as well as wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|We propose {{distributed}} deep {{neural networks}} (DDNNs) over distributed computing hierarchies, {{consisting of the}} cloud, the <b>edge</b> (<b>fog)</b> and end devices. While being able to accommodate inference of a deep neural network (DNN) in the cloud, a DDNN also allows fast and localized inference using shallow portions of the neural network at the edge and end devices. When supported by a scalable distributed computing hierarchy, a DDNN can scale up in neural network size and scale out in geographical span. Due to its distributed nature, DDNNs enhance sensor fusion, system fault tolerance and data privacy for DNN applications. In implementing a DDNN, we map sections of a DNN onto a distributed computing hierarchy. By jointly training these sections, we minimize communication and resource usage for devices and maximize usefulness of extracted features which are utilized in the cloud. The resulting system has built-in support for automatic sensor fusion and fault tolerance. As a proof of concept, we show a DDNN can exploit geographical diversity of sensors to improve object recognition accuracy and reduce communication cost. In our experiment, compared with the traditional method of offloading raw sensor data to be processed in the cloud, DDNN locally processes most sensor data on end devices while achieving high accuracy {{and is able to}} reduce the communication cost by a factor of over 20 x...|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{analytics}} {{using data}} {{generated from the}} Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is facing many challenges which range from the ingestion of data streams coming from {{a vast number of}} fog nodes and IoMT devices to avoiding overflowing the cloud with useless massive data streams that can trigger bottlenecks [1]. Managing data flow is becoming {{an important part of the}} IoMT because it will dictate in which platform analytical tasks should run in the future. Data flows are usually a sequence of out-of-order tuples with a high data input rate, and mobility analytics requires a real-time flow of data in both directions, from the edge to the cloud, and vice-versa. Before pulling the data streams to the cloud, edge data stream processing is needed for detecting missing, broken, and duplicated tuples in addition to recognize tuples whose arrival time is out of order. Analytical tasks such as data filtering, data cleaning and low-level data contextualization can be executed at the edge of a network. In contrast, more complex analytical tasks such as graph processing can be deployed in the cloud, and the results of ad-hoc queries and streaming graph analytics can be pushed to the edge as needed by a user application. Graphs are efficient representations used in mobility analytics because they unify knowledge about connectivity, proximity and interaction among moving things. This poster describes the preliminary results from our experimental prototype developed for supporting transit systems, in which edge and cloud computing are combined to process transit data streams forwarded from fog nodes into a cloud. The motivation of this research is to understand how to perform meaningfulness mobility analytics on transit feeds by combining cloud and fog computing architectures in order to improve fleet management, mass transit and remote asset monitoringComment: Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Mobility Analytics, Internet of Mobile Things, <b>Edge</b> <b>Fog</b> Fabri...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{efficient}} use of network resources is continuously increasing with the grow of traffic demand, however, current mobile systems have been planned and deployed so far with the mere aim of enhancing radio coverage and capacity. Unfortunately, this approach is not sustainable anymore, as 5 G communication systems will {{have to cope with}} huge amounts of traffic, heterogeneous in terms of latency among other Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, the advent of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) brings up the need to more efficiently plan and dimension network deployment by means of jointly exploiting the available radio and processing resources. From this standpoint, advanced cell association of users can play a key role for 5 G systems. Focusing on a heterogeneous network, this paper proposes a comparison between state-of-the-art (i. e., radio-only) and MEC-aware cell association rules, taking the scenario of task offloading in the UL as an example. The observed latency-related performance results shows that a dynamic association based on the network disparity provides nearly 60 % of gain from a system-wide point of view, as compared to the standard radio-exclusive counterpart.

This system mainly deals with {{man in the middle}} attack and DDoS attack. In addition, FOCUS is {{implemented}} in fog computing to achieve a fast response and an efficient network consumption. The authors in [16] propose a multi-level DDoS mitigation framework (MLDMF) to defend against DDoS attacks for <b>edge</b> computing, <b>fog</b> computing, and cloud computing. A framework [17] specifically used to defend against DDoS attacks is proposed. The main purpose of this framework is to protect the cloud through fog nodes. The authors in [18] build a novel mathematical framework based on game theory and epidemic theory to investigate the interplay between user incentives and interdependent security risks (DDoS) in mobile edge computing. A general fog computing IDS framework is proposed [9], and the fog computing intrusion detection classifier model based on the sample selection extreme learning machine is studied under the framework. The classifier in this architecture can effectively solve the problems of low intrusion detection efficiency and poor precision due to the characteristics of finite fog computing resource constraints. In this framework, Fuhong et al.

40|$|The {{vision of}} the Internet of Things is to allow {{currently}} unconnected physical objects {{to be connected to}} the internet. There will be an extremely large number of internet connected devices that will be much more than the number of human being in the world all producing data. These data will be collected and delivered to the cloud for processing, especially with a view of finding meaningful information to then take action. However, ideally the data needs to be analysed locally to increase privacy, give quick responses to people and to reduce use of network and storage resources. To tackle these problems, distributed data analytics can be proposed to collect and analyse the data either in the <b>edge</b> or <b>fog</b> devices. In this paper, we explore a hybrid approach which means that both innetwork level and cloud level processing should work together to build effective IoT data analytics in order to overcome their respective weaknesses and use their specific strengths. Specifically, we collected raw data locally and extracted features by applying data fusion techniques on the data on resource constrained devices to reduce the data and then send the extracted features to the cloud for processing. We evaluated the accuracy and data consumption over network and thus show that it is feasible to increase privacy and maintain accuracy while reducing data communication demands.
