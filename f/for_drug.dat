5|$|A {{cytotoxic}} agent can {{be linked}} to an anti-tumor antibody <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> targeting purposes. The word vedotin, for example, stands for monomethyl auristatin E which is toxic by itself but predominantly affects cancer cells if used in conjugates like glembatumumab vedotin.|$|E
30|$|Quantum dots (QDs), nano-carriers <b>for</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{can help}} realize the {{targeting}} of drugs, {{and improve the}} bioavailability of drugs in biological fields. And, a QD nano-carrier system <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> {{has the potential to}} realize early detection, monitoring, and localized treatments of specific disease sites. In addition, QD nano-carrier systems <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> can improve stability of drugs, lengthen circulation time in vivo, enhance targeted absorption, and improve the distribution and metabolism process of drugs in organization. So, the development of QD nano-carriers <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> has become a hotspot in the fields of nano-drug research in recent years. In this paper, we review the advantages and applications of the QD nano-carriers <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> in biological fields.|$|R
5000|$|The PRR {{is defined}} as the ratio between the {{frequency}} with which a specific adverse event is reported <b>for</b> the <b>drug</b> of interest (relative to all adverse events reported <b>for</b> the <b>drug)</b> and the frequency with which the same adverse event is reported <b>for</b> all <b>drugs</b> in the comparison group (relative to all adverse events <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> in the comparison group). For example, suppose that nausea was reported 83 times <b>for</b> a given <b>drug</b> of interest, out of 1356 adverse events reported <b>for</b> the <b>drug.</b> Thus the proportion of adverse events of nausea <b>for</b> this <b>drug</b> is 83/1356 = 0.061. Suppose that we wish to compare the drug of interest to a class of <b>drugs,</b> <b>for</b> which nausea was reported as an adverse event 1489 times, out of 53789 total adverse events reported <b>for</b> <b>drugs</b> in the class. Thus, nausea was reported with proportion 1489 / 53789 = 0.028 for the class of drugs. The PRR in this case is 0.061 / 0.028 = 2.18. This tells us that nausea was reported more than twice as frequently (among all adverse event reports) <b>for</b> the <b>drug</b> of interest compared to drugs in the comparison group.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

5|$|A 12-episode anime {{television}} series adaptation produced by AIC Classic and Aniplex aired in Japan between January 13 and March 31, 2011 on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block. Crunchyroll simulcasted the anime on their streaming website. Aniplex released the anime on six Blu-ray and DVD compilation volumes in Japan between April 27 and September 21, 2011. Of the 11 episodes to be aired on TV, episodes 10 and 11 were edited {{into a single}} episode, and were released individually on their respective BD/DVD volumes. Following the arrest of Ai Takabe, the voice actress who played Maiko, <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> possession in October 2015, Bandai Channel removed the series from its streaming catalog.

5|$|In 1937, Astrid (then {{known as}} W.U.T.A.) {{was sold to}} Swede J. Jeppson and renamed Astrid. Her port of {{registry}} was changed to Skillinge and the Code Letters SLEK were allocated. By this time, she had been derigged and was operating on her engine alone. Astrid was used on trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea until 1975. Astrid then sailed under a Lebanese flag. She was allegedly used <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> smuggling, and was being shadowed in the English Channel by HM Customs and Excise when she mysteriously caught fire.

For the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was upgraded with a new ice hockey clock, a new lighting system and new ice hockey boards. The speedway course was dismounted in 1968. During the 1980s, the stadium became a central location <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> dealing, but the traffic moved away during the 1990s. In 1985, artificial ice was laid north of the football pitch, costing 2.1 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Of this, NOK1.3 million was financed by Gr√ºner IL through loans.

5|$|In metabolism, {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent‚Äì it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> discovery.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to be sufficient to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000¬µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E
