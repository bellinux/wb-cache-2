50|$|The {{sol-gel process}} {{has a long}} history of use for {{synthesis}} of silicate systems and other oxides and it has become a widely spread research field with high technological relevance, for example for the fabrication of thin films, coatings, nanoparticles and fibers. Sol-gel processing technology at low temperatures, an alternative to traditional melt processing of glasses, involves the synthesis of a solution (sol), typically composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors followed by the formation of a gel by chemical reaction or aggregation, and lastly thermal treatment for drying, organic removal, and sometimes crystallization and cooling treatment. The synthesis of specific silicate bioactive glasses by the sol-gel technique at low temperatures using metal alkoxides as precursors was shown in 1991 by Li et al. For the synthesis of bioactive glasses, typical precursors used are tetraethyl orthosilicate, calcium nitrate and triethylphosphate. After hydrolysis and poly-condensation reactions a gel is formed which subsequently is calcinated at 600-700̊ C to form the glass. Based on the preparation method, sol-gel derived products, e.g. thin films or particles are highly porous exhibiting a high specific surface area. Recent work on fabricating bioactive silicate glass nanoparticles by sol-gel process has been carried out by Hong et al. In their research, nanoscale bioactive glass particles were obtained by the combination of two steps; sol-gel route and co-precipitation method, wherein the mixture of precursors was hydrolyzed in acidic environment and condensed in alkaline condition separately, and then followed by a freeze-drying process. The morphology and size of bioactive glass nanoparticles could be tailored by varying the production conditions and the <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio</b> of reagents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{wrinkling}} {{failure in}} conventional spinning of a cylindrical cup {{has been investigated}} by using both finite element (FE) analysis and experimental methods. FE simulation models of a spinning experiment have been developed using the explicit finite element solution method provided by the software Abaqus. The severity of wrinkles is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the radial coordinates of element nodes {{on the edge of}} the workpiece obtained from the FE models. The results show that the severity of wrinkles tends to increase when increasing the roller <b>feed</b> <b>ratio.</b> A forming limit study for wrinkling has been carried out and shows that there is a <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> limit beyond which the wrinkling failure will take place. Provided that the <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> is kept below this limit, the wrinkling failure can be prevented. It is believed that high compressive tangential stresses in the local forming zone are the causes of the wrinkling failure. Furthermore, the computational performance of the solid and shell elements in simulat-ing the spinning process are examined and the tool forces obtained from wrinkling and wrinkle-free models are compared. Finally, the effects of the <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> on variations of the wall thickness of the spun cylindrical cup are investigated...|$|R

Round polycarbonate tanks (Pan-Light) with 30 liters were employed in the rearing experiments. About 10 liters of gravels crushed were set on the bottom as a filter. The water was recirculated by an air bubbling through a pipe-like an air lift pump located around the center of the tank. The air volume supplied was increased gradually from 3 to 13 or 15 liters per minute in process of yeast feeding. Marine type of Chlorella was innoculated at the beginning with 6. 0 g of KNO_ 3, 0. 6 g of KH_ 2 PO_ 4, 0. 9 g of Clewat- 32 and 0. 1 g of Clewat-Ca in the tank. When the Chlorella grew up to the stationary phase, a small number of rotifer were transfered into the water. Frozen marine yeast were fed to the rotifer, after the majority of Chlorella cultured were taken up. The yeast were supplied at 6 -hour intervals keeping {{with a certain amount of}} feed levels between 100 × and 2, 000 × 10 ^ 4 cells per ml of yeast. The experiment was repeated three times; Exp. I, II and III, during February and May in a sunny exterior of the Laboratory. Each experiment showed a similar result on the population growth of the rotifer. The maximum density of rotifer cultured in Exp. I, II and III were 1, 450, 1, 170 and 1, 270 individuals per ml, respectively. Higher <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio,</b> 140 %, was found in lower temperature, 21. 1 °C. On the contrary, the lower ratio, 43 %, was obtained when it was 27. 6 °C, the highest temperature through the experiments. It was clear that the <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio,</b> thus, was affected by the water temperature within those ranges. Furthermore, a negative relationships between <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio</b> and population density were also found in each experiment. Typical example on this relationship was obtained in Exp. II. Higher <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio,</b> 400 %, was indicated in the cases of lower density, 10 or 25 individuals per ml. However, when the rotifer population grew up to 1, 000 per ml, the <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased to 120 %. Interesting results, concerning the growth of Chlorella cells in the tank, were observed in the final experiment, Exp. III. The Chlorella cells, which have been taken up once by the rotifer at the middle part of the experiment, grew again in the tank at the end of the rearing. This might be due to the reproduction mechanisms of phytoplankton in the closed-system like an experimental microcosm. ...|$|E

Optimum reactant <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 60 and CH 4 partial pressure of 46. 85 kPa were obtained at 728 °C with corresponding conversions of 74. 84 % and 76. 49 % for CH 4 and CO 2, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{simulate}} direct selection for <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> in laying hens and to compare the prediction response of <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> and correlated responses on related traits with family selection and within-family selection methods. We randomly selected 10 dwarf brown laying hens from each of 60 dam families for a total of 600 hens. Egg weight and feed consumption were recorded daily during the experiment (27 - 33 weeks of age) and the <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> was calculated. The heritability estimated of the <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> was 0. 15 which indicates that direct selection for this trait was effective...|$|R
40|$|The 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 {{emission}} of Tb 3 + under UV-excitation in the 4 f 7 5 d band has been measured {{as a function}} of the Tb content in Y-Si-Al-O-N glasses. A strong increase of the 5 D 4 emission over the 5 D 3 emission was obsd. at high Tb 3 + contents. This increase can be attributed to cross-relaxation between two neighboring Tb 3 + ions. The <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio</b> of the 5 D 3 and 5 D 4 levels (. apprx. 0. 11) and the interaction distance for cross-relaxation (. apprx. 1. 43 nm) excludes the presence of Tb 3 + clusters, pairs or other abnormalities (like phase sepn.) in the Tb 3 + activated materials...|$|E
40|$|A robust polymer based and polyol {{mediated}} {{procedure to}} synthesize nanobimetallic particles has been modified to produce core–shell and alloy Ag/Pt nanoparticles with tunable properties. Novel three-dimensional (3 D) quasi nanocubes entangled in nanowebs were produced by rapid solution phase transformation with hot addition of absolute ethanol. The optical characterization showed extinction of plasmon resonance band occurring with incremental <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio</b> of Pt source in all cases. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high resolution {{transmission electron microscope}} (HRTEM) images revealed that the shape, size and size distribution of asprepared silver platinum nanoparticles depended on the stabilizer or capping agent, mole ratio of metal ion sources, temperature and time of reaction. Meanwhile, catalytic activity was highest in the reduction of p-nitrophenol {{in the presence of}} polyvinylpyrrolidone/diethylene glycol stabilized Ag/Pt nanoparticles...|$|E
30|$|AA monomer (3.062  g) was {{dissolved}} in 20  ml of methanol containing 0.12  g of chain-transfer agent, CMP, and 0.017  g of initiator, AIBN. After the chemicals were totally dissolved, {{the reaction was}} preceded for 3  h at 70 °C and purged with nitrogen, so that the conversion of AA monomers could reach 99.29 %. NIPAAm monomer (7.21  g) was {{dissolved in}} 20  ml methanol then introduced into the system for another 14  h and the tri-block copolymer P(AA-b-NIPAAm-b-AA) solution was obtained. The solution was first dialyzed with methanol so as to remove unreacted monomers, and then vacuum-dried at room temperature. Therefore, the P(AA-b-NIPAAm-b-AA) copolymer, A 100 N 150, was collected. AxNy represents the mole <b>feeding</b> <b>ratio</b> of x mole of AA and y mole of NIPAAm monomers to chain transfer agent (CTA) molecules.|$|E
30|$|To {{induce a}} {{specific}} anti-glioma immune response, DCs must {{be exposed to}} glioma antigens. The antigen {{used in the study}} was a peptide (ELTLGEFLKL, termed Ag) from the protein survivin, which is widely expressed in malignant gliomas [20 – 22]. Survivin {{is a member of the}} inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, which can regulate two important cellular processes: it inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation. Hence, survivin expression is generally associated with poor prognosis [30, 31]. The peptide ELTLGEFLKL can bind to HLA-A* 0201, the most common human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotype, and stimulate DCs to generate CD 8 + immune responses against glioma cells [20 – 22, 26]. Thus, the peptide was adopted in this study, mixed with GO at various <b>feed</b> <b>ratios,</b> and evaluated for its capability to induce a DC-mediated anti-glioma immune response.The amount of Ag loaded on GO nanosheets was assessed in this study. The Ag/GO <b>feed</b> <b>ratios</b> varied from 0.2 to 12.5. The Ag peptide and GO nanosheets were mixed under sonication for 30  min and then shaken for an additional hour. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed twice. The peptide amount in the supernatants was measured using a standard bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. As shown in Figure  1 C, the amount of the Ag peptides that were loaded onto 1  μg GO increased from 0.18  μg to nearly 1  μg with increasing Ag/GO <b>feed</b> <b>ratios.</b> At the Ag/GO <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3 : 1, the amount of peptide loaded on GO saturated at about 1  μg/ 1  μg.|$|R
40|$|Light cycle oil (LCO), an oil product {{containing}} valuable {{light and}} aromatic hydrocarbons, {{can have the}} characteristics of a good diesel fuel blending component, if first has been upgraded. In the context of ongoing research towards a better LCO quality, the focus is on how the extraction of LCO is affected by solvent, temperature and solvent to <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> variation. The solvents used were acetonitrile (ACN) and its water and methanol mixtures. The pure ACN system was extracted at 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C, in 1, 1. 5, and 2. 5 solvent to <b>feed</b> <b>ratios.</b> The efficiencies of the extractions were evaluated by comparing the yield of the extracted products (raffinate and extract) and their heteroatom content (S and N). The compositional analysis of the extraction products was assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The yield of raffinate product found to increase with increased water content in the solvent, while it was invariant in the presence of MeOH. FT-IR analysis showed a more pronounced effect by the solvent to <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> increase than the temperature effect towards a better raffinate quality, verified by the yields and the densities of the raffinates. GC-MS analysis data confirmed the latter, were the distribution patterns of hydrocarbons and aromatics in the raffinate product showed increase of the n-alkanes and decrease of the aromatic compounds as the solvent to <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> increased. The extraction process can be optimized in order to achieve the highest possible raffinate yield with satisfactory properties...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} of hydrogen rich syngas production by CO 2 reforming of methane over Co/Pr 2 O 3 catalyst. The Co/Pr 2 O 3 catalyst was synthesized via wet-impregnation method and characterized for physicochemical properties by TGA, XRD, BET, H 2 -TPR, FESEM, EDX, and FTIR. The CO 2 reforming of methane over the as-synthesized catalyst was studied in a tubular stainless steel fixed-bed reactor at <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> ranged 0. 1 – 1. 0, temperature ranged 923 – 1023 K, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 30, 000 h- 1 under atmospheric pressure condition. The catalyst activity studies showed {{that the increase in}} the reaction temperature from 923 to 1023 K and <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> from 0. 1 to 1. 0 resulted in a corresponding increase in the reactant’s conversion and the product’s yields. At 1023 K and <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 0, the activity of the Co/Pr 2 O 3 catalyst climaxed with CH 4 and CO 2 conversions of 41. 49 and 42. 36 %. Moreover, the catalyst activity at 1023 K and <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 0 resulted in the production of H 2 and CO yields of 40. 7 and 40. 90 %,respectively. The syngas produced was estimated to have H 2 :CO ratio of 0. 995, making it suitable as chemical building blocks for the production of oxygenated fuel and other value-added chemicals. The used Co/Pr 2 O 3 catalyst which was characterized by TPO, XRD, and SEM-EDX show some evidence of carbon formation and deposition on its surface...|$|R
