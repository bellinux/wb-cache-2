50|$|Ceramic {{sculptor}} Waylande Gregory created The <b>Fountain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Atom,</b> which {{displayed the}} largest ceramic sculptures in modern times. It included the four Elements, each measuring 72 in high and each weighing over a ton. There were also eight electrons, which were illustrated in Life Magazine (March 1939). Gregory also created two exhibitions featuring his ceramic sculptures for the General Motors Building, American Imports and American Exports.|$|R
50|$|Waylande Desantis Gregory (1905 Baxter Springs, Kansas - 1971, New Jersey) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} and prolific American art-deco ceramics sculptors of the early 20th century. His groundbreaking techniques enabled him to create monumental ceramic sculpture, such as the <b>Fountain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Atoms</b> and Light Dispelling Darkness, which had hitherto not been possible. He also developed revolutionary glazing and processing methods, and was a seminal figure in the studio glass movement.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the first atom {{interferometer}} based on Bragg diffraction in a <b>fountain</b> <b>of</b> alkaline-earth <b>atoms,</b> namely ^ 88 Sr. We demonstrate large momentum transfer to the atoms up to eight photon recoils {{and the use of}} the interferometer as a gravimeter with a sensitivity δ g/g= 4 × 10 ^- 8. Thanks to the special characteristics <b>of</b> strontium <b>atoms</b> for precision measurements, this result opens a new way for experiments in fundamental and applied physics.

40|$|In {{connection}} with experiments aiming at {{the improvement of}} the cesium atomic beam clock by means <b>of</b> a <b>fountain</b> <b>of</b> laser-cooled cesium <b>atoms,</b> we present expressions for the line shift and line broadening due to collisions between cesium atoms. The coherent collision cross sections occurring in these expressions are calculated by means of the coupled-channels method. The magnitude of the calculated shift implies that spin-exchange collisions are an important factor in limiting the anticipated accuracy of a future cesium <b>fountain</b> clock and <b>of</b> other intended <b>fountain</b> experiments...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fountain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Atom</b> {{was made}} for the 1939 New York World's Fair. It {{features}} the classical four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, surrounded by eight electrons (four male and four female, similar to putti). Gregory described the electrons as “elemental little savages of boundless electrical energy, dancing {{to the rhythm of}} sculptured bolts of lightning-like flashes in brilliant colored glazes, their buoyant shaped bodies of richly modeled terracotta clays in warm colors”. The four elements were grouped around illuminated tubes of glass which were topped by a flame, and carried water at the top <b>of</b> the <b>fountain.</b> Pictures <b>of</b> the maquette for Earth and one of the electrons have been published. Also at the Fair, for the General Motors Building, designed by industrial designer, Norman Bel Geddes, Gregory created two sculptural groupings, American Imports and Exports. He also executed ceramic sculptural works for the United States Building, where he worked with the building's designer, the well-known industrial designer, Walter Dorwin Teague.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrostatic}} lens with three focusing elements in an alternating-gradient configuration {{is used to}} focus a <b>fountain</b> <b>of</b> cesium <b>atoms</b> in their ground (strong-field-seeking) state. The lens electrodes are shaped to produce only sextupole plus dipole equipotentials which avoids adding the unnecessary nonlinear forces present in cylindrical lenses. Defocusing between lenses is greatly reduced by having all of the main electric fields point {{in the same direction}} and be of nearly equal magnitude. The addition of the third lens gave us better control of the focusing strength in the two transverse planes and allowed focusing of the beam to half the image size in both planes. The beam envelope was calculated for lens voltages selected to produced specific focusing properties. The calculations, starting from first principles, were compared with measured beam sizes and found to be in good agreement. Application to fountain experiments, atomic clocks, and focusing polar molecules in strong-field-seeking states is discussed. Comment: 8 pages 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the primary {{frequency}} standard now under construction at the Observatoire de Neuchatel (ON). The design {{is based on a}} continuous <b>fountain</b> <b>of</b> laser-cooled cesium <b>atoms,</b> which combines two advantages: the negligible contribution of collisions to the inaccuracy and the absence of stability degradation caused by aliasing effects encountered in pulsed operation. The design is reviewed with special emphasis on the specific features <b>of</b> a continuous <b>fountain,</b> namely the source, the microwave cavity (TE 021 mode), and the microwave modulation scheme. The possible sources of frequency biases and their expected contributions to the error budget are discussed. Based on present data, an accuracy in the low 10 - 15 range and a short-term stability of 7 • 10 - 14 are attainable simultaneously under the same operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{frequency}} standard {{based on an}} atomic <b>fountain</b> <b>of</b> cesium <b>atoms</b> may have an accuracy of 10 (exp - 16) due to longer interaction times and smaller anticipated systematic errors. All of the known systematic effects that now limit {{the accuracy of the}} Cs {{frequency standard}} increase either linearly or as some higher power <b>of</b> the <b>atom's</b> velocity. The one systematic frequency shift which is dramatically different is the frequency shift due to the collisions between the laser cooled atoms. At a temperature of a few micro-K, the de Broglie wavelength (lambda(sub deB) = h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum <b>of</b> the <b>atom)</b> is much larger than the scale of the interatomic potential. Under these conditions the collision cross sections can be as large as (lambda(sub deB) (sup 2)) /Pi and the frequency shift due to these collisions was recently calculated. In our Cs atomic fountain, we laser cooled and trapped 10 (exp 10) Cs atoms in 0. 4 s. By shifting the frequencies of the laser beams, the atoms were launched upwards at 2. 5 m/s and a fraction <b>of</b> the <b>atoms</b> were optically pumped into the F= 3 ground state. The unwanted atoms in the F= 4 ground state were removed from the fountain with radiation pressure from a laser beam tuned to excite only those atoms. The Cs atoms in the F= 3 state traveled ballistically upwards, were excited by the microwave cavity, and then returned back through the same cavity in the atomic fountain configuration. By varying the cold atom density, a density dependent shift of - 12. 9 +/- 0. 7 mHz or - 1. 4 x 10 - 12 for an average <b>fountain</b> density <b>of</b> (2. 7 +/- 1. 5) 10 (exp 9) atoms/cm(sup 3) was measured...|$|R

5000|$|The {{gap in the}} {{provenance}} <b>of</b> The <b>Fountain</b> <b>of</b> Indolence between 1834 and 1882 lends {{credence to}} the theory that it is identical with The <b>Fountain</b> <b>of</b> Fallacy, a painting which Turner exhibited at the British Institution in 1839, accompanied by four lines from his own poem entitled Fallacies of Hope.
