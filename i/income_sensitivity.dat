40|$|This paper explores {{contractual}} {{features of}} housing finance and uses data from international housing markets to provide evidence supporting the “financial accelerator” (Bernanke et al. 1996, 1999). Among households whose housing demand is {{constrained by the}} availability of collateral, those who can borrow against a larger fraction of the housing value (achieve higher loan-to-value, or LTV ratio) have more procyclical debt capacity. This procyclicality in borrowing capacity {{is at the heart}} of the mechanism underlying the financial accelerator. Our empirical strategy uses international variation in maximum LTV ratios to show that housing prices as well as demand for new mortgages are more sensitive to income shocks in countries with higher LTV ratios, consistent with the dynamics of a collateral-based financial accelerator in household spending. We also find that the empirical relationship between maximum LTV ratios and <b>income</b> <b>sensitivities</b> is stronger in countries where housing prices are low relative to household income. Because collateral constraints are less likely to bind when housing is more expensive (an income constraint may bind instead), these latter results further suggest that a collateral-based accelerator is indeed behind the observed cross-country differences in <b>income</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the <b>income</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of food {{consumption}} in Beijing, China, using an original household survey data set collected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Design/methodology/approach - An Engel curve model is fit to the household data of nine food categories and 35 food items, and both conditional and unconditional expenditure elasticities of demand are calculated and reported for the nine food groups and the 35 food items. Findings - Working's model fits the data well, and the elasticity estimates are all reasonable in terms of economic theory, size and signs. The results indicate a relative large range in <b>income</b> <b>sensitivity</b> among the nine food groups and 35 food items in response to changes in household food expenditure levels. Originality/value - The research analyzes unique and rich urban household survey data collected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is the most comprehensive analysis to date in terms of the number of food items studied for which expenditure elasticities are calculated. These elasticities may be used to study household food consumption patterns, to calculate caloric or nutrient elasticities, to study obesity in China, to study policy prescriptions in terms of taxes and subsidies on food, to infer welfare and affluence, and may be used as inputs into econometric models such as those used by the World Bank, IFPRI, and others...|$|E

In that model, the public forecaster, the National Weather Service (NWS), tries to achieve socially-efficient forecast accuracy operating under a per capita tax constraint; on the other hand, the private providers compete against each other for profits by choosing their optimal level of forecast accuracy in a monopolistically competitive market in which each private provider caters to a market niche while co-existing with the NWS. Empirically, we use a unique data set on daily maximum temperature forecasts for 704 U. S. cities and estimate the nearest neighbor matching and the state fixed effect (FE) models.

Theoretical {{framework}} for monetary transmission mechanism and hence for bank lending channel provides straightforward impacts of monetary policy on aggregate output, however {{there is a}} problem of identification for these impacts with aggregate data. Using a two-staged approach, the thesis studies the loan growth sensitivities of banks in the new regulatory system in Turkey and tries to identify a relationship between loan growth sensitivity and monetary tightening. There are six alternative sensitivities tested in the thesis: (1) Liquidity sensitivity of bank loan growth, (2) <b>Income</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of bank loan growth, (3) Liquidity sensitivity of bank loan growth with ownership type of banks controlled, (4) Liquidity sensitivity of large banks loan growth, (5) Liquidity sensitivity of small banks loan growth. (6) Liquidity sensitivity of bank loan growth with foreign affiliation of banks controlled. Results confirm that there exists a positive relationship between liquidity sensitivity of loan growth of Turkish banks and monetary policy shocks. Results also show that small banks are more liquidity dependent during contradictionary monetary policy periods than large banks. Besides the results parallel to empirical findings in the literature, characteristics of Turkish banking sector are included in the discussion such as the influence of BRSA on banks and the impacts of its regulations. Robustness of the tests are checked with additional econometric models. Hence, the findings suggest that there are evidences on bank lending channel in Turkey for the period 1998 - 2009.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers about traffic noise andproperty values. Their {{aim was to}} analyze the impact of trafficnoise on property values and to translate this effect into amonetary value. The method used was the hedonic technique inwhich {{the price of the}} property is assumed to be a function ofits attributes (e. g. living area and indoor quality). It ispossible to estimate implicit prices of all the attributes byregressing the property prices on housing and locationattributes. These implicit prices could then be used toestimate the price and <b>income</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the differentattributes. Essay 1, written together with my colleagues KickiBjörklund and Bo Söderberg, investigates thepurposes, data sources, presentations and methodologies ofpublished empirical works. Overall, these works exemplify goodscientific practice. Essay 2 is an analysis that estimates themarginal willingness-to-pay for a reduction in traffic noise. Noise is negatively capitalized into house values and theanalysis shows that a house relatively far away from a nearbyroad would sell for 15 - 20 percent more than a house near theroad. Essay 3 presents a methodology for estimating the priceand income elasticity of different housing attributes. Thisentails estimating a system of expenditure functions based onan additive preference function. The analysis indicates thathousing attributes are relatively insensitive to price andincome changes. Essay 4 discusses whether an investment innoise abatements was justified economically. By analyzing housesales that has occurred more than once, where some of thehouses were sold before and after the investment, it ispossible to estimate the effect of the traffic noise barrier.

40|$|Personal or {{household}} income predicts mortality risk, with each additional dollar of income conferring a slightly smaller {{decrease in the}} mortality risk. Regardless of whether levels of income inequality in a society impact on mortality rates over and above this individual-level association (i. e., the 'income inequality hypothesis'), the current consensus is that narrowing income distributions will probably improve overall health status and reduce socio-economic inequalities in health. Our objective was to quantify this impact in a national population using 1. 3 million 25 - 59 -year-old respondents to the New Zealand 1996 census followed-up for mortality over 3 years. We modelled 10 - 40 % shifts of everyone's income to the mean income (equivalent to 10 - 40 % reductions in the Gini coefficient). The strength of the income-mortality association was modelled using rate ratios from Poisson regression of mortality on the logarithm of equivalised {{household income}}, adjusted for confounders of age, marital status, education, car access, and neighbourhood socio-economic deprivation. Overall mortality reduced by 4 - 13 % following 10 - 40 % shifts in everyone's income, respectively. Inequalities in mortality reduced by 12 - 38 % following 10 - 40 % shifts in everyone's <b>income.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses suggested that halving {{the strength of the}} income-mortality association (i. e., assuming our multivariable estimate still overestimated the causal income-mortality association) would result in 2 - 6 % reductions in overall mortality and 6 - 19 % reductions in inequalities in mortality in this New Zealand setting. Many commentators have noted the non-linear association of income with mortality predicts that narrowing the income distribution will both reduce overall mortality rates and reduce inequalities in mortality. Quantifying such reductions can only be done with considerable uncertainty. Nevertheless, we tentatively suggest that the gains in overall mortality will be modest (although still potentially worthwhile from a policy perspective) and the reductions in inequalities in mortality will be more substantial.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Wheat {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} product in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The market class primarily grown {{in the region is}} Western White (WW) wheat. An important export market for PNW wheat producers is the Asian Pacific Rim (APR), due to its proximity and economic growth. Agronomic research has been conducted in recent years on developing a higher protein wheat in the PNW, known as Hard Red Winter (HRW). The justification of this research is that PNW wheat producers could perhaps become more competitive by diversifying toward HRW wheat. The higher protein levels of HRW allow it {{to be used as a}} meat complement, producing sandwich breads and hamburger buns. The lower protein levels of WW limit its final products to be cereal-based, such as noodles and crackers. Cross-sectional studies have indicated a change in dietary composition as economic development occurs. Countries seek improved and varied diets. They move away from cereal products such as noodles and rice, and consume more livestock products, especially meats. The objective of this research is to ascertain whether or not a higher protein wheat (HRW), which can be used as a meat complement, becomes more income sensitive than wheat with cereal-based end uses (WW) when economic development transpires. Import demand equations were estimated for a selected group of APR countries for the two wheat classes. The estimation was conducted using Ordinary Least Squares and Seemingly Unrelated Regression. The data period was from 1970 - 1971 to 1985 - 1986. Only one country, South Korea, produced significant results to permit comparison of the <b>income</b> <b>sensitivities</b> for the two wheats. Both HRW and WW possessed negative income coefficients, this would suggest that South Korean consumers perceived the final products from which the demand for the two wheats are derived as inferior goods. This means that HRW and WW wheat imports would fall as income rose for South Korea. However, the food self-sufficiency policy of the South Korean government was advanced as a probable reason for the negative coefficients rather than a diminishing marginal propensity to consume food items caused by income growth...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} household car ownership behaviours {{in seven}} countries characterised by different {{economic and cultural}} contexts: France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, UK and USA. An Age-Cohort-Period model is used {{to account for the}} effects of the stage in life cycle, of a differentiated access of successive generations to the car, and {{of the impact of the}} current economic context. It appears that differences between countries and regions can be attributed to three main factors: the history of car ownership development, the level of economic development, and population density. Thus, the USA, where car diffusion started earlier than elsewhere (before World War II), seems closer to saturation than the other countries. Indeed, the differences between cohorts are narrower and the sensitivity to changes in economic factors is weaker in the case of American households. As shown by long-term projections, this proximity to saturation should result in a lower growth of the car fleet in the USA compared to the rest of the countries considered. Besides, unlike the other countries, this evolution would essentially be due to an increase in the number of households. At the other extreme, Poland has the lowest car ownership levels, but these are continuing to grow and the gaps between successive generations do not stabilise, reflecting a catching up phenomenon after the period of transition from a rationed economy to a free market economy. The influence of economic affluence is also evidenced by a comparison between two Italian macro-regions: car ownership rates are lower, and <b>income</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is stronger, in the South and the Islands than in the North and the Centre. Although car diffusion reduced the gap between the two regions in terms of the proportion of motorised households, at least for the more recent generations, the South and the Islands are still lagging in terms of the level of car ownership per household. Closing this gap should depend on the evolution of incomes. Finally, the more densely populated countries (Japan and the Netherlands) record lower car ownership levels than the other industrialised countries...|$|E

The longevity risk is accelerated correspondingly. In this paper, housing reverse mortgage longevity risk securitization is introduced, and empirical analysis is conducted with the survivor bonds as the case. According to the longevity risk bond model, a sensitivity test is carried out on the survivor bonds by acknowledging the impact of mortality improvement on the investment income. This is seen to be of assistance {{for the design of}} future housing reverse mortgage longevity risk bonds. The main body of this paper consists of six parts. The first chapter is the introduction, covering a brief research background, research problems, assumptions and limitations. The second chapter is the literature review. The development of the longevity risk market, management method, securitization products, longevity risk, pricing model of longevity risk derivatives and optimal allocation design have been reviewed. The third chapter is the methodology including both qualitative and quantitative methods used in this study. The longevity risk bond type, structure and cash flow analysis of the current housing reverse mortgage loan is introduced with emphasis. The fourth chapter is the overview of the background to study, with housing reverse mortgage, longevity risk securitization and the securitization of the housing reverse mortgage loan. Secondly, the meaning of longevity risk and mortality risk is illustrated broadly. The fifth chapter is the empirical analysis of the impact of housing reverse mortgage loan longevity risk bond on the investment <b>income.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis is conducted for the natural mortality and average housing price growth rate. The sixth chapter is the conclusion. It summarizes the main contribution, managerial conclusions, and puts forward some new prospects on future researches.

Methods 					We used price elasticity estimates to calculate the effect of a 10 % SSB tax on SSB consumption. SSBs were assumed to have an own-price elasticity of &# 8722; 0. 9 and we assumed a tax pass-on rate to consumers of 90 %. Baseline SSB consumption and obesity prevalence, by age, sex and income-group, for Ireland were taken from the 2007 Survey on Lifestyle and Attitude to Nutrition.

Results 					We estimate that a 10 % tax on SSBs will result in a mean reduction in energy intake of 2. 1 &# 160;kcal/person/day. After adjustment for self-reported data, the 10 % tax is predicted to reduce the percentage of the obese adult population (body mass index [BMI] &# 8805; 30 &# 160;kg/m 2) by 1. 3 %, equating to 9, 900 adults (95 % credible intervals: 7, 750 to 12, 940), and the overweight or obese population (BMI&# 8201;&# 8805;&# 8201; 25 &# 160;kg/m 2) by 0. 7 %, or 14, 380 adults (9, 790 to 17, 820). Reductions in obesity are similar for men (1. 2 %) and women (1. 3 %), and similar for each income group (between 1. 1 % and 1. 4 % across income groups).

Reductions in obesity are similar for men (1. 2 %) and women (1. 3 %), and similar for each income group (between 1. 1 % and 1. 4 % across income groups). Reductions in obesity are greater in young adults than older adults (e. g. 2. 9 % in adults aged 18 - 24 years vs 0. 6 % in adults aged 65 years and over). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a tax on SSBs in Ireland would have a small but meaningful effect on obesity. While such a tax would be perceived as affecting the whole population, from a health prospective the tax will predominantly affect younger adults who are the main consumers of SSBs...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{construct}} a model of passenger cars demand and estimate it using data on new car registrations from the Czech Republic. The constructed model takes into account factors affecting not only the demand, but also the supply, as both of these variables form a simultaneous equations system. In order to estimate the model consistently, the econometric theory of simultaneous equations model is presented. At first the basic notations are introduced, the inconsistency of ordinary least squares estimates is proved and consistent methods of estimation are described, notably the two stage least squares and the indirect least squares methods. Observation of the data suggests that new passenger cars registrations in the Czech Republic were influenced by a specific taxation policy, which up to April 2009 did not allow the value added tax deduction in case of passenger cars. A large proportion of passenger cars were therefore registered as light utility vehicles. This fact {{has to be taken}} into account when studying the passenger cars demand. Results of the estimation by the two stage least squares method showed that the demand for new passenger in the Czech Republic is elastic in price and <b>income.</b> Significant <b>sensitivity</b> of the demand was observed also with respect to used cars [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the outlook}} for oil prices remains uncertain, this paper {{develops}} a method to assess which areas of England would be most vulnerable to future motor fuel price increases. Building on previous research, we define and operationalise three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure (the cost burden of motor fuel), <b>sensitivity</b> (<b>income)</b> and adaptive capacity (accessibility with modes alternative to the car). We exploit unique data sets available in England, including the ‘MOT’ vehicle inspection data and DfT Accessibility Statistics. This allows us to map vulnerability to fuel price increases at a spatially disaggregated level (Lower-layer Super Output Areas), taking into account motor-fuel expenditure for all travel purposes, {{and the ability of}} households to shift to other modes of travel. This is an advancement on the ‘oil vulnerability’ indices developed in previous international research...|$|R
40|$|In {{the midst}} of rapid {{integration}} and globalization, multinational firms still face tax systems that differ among countries, and these differences {{have the potential to}} affect major investment and financing decisions. This research covers a wide range of topics, including the impact of indirect taxes as well as of corporate <b>income</b> taxes, the <b>sensitivity</b> of financing decisions to tax rates, the effects of taxes on repatriation policies, the demand for, and impact of, tax havens, and the use of indirect ownership as a means of avoiding taxes. The behavior of US multinational firms as revealed by the evidence collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis surveys consistently demonstrates that taxes {{play a critical role in}} shaping the volume and location of foreign investment, the financing of foreign investment, and the organizational structures of multinationals firms...|$|R
40|$|The Maximum Tax on Personal Service Income was {{intended}} to reduce the maximum marginal tax rate on earned income to 50 percent. In general it did not achieve this result, although it did lower marginal tax rates on both earned and unearned income. This paper considers the effect of different tax rate structures on the total tax revenue collected from high <b>income</b> taxpayers. The <b>sensitivity</b> of tax avoidance practices to marginal tax rates is estimated using four different specifications. These estimates are then combined with plausible parameter values for income and substitution effects in the supply of labor to produce a range of elasticities of taxable income with respect to tax rates. The NBER Taxsim model is then used to estimate the effects of different rate structures on tax revenue. ...|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s, {{a number}} of states {{operated}} welfare-to-work programs on a demonstration basis and subjected these demonstrations to formal cost/benefit evaluations. This paper examines the evaluators' methods and summarizes and interprets their findings. Cost/benefit analysis of welfare-to-work programs can provide a rough but useful assessment of a program's efficiency in reducing welfare caseloads. But the evaluation results are more difficult to interpret than they may appear to be. For example, the results typically imply that such programs produce small net gains to society when gains and losses are measured in terms of net <b>income.</b> However, a <b>sensitivity</b> analysis measuring net gains and losses to welfare recipients in terms of changes in net utility suggests that an important modification to the evaluators' methodology might well reverse this finding in many instances.
