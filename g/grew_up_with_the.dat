At one time the Poodle was a longer-coated dog, as is one variety of the Portuguese Water Dog.

In early times, Celtiberians migrated from lands which now belong to southwestern Germany.

25|$|Like many Northern {{cities that}} <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Revolution, Minneapolis and St. Paul {{experienced}} shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, {{especially in the}} 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 60s and 70s came population decline in the central city areas, white flight to suburbs, and, {{in the summer of}} 1967, race riots on Minneapolis's North Side. By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and St. Paul were frequently cited as former Rust Belt cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.|$|E

It is also claimed that she <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Krüdener family, where the father, Baron Krüdener, was his uncle; however {{it is more likely}} that she served the Krüdener family later as a governess.

25|$|Most of the {{research}} into military brats has been conducted on the long-term effects on adults who grew up during the Cold War and also during the Vietnam and Korean wars. As the Cold War came to an end, {{the role of the}} United States Armed Forces changed.

To this end, the military started to change the living standards that most Cold War brats <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> demographics of the military changed.

25|$|According to the Book of Exodus, Moses {{was born}} in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were {{increasing}} in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed {{in order to reduce the}} population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God).|$|E

500|$|The author {{describes}} his experiences {{growing up in}} a church that, despite preaching about grace, did not demonstrate it to others; the church excluded African Americans, dismissed other Christians on the basis of slightly different beliefs, and depicted God as tyrannical and vengeful. Yancey writes, [...] "I <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strong impression that a person became spiritual by attending to grey-area rules," [...] and that church was a place to look good rather than be honest. He contrasts the teachings of early Christians Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo on the subject of grace, with Pelagius believing that divine grace must be earned and Augustine contending that grace is a gift that cannot be earned. Pelagius was declared a heretic by his peers; Augustine was canonized. According to Yancey, many Christians follow Pelagius's teaching on grace during the week but espouse Augustine's on Sunday.|$|E
500|$|Indian Head cents {{were popular}} among coin {{collectors}} {{even in the}} half-century when they were produced; since then, {{with the growth of}} the hobby, interest has increased. [...] The 1930s introduction of inexpensive coin albums to house the series and encourage collectors to seek a complete set came {{at a time when the}} bronze version of the Indian Head cent was still common in pocket change. They were not widely studied until the 1960s; numismatic writer Tom DeLorey, in his introduction to Snow's book, ascribes this to prejudice among numismatists who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indian Head cent as a common circulation piece. He notes that the 1960 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (commonly, the Red Book) listed only four dates for which there were varieties, one of which, the overdate 1869/68 was in error, as the final digit was actually over another 9.

According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something."
