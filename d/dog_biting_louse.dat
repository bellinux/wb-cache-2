"Invasion of the Bite Lice" [...] (1) - The Dragozaur's base {{begins to}} crumble without {{a supply of}} life force, and Diamond Ryugu sends Drago Wing to Earth to command an army of <b>bite</b> <b>lice.</b> At the same time, Rick visits the Dinotarium {{for the first time}} while staying over at Kaito's home. Soon, a {{miniature}} Drago Wing and his <b>bite</b> <b>lice</b> army invade the Earth, covering it with Diamond Ryugu's dark energy. The Dino Knights are disabled, and so the kids venture out to observe what is going on. The <b>bite</b> <b>lice</b> are deployed and begin covering everything in sight, terrorizing the city's inhabitants, as Diamond Ryugu begins a search for something important to her on Earth. Rick summons the Cerasaur brothers to help fight the <b>bite</b> <b>lice,</b> and after Dino Ictheo and the Dino Weapons join the fray, discover that the lice are afraid of chickens, they are all able to drive the lice away. Unfortunately, their victory is short-lived as Diamond Ryugu finds and kidnaps Dino Rhamph, for use in a giant planet-killer life force extractor. All of the assembled Dino Knights then begin a final desperate attack on Ryugu and her device.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDespite the {{widespread}} use of police dogs, there is very little objective medical information about the injuries they cause when they bite. Our aim was to statistically describe police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries. MethodsWe described police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries by comparing them with domestic (non-police) <b>dog</b> <b>bites.</b> We retrospectively analyzed their demographic and specific injury data drawn from their medical records. The police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims came from the Los Angeles Police Department K 9 Unit from 1988 to 1990. The domestic <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims came from King-Drew Medical Center, an inner-city public hospital from 1989 to 1996. All of the police dog victims’ medical records that could be located were included (595 out of 957). All domestic <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims that arrived for treatment were included (n= 1109). ResultsPolice <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims were usually bitten multiple times, whilst domestic bite victims were not. Police <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims were bitten more often in the head, neck, chest and flank. They were hospitalised more often, underwent more operations and had more invasive diagnostic tests. ConclusionsPolice <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries appeared to be more serious than victims of domestic <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> victims. The reasons for the differences were related to the types of dogs selected and their special training...|$|R

40|$|Published Online First 27 January 2017 INTRODUCTION: Preventing <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> is an {{intractable}} problem {{given the}} complex <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injury environment. Desexing of dogs {{has the opportunity}} of creating a safer injury environment, given the potential links between desexing and behaviour change in dogs. METHODS: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted to examine the evidence for desexing of dogs to reduce <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> risk within a population health paradigm. Medline and CAB Abstracts were searched for studies that reported data on the association of dog neuter status with the risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bite.</b> All definitions of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> were included and all empirical studies were included in the review, limited to those published in English. Quality appraisal and data extraction were based on the 2013 evidence-based practice and critical appraisal tool from the University of Auckland. RESULTS: Five out of six observational studies, from four study populations found evidence that intact dogs were associated with an increased risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> compared with desexed dogs. The effect sizes ranged across the studies and given the heterogeneity of the studies no single effect size on the association between desexing and <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> risk could be estimated. CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence that desexing dogs is associated with a reduced risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bite,</b> although the studies reflect association and may not be causal. Although recent publications have suggested desexing is associated with health and behavioural costs in some breeds, population level evidence supports desexed dogs having a longer lifespan, and being less likely to wander with the added benefit of reducing unwanted litters. Thus, mandatory desexing presents a possible opportunity for prevention of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> expanding <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> prevention beyond an education-only approach.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{patterns and}} distributions in {{the occurrence of}} <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> incidents in El Paso County. The data analyzed consisted of reports submitted to the City of El Paso Animal Services Division during the years 2009 - 2011. ^ Methods: The authors reviewed the <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> reports received by the City of El Paso Animal Services for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011. The reports are limited to incidents involving domestic dogs, (Canis familiaris), which resulted in skin breaks, and occurring {{within the limits of}} El Paso County and its municipalities. The authors, organized the data by person, time and place, and calculated and compared rates of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> by populations at risk. ^ Results: There were 2, 892 <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> reported during 2009 - 2011 for a rate of 120 <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> per 100, 000 persons-years. Forty-percent of the bites were to the upper extremities, and 6. 7 % were classified as severe. The risk of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> to children was twice that of older adults. <b>Dog</b> <b>bites</b> seem to occur disproportionately at 8 am. Seventy five (75 %) percent of the <b>bites</b> were from <b>dogs</b> without documented vaccination status and therefore considered unvaccinated against rabies. Seventeen census tracts experienced rates at least twice the incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites.</b> ^ Conclusion: We found that most of the dog-biting dogs were unvaccinated. Reports of canine rabies in neighboring Mexico call for the increase of dog rabies vaccination. High-risk areas were identified and could be targeted for preventive interventions. Although Animal Services data severely underestimates the incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites,</b> it is sensitive to detect patterns of occurrence and is readily available for local decision-making. ...|$|R

40|$|Background:. Incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> {{continues}} to rise among the pediatric population {{and serves as a}} public health threat for the well-being of children. Plastic surgeons are at the forefront of initial management and eventual outcome of these devastating injuries. This study set out to determine the nature of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries treated over a 3 -year period at a large level 1 pediatric trauma center. Methods:. A retrospective review of emergency room records of all pediatric patients (age, 0 – 18 years old) who sustained <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> between January 2012 and December 2014 were gathered. All details about age of patient, location and severity of <b>dog</b> <b>bites,</b> type of <b>dog</b> breed, antibiotics given, and emergency versus operative treatment were recorded and analyzed. Results:. One hundred eight patients aged 5 months to 18 years old were treated in the emergency department after suffering <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries during the study period. The highest incidence of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> occurred in preschool children. The mean age for patients who required operative repair was lower than the mean age for patients who underwent primary closure in the emergency department.

METHODS: Data on <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> were gathered as part of a 1994 national telephone survey of 5, 238 randomly dialed households. Data were weighted to provide national estimates. RESULTS: The weighted total number of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> was 4, 494, 083 (estimated incidence = 18 / 1, 000 population); of these, 756, 701 persons sustained bites necessitating medical attention (incidence rate = 3 / 1, 000).
