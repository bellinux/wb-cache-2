So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E

It was almost a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> suicide mission or something. And obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? So {{we had to have}} some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E

Asked about claims that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election through hacking, Chomsky said: [...] "It’s possible, but it’s a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been interfering with, and undermining, elections {{all over the world}} for decades and is proud of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour was}} {{formally}} announced on March 1, 2015 on Madonna's official website. Titled Rebel Heart Tour, it was initially {{scheduled to begin}} on August 29, 2015, from Miami and continue throughout Europe and end on December 20, 2015, in Glasgow, Scotland. Rebel Heart Tour was led by Live Nation Entertainment's Global Touring Division, helmed by Arthur Fogel. It was Madonna's fifth collaboration with Live Nation. Fogel commented that the leak had helped in bring more attention to Madonna's music {{and it was a}} positive scenario for the world tour. [...] "It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> how it all came about, but it certainly hasn't been a negative in terms of getting people engaged with the new music. Anything that helps put it out there is good, even if it happens in a weird way", he concluded.|$|E

Produced almost solely by Gambino (with help from Community composer Ludwig Goransson), {{it seems as if}} BTI is the first rap album this year that is completely confident in what it is." [...] Lizzie Plaugic of CMJ stated in a mixed review, [...] "Because The Internet is not easily dismissible, because it's so self-awarely annoying. It trips over its own feet hoping the cool kids will roll their eyes at it, because behind those eye rolls is a jealousy that Gambino can fall with such nonchalance. Even though Because The Internet is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> and kind of a bummer, it does show Glover's range as a musician." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork stated, [...] "With Gambino's wordplay ping-ponging from caustic wit to message board snark, the enduring strength of the album is its production. Gambino and Göransson handle the bulk of it here alongside usual suspect Stefan Ponce and alley oops from twin act Christian Rich and Flying Lotus associate Thundercat. Because the Internets production team not only ensures the sounds are pretty, spacey, and jarring in all the right places, but they also effortlessly nail the album's Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz synchronicity gambit." ...|$|E

60|$|I did {{not reflect}} then, as I have since and often, how great was the {{knowledge}} and resource Tom practised that day. Our feeling for him (Polly Ann's and mine) fell little short of worship. In company ill at ease, in the forest he became silent and masterful--an unerring woodsman, capable of meeting the Indian on his own footing. And, strangest thought of all, he and many I could name who went into Kentucky, had escaped, by a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> fate, being born {{in the north of}} Ireland. This was so of Andrew Jackson himself.|$|E
60|$|Judged by {{the great}} average of ideals and {{conventional}} standards of life, Dick Gale was a starved, lonely, suffering, miserable wretch. But in his case the judgment would have hit only externals, would have missed the vital inner truth. For Gale was happy with a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange,</b> wild glory in the privations, the pains, the perils, and the silence and solitude to be endured on this desert land. In the past {{he had not been}} of any use to himself or others; and he had never know {{what it meant to be}} hungry, cold, tired, lonely. He had never worked for anything. The needs of the day had been provided, and to-morrow and the future looked the same. Danger, peril, toil--these had been words read in books and papers.|$|E

60|$|Upon {{the morning}} of the Fourth, I looked for the Rube at the hotel, but could not find him. He did not show up at the grounds when the other boys did, and I began to worry. It was the Rube's turn to pitch and we were neck and neck with Buffalo for first place. If we won both games we would go ahead of our rivals. So I was all on edge, and kept going to the dressing-room to see if the Rube had arrived. He came, finally, when all the boys were dressed, and about to go out for practice. He had on a new suit, a {{tailor-made}} suit at that, and he looked fine. There was about him a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> radiance. He stated simply that he had arrived late because he had just been married. Before congratulations were out of our mouths, he turned to me.|$|E

I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very {{impatient}} and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when {{he is in a}} tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to.

60|$|It {{seemed so}} {{strange to me}} to be talking here in New Orleans, in this little Spanish house, with a French vicomtesse brought up near the court of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette; nay, with Helene de St. Gre, whose {{portrait}} had twice come into my life by a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> fatality (and was at that moment in my pocket), that I could scarce maintain my self-possession in her presence. I had given the portrait, too, attributes and a character, and I found myself watching the lady with a breathless interest lest she should fail in any of these. In the intimacy of the little room I felt as if I had known her always, and again, that she was as distant from me and my life as the court from which she had come. I found myself glancing continually at her face, on which the candle-light shone. The Vicomtesse might have been four and twenty. Save for the soberer gown she wore, she seemed scarce older than the young girl in the miniature who had the presence of a woman of the world. Suddenly I discovered with a flush that she was looking at me intently, without embarrassment, but with an expression that seemed to hint of humor in the situation. To my astonishment, she laughed a little.|$|E

She was ashamed to tell Miss Aldclyffe her terrors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{underground}} {{movement was}} also symbolised {{by the use}} of drugs. The types of drugs used were varied and in many cases the names and effects were unknown as The Deviants/Pink Fairies member Russell Hunter, working at International Times (part of the underground press at the time), recalled. [...] "People used to send in all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> drugs and things, pills and powders, stuff to smoke and that.

5000|$|On the {{production}} of the drum and bass sound of the album, Bowie said, [...] "Unlike most drum and bass things, we didn't just take parts from other people's records and sample them. On the snare drum stuff, Zac Alford went away and did his own loops and worked out all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> timings and rhythms. Then we speeded those up to your regular 160 beats per minute. That's very much how we treat the album. We kept all sampling in-house and created our own soundscape in a way." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{remembered that}} they had not always been sad, for I had known her in her full bloom--an {{imposing}} woman, her eyes sparkling with intense fire and passion, who, despite her coarse features and dark skin, had a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> wild beauty which attracted men. Unhappily she placed her affections on the wrong person, a dashing young gaucho who, albeit landless and poor in cattle, made a brave appearance, especially when mounted and when man and horse glittered with silver ornaments. I recalled how one of my last sights of her had been on a Sunday morning in summer when I had ridden to a spot on the plain where it was overgrown with giant thistles, standing about ten feet high, in full flower and filling the hot air with their perfume. There, in a small open grassy space I had dismounted to watch a hawk, in hopes of finding its nest concealed somewhere among the thistles close by. And presently two persons came at a swift gallop by the narrow path through the thistles, and bursting out into that small open spot I saw that it was Cipriana, in a white dress, on a big bay horse, and her lover, who was leading the way. Catching sight of me they threw me a [...] "Good morning" [...] and galloped on, laughing gaily at the unexpected encounter. I thought that in her white dress, with the hot sun shining on her, her face flushed with excitement, on her big spirited horse, she looked splendid that morning.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Roxy did not {{interrupt}} her meditations. The {{nature of}} her profession had rendered her familiar with all the changing mental and physical phenomena that attend the development of disease and the gradual loosening of the silver cords of a present life. Certain well-understood phrases everywhere current among {{the mass of the}} people in New England, strikingly tell of the deep foundations of religious earnestness on which its daily life is built. [...] "A triumphant death" [...] was a matter often casually spoken of among the records of the neighborhood; and Miss Roxy felt that there was a vague and solemn charm about its approach. Yet the soul of the gray, dry woman was hot within her, for the conversation of the morning had probed depths in her own nature of whose existence she had never before been so conscious. The roughest and most matter-of-fact minds have a craving for the ideal somewhere; and often this craving, forbidden by uncomeliness and ungenial surroundings from having any personal history of its own, attaches itself to the fortune of some other one in a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> disinterestedness. Some one young and beautiful is to live the life denied to them--to be the poem and the romance; it is the young mistress of the poor black slave--the pretty sister of the homely old spinster--or the clever son of the consciously ill-educated father. Something of this unconscious personal investment had there been on the part of Miss Roxy in the nursling whose singular loveliness she had watched for so many years, and on whose fair virgin orb she had marked the growing shadow of a fatal eclipse, and as she saw her glowing and serene, with that peculiar brightness that she felt came from no earthly presence or influence, she could scarcely keep the tears from her honest gray eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Henceforward Johnson had {{no longer}} to {{struggle}} with the evils of extreme poverty. A pension of £300 was granted to him, in 1762, by His Majesty. Before his acceptance of it, in {{answer to a question}} put by him to the Earl of Bute, in these words, [...] "Pray, my Lord, what am I to do for the pension?" [...] he was assured by that nobleman that it was not given him for any thing he was to do, but for what he had done. The definition he had given of the word pension, in his dictionary, that in England it was generally understood to mean pay, given to a state hireling, for treason to his country, raised some further scruples whether he ought himself to become a pensioner; but they were removed by the arguments, or the persuasion of Mr. Reynolds, to whom he had recourse for advice in this dilemma. What advice Reynolds would give him he must have known pretty well before-hand; but {{this was one of the}} many instances in which men, having first determined how to act, are willing to imagine that they are going for clearer information, where they in truth expect nothing but a confirmation of their own resolve. The liberality of the nation could not have been extended to one who had better deserved it. But he had a calamity yet more dreadful than poverty to encounter. The depression of his spirits was now become almost intolerable. [...] "I would have a limb amputated," [...] said he to Dr. Adams, [...] "to recover my spirits." [...] He was constantly tormented by harassing reflections on his inability to keep the many resolutions he had formed of leading a better life; and complained that a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> oblivion had overspread him, so that he did not know what was become of the past year, and that incidents and intelligence passed over him without leaving any impression.|$|E
40|$|Poltergeist {{accounts}} {{concern at}} least four <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>strange</b> spontaneous manifestations, such as burning of materials, failures of electric equipments, rapping noises and movements of objects. A simple analysis of phenomenology of these disturbances shows {{that they might have}} a common origin, that is, a reduction in strength of molecular bonds due to an enhancement in polarization of vacuum which decreases the actual electron charge. Arguments based on Prigogine' nonequilibrium thermodynamics are proposed, which show how transformations in brain of some pubescent childs or young womans might be the cause of these effects.
