2500|$|The only {{station on}} the Cut-Off at which {{mainline}} passenger trains would stop was Blairstown. [...] Blairstown {{was also the first}} stop on westbound trains where passengers were permitted to unboard (i.e. westbound passengers boarding and detraining east of Blaistown were required to use suburban train service instead). [...] This explains why Blairstown was the first stop listed on the <b>destination</b> <b>board</b> at the boarding gate at Hoboken for trains travelling via Scranton. [...] In later years, Blairstown had a somewhat unusual facet of operation: any trains arriving after the station agent went home for the night would automatically activate the station platform lights as the train entered the signal block. [...] This practice was abandoned after passenger service ended.|$|E
2500|$|Mel's exit storyline {{was linked}} to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit {{a few months after}} Steve's. She commented, [...] "Mel is devastated by Steve's death. She thinks that Phil caused it and rushes into the Vic and goes for him. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a {{necklace}} of black pearls on the day Steve dies and it breaks her heart. She knows Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He has been nothing but trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up." [...] In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell. After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as [...] "a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [...] one by one her friends desert her." [...] Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: [...] "When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is a glint in her eye as Mel looks at the <b>destination</b> <b>board</b> and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten." ...|$|E
