500|$|Keith {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song on his website in 2000. [...] "Initially, I said, 'Here's my title: [...] "You Never Loved Me Before, So <b>How</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?'" [...] It's one of my catch-phrases. A lot of people become successful after they've been told they won't ever be, so people can relate to this. It can be about an old flame or a boss or a teacher -whatever it means to each individual. It was a fun song to write." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith had {{originally}} recorded the song {{near the end}} of his contract with Mercury Records Nashville in the late 1990s. According to a 2005 interview with Billboard, Keith had the album <b>How</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?! completed, but label executives rejected the entire album except for two songs: [...] "Getcha Some" [...] and [...] "If a Man Answers", both of which were put on his 1999 Greatest Hits album. After he recorded two more songs which were also rejected, he asked to terminate his contract with Mercury, and purchased the rights to the rest of the album. Upon the album's release in late 1999, both the album and its lead single, [...] "When Love Fades", were performing poorly on the charts; as a result, Keith asked that [...] "When Love Fades" [...] be withdrawn as a single in favor of [...] "How Do You Like Me Now?!" [...] Keith stated that DreamWorks executives were [...] "scared to put it out", but within five days of Keith's request, [...] "When Love Fades" [...] was withdrawn and [...] "How Do You Like Me Now?!" [...] was released.|$|E
2500|$|Penniman was 18 when Ethan Allen, {{liberated from}} the Tower of London, {{returned}} to his native State. [...] "I should like," [...] said Penniman, one evening in a mixed company in her step-father's parlor, [...] "above all things to see this Mr. Allen, of whom we hear such incredible things." [...] This saying reached the ears of Allen, who soon after {{paid a visit to}} the house of Mr. Wall, and was introduced to Penniman. There was a mutual and agreeable surprise, both manifestly pleased with the tone of thought and conversation, which ran on with a natural flow, and developed traits of kindred sympathies of intellect and feeling. It was late in the evening before Mr. Allen rose. He had not failed to observe the interest his conversation had excited in Penniman. [...] "And now," [...] said he, as he stood erect before her, and was about to departâ€”" [...] and now, Miss Brush, allow me to ask, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> this Mr. Allen?'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} talk of {{indifferent}} themes," [...] said Ramage, a little fussily, [...] "until these interruptions of the service are over. Then--then we shall be together.... <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Tristan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, well, back again, eh? Say, this is fine! Have a fine trip? My, <b>you</b> look <b>like</b> a rose, Carol. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the coast, doc? Well, well, well! Where-all <b>did</b> <b>you</b> go?" ...|$|R
2500|$|By 5:30p.m., Averell, citing his {{exhausted}} men and horses, [...] "deemed it {{proper to}} withdraw." [...] He left two Confederate officers {{who had been}} wounded and captured by Averell's troops, a sack of coffee, and the following message: [...] "Dear Fitz, Here's your coffee. Here's your visit. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it?" [...] Some of his fellow officers believed that he lost his nerve, concerned {{about the presence of}} Jeb Stuart on the battlefield and, hearing the sound of railroad cars approaching, imagining the possibility of a Confederate infantry force pinning him against the river. The Union advance had covered 2 miles over more than 12 hours and resulted in 78 casualties (6 killed, 50 wounded, 22 missing). The Confederates lost 133 (11 dead, 88 wounded, 34 captured); 71 Confederate horses were killed and 12 were captured. The loss of the youthful Pelham, age 24, well respected by Robert E. Lee, Stuart, and many veterans of the Battle of Fredericksburg, was a shock. Stuart wrote after the battle, [...] "The gallant Pelhamso noble, so truewill be mourned by the nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Keith {{moved to}} DreamWorks Records' Nashville division, of which Stroud served as president. His first release for the label was [...] "When Love Fades", which {{also failed to}} make Top 40. Upon seeing the single's poor performance, Keith {{requested}} that it be withdrawn and replaced with [...] "How Do You Like Me Now?!", a song that he wrote with Chuck Cannon, and which had previously been turned down by Mercury. It also served as the title track to his first DreamWorks album, <b>How</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> Me Now?! The song spent five weeks at number 1 on the country charts, and became his first top 40 pop hit, with a number 31 peak on the Hot 100. It was also the top country song of 2000 according to the Billboard Year-End chart. The album, which was certified platinum, produced a Top 5 hit in [...] "Country Comes to Town" [...] and another number 1 in [...] "You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This". It was also his first album to feature songs co-written by Scotty Emerick, who would be a frequent collaborator of Keith's {{for the next several}} albums. Steve Huey wrote that this album [...] "had a rough, brash attitude that helped give Keith a stronger identity as a performer." [...] In 2001, Keith won the Academy of Country Music's Top Male Vocalist and Album of the Year awards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is what}} I {{hope and}} believe," [...] Rupert said. [...] "Well, Easton, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the Guards, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> campaigning? I see that you have given up white shirts, {{like the rest of}} us. I rather {{expected}} that if we did meet I should find that, in some miraculous way, you still contrived to get up immaculately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the girl, Agnes?" [...] she said, {{raising her}} voice. Agnes had fetched Charlie in, {{and they were}} looking {{together}} down into the street while their mother was talking to Guy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Sunday school?" [...] Marilla {{wanted to}} know when Anne came home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had {{discarded}} it in the lane, so Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{a pretty}} clear proposition, my friend; but then <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the meaning when <b>you</b> <b>did</b> get at it? or was that like some ponies, too {{difficult}} to catch, and, when caught, not worth the trouble?" ...|$|R
60|$|AND <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> my friend, Henrietta?' said Mr. Temple, as {{they drove}} home.|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the {{simplicity}} and tenderness of this pastoral? I think it pretty well.|$|E
6000|$|Thus a {{whole year}} passed, {{and when it was}} over the troll called him home, for he was now in his power like all the other animals. The troll then said some words to him which he did not understand, and the hare {{immediately}} became a human being again. 'Well, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to serve me?' said the troll, 'and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> being a hare?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{sorry for}} that," [...] said Sewell, {{with the general}} sympathy which Evans accused him of keeping on tap professionally. [...] "Well, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the looks of Willoughby Pastures {{compared}} with Boston? Rather quieter, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course. There {{was never}} anybody about Four Winds could touch her for looks. Did {{you ever see}} her hair? It reaches to her feet when she lets it down. But I meant <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Hist!' says I, {{slipping}} {{the rose}} between the bars. 'She sends you this. She bids you take courage. At nightfall two masked men {{brought it to}} the ruined chateau in the orange grove. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that goat hash, Barney?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Tudor, my boy,' said he, 'and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the {{clotted cream}} and the thick ankles of the stout Devonshire lasses?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Miss Brangwen,' she said, in her {{slightly}} whining, insinuating voice, 'and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> {{being back}} in the old place, then?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll learn a {{few more}} of the same kind before you're through," [...] Carnally drawled. [...] "But <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> your moccasins?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You think that's simple, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> I {{suppose you}} imagine that a girl enjoys that sort of thing? Oh, what's the use of talking about it? It's horrible, {{and no amount of}} arguing will make it {{anything}} else. Do let's change the subject. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Chicago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} about a flat," [...] she declared, [...] "which makes one horribly curious about one's neighbors--especially if one has never had any. All these closed doors may hide no end of interesting people, and I {{have never seen a}} soul go in or out. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> all this climbing?" ...|$|R
60|$|This, however, he {{also got}} used to, {{when he saw}} that they could never hit him, and in this way he flew about all that year, until the troll called him home again, said some strange words to him, and gave him his human shape again. 'Well, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> being a raven?' said the troll.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know the}} house of old, you recollect,' said I, 'and will find my way upstairs. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the law, Mr. Micawber?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Feeling without {{sufficient}} cause is, I should think.' And then, {{and in a}} tone of some archness, she said, 'And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> balls?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, my boy, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that?" [...] cried Andy, as, dancing around, {{he managed}} to land a {{slapping}} blow on Jack's bare shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she came}} back to the house, tired and dishevelled after her journey of exploration, Girdlestone was {{standing}} by the door to receive her with a sardonic smile upon his thin lips. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the grounds, then?" [...] he asked, with, the nearest approach to hilarity which she had ever heard from him. [...] "And the ornamental fencing? and the lodge-keeper? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> them all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear," [...] {{promptly}} {{interrupted her}} aunt, [...] "I know {{that sort of}} independence. I used to have whole Declarations of it. But you'll get over that, in Europe. There was a time--just after the war--when the English quite liked our sticking up for ourselves; but that's past now. They like us to be outlandish, but they don't like us to be independent. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the sermon? Didn't you think we had a nicely-dressed congregation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the nun as a bed-fellow? I dressed her up: didn't I do it well? Did you shriek {{when you}} saw her: I should have gone mad; but then you have such nerves!--real iron and bend-leather! I believe you feel nothing. You haven't the same {{sensitiveness}} that a person of my constitution has. You seem to me insensible both to pain and fear and grief. You are a real old Diogenes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, dear, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> your cousins?" [...] asked Aunt Plenty, as {{the last}} pony frisked round the corner and the din died away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed!' {{said the}} soldier. 'Then I see there are stratagems in law {{as well as}} war. Well, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> their line of battle?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{reports from}} Eton were simply scurrilous. There's a libel action in every sentence. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> this place from what you've seen of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|No one {{has thought}} fit {{to send me}} Atalanta[55]; and I have no proof at all of D. Balfour, which is far more serious. How about the D. B. map?

6000|$|<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{suppose he}} <b>likes</b> it, [...] Young one with {{annoying}} paw? [...] If I only were your mother, [...] I'd tickle you with birchen straw.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thomas!" [...] cried Mr. Vanstone, {{taking up}} his old felt hat and his thick walking stick {{from the hall}} table. [...] "Breakfast, this morning, at ten. The young ladies {{are not likely to}} be down earlier after the concert last night.--By-the-by, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the concert yourself, eh? You thought it was grand? Quite right; so it was. Nothing but crash-ban g, varied now and then by bang-crash; all the women dressed within an inch of their lives; smothering heat, blazing gas, and no room for anybody--yes, yes, Thomas; grand's the word for it, and {{comfortable}} isn't." [...] With that expression of opinion, Mr. Vanstone whistled to his vixenish terrier; flourished his stick at the hall door in cheerful defiance of the rain; and set off through wind and weather for his morning walk.|$|R
