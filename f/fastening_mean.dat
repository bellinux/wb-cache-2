50|$|As the armet {{was fully}} enclosing, and narrowed {{to follow the}} {{contours}} of the neck and throat, it had to have a mechanical means of opening and closing to enable it to be worn. The typical armet consisted of four pieces: the skull, the two large hinged cheek-pieces which locked at the front over the chin, and a visor which had a double pivot, one either side of the skull. The cheek-pieces opened laterally; when closed they overlapped at the chin, <b>fastening</b> by <b>means</b> of a spring-pin which engaged in a corresponding hole, or by a swivel-hook and pierced staple. A multi-part reinforcement for {{the bottom half of the}} face, known as a wrapper, was sometimes added; its straps were protected by a metal disc at the base of the skull piece called a rondel. The visor attached to each pivot via hinges with removable pins, as in the later examples of the bascinet. This method remained in use until c. 1520, after which the hinge disappeared and the visor had a solid connection to its pivot. The earlier armet often had a small aventail, a piece of mail attached to the bottom edge of each cheek-piece.|$|R

On the back were 58 buttons of gazar and organza, which <b>fasten</b> by <b>means</b> of rouleau loops. The skirt, underskirt trim and bridal train (which measured 270 cm — 110in) also incorporated lace appliquéd in a similar manner.

They were made of tough hickory, slightly curved in front, and were attached to each other by cross bars. At the stem of the vehicle there was a low back composed of two uprights and a single bar across. The whole machine was <b>fastened</b> together by <b>means</b> of tough lashings of raw seal-hide, so that, to all appearance, it was a rickety affair, ready to fall to pieces. In reality, however, it was very strong. No metal nails of any kind could have held in the keen frost; they would have snapped like glass at the first jolt; but the seal-skin fastenings yielded to the rude shocks and twistings, to which the sledge was subjected, and seldom gave way, or, if they did, were easily and speedily renewed without the aid of any other implement than a knife.|$|R
40|$|Usually, FRP {{materials}} are adhesively bonded to the structural substrate. An innovative technique application {{is based on}} the use of mechanical <b>fastening</b> (MF-FRP) by <b>means</b> of steel anchors to attach FRP laminates with enhanced bearing strength to concrete substrate. The benefit of MF-FRP, compared to adhesive bonding for FRP flexural strengthening is due to speed of installation using unskilled labor, minimal or absent surface preparation under any meteorological condition and immediate use of the strengthened structures. Some of the potential shortcomings are: brittle failure modes for members strengthened with the MF-FRP without a proper design; possible concrete damage during the drilling and dense internal reinforcement of the members that could limit the installation. Laboratory testing and a number of field applications have shown the effectiveness of such method. In this paper an analytical model is discussed for reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened by using MF-FRP strips. The model accounts for equilibrium, compatibility and constitutive relationships of materials, in particular, it accounts explicitly for the slip between the surface of the substrate and the FRP strip due to the behavior of fasteners. The proposed flexural model, coupled with an appropriate computation algorithm, is able to predict the fundamentals of flexural behavior of RC members strengthened with MF-FRP strips in terms of ultimate limit state. A comparison between the analytical predictions and the experimental results has been performed to validate the proposed model. The comparison shows a good agreement between the analytical predictions and the experimental results...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} experiments is to deter-mine whether environmental temperature has a similar influence upon the outcome of the shock experiment in a different species, namely, the rabbit, when shock is produced by the tourniquet instead of by the press. Working with burn shock in rats, certain investigators (2) reported an optimal temperature for survival at 750 F. Others (3) published findings that indicated a possible optimum near body temperatures for shock produced by intestinal trauma. We have found (1) that the difference between 160 C. and 280 C. in room temperature makes the difference between survival or death of the dog in crush injury. High temperatures generally are dele-terious, and low temperatures beneficial. No optimum such as that reported by the above-mentioned authors could be detected for the range tested. METHODS Peripheral circulatory failure ("shock") was produced both in anesthetized (Nembutal) and unanesthetized rabbits by means of a tourniquet allowed to remain in place around one hind limb for 5 hours.

Debray (Bulletin of the Chemical Society, Paris 12. 346), after which researcher a very much diluted neutral, nearly colorless iron perchloride solution dissociates with heating up under strong coloring into hydrochloric acid and colloidal ferric oxide. Beside the latter F. W. Krecke (Journal pr. Chemistry 3. 286) found an iron oxychloride compound. After F. Wiedemann (Journal pr. Chemistry, 9. 145) the magnetism of the ferric chloride solutions {{consists of the}} sum of the magnetism of the iron in the colloidal oxide and the magnetism of the iron is not changed chloride and therefore no basic salts will give, in which the iron possesses its own atomic magnetism. The studied solutions were middle concentration (30 % to 0. 06 %), however not border lines. Antony and Giglio (Chem. -Newspaper 1895. 325; C. 95. II. 858) the {{decomposition of}} the ferric chloride found completed in hydrogen chloride and colloidal hydrate after 24 hours according to colorimetric method with dilutions up to 0. 00083 %. The latter happens under temporary formation of chlorohydrates, [FeCl 2. OH and FeCl(OH) 2], which depending upon applied water conditions with hydrogen chloride equilibrium systems form and also cause during the dilution of the irregularities arising in the color of the solution. These changes in the color the line conduction of the iron perchloride solutions follows after Goodwin (Journal of Physik. Chemistry, 21. 1; C. 96. II. 998) a sufficient dilution of the first ionization of the ferric chloride causes, on which the ions (Fe) unite with the ions (OH) first to the colorless, bivalent ions Fe(OH), which gives the colloidal brown ferric hydroxide then with further ions of OH. xFe(OH) [...] . + 2 x(OH) = xFe(OH) 3. The decomposition of the ferric chloride will exist therefore not in a simple hydrolysis in hydrate and hydrogen chloride, but will be accompanied by ionization features. Solutions concentrated by the author implemented experiments with ferric chloride resulted in the following. Sublimated ferric chloride Fe 2 Cl 6 separates in water without decomposition then only if the relationship of the solvent is extraordinarily small. With the increase of the latter place shift takes place in the ferric chloride, whereby the delivery is prepared of two of the six chlorine atoms. The salt regards now as a composition of Ferrochloride and chlorine Fe 2 Cl 4. Cl 2, which dissociates with increase of water completely into the groups of the Fe 2 Cl 4 and Cl 2, if these groups can accept the neutral electrical condition. Chlorine in the status nascent reacts then with the water under formation of hydrogen chloride and oxygen, which transfer the group of Fe 2 Cl 4 immediately into the Oxychloride Fe 2 Cl 4 O, which accepts the certain following structure: 3 Fe 2 Cl 4 O = Fe 2 O 3. 2 Fe 2 Cl 6 and forms with hydrochloric acid and the water an equilibrium system modifying with the temperature. With still further dilution of the solution arrives by the designated phases at the complete decay. In van't Hoff's opinion {{about the nature of the}} solutions proven that the expansion of a salt draws the same consequences by its solvent, like those by increase of the temperature. Reaction of the potassium ferricyanide. Potassium ferricyanide does not give a low-brown color with ferric salt solutions of middle concentration, a clear reaction with a very much concentrated solution of ferric chloride (230 %), with a 126 % solution against it immediately a precipitation of citizen of Berlin blue and development of chlorine, from which it must be closed that the ferric chloride splits in the solution into Ferrochloride and chlorine: Fe 2 Cl 6 = Fe 2 Cl 4 + Cl 2. Similarly behave after author ferric bromide, ferric iodide and ferric nitrate, only takes place slower at the latter the formation precipitation of citizen of Berlin-blue, therefore the dissociation: Fe 2 (NO 3) 4 + N 2 O 5 + O seems to take place with difficulty; more rapidly the latter is caused with addition by some barium carbonate. Despite this behavior one may not really regard a solution of ferric chloride consisting of Fe 2 Cl 4 and Cl 2, as soon as chlorine leaves the compound, with the Fe 2 Cl 4 and Cl 2 an electrical charge is caused, whereby the Ferrochloride as cation and chlorine function as anion. Between these ions results an electrostatic attraction, which opposes its complete separation. Chlorine reacted with the water under formation from HCl, what latter by an air flow can be removed, while the oxygen remains connected with the group of Fe 2 Cl 4 : Fe 2 Cl 6 + H 2 O = Fe 2 Cl 4 O + 2 HCl. About the reaction of the iron with ferric chloride. A metal plate from iron does not react nearly with a saturated ferric chloride solution. The iron separates into less concentrated solutions, all faster, the more easily these solutions with potassium ferricyanide give citizen of Berlin-blue. It is not the formation of the Ferrochloride, a consequence of the dissolution of the iron, but is from the latter cause, as due to the dissociation (see above) formed hydrochloric acid dissolves the iron under development of hydrogen. If with these location of the ferric chloride, the FeCl 2 cation and Cl 2 anion and between these ions make an electrostatic attraction valid (see above), then must have a difference of potential be stated and an electric current to be able to collected, whose intensity will depend on the dissociation of the ferric chloride. On the other hand, one will cause the delivery of the ions with the current conclusion, brings and/or the dispersion of FeCl 2 and Cl 2 without difficulty to conditions - an opinion, which was confirmed by the experiment. A small platinum cap flat at the reason is <b>fastened</b> on by <b>means</b> of metal catch of the ends of a galvanometer, given into the same a confirmed FeCl 3 -solution (laminate 5 - 6 mm) and brought a small iron disk (2 cm diameters) on the surface of the liquid which is connected with the other end of the galvanometer. In instants of the contact, the needle turn out into violent oscillations and places with the division 54 °. After 4 hours, 4 cg had more separated iron than in a simultaneous experiment which the flow was not closed. The latter went from the iron to platinum, so that this cathode and the iron were anode. With the use of more diluted solutions of FeCl 3 increases the intensity of the flow up to a solution of 40 %, on which it decreases with the further dilution regularly, thus it goes through a maximum. Also the ease give with solutions of ferric chloride citizen of Berlin-blue under delivery of chlorine, walks by a maximum. In the end it is noticed that the investigations of the author, also contribute to the answer of the question of the molecular formula of the ferric chloride, which after the density of the formula Fe 2 Cl 6, according to the b. p. -method in alcohol or ether solution however comes the formula FeCl 3. It is still determined whether the place mixture of chlorine in the ferric chloride has solution not also in alcoholic or ethers. Reprinted with the permission of the American Chemical Society.

Autor također Andrijiću pripisuje dva do sada neprepoznata djela iz korčulanske katedrale: sakristiju i grobnicu biskupa Malumbre. The article {{tries to}} explain the {{extraordinary}} importance for Dalmatian art in general, and for architecture in particular, of Marko Andrijić, {{the greatest of all}} the master builders and sculptors of Korčula. He left his best achievements in the cathedral of his home town: the ciborium above the high altar and the top storey of the bell tower which, together with Marko 2 ̆ 7 s last work, the campanile of the Franciscan church in Hvar, became the model for a whole series of Dalmatian Renaissance and baroque church towers. A few architectural and sculptural works in the cathedral of Korčula which have not been recognized as works of Andrijić are ascribed to his opus. The construction of the campanile of the cathedral in Korčula dragged on through the whole first half of the fifteenth century, when the work stopped until the completion of the church. The sturdy lower part of the tower was built in the romanesque tradition. On 13 February 1481 Marko Andrijić signed a contract for the construction of the top part of the campanile. It was a combination of three basic architectural elements: -The main element is the octagonal loggia with pillars which carry the dome consisting of thin stone slabs grooved into diagonal stone ribs. -A narrow passage with a stone balustrade which Marko succeeded in creating around the loggia, above the 70 centimetres wide wall. -A lantern on top of the dome with eight slender pillars which continue the lines of the ribs. The structure of the top section of the Korčula belfry is particularly interesting. It is essentially a gothic skeletal structure in which each element has a clearly determined function. Also gothic is the requirement that the structure should be as light as possible. The profile of specific elements should be the smallest possible, utilizing the fabric almost to the ultimate limit of strength. However, because well-known elements were used in a completely new manner, we can define the structure as being in the mixed gothic-Renaissance style, which is usually used to describe Dalmatian decorative sculpture of this period. The dome is smooth within, while on the outside rounded ribs mark the edges. The segments of the dome consist of thin slabs (only 8 centimetres thick!) which are joggled together, and tongued and grooved into the ribs. Individual elements are so thin that they needed to be additionally <b>fastened</b> by <b>means</b> of copper cramps. These cramps, which tie together all the slabs and all the segments of the ribs, ensure the behaviour of the dome as a three-dimensional shell. Metal cramps take all tensile stresses, stone is loaded only in compression (which means that its bearing capacity is used to the maximum), and only vertical load is transmitted to the structural elements below the dome. A very satisfactory structural action of the loggia is thus achieved. We can {{go so far as to}} say that Marko, besides the knowledge acquired in his father 2 ̆ 7 s workshop, from his own experience as stone cutter and master builder, and from his study of buildings in his homeland and in Italy (his work in Venice was documented in 1473 and 1474, and in Mantua in 1478), was inspired by 223 Korčula 2 ̆ 7 s shipbuilding tradition. In the upper part of Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s campanile there are a great number of carpentry-style joints between stone elements. ***** The dome of the Korčula campanile, built between 1481 and 1483, and the dome of the cathedral of Šibenik which was erected a little later by Nicolo di Giovanni Fiorentino to the design of his predecessor Juraj Dalmatinac (Giorgio da Sebenico), have a very similar basic structural concept: a combination of stone ribs tongued and grooved with thin slabs. Because we cannot evaluate exactly the responsibility of each of the two master builders for the structural idea, because the activity of Marko Andrijić falls between theirs, and because we know that Juraj and Nicolo came to Korčula to purchase stone for the building of Šibenik cathedral, it is to be supposed that the builders of Korčula and of Šibenik influenced each other. A comparison of the two buildings leads to the conclusion that Andrijić resolved most of formal and structural problems more successfully than Nicolo Fiorentino. Andrijić achieved the transition from the square to the octagonal plan by the use of a balustrade which "softens" the clash of the two geometrical forms. In Šibenik the change from the cubic base to the octagonal drum is straightforward. In Korčula the octagonal structural plan was followed through systematically: the eight pillars of the loggia continue into the eight ribs of the dome, and into the eight columns of the lantern. In Šibenik, on the other hand, each side of the drum is composed of two bays, so that only the angle pilasters have the logical structural continuation in the dome ribs, while those in the middle carry only the cornice. The lantern of the campanile in Korčula is a more successful crown to the composition than the finial on top of the dome in Šibenik, where a lantern could be expected both for formal and functional reasons - to let in light and air. The slabs of the dome in Korčula are joggled in such a way that the thickness of the dome is the same throughout, and its surface smooth within and without, while in Sibenik the joints are emphasized by the thicker lower edges of the slabs, a detail which added to the complexity of the construction. In the structural system of the dome in Korčula two kinds of stress - compression and tension - are opposed by two adequate materials: stone (slabs and ribs) and copper (cramps). In Šibenik the same material - stone- resists both kinds of stress. This can be described as structural "integrity", but it created a number of difficulties which were resolved by the use of a sophisticated system of grooves and stone wedges in the ribs. ***** Although there are some campanili with elements similar to those in Korčula, we find the distinctive combination of an octagonal domed loggia with a passageway and a stone balustrade only in the small Apulian town of Soleto. The tower, with the later parish church next to it, was built at the end of the fourteenth century by Francesco Colaci, but the upper section received its present shape only during its baroque restoration, when it was completely remodelled. The closest we can get to the campanile in Korčula is in two. Renaissance imaginary views kept in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The first of these is an engraving dated about 1475 and attributed to Bramante, while the authorship 224 of a drawing dated somewhat later has previously been ascribed to Peruzzi and more recently to Vasari. For the time being the question of whether the campanili depicted in these two vedute were real or imaginary "ideal" buildings remains open. ***** About twenty years after having built the campanile in Korčula, Marko erected the tower of the Franciscan church in Hvar. This time he was able to make the design for the complete building, not only for the upper part. Although he repeated the traditional concept of a square prism, lightened by the use of openings which increase towards the top, Andrijić articulated the mass of the building in a new way. Apart from the common string courses between the storeys, he introduced them also at the level of the capitals of the columns in the bays. The height of the storeys increases towards the top, which adds to the slenderness of the tower. It seems natural that at the beginning of the sixteenth century Andrijić abandoned the abundant gothic decoration which covered his campanile in Korčula. On the tower in Hvar he introduced Renaissance details, like the balustrade of classical simplicity and the attic below the dome. Apart from the gradual opening up of the wall mass, the slenderness and the visual ascent of the campanile were achieved by the increase in height of the storeys, which was carried out in a very subtle way. The proportions of individual storeys were derived from the square (1 : 1), from the golden section rectangle (0 = [J s+t l I 2) and from descendant rectangles (2 I 0, 2 I 3 0, 3 I 4 0, 4 I 50). the proportions of the lesser elements (bays, division of storeys by string courses) also belong to the same family. The relation between the proportions of the storeys, i. e. the increase in height of each single storey was obtained in a different way. The starting proportions are those of a square. The height of the second storey is achieved by the addition of the thickness of the string course to the height of the first storey, and the height of the third storey by adding to the second storey the thickness of two string courses. The height of the fourth storey is again obtained by the addition of the thickness of only one string course. In this way the increase in height of storeys is very slow, almost imperceptible, and the string courses are involved in the proportional scheme of the whole. We can say that the architect borrowed the method used by a sculptor who takes into consideration the view from below and elongates the upper parts of his sculpture to counterbalance perspective shortenings. The Franciscan bell tower is the first in the line of four campanili in Hvar which were erected in the same style. It seems quite certain that Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s tower of the Franciscan church was the model for the builders of the cathedral belfry, and that it indirectly influenced the design of the campanili of the churches of St Mark and of|$|R
