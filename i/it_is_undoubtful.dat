With {{the case of}} Indonesia, most of the owners of fish trading business in Lamongan still market their fish in traditional market with the coverage of 40 % of the area of East Java, 38 % of Central Java and West Java, {{and the rest of}} 21 % is outside Java. This trading sector has an open characteristics which means that there is  no obstacle {{for those who want to}} join or leave the  trading business and this condition requires trading businessmen to have more capabilities in terms of offering goods, searching for market opportunities, and maintaining a network of relations.  This study aims to analyze whether social competence can act as a mediating variable between human capital and business success in the fish trading business owners in Lamongan. The process of data collection in this study was conducted on a population of 114 used to test the validity and reliability of 30 respondents, so that the sample 84 respondents were overall taken. The result of this study shows that human capital gives negative effect on business success while the social competence positively and significantly gives impact on the business success   and has a perfect role as mediating variables in the relationship between human capital with business success. This study contributes to the development aspects of the study of the human resources stating that the better human capital an entrepreneur has,  the better the social competence he has, and subsequently provides better opportunities to achieve business success...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in analytical instrumentation enable to describe biogeochemical processes in oceanic waters on a molecular level. This is the prerequisite to integrate biological and geochemical parameters {{and to develop}} chemical cycles on a global perspective. The state-of-the-art Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) applications for dissolved organic matter (DOM) focus mainly on carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes. Implementation of sulfur and especially phosphorus in the molecular formula assignment has been questionable because of ambiguous calculated elemental formulas. On the other hand, many compounds bearing these elements are well known {{to occur in the}} dissolved state as part of the permanent recycling processes (e. g. phospholipids, phosphonates) but analytics of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and sulfur (DOS) are often hampered by the large inorganic P and S pools. Even less is known about complexation characteristics of the DOM moieties. Although electrochemical methods provide some information about trace metal speciation, the high amount of organic molecules and its insufficient description as chemical functional classes prevent the assignment of trace metals to ligand classes. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>undoubtful</b> that a varying but extensive amount of transition metals is bond in form of organic complexes. Hyphenation of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) is a valuable tool to study these metal-organic interactions in a qualitative and quantitative approach. We established a desolvation method that allows direct transfer of high organic solvent loads into the plasma. Thus, in combination with internal standardization and external calibration, the investigation of a broad polarity scale was possible. This approach overcomes previous restrictions to non-organic solvent separation techniques like size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We used solid phase extracted DOM (SPE-DOM) from Atlantic and Southern Ocean water samples to show that organic sulfur and phosphorus species can be separated via RP-HPLC and that the partitioning can be correlated to trace metal binding capabilities in the different fractions. A molecular level investigation of these fractions via FT-ICR-MS revealed further details of the complexation features and connects the polarity-based separation on a C 18 column to O/C and H/C elemental ratios. With our study, we showed that biologically relevant transition metals (e. g. Fe, Ni, Cu) and uranium are intrinsic constituents of the DOM fractions. Moreover, a comparison between samples from different ecological provinces and diagenetic conditions was performed to highlight the benefits of this approach for future marine biogeochemical research...|$|E
40|$|The {{interesting}} {{study by}} Kim et al. reported {{a significant decrease}} in nitric oxide (NO) in a group of healthy female nurses after three sequential night shift. This study is in agreement also with a recent study by Suessenbacher et al., who also demonstrated a reduced peripheral arterial tone in shift workers compared with nonshift workers. The authors state that night shift work might be a stressor capable to deteriorate flow-mediated brachial artery dilation (FMD), but the precise mechanism is unknown. On one hand, the existence of a circadian variation in basal vascular tone, due at least in part to increased alpha-sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, has been demonstrated, and this could {{play a role in the}} complex series of triggering factors potentially favoring the higher incidence of acute cardiac ischemic events in the morning. On the other hand, a recent growing body of evidence has shown that vascular function and circadian clocks are tightly coupled. Circadian clocks exist as a self-sustained transcriptional-translational circuit consisting of positive and negative feedback loops, and generating a rhythm in gene expression with a period of approximately 24 hours. The principal (master) circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is entrained by light, but peripheral circadian clocks have been identified within almost all mammalian cell types, including cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. The principal role of cellular biological clocks is driving circadian rhythms to adapt the organism to further needs in an anticipatory manner, so providing selective advantage. However, it has been recently shown that external or internal disruption (dyssinchrony) of circadian control may result in overt diseases. For example, mice exposed to a 20 -hour instead of 24 -hour circadian rhythm show a complete disruption of sleep/wake behavior and a marked progression of myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Again, bmal 1 knockout mice or clock mutant mice exhibit impairment of normal protective endothelial responses to vascular injury with pathological remodeling and predisposition to vascular thrombosis, and mice with mutation in the Per 2 gene show endothelial disfunction characterized by decreased production of NO and vasodilatory prostaglandins, and increased release of cyclooxygenase- 1 -derived vasoconstrictor substances. Thus, it is quite likely that vascular and endothelial function and NO production may be affected and impaired in night shift workers via a circadian-based mechanism. Now, we have no conclusive data on whether out-of-synch of biological clocks may influence health or disease, and which amount of circadian rhythm disruption or sleep deprivation may be harmful for the cardiovascular system. For example, it has been found that the incidence of acute myocardial infarction was slightly (but significantly) increased for the first three weekdays after the transition to daylight saving time in the spring, with an incidence ratio of 1. 051 for the first week. Finally, several risk factors have to be considered when evaluating shift work disorder, e. g., age, female sex, time of light exposure, duration of the shift, familial (genetic) predisposition, and so on. The results reported by Kim et al have been obtained after a sequential series of three night shifts, and rapid shift rotation is suggested to not allow bodily's rhythms to synchronize to a new schedule. In conclusion, keeping away from alarmistic manipulations, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>undoubtful</b> that circadian rhythms play an important role in cardiovascular health and disease, and further studies on night shift-workers should be addressed to clarify potential cardiovascular effects of possible rhythm disruption...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{advances}} {{in the field of}} psoriasis research, several questions remain that need to be answered considering the exact molecular pathogenesis of the disorder, including the description of molecular triggers and the mechanism of disorder initiation. However, the altered response of keratinocytes to the T-cell signals <b>is</b> <b>undoubtful</b> an essential factor of psoriasis development. To date, relatively few studies have been conducted on mRNA maturation disturbances in psoriasis. In the study of Ting et al. was shown that the EDA+ domain containing fibronectin isoform (EDA+ fibronectin) is overexpressed in psoriatic non-involved epidermis. We found that proliferating keratinocytes (both normal cultured keratinocytes and HaCaT cells) are able to produce this isoform. EDA+ fibronectin expression was modest in healthy keratinocytes whereas keratinocytes from psoriatic non-involved epidermis proved to be effective producers of this splice variant. In our cDNA microarray study we examinated the T-lymphokine induced gene expression changes. In the applied experimental setup, organotypic cultures were generated from both healthy and psoriatic epidermis samples, and half of them were treated with a lymphokine mixture containing GM-CSF, IFN-gamma and IL- 3. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> previously proven that IFN-gamma in the presence of GM-CSF and IL- 3 is able to promote proliferation of the keratinocyte precursors originating from the non-involved epidermis, therefore, these mediators could {{play a crucial role in}} the early steps of disorder development. In the following analysis, a comparison has been made between the autologuous pairs of untreated and treated samples, and the differentially regulated genes among healthy and psoriatic non-involved epidermis samples were selected for further analyses. An important outcome of the study was that due to T-lymphokine treatment, several identified genes showed upregulation in healthy epidermis, while in the non-involved epidermis, downregulation or unchanged gene expression was experienced. Moreover, we have also proved that certain SR-rich splicing regulators showed altered responsiveness to T-lymphokine stimuli. In this experiment, we identified splicing factor, luc- 7 like protein 3 (LUC 7 L 3), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase G (PPIG) and arginine/serine-rich 18 (SFRS 18), differentially regulated among healthy and psoriatic non-involved epidermis, therefore they could contribute to the responsiveness changes of keratinocytes...|$|R

On {{a certain}} class of minds, however, these Raphaelesque and other sacred {{paintings}} of high order, have had, of late years, {{another kind of}} influence, much resembling that which they had at first on the most pious Romanists. They are used to excite certain conditions of religious dream or reverie; being again, as in earliest times, regarded not as representations of fact, but as expressions of sentiment respecting the fact. In this way {{the best of them}} have unquestionably much purifying and enchanting power; and they are helpful opponents to sinful passion and weakness of every kind. A fit of unjust anger, petty malice, unreasonable vexation, or dark passion, cannot certainly, in a mind of ordinary sensibility, hold its own {{in the presence of a}} good engraving from any work of Angelico, Memling, or Perugino. But I nevertheless believe, that he who trusts much to such helps will find them fail him at his need; and that the dependence, in any great degree, on the presence or power of a picture, indicates a wonderfully feeble sense of the presence and power of God. I do not think that any man, who is thoroughly certain that Christ is in the room, will care what sort of pictures of Christ he has on its walls; and, in the plurality of cases, the delight taken in art of this kind is, in reality, nothing more than a form of graceful indulgence of those sensibilities which the habits of a disciplined life restrain in other directions. Such art is, in a word, the opera and drama of the monk. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> worse than this, and the love of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the mask under which a general thirst for morbid excitement will pass itself for religion. The young lady who rises in the middle of the day, jaded by her last night's ball, and utterly incapable of any simple or wholesome religious exercise, can still gaze into the dark eyes of the Madonna di San Sisto, or dream over the whiteness of an ivory crucifix, and returns to the course of her daily life in full persuasion that her morning's feverishness has atoned for her evening's folly.
