50|$|Although {{relatively}} infrequent {{the use of}} SIMS on obsidian surface investigations {{has produced}} great progress in OHD dating. SIMS in general refers to four instrumental categories according to their operation; static, dynamic, quadrupole, and time-of-flight, TOF. In essence it is a technique with a large resolution on a plethora of chemical elements and molecular structures in an essentially non destructive manner. An approach to OHD with a completely new rationale suggests that refinement of the technique is possible in a manner which improves both its accuracy and precision and potentially expands the utility by generating reliable chronological data. Anovitz et al. presented a model which relied solely on compositionally-dependent diffusion, following numerical solutions (finite difference (FD), or finite element) elaborating on the H+ profile acquired by SIMS. A test of the model followed using results from Mount 65, Chalco in Mexico by Riciputi et al. This technique used numerical calculation to model {{the formation of the}} entire <b>diffusion</b> <b>profile</b> as a function of time and fitted the derived curve to the hydrogen profile. The FD equations are based on a number of assumptions about the behavior of water as it diffused into the glass and characteristic points of the SIMS H+ <b>diffusion</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{more precise}} {{statement}} of the image acquisition process is that the image-intensities at each position are attenuated, depending on the strength (b-value) {{and direction of the}} so-called magnetic diffusion gradient, {{as well as on the}} local microstructure in which the water molecules diffuse. The more attenuated the image is at a given position, the greater diffusion there is in the direction of the diffusion gradient.

5000|$|The {{diffusion}} tensor, a 3 &times; 3 symmetric positive-definite matrix, {{offers a}} straightforward solution {{to both of}} these goals. It {{is proportional to the}} covariance matrix of a Normally distributed local <b>diffusion</b> <b>profile</b> and, thus, the dominant eigenvector of this matrix is the principal direction of local diffusion. Due to the simplicity of this model, a maximum likelihood estimate of the diffusion tensor can be found by simply solving a system of linear equations at each location independently. However, as the volume is assumed to contain contiguous tissue fibers, it may be preferable to estimate the volume of diffusion tensors in its entirety by imposing regularity conditions on the underlying field of tensors. Scalar values can be extracted from the diffusion tensor, such as the fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivities, which indirectly measure tissue properties such as the dysmyelination of axonal fibers [...] or the presence of edema. Standard scalar image computing methods, such as registration and segmentation, can be applied directly to volumes of such scalar values. However, to fully exploit the information in the diffusion tensor, these methods have been adapted to account for tensor valued volumes when performing registration [...] and segmentation.|$|E
