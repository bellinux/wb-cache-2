5|$|Persoonia levis is one {{of several}} species of Persoonia that {{regenerate}} by resprouting from the trunk after bushfire, an adaptation to the fire-prone habitat in which it grows. Its thick papery bark shields the underlying epicormic buds from the flames. Plants also regenerate by seedlings that arise from a seedbank in the soil after fire, although they may take up to 12months to germinate. One study of sclerophyll forest unburnt <b>for</b> <b>thirty</b> years showed P.levis had declined over time. P.levis plants can live for over 60years, and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6years.|$|E

The Dime Store's concept was created by McErlean and Jeremy Larter, and was inspired by the soda shops they both experienced growing up on the East Coast. Prior to the restaurant's opening, plans were to serve breakfast and lunch during mid-week hours, with the potential to later add happy hour and family-friendly dinner options, as well as outdoor seating.|$|E
