5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> {{temporarily}} removed {{due to a}} renovation project, {{and this}} sparked debate on whether the <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> necessary.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> {{strengthened}} in {{the late}} 1950s, particularly in areas with {{a high number of}} escapes. Parallel rows of barbed-wire <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> built, with concertina wire added between the fences in some places to further hinder escapees. The outer <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> often located very close to the actual border. A further obstacle was added by placing short wooden anchor posts about [...] outwards from both <b>fences.</b> Barbed wire <b>was</b> strung between them to form a V-shape to hinder lateral movement by escapees. In some low-risk areas, only a single <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> installed.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, the {{facility}} underwent several renovations. In 1990, a new, wooden outfield wall was constructed. In 1991, new dugouts were added, foul territory <b>fencing</b> <b>was</b> replaced, and <b>fencing</b> <b>was</b> {{built around the}} bullpens. In 2002 and 2003, 70-foot sunken dugouts with <b>fencing</b> <b>were</b> constructed. In 2004, the warning track was resurfaced. In 2006, a new electronic scoreboard, located beyond the right center field <b>fence,</b> <b>was</b> installed. In 2010, the Quinn Family Grandstand, which includes 400 chairback seats and a press box, was completed.|$|R
25|$|July 1956. A second {{director}} {{takes over}} {{as head of}} New Denver School, a <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> put up around the grounds. Visits with parents are conducted through the fence as RCMP patrol the grounds during the visits.|$|E
25|$|Falling <b>Fence</b> <b>is</b> a {{sculpture}} by Melbourne photographer John Gollings {{and his assistant}} Samantha Slicer. It was officially launched in 2001. It is made of cypress pine, and is intended {{to blend in with}} its surroundings over time.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 to 2009, one of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} features of the Metrodome was the centerfield fence with the large original white and later, yellow 408ft. marking. The centerfield <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> 7 feet high and 30 feet long. The centerfield fence 408ft. marking were originally painted white but was repainted gold although the original white is still visible under the yellow. The centerfield fence hung in the dome through both the 1987 and 1991 Minnesota Twins World Series Championship victories. The fence was removed after the last Twins season in the Metrodome in 2009. The centerfield <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> now kept in a private collection in Minnesota along with the Metrodome seat that Kirby Puckett's 11th inning 1991 World Series Game 6 winning walk-off home run ball landed in.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after, a <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> erected and Clarke {{circulated}} a third petition {{and collected}} funds. He received {{a total of}} $158 from 19 residents and the <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|Courses {{have also}} changed considerably. Early <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> built more naturally, {{rather than the}} brightly colored poles that <b>are</b> today's standard. <b>Fences</b> <b>were</b> smaller, and courses were not as technical.|$|R
5000|$|Earthworks for the <b>fence</b> <b>were</b> {{finished}} in May 2007. The <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> completed and the sanctuary officially [...] "closed" [...] on 3 July 2007 {{in the presence}} of the Waitati Militia.|$|R
25|$|A {{temporary}} {{gravel road}} is {{constructed in the}} northeast quadrant of the Ellipse each year to give workers access to the tree for decoration. A wooden snow <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> installed near the tree and around the Pageant of Peace area each year as well to protect the lawn during periods of high foot traffic.|$|E
25|$|To avoid confusion, the {{efficiency}} of heat engines and power stations should be stated relative to the Higher Heating Value (HHV) or Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, to include or exclude the heat that {{can be obtained from}} condensing the flue gas. It should also be specified whether Gross output at the generator terminals or Net Output at the power station <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> being considered.|$|E
25|$|A {{jet blast}} {{deflector}} (JBD) or blast <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine to prevent damage and injury. The structure must {{be strong enough to}} withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the turbulent air. Without a deflector, jet blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Picket <b>fences</b> <b>are</b> {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} United States, where the style has been used since America's earliest colonial era and remains popular today. They are a decorative way to contain pets and children without blocking views, and are used around both front and back yards. Traditionally picket <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> made out of wood and painted white (or whitewashed), but now picket <b>fences</b> <b>are</b> also widely available in polyvinyl chloride (PVC).|$|R
50|$|In 2009, a large metal <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} {{around the}} entire park, preventing casual use. The <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> opposed by community groups including the Esplanade Association, but was requested by private donors and installed by DCR.|$|R
5000|$|In 1488, {{in order}} to secure the public safety of the capital, the central {{government}} built wooden fences at all the entrances to the streets and lanes in Beijing. The <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> accomplished with contributions from the local residents, and the total number of the <b>fences</b> <b>was</b> more than 1,700 {{by the end of the}} Qing dynasty. Among them, the Langfang Sitiao streetâ€™s <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> funded by the merchants. For this reason, the <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> extremely large and thus got the name [...] "Dashilanr". With the passage of time, [...] "Dashilanr" [...] gradually became the formal name of the street replacing [...] "Langfang Sitiao".|$|R
25|$|The Cardrona Bra Fence was a {{controversial}} tourist attraction in Central Otago, in New Zealand. At some point between 1998 and 1999, passers-by began to attach bras to a rural fence. The fence gradually became a well known site {{as the number}} of bras grew to hundreds. The <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> located on a public road reserve, adjacent to farm property in the Cardrona Valley area southwest of Wanaka, near to Cardrona.|$|E
25|$|A gate {{near the}} south end of the <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> no longer in use; the road from it is overgrown. Two gates near the {{northwest}} corner lead to a short semicircular drive with a large cast iron urn in the middle of its lawn. At its east end is the only mausoleum in the cemetery, the final resting place of Dean Richmond, a Batavia native who rose to become president of the New York Central Railroad. There are no other monuments or markers in the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|The present-day {{garden was}} created by the {{architect}} Henri Beyaert, and was inaugurated in 1890. It is surrounded by an ornate wrought iron fence inspired by one which once decorated the Coudenberg Palace. The <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> punctuated by tall stone pillars; atop each pillar is a statue of one or more historical professions, with 48 statues in total. To ensure that the statues were stylistically coherent, Beyart asked painter Xavier Mellery to design all of the statues. Each pillar has a unique design, as does each section of fence.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} home ranges and {{activity}} patterns of 24 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in southwestern Wisconsin via radio-telemetry and visual observation {{to determine their}} response to single-strand electric crop-protection <b>fences.</b> Deer <b>were</b> allowed to establish feeding patterns in alfalfa fields during the spring green-up periods of 1986 and 1987. In mid-April of each year, 7 <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> constructed around selected 7 - 25 ha alfalfa fields to exclude deer from varying portions of their home ranges. No <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> constructed around alfalfa fields in one area. <b>Fences</b> <b>were</b> built around 50 and 100...|$|R
50|$|Like {{the jewel}} box parks, the outfield <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> angled {{rather than the}} gradual curve of the newer parks, and often had quirky dimensions. The {{requirements}} for minimum distance to the outfield <b>fences</b> <b>were</b> frequently waived during this time.|$|R
50|$|The garden {{includes}} a large Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Camphor Laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), and Macadamia (possibly Macadamia tetraphylla). An early timber <b>fence</b> post <b>is</b> {{located at the}} north-west corner of the yard. It bears two different sets of post notches suggesting the Dewar Terrace <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> post-and-rail and the Ruthven Street <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> more finely crafted. The grounds contain a carport and swimming pool.|$|R
25|$|The Bra Fence {{began at}} some point between Christmas 1998 and New Year 1999, when four bras were {{attached}} to the wire fence alongside the road. The original reason for the bras being attached to the <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> unknown. News spread of the addition, which was left on the fence by the local landowners, and more bras began to appear. By the end of February there were some 60 bras, but at about this time they were all removed anonymously. This {{was reported in the}} local press, and the story gained widespread dissemination through the New Zealand media, leading to more bras appearing.|$|E
25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|Guru: The will {{to suffer}} and {{sacrifice}} should be there. But {{there is no}} need to get drenched or starved. Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you intend to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my viewâ€¦. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people know that I subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E
50|$|In 1993 an 8.4 km <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> {{built around}} the exclave. As the first <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> too easy to cross the {{construction}} of a new system started in 1995. In 2005 an increase of height was made, from 3 to 6 m.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fencing</b> <b>is</b> a {{small but}} growing sport in Singapore. The National Sport Association that helps to oversee <b>fencing</b> in Singapore <b>is</b> <b>Fencing</b> Singapore. Generally, <b>fencing</b> <b>is</b> in a handful of schools at all levels, {{including}} primary and secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics, and universities. Some country clubs in Singapore also have fencing, and other schools and organizations are known to organize limited fencing workshops once in a while.|$|R
50|$|The Mooney Mooney Bridge, {{because of}} its height, has been {{susceptible}} {{in the past to}} people committing suicide. As a result, a <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> erected {{along the side of the}} bridge to prevent people jumping off. This <b>fence</b> <b>was</b> erected in 2003 and cost A$1,000,000.|$|R
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the story, {{the group}} that set out to bury Kazangap has nearly reached the Ana-Beiit cemetery. However, they are {{hindered}} in their journey by a barbed wire fence erected {{in the middle of their}} route. Resolved to go around it, they travel along it toward another road only to reach a check-point manned by a young soldier. To their dismay, they are told that access beyond the <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> prohibited, but the soldier calls his superior to see if an exception can be made. It is then that Yedigei learns that the superior is named Tansykbaev but discovers that this is a different man from the one previously known. However, the new Tansykbaev is also encrusted in a patina of hierarchical obedience and interpersonal tyranny; unmoved by the procession's request, he denies them entry and also informs them that the Ana-Beiit cemetery is to be leveled in the future.|$|E
500|$|As {{one side}} of the ground {{directly}} adjoins a cricket pitch, the club was required to erect a dividing fence in order to gain entry to the Northern Premier League. [...] The <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> temporary in nature and is removed during the cricket season. [...] It was partially funded by money raised from friendlies against Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United.|$|E
500|$|The {{cemetery}} perimeter {{is lined}} {{on three sides}} by a cast wrought iron fence, accessible by a gate [...] in width at its western entryway. The wrought iron <b>fence</b> <b>is</b> [...] in height, and has approximately [...] diameter tubular fence posts, which are supported by three horizontal metal rails. The fence posts are capped with white-painted stylized arrows, with a ball at the tip. A shield with the emblem reading, [...] "The Stewart Iron Works, Cincinnati, Ohio", is emblazoned on the fence's gate. The cemetery's eastern extension is surrounded by chain-link fencing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fencing</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1837 simultaneously with the {{monument to the}} Empress Catherine II between the Nevsky Prospect and the Rossi Street. The <b>fencing</b> design <b>is</b> simple: its links fasten to cylindrical racks, {{and at the top}} of the <b>fencing</b> there <b>are</b> sharp peaks.|$|R
