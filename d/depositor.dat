As a result of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, Tsang's government rolled out a package of financial stimulus of HK$11 billion and a <b>depositor</b> guarantee scheme to safeguard Hong Kong dollar savings in bank accounts. Hong Kong narrowly avoided a technical recession from the ongoing crisis.|$|E
5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover <b>depositor</b> accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E

5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the <b>depositor</b> claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E
25|$|In {{transactions}} with static assets, a <b>depositor</b> will {{assemble the}} underlying collateral, help structure {{the securities and}} work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors. The <b>depositor</b> has taken on added significance under Regulation AB. The <b>depositor</b> typically owns 100% of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction. In transactions with managed (traded) assets, asset managers assemble the underlying collateral, help structure the securities {{and work with the}} financial markets in order to sell the securities to investors.|$|E

50|$|In the {{standard}} Diamond-Dybvig model, financial systems {{are vulnerable to}} a financial crisis {{in the form of}} a bank run due to the inherent nature of banking. Banks serve as intermediaries between <b>depositors</b> and borrowers. <b>Depositors</b> want immediate access to their deposits, while borrowers are not able to pay on demand. This creates a fundamental fragility, as a bank's assets cannot be liquidated in the event of a crisis to pay all <b>depositors.</b> This tension makes the financial system susceptible to a sudden change in demand for money by <b>depositors,</b> resulting in a bank run.|$|R
40|$|Diamond and Dybvig (JPE, 1983) and the {{subsequent}} literature mod-elled bank runs as a simultaneous-move game, even though empirical evidence indicates that <b>depositors</b> have information about others ´ deci-sion. This paper introduces explicitly sequential moves into the Diamond-Dybvig model. <b>Depositors</b> decide consecutively whether to withdraw their funds or continue holding balances in the bank. If agents can observe the actions of all previous <b>depositors,</b> I show that, contrary to Diamond and Dybvig, there are no bank runs in equilibrium. However, when only with-drawals are observed (and <b>depositors</b> do not know their exact position in the sequence) bank runs re-emerge as possible outcomes. I also consider a third setup in which keeping the funds in the bank is unobservable, but <b>depositors</b> are allowed to make this decision observable, at a cost. If the cost is moderate, {{then there will be}} no bank runs. This result suggests that allowing for communication between the bank and the <b>depositors</b> can help prevent bank runs...|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} fractional-reserve banking expands {{the money supply}} of the economy but also {{increases}} the risk that a bank cannot meet its <b>depositor</b> withdrawals. Modern central banking allows banks to practice fractional-reserve banking with inter-bank business transactions with a reduced risk of bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift toward}} {{the use of}} these {{receipts}} as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith-bankers of London began to give out the receipts as payable to the bearer of the document rather than the original <b>depositor.</b> This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the Goldsmith-banker.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a bank can offer demand deposits and yet avoid bank runs without deposit insurance if {{it also offers}} time deposits that have a low liquidation value. Self-fulfilling runs do not occur, as maturity mismatch is eliminated. To do this, we modify Diamond and Dybvig"s [1983] model so that <b>depositors</b> have differing risks of encountering a preference shock. We show that high-risk <b>depositors</b> will hold their savings as demand deposits, whereas low-risk <b>depositors</b> will prefer time deposits. These deposit choices transfer liquidity optimally from low-risk to high-risk <b>depositors,</b> who place the highest value on liquidity. ...|$|R
25|$|Modern banking practices, {{including}} fractional reserve {{banking and}} the issue of banknotes, emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries. Merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original <b>depositor</b> could collect the stored goods.|$|E
25|$|Banks have demand {{deposits}} {{in the nature}} of loans to the bank and investment deposits. Some offer guaranteed savings accounts with permission to use the funds and a discretionary reward to the <b>depositor</b> {{as in the case of}} the Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad. Initially, demand deposit accounts were more common, but over time, most accounts are now investment accounts, which reflects the confidence of depositors in the ability of banks to generate a return. Islamic banking operations are successfully operating in many Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Iran, Sudan, Turkey and Bahrain.|$|E
25|$|Relying on this clause, the Supreme Court {{has held}} that where the marshal {{of a state}} court {{received}} state bank notes in payment and discharge of an execution, the creditor was entitled to demand payment in gold or silver. Since, however, {{there is nothing in}} the Constitution prohibiting a bank <b>depositor</b> from consenting when he draws a check that payment may be made by draft, a state law providing that checks drawn on local banks should, at the option of the bank, be payable in exchange drafts was held valid.|$|E

25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of zero {{interest}} creating unlimited demand for investment that is limited in supply, activists such as Siddiqi suggest a two-tier mudarabah model as the basis of a riba-free banking system. This involves the bank acting as the capital partner in a back-to-back mudarabah contract with the <b>depositor</b> {{on one side and the}} entrepreneur on the other side. This model can be supplemented by a number of fixed-return models (like Ijara, Istisna, Murabaha etc.). In practice the murabaha model is the bank's favourite, as it bears results most similar to the interest-based finance models.|$|E
25|$|Usury {{was still}} {{banned by the}} Church in this period, with an {{interpretation}} concisely expressed as Quidquid sorti accedit, usura est ("Whatever exceeds the principal is usury").

40|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that reducing deposit insurance would reduce problems of moral hazard {{in the banking}} industry.

5000|$|A {{collection}} item (also {{called a}} noncash item) is an item presented {{to a bank}} for deposit that the bank will not, under its procedures, provisionally credit to the <b>depositor's</b> account or which the bank cannot (due to provisions or law or regulation) provisionally credit to a <b>depositor's</b> account.

25|$|It was {{feared that}} {{legitimate}} non-banking financial companies and micro finance institutions would be stigmatised, {{leading to a}} vicious cycle of low <b>depositor</b> trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localised credit crisis. Because most of the Saradha Group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, {{the loss of the}} investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. The scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilising companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure. Many of these companies have been variations of time share travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations. These companies tried to register as cooperative societies to continue their financial operations.|$|E
25|$|Gradually the goldsmiths {{began to}} lend {{the money out}} {{on behalf of the}} <b>depositor,</b> which led to the {{development}} of modern banking practices; promissory notes (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith. The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay, allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.|$|E
25|$|Where the finder is an employee, {{most cases}} hold that the find should be {{awarded to the}} {{employer}} {{if it has a}} heightened legal obligation to take care of its customers' property, otherwise it should go to the employee. A find occurring in a bank is generally awarded to the bank as the owner is likely to have been a bank customer and the bank has a fiduciary duty to try to reunite lost property with their owners. For similar reasons, common carriers are preferred to passengers and hotels to guests (but only where finds occur in guest rooms, not common areas). The view has been taken that such a rule is suitable for recently misplaced objects as it provides the best chance for them to be reunited with their owners. However, it effectively delivers title of old artefacts to landowners, since the older an object is, the less likely it is that the original <b>depositor</b> will return to claim it. The rule is therefore of little or no relevance to objects of archaeological value.|$|E

50|$|However a {{different}} outcome is also possible. Since banks lend out at long maturity, they cannot quickly call in their loans. And {{even if they}} tried to call in their loans, borrowers {{would be unable to}} pay back quickly, since their loans were, by assumption, used to finance long-term investments. Therefore, if all <b>depositors</b> attempt to withdraw their funds simultaneously, a bank will run out of money long before it is able to pay all the <b>depositors.</b> The bank will be able to pay the first <b>depositors</b> who demand their money back, but if all others attempt to withdraw too, the bank will go bankrupt and the last <b>depositors</b> will be left with nothing.|$|R
