5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|Only about 1300 {{cartridges}} of {{the estimated}} 700,000 {{were removed from the}} burial, as the remaining materials were <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> expected, and made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. The burial was refilled following this event. Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, said that this was a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to agree to a similar event again.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Bill Austin of Khoyatan Marine Lab in the Northeast Pacific {{examined}} a video {{made during the}} National Geographic dives to identify the benthic flora and fauna of Bowie Seamount.

5|$|Two-year-old bushes {{are usually}} planted but strong one-year-old stock {{can also be}} used. Planting {{certified}} stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses. On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6ft) or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of 1.2 metres (4ft) and row separations of 2.5 metres (8ft) or more. In the UK, young bushes are generally planted <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{divergence}} between the broadbills and the sapayoa {{found in the}} 2003 study is only slightly less <b>deep</b> <b>than</b> that between the sapayoa and the pittas. It is even possible though unlikely that the present species is actually closer to the pittas than to the broadbills. Consequently, it is now placed in its own monotypic family, Sapayoidae.|$|R
50|$|These battalions were fielded {{much less}} <b>deep</b> <b>than</b> the {{infantry}} squares of the Spanish, the pikemen being generally described as {{five to ten}} ranks deep, the shot eight to twelve ranks. In this way, fewer musketeers were left inactive {{in the rear of}} the formation, as was the case with tercios which deployed in a bastioned-square.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a hillside castle was that its well was much less <b>deep</b> <b>than</b> that of a hilltop castle. The boring of the well was often the most expensive and time-consuming element in the overall construction of a castle. Often, however, its water supply was ensured with the additional help of donkeys as pack animals, entailing the construction of special donkey tracks.|$|R
5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be more {{difficult}} than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
5|$|Great kivas {{are always}} much larger and <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> Chaco-style kivas. Whereas {{the walls of}} great kivas always extend above the {{surrounding}} landscape, the walls of Chaco-style kivas are flush with the surrounding landscape. Chaco-style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses, but great kivas are always separate from core structures. Great kivas almost always have a bench that encircles the inner space, but this feature is not found in Chaco-style kivas. Great kivas also tend to include floor vaults, which may have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers, but Chaco-style kivas do not.|$|E
50|$|Some {{describe}} tachypnea as any rapid breathing. Hyperventilation is then {{described as}} increased ventilation of the alveoli (which can occur through increased rate or depth of breathing, or both) {{where there is}} a smaller rise in metabolic carbon dioxide relative to this increase in ventilation. Hyperpnea, on the other hand, is defined as breathing more rapid and <b>deep</b> <b>than</b> breathing at rest.|$|R

5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the {{cylinder}} slightly pressurized {{at all times}} during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of {{the cylinder}} with corrosive agents, such as sea water, or toxic material, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria. A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> where the last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive.|$|E
5|$|M1 is flat-crowned. The anteroloph, a crest at {{the front}} of the tooth, lacks a smaller {{accessory}} spur that is present in N.rufus. The paracone, one of the main cusps, is quite small; this cusp is more prominent in N.rufus. The mesoloph, a crest on the middle of the tooth, is distinct but short and located further to the back than in N.rufus. M2 has a longer mesoloph. M3 is largely flat-crowned, but the paracone is a bit more prominent than the rest. The valley between the cusps {{at the front}} is <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> the valleys at the back. Each of the upper molars has three roots.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the elastic {{scattering}} of the exotic 17 F nuclei from 208 Pb at Coulomb barrier energies.
