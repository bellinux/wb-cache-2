40|$|Determinations of the {{magnetic}} fabric of 117 samples of Neogene and Quaternary sediment from DSDP Hole 610 B on the Feni Drift and Holes 611, 611 C, and 61 ID on the Gardar Drift reveal near-horizontal magnetic foliation planes in 60 % of the samples studied. These {{are believed to be}} due either to the partial preservation of original bedding surfac-es or to the effects of postdepositional compaction. The majority of these samples have been affected to some extent by bioturbation, but magnetic fabric parameters suggest that the degree of disruption of the original depositional sediment fabric by bioturbation has been greater at Site 611 than at Site 610. Sediments from the three studied holes at Site 611 show highly variable magnetic lineations, probably due to the effects of bioturbation. However, a well-defined E-W magnetic lineation has been identified in upper Pliocene sediments at Site 610 on the Feni Drift, reflecting E-W pre-ferred orientation of long axes of grains at this site. This <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> grain <b>alignment</b> is approximately parallel with the local orientation of sediment wave crests {{on the surface of the}} Feni Drift in this region, and appears to relate to the process by which these waves develop in response to the large-scale geostrophic currents responsible for the forma-tion of the drifts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Material juxtapositions across mature faults are {{a common}} occurrence. Previous work has found that this elastic {{mismatch}} results in a rupture that will preferentially propagate in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> slip displacement on the more compliant side of the fault, with more off-fault damage in the stiffer material. This result has implications for inferring preferred rupture directions based on observations of damage zone asymmetry. We perform a complete numerical investigation {{of the role of}} the stress state on the distribution of plastic deformation and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> rupture propagation. We show that there are important factors, in addition to the elastic mismatch, which control the <b>preferred</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> propagation as well as the side of the fault in which damage predominately accumulates. The orientation of the most compressive principal stress is the controlling factor in determining the location of plastic deformation. For different orientations, plastic deformation can accumulate in either the stiffer or the more compliant material. For high angles of most compressive stress, the aforementioned preferred rupture direction prediction holds true. However, the off-fault plastic response can reverse that direction for low angles of most compressive stress so that rupture will preferentially propagate in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> slip displacement in the stiffer material. 1...|$|R

The Alpine Fault produces M-W approximate to 8 earthquakes every 200 - 400 years and last ruptured in 1717 AD. Wireline geophysical logs and rock cores extending {{from one side of}} the Alpine Fault to the other were acquired in two boreholes drilled in 2011 at Gaunt Creek during the first phase of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP- 1). These data document ambient conditions under which the next Alpine Fault earthquake will occur. Principal component analysis of the wireline logging data reveals that > 80 % of the variance is accounted for by electrical, acoustic, and natural gamma properties, and preliminary multivariate classification enables the lithologies of sections of missing core to be reconstructed from geophysical measurements. The fault zone exhibits systematic variations in properties consistent with common processes of progressive alteration and comminution near the principal slip zone, superimposed on different protolith compositions. Our observations imply that the fault zone has the opposite sense of elastic asymmetry at 0. 1 - 100 m scales to that of the crustal-scale orogen imaged by remote geophysical methods.

40|$|Damage in {{concrete}} is mostly visualised in sections {{or at the}} surface of specimens subjected to internal and/or external loading. It continuously develops by growth and coalescence of tiny cracks into a spatial network structure. This structure {{can be seen as}} the fi nger-print of the material refl ecting its history of loadings under given environmental conditions. The methodology of contrast improvement as an essential link in visualising damage is touched upon. However, a major focus of the paper is on describing damage by submitting images of crack patterns consisting of lineal features in the plane to a sweeping test line system and counting intersections. To obtain three-dimensional damage information in an economic way, the damage structure is assumed in the most general case revealing a partial orientation of mixed lineal and planar nature (the so-called ‘Stroeven-concept’). The practical cases are elaborated of prevailing compressive and tensile stresses. This reduces the number of unknown crack portions to two. As a consequence, quantitatively analyzing the image patterns can be restricted to vertical sections only.

In this work tungsten-oxide thin films were obtained by electron-beam deposition and annealed in the temperature range 350 - 800 °C for 1 - 3 h. The structure, morphology and phase composition of the as-deposited and annealed films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM and AFM. The changes of phase composition and the microstructure in dependence of the annealing conditions are described in detail. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the phase transformations for different annealing conditions {{is influenced by the}} very high macrostresses that appear as an additional, independent thermodynamic factor. During annealing at 350 - 400 °C for 1 - 3 h and at 800 °C for 1 h predominantly semiconductor phases are formed, whereas the thin films annealed at 500 - 600 °C for 1 - 3 h and 800 °C for 2 h consist mainly of phases with more pronounced metallic properties.

However, as we will demonstrate, the experimental mobility data can be consistently described {{within the framework of}} incoherent, hopping-type transport modeled by Levich-Jortner rates, explicitly accounting for the inner and outer relaxation energies related to thermally induced lattice effects and enhanced electron-phonon interaction at elevated temperatures. Complementary band-structure calculations yielding temperature dependent effective mass tensors deviate stronger from experimentally observed spatially anisotropic transport behavior. Thus, these results hint at the fact that by the particular interplay of the transport energies the mobility of a given organic semiconducting material might appear to be band-like in a certain temperature regime even though the underlying charge carrier transport can be of incoherent, hopping-type nature. Building on this description, we further explore the role of the intermolecular electronic coupling and develop a procedure to distinguish between its dependence on static and dynamic lattice deformation upon temperature variation...|$|R

Erebus volcano contains a convecting phonolite lava lake, presumably {{connected to a}} magma chamber at depth. It {{is one of the}} few open vent volcanoes that allow a direct observation of source processes during explosions. Its lava lake is the source of frequent violent Strombolian explosions, caused by large gas bubbles bursting at the lake surface. The exact mechanism of these bubble bursts is unclear, as is the mechanism of the creation of the infrasound signal accompanying the explosions. We use the Doppler radar data to calculate the directivity of Strombolian eruptions at Erebus. This allows us to derive information about the expected type of infrasound source pattern (i. e. the role of a dipole in addition to the monopole signature) and the physical structure of the volcano. We recorded 10 large explosions simultaneously with three radars, enabling us to calculate time series of 3 D directivity vectors (i. e. effectively 4 D), which describe the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> expansion <b>of</b> the gas bubble during an explosion. Such directivity information allows a comparison to dipole infrasound radiation patterns recorded during similar explosions only a few weeks later. Video observations of explosions support our interpretation of the measurements. We conclude that at Erebus, the directivity of explosions is mainly controlled by random processes. Since the geometry of the uppermost conduit is assumed to have a large effect on the directivity of explosions, the results suggest a largely symmetrical uppermost conduit with a vertical axis of symmetry. For infrasound recordings, a significant dipole signature can be expected in addition to the predominant monopole signature...|$|R

The diffraction pattern generated allows to determine the chemical composition or phase composition of the film, the texture <b>of</b> the film (<b>preferred</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> crystallites), the crystallite size and presence of film stress. According to this method the sample is scanned in a wide-angle X-ray goniometer, and the scattering intensity is plotted {{as a function of}} the 2θ angle. X-ray diffraction is a non destructive method of characterization of solid materials. When X-rays are directed in solids they will scatter in predictable patterns based upon the internal structure of the solid. A crystalline solid consists of regularly spaced atoms (electrons) that can be described by imaginary planes. The distance between these planes is called the d-spacing. The intensity of the d-space pattern is directly proportional to the number of electrons (atoms) that are found in the imaginary planes. Every crystalline solid will have a unique pattern of d-spacings (known as the powder pattern), which is a “finger print” for that solid. In fact solids with the same chemical composition but different phases can be identified by their pattern of d-spacings.|$|R

Within each species, the particles try to achieve polar alignment of their velocity vectors, whereas we analyze the cases <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> polar, antiparallel, as well as perpendicular alignment between particles of different species. Our {{focus is on the}} effect that the interplay between the two species has on the threshold densities for the onset of collective motion and {{on the nature of the}} solutions above onset. For this purpose, we start from suitable Langevin equations in the particle picture, from which we derive mean field equations of the Fokker-Planck type and finally macroscopic continuum field equations. We perform particle simulations of the Langevin equations, linear stability analyses of the Fokker-Planck and macroscopic continuum equations, and we numerically solve the Fokker-Planck equations. Both, spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions are investigated, where the latter correspond to stripe-like flocks of collectively moving particles. In general, the interaction between the two species reduces the threshold density for the onset of collective motion of each species. However, this interaction also reduces the spatial organization in the stripe-like flocks. The most interesting behavior is found for the case <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> perpendicular <b>alignment</b> between different species. There, a competition between polar and truly nematic orientational ordering of the velocity vectors takes place within each particle species. Finally, depending on the alignment rule for particles of different species and within certain ranges of particle densities, identical and inverted spatial density profiles can be found for the two particle species.
