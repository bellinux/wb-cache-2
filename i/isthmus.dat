40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeRecent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{a high incidence of}} <b>isthmuses</b> in mandibular first molar mesial roots, and intratubular mineralization following mineral trioxide aggregate obturation. This study assessed the filling quality of three obturation techniques in the apical 5  mm of mandibular first molar mesial root canals. Materials and methodsSixty extracted human mandibular first molar mesial roots with two separate canals that had interconnecting <b>isthmuses,</b> were prepared to an apical size of 40 / 0. 06. They were allocated to three groups of 20 roots for obturation by either cold lateral compaction (CLC) or the continuous wave of condensation (CW) that used gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer, or by an orthograde canal obturation using OrthoMTA. The obturated roots were scanned by micro-computed tomography and assessed for the volumetric ratio (%) of gutta-percha, sealer, and OrthoMTA within the main canals or <b>isthmuses</b> in the apical 5  mm area. Measurements were analyzed statistically for differences among three obturation techniques. ResultsIn the main canals, filled volume ratios were not significantly different among groups. Within <b>isthmuses,</b> the filled volume ratio for CLC was lower than in CW (P =  0. 025) or OrthoMTA (P =  0. 002). In <b>isthmuses,</b> the gutta-percha volume ratio in CLC was lower than in CW (P =  0. 005), although the sealer volume ratio was higher than in CW (P =  0. 049). ConclusionCLC demonstrated lower filling densities in <b>isthmuses</b> in the apical region than either CW or OrthoMTA. Orthograde MTA obturation showed comparable filling quality to gutta-percha with sealer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the mesiobuccal root of maxillary first molars, according to the root canal configuration, prevalence and location of <b>isthmuses</b> at 3 and 6 mm from the apex, comparing cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) analysis and cross sectioning of roots by thirds. Images of the mesiobuccal root of 100 maxillary first molars were acquired by CBCT and then roots were cross-sectioned into two parts, starting at 3 mm from the apex. Data were recorded and analyzed according to Weine's classification for root canal configuration, and Hsu and Kim's classification for <b>isthmuses.</b> In the analysis of CBCT images, 8 root canals were classified as type I, 57 as type II, 35 as type III. In the cross-sectioning technique, 19 root canals were classified as type I, 60 as type II, 20 as type III and 1 as type IV. The classification of <b>isthmuses</b> was predominantly type I in both CBCT and cross-sectioning evaluations for sections at 3 mm from the apex, while for sections at 6 mm from the apex, the classification of <b>isthmuses</b> was predominantly types V and II in CBCT and cross-sectioning evaluations, respectively. The cross-sectioning technique showed better results in detection of the internal morphology of root canals than CBCT scanning...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} ex vivo, {{the root}} canal morphology of the MB root of maxillary first molar teeth {{by means of}} micro-computed tomography. Methodology: Thirty extracted intact human maxillary first molar teeth were selected for micro-tomographic analysis (SkyScan 1072, Aartselaar, Belgium) with a slice thickness of 38. 0 m. The following data regarding the MB root were analysed and recorded: number and type of root canals, prevalence of <b>isthmuses,</b> prevalence of intercanal connections, presence of accessory canals, presence of loops and number of apical foramina. Results: The MB 2 canal was present in 80 % of specimens and was independent in 42 % of these cases. When present, the MB 2 canal merged with the MB 1 canal in 58 % of cases. Communications between the two canals were found in all specimens, with <b>isthmuses</b> in 71 % of the cases. These communications and <b>isthmuses</b> were respectively in 42 % and 54 % of the cases in the coronal third, in 59 % and 79 % of the cases in the middle third and in 24 % and 50 % of the cases in the apical third. A single apical foramen was found in 37 % of specimens, two apical foramina were present in 23 % of the cases, with three or more separate apical foramina occurring in 40 % of the specimens. Conclusions: The MB root canal anatomy was complex: {{a high incidence of}} MB 2 root canals, <b>isthmuses,</b> accessory canals, apical delta and loops was found. © 2008 International Endodontic Journal...|$|R

40|$|P>Aim To {{compare the}} {{percentage}} of gutta-percha, sealer and voids {{and the influence of}} <b>isthmuses</b> in mesial root canals of mandibular molars filled with different techniques. Methodology Canals in 60 mesial roots of mandibular first molars were prepared with ProTaper instruments to size F 2 (size 25, 0. 08 taper) and filled using a single-cone, lateral compaction, System B or Thermafil techniques. An epoxy resin sealer was labelled with Rhodamine-B dye to allow analysis under a confocal microscope. The percentage of gutta-percha, sealer and area of voids was calculated at 2, 4 and 6 mm from the apex, using Image Tool 3. 0 software. Statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (P < 0. 05). The influence of <b>isthmuses</b> on {{the presence or absence of}} voids was evaluated using the Fisher test. Results At the 2 mm level, {{the percentage of}} gutta-percha, sealer and voids was similar amongst the System B, lateral compaction and single-cone techniques. The single-cone technique revealed significantly less gutta-percha, more sealer and voids in comparison with the Thermafil technique at the 2 and 4 mm level (P < 0. 05). The analysis of all sections (2, 4 and 6 mm) revealed that more gutta-percha and less sealer and voids were found in root canals filled with Thermafil and System B techniques (P < 0. 05). The Fisher test revealed that the presence of <b>isthmuses</b> increased the occurence of voids in the lateral compaction group only (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Gutta-percha, sealer filled area and voids were dependent on the canal-filling technique. The presence of <b>isthmuses</b> may influence the quality of root filling.

5000|$|Island Eddy {{consists}} of three low islets, inter-linked and flanked by extensive <b>isthmuses</b> and spits. At the south-west {{end of the island}} a number of the latter combine to form a large lagoon-like area, and a second series also define another 'lagoon' towards the eastern end. These are known locally as [...] "Malluirs", probably because they fill and drain up to and hour behind the normal tidal pattern. They are labelled as the North Mallmhuir and the South Mallmhuir, respectively. The islets are probably partially submerged drumlins while the <b>isthmuses</b> and spits are largely composed of sea-rolled cobbles and shingle. At the eastern extremity of the island there is a long sinuous sand-spit called [...] "the cush", which allows access to the island by foot at certain spring tides.|$|R

The rest of the Perekop <b>Isthmus</b> was captured slowly and with some difficulty; Manstein complained of a lack of air support to contest Soviet air superiority in the region. He next created a mobile reconnaissance unit to press down the peninsula, cutting the road between Simferopol and Sevastopol on 31 October. Simferopol was captured the next day.

5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies.

They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the <b>isthmus</b> was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E

An estimated 7,000 were left homeless along the Oaxacan coast and on the <b>Isthmus</b> of Tehuantepec. In addition, travel from the <b>isthmus</b> was cut off due to mudslides that blocked portions of the Pan-American Highway. Two rivers threatened to overflow their banks while the Benito, Juarez, and Yosocuta dams attained peak capacity and thus the gates were opened to prevent overflowing. A total of 42 communities were flooded. The cities of Tehuantepec, Salina Cruz, Juchtianm, and Tuxtepec were flooded due to extended periods of torrential rains.
