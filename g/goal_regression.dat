40|$|Analytical {{learning}} {{is a set of}} machine learning techniques for revising the representation of a theory based on a small set of examples of that theory. When the representation of the theory is correct and complete but perhaps inefficient, an important objective of such analysis is to improve the computational efficiency of the representation. Several algorithms with this purpose have been suggested, most of which are closely tied to a first order logical language and are variants of <b>goal</b> <b>regression,</b> such as the familiar explanation based generalization (EBG) procedure. But because predicate calculus is a poor representation for some domains, these learning algorithms are extended to apply to other computational models. It is shown that the <b>goal</b> <b>regression</b> technique applies to a large family of programming languages, all based on a kind of term rewriting system. Included in this family are three language families of importance to artificial intelligence: logic programming, such as Prolog; lambda calculus, such as LISP; and combinatorial based languages, such as FP. A new analytical learning algorithm, AL- 2, is exhibited that learns from success but is otherwise quite different from EBG. These results suggest that term rewriting systems are a good framework for analytical learning research in general, and that further research should be directed toward developing new techniques...|$|E

We propose a tight integration between the logical and geometric aspects of planning.

Given this representation and some simple mechanisms for geometric inference, we characterize the pre-conditions and effects of robot actions in terms of these logical entities. We then reason about the interaction of the geometric and non-geometric aspects of our domains using the general-purpose mechanism of <b>goal</b> <b>regression</b> (also known as pre-image backchaining). We propose an aggressive mechanism for temporal hierarchical decomposition, which postpones the pre-conditions of actions to create an abstraction hierarchy that both limits the lengths of plans that need to be generated and limits the set of objects relevant to each plan.

More exactly, the problem that this thesis tackles {{is to develop a}} way for robots to explain their actions {{in order to make it}} easier for engineers, users and for the audience to understand what the robot is actually trying to achieve. Another problem that this thesis tackles is that the tasks of the robots may not be precisely defined upfront. In such cases, tasks cannot be solved by a fixed, predefined task plan. Thus, I also show how to enable the user to create custom scenarios that the robot successfully resolves. These two problems are resolved by using planning. More specifically, the initial state of the robot and the goals that need to be achieved are defined by the user. After that, the robot, using the <b>goal</b> <b>regression</b> algorithm, creates a plan in order to achieve the goals. Each action of the plan is explained using an explanation algorithm. The algorithm takes into account the immediate and indirect goals the actions achieve.

Chi square analyses addressed the relationship between reading level and success course enrollment and between success course enrollment and retention (2 nd and 4 th semester), momentum points (enrollment into developmental writing and gateway writing courses), and milestones (completing an associate’s degree or transfer- ready status). The results demonstrate a small (6 - 10 %) but consistent effect of enrollment in the success course in facilitating the acquisition of academic <b>goals.</b> <b>Regression</b> analyses evaluated the demographic characteristics associated with these variables.
