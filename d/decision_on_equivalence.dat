40|$|Increase in system level {{modeling}} {{has given}} rise to a need for efficient functional validation of models above cycle accurate level. This paper presents a tool for comparing system level models, before and after a refinement. Verifiable refinements include mapping functionality in the specification to platform components, static scheduling of functions mapped to a component and routing of transactions across components. The verification tool starts by abstracting the input models into a control and data dependency graph representation. A series of functionality preserving transformations is then applied to the graphs in order to normalize them. Finally, the normalized graphs are checked for isomorphism and a <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the <b>equivalence</b> of models is returned.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of equivalents {{began as a}} tool creating judicial flexibility to shield patent holders from piracy through minor variations on their inventions. Over time, two trends have transformed it from shield to sword. First, plaintiffs have persuaded courts to allow claims of infringement by equivalents even {{where there is no}} evidence of copying or other fraud. Second, as juries have decided more and more infringement cases, their sympathy for patent holders has had a greater impact on equivalents cases. Together, these trends have worked a gross distortion on the {{doctrine of}} equivalents. The doctrine should not be used to extend patent coverage, leaving the public unable to determine the exact scope of a patent 2 ̆ 7 s claims. Instead, application of the doctrine should be limited to cases where fraud or other equitable factors justify departure from the patent 2 ̆ 7 s terms. Further, <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> infringement by <b>equivalence</b> should be made by judges in their equitable capacity, not by juries...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the nature}} of the {{association}} between age (7 – 11 years) and performance <b>on</b> mathematical <b>equivalence</b> problems (e. g., 7 � 4 � 5 � 7 � __) ? Many prevailing theories suggest that there should be a positive association. However, change-resistance accounts (e. g., N. M. McNeil & M. W. Alibali, 2005 b) predict a U-shaped association. The purpose of the present research was to test these differing predictions. Results from two studies supported a change-resistance account. In the first study (N � 87), performance <b>on</b> <b>equivalence</b> problems declined between the ages of 7 and 9 and improved between the ages of 9 and 11. The decrements in performance between the ages of 7 and 9 were then replicated in a second study (N � 35).

The order → for directed graphs is again a distributive lattice and a Heyting algebra, with join and meet operations defined as before. However, it is not dense. There is also a category with directed graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows, which is again a cartesian closed category.|$|R
