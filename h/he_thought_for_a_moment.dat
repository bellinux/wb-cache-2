60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence. Then {{he shook}} his head sorrowfully.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{had never}} asked himself, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before replying.|$|E
60|$|John laughed quietly. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then beckoned to the {{hovering}} waiter.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{and then}} he said, [...] "I must really give it up. I cannot tell, {{for the life of}} me, why a man has two eyes. Do you know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{wait and}} I'll {{tell you all}} about it--maybe." [...] And then Spouter stopped short, struck by <b>a</b> sudden idea. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds and then his face broke into a broad smile.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> space, {{and then}} removed his boot {{and sat with}} it on his knee. [...] "Of course!... all that he said was wrong--quite wrong. Right is right and {{cheating}} is cheating, whatever you say about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "Can you {{remember}} any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?" [...] he asked, {{looking at her}} across the table.|$|E
6000|$|Once {{more the}} man was bewildered. This time, however, it was bewilderment of a {{different}} sort. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> steadfastly. Who was there who could have betrayed him? ...|$|E
60|$|Douglas hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of De Quincey's Ann {{wandering}} out of {{the mists}} to cross the bridge with weary footsteps, and turned towards the girl with a courtesy which was almost tenderness.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute or}} two before he {{answered}} her. Perhaps the man would be more impressed if the message came to him through his wife. [...] "If {{you think that he}} will not be annoyed with you, you may do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleasant extinction," [...] said Graham. [...] "Yet--." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. [...] "There is {{that other}} thing--the Crowd, the great mass of poor men. Will that die out? That will not die out. And it suffers, its {{suffering}} is a force that even you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|LILY--[Who has wandered to {{window on}} right.] You mean {{you think he}} believes--Well, I don't. And you had better {{be careful not to}} let him guess what you think. [Pointing outside.] There's my proof. There he is walking about with Bigelow. Can you imagine Curt doing that--if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The father read {{it with an}} {{ejaculation}} of 'Thank God,' {{the aunt}} answered with a cry of horror, so that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> she had supposed he said 'dropped him into the sea,' and repeated 'Liverpool Workhouse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rascal!" [...] howled Josiah Crabtree. [...] "Oh, {{wait till}} I {{get my hands}} on him! But I must get the teeth first." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "Fenwick, find Snuggers and send him to me at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't have a {{face like}} that," [...] {{proceeded}} the child, with {{a good deal of}} earnestness, [...] "not if you gave me a million dollars." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then corrected himself. [...] "Two million dollars!" [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|He felt so {{overwhelmed}} by despair that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant of {{putting an end}} to his life. 'Can I survive my misfortunes?' he cried. 'I fancied I had come to an end of my troubles, and now they are worse than ever. What will become of me? Never can I discover the place where this monster will hide Rosalie.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{wonderful}} {{that they have}} come round," [...] Henriette said. [...] "It was lucky my husband had some brandy in the boat. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time <b>he</b> would never bring the youngest round. They are only young girls. What harm could they have done that those monsters at Nantes should try to murder them? There is no fear, I hope, that any in the village will {{say a word about}} it." ...|$|R
40|$|Ted Fischer {{had a big}} {{realization}} because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} that money was the answer <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good life. As we keep rediscovering the wheel of human happiness, we found it several times before, only to forget; as we pass our New Year resolutions, only to forget: There are four paths for the realization of direct experience of the union between the individual consciousness and the universal consciousness, the Yoga: Jnana Yoga, Bhakt...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seven of you, eh?" [...] was the teacher's sour comment. [...] "A fine {{piece of}} business, truly." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "Come with me, all of you, and we'll see what {{damage has been}} done down in the office." ...|$|E
60|$|The limpid air {{softened}} his heart; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that if {{he could}} wander aimlessly with Mary, gossiping without purpose, they might end by understanding one another. The sun, the wild flowers, the inconstant breeze, might help to create a new feeling.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then {{remembered a}} deep hollow {{which he had}} {{encountered}} but a short while before. Gazing around, {{to make certain that}} nobody was watching him, he picked up the unconscious lad and stalked off with the form, back into the jungle and up a small hill.|$|E
60|$|She {{was really}} like her sister <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> {{impressed}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment by the soft brilliancy of her smile. Her fingers rested upon his.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked him}} how he {{proposed}} I should discover the owner of the cat. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, and then suggested that I might follow it home. I did not feel inclined to argue with him any more after that; I should only have said things that would have made the matter worse. As it was, that night's sport cost me twelve marks; and not a single one of the four German officials who interviewed me on the subject could see anything ridiculous in the proceedings from beginning to end.|$|R
60|$|They laughed {{over his}} voracity, and he promised {{it should be}} held in check as to the point which <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment might be worked so {{effectively}} into the play.|$|R
60|$|But he paused. He {{looked at}} poor Mrs. Brixham's scared face; and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{to himself that}} the man brought to bay and in prison might make {{disclosures}} which had best be kept secret, {{and that it was}} best not to deal too fiercely with a desperate man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{go after}} him by that short cut," [...] {{answered}} Dave. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> To hunt up Roger and get him to go along might take too long. He looked at the farmer. [...] "Would {{you like to go}} with me? I'll make it worth your while," [...] he continued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody knows," [...] {{said the}} other, shaking his head. [...] "The thing is, {{as you are}} here, {{it seems to me}} that things couldn’t have been otherwise. They were all arranged. When your father went up North in that light-hearted fashion, I don’t suppose <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that you’d be sitting here to-day {{worrying}} over one of the results of his journey." ...|$|E
60|$|Moreover, he {{said that}} the Walwyn {{property}} had been sequestered, but no one had yet purchased it, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fair sum, it might be redeemed for the family.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} at Löbnitz (today a part of Groitzsch) in Saxony, the {{daughter}} of the ducal Mecklenburg-Schwerin chamberlain and later Hofmarschall Joachim Otto Ulrich von Levetzow. The seventeen-year-old girl first met Goethe in 1821 at Marienbad and again at Carlsbad in 1822 and 1823. The poet, then 72, was so carried away with her wit and beauty that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time of marrying her and urged Grand Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach to ask for her hand in his name. Rejected, he left for Thuringia and addressed to her the poems which he afterward called Trilogie der Leidenschaft. These poems include the famous Marienbad Elegy.|$|R
60|$|The agent stated his {{willingness}} to supply land of whatever sort Jimmy needed, but <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambitious young man, the proper investment was a city building lot. In fact, he {{had a number of}} useful lots on a first-class frontage. Jimmy studied the map and remarked that the town had not got there yet. The agent declared the town would get there soon, and to wait until the streets were graded and prices went up was a fool's plan. Jimmy stated he would not speculate; if the price were suitable, he might buy land in the Kelshope valley on the other map.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and went}} on: [...] "Love is {{something}} that has to be taken care of. One has to be so careful.... It's a beautiful plant, but a tender one.... I didn't know. I've a dread of love dropping its petals, becoming mean and ugly. How can I tell you all I feel? I love you beyond measure. And I'm afraid.... I'm anxious, joyfully anxious, like a man when he has found a treasure." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that {{he would}} tell her that the Lord loved her; but there was {{something}} human at his heart, something perhaps too human, which made him feel that were he down low upon the ground, some love that was nearer to him, some love that was more easily intelligible, which had been more palpably felt, would in his frailty and his wickedness be of more immediate avail to him than the love even of the Lord God.|$|E
60|$|Oh! {{what would}} not Billy have given {{at that time}} to have been {{thoroughly}} wide-awake and fresh! <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of awaking his father, but the thought was only half formed ere sleep again weighed down his spirit, causing his eyelids to blink despite his utmost efforts to keep them open. Presently he saw Graddy draw the right oar quietly into the boat, without ceasing to row with the left one, and slowly draw the knife which hung at his belt.|$|E
6000|$|But there arose {{to him the}} {{question}} whether all this had not arrived too late! Of {{what good is it}} to open up the true delights of life to a man when you have so scotched and wounded him that he has no capability left of enjoying anything? As he sat lonely with his pipe in his mouth <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while that <b>he</b> would decline the invitation. The idea of selling Chowton Farm and of establishing himself at some Antipodes in which the name of Mary Masters should never have been heard, was growing upon him. Of what use would the friendship of Lord Rufford be to him at {{the other side of the}} globe? ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the officer}} {{had seen him}} to the porch, he returned, and again {{unlocking}} and unbarring {{the door of the}} cell, set it wide open, informing its inmate that he was at liberty to walk in the adjacent yard, if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> proper, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|R
50|$|Raousset-Boulbon {{arrived in}} San Francisco and felt deeply disillusioned after not {{receiving}} the treatment <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> was deserved <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Count.|$|R
