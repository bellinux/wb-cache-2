5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridization.</b> Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} uses {{in vitro}} biological assays such as PCR-ELISA or Fluorescence <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridization.</b> The assay detects a molecule, often in low concentrations, {{that is a}} marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. Preservation of the sample before analysis is critical. Manual handling should be minimised. The fragile RNA molecule poses certain challenges. As part of the cellular process of expressing genes as proteins, it offers a measure of gene expression but it is vulnerable to hydrolysis and breakdown by ever-present RNAse enzymes. Samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or incubated in preservation agents.|$|E

40|$|Specimens from 26 condylomatous lesions, 24 {{invasive}} cancer cells, and 33 cervices, without {{evidence of the}} diseases, were tested {{for the presence of}} human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by Southern blot <b>hybridization,</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> filter <b>hybridization,</b> or <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> tissue <b>hybridization</b> methods. A total of 89 % (23 of 26) of the condylomatous lesions contained HPV DNAs, as determined by {{one or more of the}} methods. The positive rates for the detection of HPV DNA in condylomas by the different methods were 82 % for Southern blot hybridization, 62 % for <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> filter <b>hybridization,</b> and 72 % for <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> tissue <b>hybridization.</b> Among the specimens from patients with cancer, HPV DNA was found in 83 % (19 of 23) by one or more of the methods.

Thirteen percent of the control cervices were positive for HPV DNA by one or more of the assays.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> and RNase {{protection}} assays {{have been}} used to characterize nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gene expression in the developing and adult rat retina. At the earliest time examined (embryonic day 13) a low level of [alpha]- 3 and [beta]- 4 gene expression could be detected. During the next 48 hr there was a dramatic induction of the [alpha]- 3, [alpha]- 4, [beta]- 2, [beta]- 3 and [beta]- 4 genes in the recently differentiated retinal ganglion cells. By post-natal day 4 we detected nAChR gene expression in the inner nuclear layer. In the adult retina, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> showed these genes are expressed by cells residing in the ganglion and inner nuclear layers. These results suggest a common regulatory mechanism for the induction of nAChR expression in retinal ganglion cells during development. In addition, the variety of nAChR genes expressed in the retina imply a relatively large number of different types of nAChRs can be expressed by these cells...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} cDNAs encoding four additional mitotic-like cyclins from Arabidopsis: cyc 2 aAt, cyc 2 bAt, cyc 3 aAt, and cyc 3 bAt. Examination of {{amino acid}} sequences deduced from plant cyclin cDNAs isolated so far showed {{that they can}} be grouped into three distinct classes. The members of each plant cyclin family are more related to each other than to any animal or yeast cyclin. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that cyc 2 aAt was expressed in all plant organs, whereas cyc 2 bAt mRNAs were found only in roots; cyc 3 aAt was not expressed in leaves and was barely expressed in flowers. On the other hand, cyc 3 bAt transcripts were observed in all organs. Whole-mount <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> on roots showed that the cyclin mRNAs were confined to parts of the roots with mitotic activity. Furthermore, results of whole-mount <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> on roots treated with either oryzalin or hydroxyurea suggest that the different cyclin classes have distinct functions in the cell cycle...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the chordate body plan is still unresolved. Notochord evolution can be studied with two tunicatesâ€”the tailed M. oculata and the tailless M. occulta. The tailed M. oculata has 40 notochord cells that are converged and extended. The tailless M. occulta does not form a tail in their larval stage as it only has 20 notochord cells that have not converged or extended. A hypothesis {{for the loss of}} notochord cells in M. occulta is that the notochord cells are being destroyed by apoptosis (programmed cell death). In this study, preparations for studying programmed cell death (PCD) using two genes Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD 2) and Programmed cell death interacting protein 6 (PCDIP 6) were made for <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations.</b> A cell death assay and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> will be done in the future on a variety of developmental stages of both the tailed and tailless species to assess differential regulation of the PCD genes.

40|$|Type VII collagen, {{a genetically}} {{distinct}} {{member of the}} collagen family, {{is present in the}} cutaneous basement membrane zone as an integral component of the anchoring fibrils. We have recently isolated several cDNAs that correspond to human type VII collagen sequences. One of these cDNAs (clone K- 131) was utilized to examine type VII collagen gene expression in cultures of human cells by Northern analyses, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> and indirect immunofluorescence. Northern hybridizations revealed the presence of an approximately 9 -kb mRNA transcript, and indicated a high level of expression in epidermal keratinocytes as well as in an oral epidermoid carcinoma cell line (KB), while the expression was considerably lower in skin fibroblasts and in several virally or spontaneously transformed epithelial cell lines. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> of cultured keratinocytes supported the notion of a high level of gene expression. Indirect immunofluorescence of skin from a 19 -wk fetus revealed type VII collagen gene expression at the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone.
