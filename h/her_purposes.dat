25|$|One of the {{interests}} of collectors and EJO Society members is finding and visiting the original sites used by Oxenham in her books. As well as the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire area which is the background for Girls of the Hamlet Club and the village of Washford, Somerset where Cleeve Abbey is situated, Oxenham used parts of Sussex, Wales, Lancashire, the English Lake District and Scotland for the settings of several books. The UK Society holds a biennial meeting at Halsway Manor in the summer, which includes folk-dancing and tours of nearby Cleeve Abbey {{as if it were the}} fictional one. These places are not always depicted in the books exactly as the real sites; Oxenham was writing fiction, and given that she could move an abbey several hundred miles for <b>her</b> <b>purposes,</b> changing a few names and telescoping or stretching distances was also well within her remit.|$|E
2500|$|Wilhelm Gustloff was {{the first}} {{purpose-built}} cruise liner for the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF) and used by subsidiary organisation Kraft durch Freude (KdF) (Strength Through Joy). <b>Her</b> <b>purposes</b> were to provide recreational and cultural activities for German functionaries and workers, including concerts, cruises, and other holiday trips, and as a public relations tool, to present [...] "a more acceptable image of the Third Reich." [...] She was the flagship of the KdF cruise fleet, her last civilian role, until the spring of 1939.|$|E
2500|$|Efforts of will {{theory is}} related to the role of will power in {{decision}} making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events – and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of volition have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of Robert Kane, where he hypothesizes that [...] "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of <b>her</b> <b>purposes</b> – a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort." [...] According to Robert Kane such [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] is a required condition for free will. An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see non-reductive physicalism).|$|E
60|$|So she {{dismissed}} Mrs. Inchbare, when Mrs. Inchbare {{had served}} <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
60|$|She evidently couldn't {{think of}} any vehicle mean enough for <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
60|$|But she was obstinately set in <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b> She {{picked up}} a short stick of firewood.|$|R
2500|$|María Ruíz de Burton's unique {{position}} as an insider (and consequently an outsider) {{on both sides}} of the US/Mexican border afforded her an ideal perspective from which to view the political tempest taking place between the two nations. She would always see the rising hegemony of the Anglo-American cultural, economic, and political spheres from a Latin-American frame of reference, but she was uniquely able to penetrate that same dominant society and manipulate its system to serve <b>her</b> <b>purposes.</b> Her anti-imperialist ideals were made all the more potent by her understanding of and interaction with the United States. By stripping down and criticizing the complex organization of US policy, she learned that those very constructs could be used as a key component in playing their game. Ruíz de Burton was an extraordinary woman in her time, because she was able to assume different, and often opposing identities to suit her needs. Her position as an insider granted her access to the same political, legal and economic system that she critiques in her literature, while still managing to maintain the standpoint of a distrustful [...] "other".|$|E
60|$|Judith hesitated, {{and some}} {{powerful}} emotion was struggling within her. Then, as if determined {{to look down}} all weaknesses, and accomplish <b>her</b> <b>purposes</b> at every hazard, she spoke more plainly.|$|E
60|$|Just {{right for}} her and <b>her</b> <b>purposes!</b> It threw all its light on my face, leaving in gloom the faces of both Pierre and the woman, who sat outside of me on each side.|$|E
60|$|But <b>her</b> <b>purpose</b> {{was firm}} and her incentive, the {{greatest}} {{that has ever}} spurred mankind to heroism.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia {{thought that}} they would be safe from {{interruption}} for a few minutes, which would serve <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{she only}} half {{accomplished}} <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b> By some accident, {{which has never}} been explained, {{and in spite of}} the stress of competition, she had purchased pure salts of potash for the execution of <b>her</b> fell <b>purpose</b> in place of adulterated salts of soda.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is quite}} pretty enough for <b>her</b> <b>purposes,</b> {{and it is}} a face and figure on which {{everything}} tells. If she were prettier she would be less intelligent, and her intelligence is half of her charm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A truly trained {{taste and}} eye would enable a lady to select from the {{permitted}} forms of fashion such {{as might be}} modified to <b>her</b> <b>purposes,</b> always remembering that simplicity is safe, that to attempt little and succeed is better than to attempt a great deal and fail.|$|E
60|$|The {{breaking}} day showed <b>her</b> <b>purposes</b> grotesque and monstrous. The revulsion {{that must}} come, {{came with a}} tide that swept before it all prepossessions, all affections. It {{seemed as if the}} child, still asleep in her crib, had heard what she said, and would help to hold her to her word.|$|E
60|$|Absorbed in the {{intensity}} of <b>her</b> <b>purpose,</b> she did not observe a peculiar little smile playing round Barbara's lips.|$|R
60|$|Having {{paid the}} tribute of a sigh to the {{instability}} of human existence, Flora hurried on with <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{very idea}} seemed to endorse Margaret's {{magnificent}} tribute to <b>her</b> <b>purpose,</b> {{and helped to}} calm my troubled spirit.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Isaac was borne along {{upon the}} lady's stream {{of words in}} a state of mulish reluctance, nodding, saying [...] "Of course" [...] and similar phrases, and wishing he was out of it all with an extreme manifestness. He drank his tea with unmistakable discomfort, and twice {{inserted}} into the conversation an entirely irrelevant remark that he had to be going. But Lady Beach-Mandarin had <b>her</b> <b>purposes</b> with him and crushed these quivering tentatives.|$|E
60|$|Hence Bathsheba {{lived in}} a {{perception}} that <b>her</b> <b>purposes</b> were broken off. She was not {{a woman who could}} hope on without good materials for the process, differing thus from the less far-sighted and energetic, though more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope goes on as a sort of clockwork which the merest food and shelter are sufficient to wind up; and perceiving clearly that her mistake had been a fatal one, she accepted her position, and waited coldly for the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah! {{my sweet}} Ghita, Sir Brown, or Sir White, or Sir Black {{has not yet}} got me. I am not a child, to tumble into the fire because the leading-strings are off; and le Feu-Follet shines or goes out, exactly as it suits <b>her</b> <b>purposes.</b> The frigate, ten to one, will just run close in and take a near look, and then square away and go to Livorno, where {{there is much more}} to amuse her officers, than here in Porto Ferrajo. This Sir Brown has his Ghita, as well as Raoul Yvard." ...|$|E
6000|$|She clambered up {{the steep}} ascent, [...] Though faint and weary, too; [...] But firmly did our Marian keep [...] <b>Her</b> <b>purpose</b> still in view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Prince. She still sits yonder in the tomb, {{resolute}} in <b>her</b> <b>purpose,</b> {{and giving}} {{no answer to}} those who come to reason with her." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus talking {{together}} they remained closeted for a most unconscionable time. Clara had had <b>her</b> <b>purpose</b> to carry out, and to Herbert the moments {{had been too}} precious to cause him any regret as they passed. But now at last a knock was heard at the door, and Lady Desmond, {{without waiting for an}} answer to it, entered the room. Clara immediately started from her seat, not as though she were either guilty or tremulous, but with a brave resolve to go on with <b>her</b> <b>purposed</b> plan.|$|R
60|$|Little, however, did Raoul Yvard, {{much as he}} prized her, know Ghita Caraccioli. Her {{nature was}} full of womanly sensibilities, it is true, and her heart replete with {{tenderness}} for him in particular; but the adoration she paid to God was of that lasting character which endures to the end. In all she said and felt, she was truth itself; and while no false shame interposed to cause her to conceal her attachment, there was a moral armor thrown about <b>her</b> <b>purposes</b> that rendered them impregnable to the assaults of the world.|$|E
60|$|Several {{times she}} drove over to Harrington, a large town some five miles away, which {{contained}} a furniture factory, {{and there she}} purchased many articles which would be suitable for the house, always securing the best things for <b>her</b> <b>purposes,</b> but frequently regretting that certain beautiful and imposing pieces of furniture were entirely unsuited to the capacity of her rooms and hallways. But when her dining-room should be finished, and the room above it, she would have better opportunity of gratifying her taste for handsome wood in imposing designs. Then {{it might be that}} Harrington {{would not be able to}} give her anything good enough.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not know}} this bold sailor {{as well as she}} loved him, and she was not at all sure that the plans he might make for her during his absence would suit her {{disposition}} or <b>her</b> <b>purposes.</b> Consequently, she resolved to submit her plans to him before he should write again. Above everything else, she wished to be {{in that part of the}} world at which Captain Horn might be expected to arrive when his present adventure should be accomplished. She did not wish to be sent for to go to France. She did not wish to be told that he was coming to America. Wherever he might land, there she would be.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed almost}} as though he read <b>her</b> <b>purpose</b> in <b>her</b> terror-stricken face, and it maddened him. He caught her by the wrist and thrust her back.|$|R
60|$|At that Valentina elbowed the Count aside, {{and forgetting}} <b>her</b> <b>purpose</b> of {{conducting}} this affair with dignity, {{she let her}} woman's tongue deliver the answer of her heart.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not answer}} him immediately, {{and he began to}} fear that she repented of <b>her</b> <b>purpose.</b> [...] "Because," [...] said he, [...] "under no other {{circumstances}} could I--" ...|$|R
60|$|Many {{would have}} thought the matured charms of the lady {{superior}} to the innocent-looking beauty of the girl; {{but no one could}} have come to such an opinion who saw them both at that moment. While Ghita's face was radiant with a holy hope and the pious earnestness which urged her on, a dark expression lowered about the countenance of the English beauty that deprived it of one of its greatest attractions by depriving it of the softness and gentleness of her sex. Had there not been observers of what passed, it is probable the girl would have been abruptly repulsed; but management formed no small part of the character of this woman, and she controlled her feelings in order to effect <b>her</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Passing {{into the}} garret just mentioned, Maud soon {{reached the door}} of the little room she sought. It was an {{apartment}} she had selected for painting, on account of the light from the loop, which in the morning was particularly favourable, though somewhat low. As she usually sat on a little stool, however, this difficulty was in some measure obviated; and, at all events, the place was made to answer <b>her</b> <b>purposes.</b> She kept the key herself, and the room, since Beulah's marriage in particular, was her sanctum; no one entering it unless conducted by its mistress. Occasionally, Little Smash was admitted with a broom; though Maud, for reasons known to herself, often preferred sweeping the small carpet that covered the centre of the floor, with her own fair hands, in preference to suffering another to intrude.|$|E
60|$|In short, and to sum up, America, betaking {{herself to}} {{formative}} action, (as {{it is about}} time for more solid achievement, and less windy promise,) must, for <b>her</b> <b>purposes,</b> cease to recognize a theory of character grown of feudal aristocracies, or form'd by merely literary standards, or from any ultramarine, full-dress formulas of culture, polish, caste, &c., and must sternly promulgate her own new standard, yet old enough, and accepting the old, the perennial elements, and combining them into groups, unities, appropriate to the modern, the democratic, the west, and to the practical occasions and needs of our own cities, and of the agricultural regions. Ever the most precious in the common. Ever the fresh breeze of field, or hill, or lake, is more than any palpitation of fans, though of ivory, and redolent with perfume; and the air {{is more than the}} costliest perfumes.|$|E
6000|$|She {{offered a}} letter, {{and with her}} steady eyes upon him, <b>her</b> <b>purpose</b> {{strengthening}} as she looked, stood watching the changes of that expressive countenance. This was the letter: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} a base {{advantage}} of our confidence," [...] burst in Mrs. Arrowpoint, unable to carry out <b>her</b> <b>purpose</b> and leave the burden of speech to her husband.|$|R
60|$|She {{had spoken}} quietly, dispassionately, and with firm, {{unbending}} resolution. <b>Her</b> <b>purpose</b> {{was to make}} that young man trust and help her, for she could do nothing without him.|$|R
