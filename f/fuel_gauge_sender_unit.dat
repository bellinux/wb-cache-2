50|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} electrical systems {{that may be}} used in autogas systems - <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>sender,</b> <b>fuel</b> shut-off, closed loop feedback mixture control and injection control.|$|R
50|$|In some installations, the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>sender</b> {{fitted to}} the autogas tank is matched to the {{original}} <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> in the vehicle. In others, an additional gauge is added to display the level of fuel in the autogas tank separately from the existing petrol gauge.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gauge</b> <b>sender</b> {{is usually}} a magnetically coupled arrangement, with a float arm inside the tank {{rotating}} a magnet, which rotates an external gauge. The external gauge is usually readable directly, and most also incorporate an electronic sender to operate a <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> on the dashboard.|$|R
50|$|A digital {{tachograph}} system {{consists of a}} digital driver card, the tachograph head, and a <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> mounted to the vehicle gearbox. The <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> produces electronic pulses as the gearbox output shaft turns. These pulses are interpreted as speed data by the head.|$|R
50|$|As {{a legacy}} of the V8's {{beginnings}} as a straight-4 design the <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> for the temperature gauge is located in one cylinder head (rather than a point of the cooling system common to both heads as on other multi-bank engines). This means that problems can go undetected in one head until enough damage and/or overheating has occurred to affect the one fitted with the <b>sender</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R

40|$|Chaotic {{system may}} lead to instability, extreme {{sensitivity}} and performance reduction in control systems. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} causes of such undesirable characteristics in control system especially in the automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges.</b> This is because without accurate <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> in automobile systems, it will be difficult if not impossible to embark on a journey whether during odd hours of the day or where fuel is difficult to obtain. To this end, this work studied the impacts of fuel tank rust and faulty component of <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> system (voltage stabilizer) on the chaotic characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges.</b> The results obtained were analyzed using Graph iSOFT package. Over the range of experiments conducted, the results obtained showed that rust effect of the fuel tank would alter the flow density, consequently the fluid pressure and ultimately the flow velocity of the fuel. The responses of the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> pointer to the faulty voltage stabilizer were erratic causing noticeable instability of gauge measurands indicated. The experiment also showed that the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> performed optimally by indicating the highest degree of accuracy when combined the effect of rust free tank and non-faulty voltage stabilizer conditions (± 6. 75 % measurand error) as compared to only the rust free tank situation (± 15 % measurand error) and only the non-faulty voltage stabilizer condition (± 40 % measurand error). The study concludes that both the fuel tank rust and the faulty voltage stabilizer gauge component {{have a significant effect on}} the sensitivity of <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> and its accuracy ultimately. Also, by the reason of literature, our findings can also be said to be valid for all other fluid meters and gauges applicable in plant machineries and most hydraulic systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how knowledge properties of a transferred manufacturing activity between units {{in an international}} manufacturing network impact performance during the transfer phase and the phase after steady state is reached. Survey data from 178 companies, we use hierarchical regression to test the relationships. We find knowledge properties as a group significantly affect both performance measures when controlling {{for the effects of}} <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> experience, <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> size and receiver unit experience. Thus, the activities transferred impact the success of the transfer. <b>Sender</b> <b>unit</b> experience and receiver unit experience have relatively strongest performance effects after steady state is reached. Testing the performance effects of single knowledge property dimensions, we identify independency to have the strongest relative performance effect, validates and advances previous research. This as {{it is one of the}} first survey studies to link activity independency and manufacturing transfer performance. We also identify several strands of further research...|$|R

25|$|According to one report, the helicopter's <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> {{had been}} {{reported}} faulty by Powers. The improperly operating <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> would indicate empty when the fuel tank actually contained enough fuel for 30 minutes flying time.

50|$|While the {{aircraft}} was {{being prepared for}} its return to Edmonton, a maintenance worker decided to investigate {{the problem with the}} faulty FQIS. To test the system he re-enabled the second channel, at which point the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> in the cockpit went blank. He was called away to perform a floatstick measurement of fuel remaining in the tanks. Distracted, he failed to disable the second channel, leaving the circuit breaker tagged (which masked {{the fact that it was}} no longer pulled). The FQIS was now completely unserviceable and the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> were blank.|$|R
