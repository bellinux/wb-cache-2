25|$|As a {{response}} to the 2001 economic crisis, electricity tariffs were converted to the Argentine peso and frozen in January 2002 through the Public Emergency and <b>Exchange</b> <b>Regime</b> Law. Together with high inflation (see Economy of Argentina) and the devaluation of the peso, many companies in the sector had to deal with high levels of debt in foreign currency under a scenario in which their revenues remained stable while their costs increased. This situation has led to severe underinvestment and unavailability to keep up with an increasing demand, factors that contributed to the 2003-2004 energy crisis. Since 2003, the government has been in the process of introducing modifications that allow for tariff increases. Industrial and commercial consumers' tariffs have already been raised (near 100% in nominal terms and 50% in real terms), but residential tariffs still remain the same.|$|E

40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes,</b> this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of exchange rate flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes</b> appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility.

To test our hypothesis, we exploit a novel dataset of both de jure and de facto <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regime</b> classifications. We find that pegged exchange rates are associated with significantly lower inflation in EMDCs than flexible exchange rates, and that this effect is much stronger for de facto pegs that are matched by de jure pegs than for those that are not.

It develops a Barro-Gordon type two-country model and compares noncooperative equilibria under different assumptions of monetary policy credibility and different <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes.</b> Using a two-stage game approach to the strategic choice of policy instruments, it identifies optimal (in a Pare to sense) and sustainable (self-enforcing) <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes.</b> The theoretical results indicate that the choice of such regimes depends fundamentally on the credibility of monetary policy commitments by the two countries’ authorities. The nature of shocks to the economies and the substitutability between goods produced in the two countries also play some role. International coordination on instrument choice is necessary to design optimal and sustainable <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes.</b> <b>Exchange</b> rate regimes;Economic models;exchange rate, <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regime,</b> inflation, money supply, monetary policy, fixed exchange rate, fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regime,</b> <b>exchange</b> rates, real output, flexible exchange rate, exchange rate stability, flexible <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regime,</b> <b>exchange</b> rate management, rate of inflation, fixed exchange rates, exchange rate commitment, price inflation, exchange rate rule, currency areas, rational expectations, nominal interest rate, price stability, inflationary policy, inflation rate, spot exchange rate, inflationary pressure, home currency, currency depreciation, optimal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes,</b> foreign <b>exchange,</b> high inflation, exchange rate system, variable inflation, currency appreciation, real interest rate, spot exchange rates, real exchange rates, low inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, real exchange rate, monetary economics, alternative <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes,</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>regimes,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> rate, inflation money, moderate inflation, equilibrium exchange rate, average inflation, exchange rate systems, flexible exchange rates, fixed exchange rate system, exchange rate policies, high growth rate of money, exchange rate commitments, nominal interest rates, foreign exchange market, exchange rate instrument, nominal exchange rate, flexible exchange rate systems, real wages, money growth, constant exchange rate, wage inflation, average inflation rate, financial stability, general price inflation, exchange rate policy, foreign currency, real interest rates, wage-price, exchange rate arrangements, aggregate demand, exchange rate instability...|$|R
