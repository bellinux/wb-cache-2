[...] "Bob has written," [...] thought Maud--"Yet how could he do this? He was in the dark, and had not pen or paper!" [...] Another look rendered this conjecture still more improbable, as it showed the <b>gilt</b> <b>edge</b> of paper of the quality used for notes, an article equally unlikely {{to be found in the}} mill and in his own pocket. [...] "Yet it must be a note," [...] passed through her mind, [...] "and of course it was written before he left the Hut--quite likely before he arrived--possibly the year before, when he spoke of the box as containing the evidence of the great secret of his life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXVI. It is {{fortunate}} that the capitals themselves, being somewhat rudely cut, can bear {{this kind of}} treatment better than most of those in Venice. They are all founded on the Corinthian type, but the leaves are in every one different: those of the easternmost capital of the southern range are the best, and very beautiful, but presenting no feature of much interest, their workmanship being inferior {{to most of the}} imitations of Corinthian common at the period; much more to the rich fantasies which we have seen at Torcello. The apse itself, to-day (12th September, 1851), is not to be described; for just in front of it, behind the altar, is a magnificent curtain of new red velvet with a <b>gilt</b> <b>edge</b> and two golden tassels, held up in a dainty manner by two angels in the upholsterer's service; and above all, for concentration of effect, a star or sun, some five feet broad, the spikes of which conceal the whole of the figure of the Madonna except the head and hands.|$|E

50|$|The geology of {{the range}} {{includes}} limestone, sandstone, and siltstone of Cambrian to Cretaceous age which were intruded by alkaline intrusives of monzonite, syenite to tinguaite composition of Cretaceous to Tertiary age. Epithermal gold and silver veins are found along the intrusive contacts. The mountains were the center of gold and silver mining in the 1800s and current exploration continues. The old mining camps of Maiden and <b>Gilt</b> <b>Edge</b> were built during the mining boom in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
50|$|In 1883, {{a dispute}} {{evolved into a}} court case between two mining claims that reached the Supreme Court of Dakota Territory. The same year, a man named Patrick Gorman was killed and the case was brought to a trial, but the killer was let go when the jury ruled self-defense. These controversies {{eventually}} contributed {{to a decline in}} Galena's activity. In 1886, Galena experienced another period of activity as eight mining companies worked the land. From then until 1897, the town was very inactive. the Union Mining Company bought all of the surrounding mines, but within the year, the operations had failed. By 1902, Galena had been severely neglected. That same year, however, the Burlington Railroad came through. The economy started to increase again and the houses were repaired. However, the line was abandoned in 1912, and the railroad took up its tracks in 1929. In 1940, another mining company, the <b>Gilt</b> <b>Edge</b> Mines, came through and revived the town. The school closed in summer 1943.|$|E
