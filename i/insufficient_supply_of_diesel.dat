30|$|First, lack of {{professionals}} stems from an <b>insufficient</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> talent, {{as well as}} limited capabilities of existing resource persons. To fulfill the goal of constructing 3000  km of new rail lines during the 13 th Five-Year Plan period, 180, 000 new employees will be required over 2016 – 2020. Professionals trained by existing pre-service education can only meet {{approximately half of the}} current demand; the <b>insufficient</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> employees has become a growing concern. On the one hand, with regard to talent capabilities, there is growing demand from passengers for people-oriented, personalized, and diversified services. On the other hand, the development of urban rail transit has generated a greater demand for new network and intelligent technologies. These “five changes” have led to new requirements for employees. Therefore, strengthening the pre-service education and in-service training and providing more qualified management personnel, technicians, and production personnel have become major influential factors for the smooth development of the urban rail transit industry.|$|R

The decreased linoleoyl-CoA desaturase activity may be due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> electrons, because of possible diversion to MEOS...|$|R

40|$|There is an <b>insufficient</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> young human knees for {{evaluating}} ACL reconstructions, which has researchers investigating other alternatives. An {{alternative is to}} use a knee from a large farm animal (eg, porcine, bovine, ovine, and caprine). † The disadvantages of using a knee from a large farm animal as a substitute are that the stiffness and yield of 1 type of fixation device (ie, interference screw) are overestimated, 19 and the geometry and kinematics of a knee from a large farm animal differ from those of a human knee. 3, 12, 16 Therefore, the challenge is to devise a substitute that both approximates the fixation properties of young human bone and has the geometry and kinemat-ics of a human knee. A technique that has not been reported and that might circumvent the <b>insufficient</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> young human knees is the use of foam to reinforce the osteopenic cancellous bone in an elderly human knee. A block of polyurethane foam has been used to test fixation devices. 8, 11, 29, 34 A 2 -part kit of liquid polyurethane foam, which when mixed an...|$|R
