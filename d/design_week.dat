500|$|Also in 2015, a Mediated Matter team {{developed}} G3DP, {{the first}} 3D printer for optically transparent glass. At the time, sintering 3D printers could print with glass powder, {{but the results}} were brittle and opaque. G3DP was designed in collaboration with MIT's Glass Lab and the Wyss Institute, emulating traditional glass working processes. Molten glass was poured in fine streams and cooled in an annealing chamber, yielding precision suitable for art and consumer products, and glass strength suitable for architectural elements. The process allowed close control of color, transparency, thickness and texture. Changing the height and speed of the nozzle produced uniform loops, turning the printer into a [...] "molden glass sewing machine". A set of glass vessels made with this printer went on exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt and other museums, and a 10-foot tall sculpture of light and printed glass, YET, was designed for the 2017 Milan <b>Design</b> <b>Week.</b>|$|E

It's a maze of tunnels, wires and props interrupted only by platforms poised to send performers up into the light". Madonna was transported on a trolley {{from one end to the}} other end of the stage. She had a makeshift make-up room in the underneath area, for having touch-ups in between performances.
