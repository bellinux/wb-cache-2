One method of producing hydrogen for fuels cells is the steam reforming of conventional hydrocarbons, an established refinery process. It has been proposed {{to carry out this}} process in a <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reformer</b> – a reformer that has a flow configuration analogous to a heat exchanger. The catalyst, {{in the form of a}} conventional pellet, is usually placed in the tubes of the reformer and a hot gas (i. e. from a combustor) or effluent from another process is circulated in the shell side. Key design objectives of the <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Reformer</b> are a high, steady state, thermal efficiency and a compact unit both in volume and mass. It is well known that many applications of fuel cells require transient operation which requires that the production of hydrogen rich feed also varies. Otherwise excess hydrogen is generated and not consumed, leading to a significant loss in overall energy efficiency. The implication is that the transient response of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reformer</b> also needs to be considered in its design. In this work, the transient response of a simplified <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>reformer</b> is modeled. The geometry of the reformer is two concentric cylinders, filled with conventional pellet catalyst, a common design element in many heat exchang...|$|E
40|$|The worlds {{energy demand}} is increasing, {{and at the}} same time the amount of easily {{accessible}} oil is reduced. Associated gas for most off-shore applications are flared or injected in the reservoir due to transportation challenges. A gas-to-liquid (GTL) process for offshore applications could be a solution to make valuable products of the associated and remote natural gas resources. GTL is a process that converts carbon based feedstock to more valuable liquid products. One of the main technologies used are the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A new process design for a GTL process for off-shore applications are proposed. The syngas is produced with an autothermal reformer (ATR) with enriched air as oxidant. The process design is a once-through, to prevent accumulation of nitrogen. Once-through means that no unconverted syngas is recycled in the process. In order to maximize the conversion and production of higher hydrocarbon the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are staged. Three multitubular fixed bed stages are used with product separation and hydrogen added between each step. Two Fischer-Tropsch reactors in parallel are used for the two first reactor stages. The hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming in a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanged</b> <b>reformer,</b> where <b>heat</b> needed for reaction is provided from the hot outlet stream from the ATR. The tail gas in the process is used for power production in a gas turbine. The hot effluent gas from the gas turbine is used for pre-heating of the natural gas. The process design is modelled and optimized with the use of Aspen HYSYS V 8. 6, with some use of Aspen Custom Modeler and MATLAB programming. The kinetic model used for the Fischer-Trospch reactors are proposed by Todic et al., with a product distribution model proposed by Hillestad. There are several parameters in the process that could be optimized. Optimizing in this master thesis are focused on obtaining the maximum production of C 5 +, which means hydrocarbons with five carbon atoms or more. The optimal distribution of the natural gas in the process was found to be 90 % to the autothermal reformer and 10 % to the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanged</b> <b>reformer.</b> With a natural gas feed amount of 120 MMSCF or 6, 000 kmole/h the total production in the process are found to be 53. 9 tonne/h or approximately 10, 000 bbl/day. The carbon efficiency in the process is 57 % and the energy efficiency is 45 %. The process is self-supported with utilities and produces 36. 4 MW of external power and 501 tonne/h of medium pressure steam. The total investments cost for the plant is estimated to 543. 7 million$...|$|R

40|$|A new {{conceptual}} flowsheet {{is presented}} for Martian in situ fuel production. The dry reforming flowsheet incorporates the well-known Sabatier-Electrolysis process with a carbon dioxide / methane reforming step to consume {{some of the}} Sabatier methane. By varying the ratio of effluent to reformed methane, any desired methane / oxygen ratio can be produced by the dry reforming process. Such a machine will enable utilization of all imported hydrogen into an optimal methane / oxygen fuel mixture, with copious quantities of surplus oxygen produced for crew consumables. The reforming process is highly endothermic and requires temperatures above 650 centigrade on precious metal catalysts. Appropriate feed / effluent <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> reduces the <b>reformer</b> power requirements, but an increased oxygen / methane ratio increases the power requirements. In addition, the complexity introduced by the reformer and its interactions with the Sabatier system make the system relatively difficult to automate or control remotely. The energy usage and complexity imply that a dry reforming process will not be useful {{in the early stages}} of Mars exploration. However, the increased material usage efficiency and oxygen generation capability of the dry reforming technique will make it an attractive technology to consider for second generation ISRU systems. In addition, the potential ease of retrofitting Sabatier / Electrolysis units with a dry reformer provide an important advantage for early adoption of the technology. Minor preinvestment in the Sabatier system – essentially just provision for interconnections – will allow the addition of a reformer, thus extending the useful lifetime of the Sabatier system, instead of replacing early Sabatier systems with entirely new second generation systems. Thus, dry reforming will be an important technology to allow cost effective expansion of early Martian exploration and base building efforts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The overall {{reason for}} {{investigating}} intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> in diabatic distillation is to enable {{a reduction in}} external energy demand. This thesis applies computer simulations and experimental measurements to evaluate and analyse the use of intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> in binary distillation. The use of intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> has been studied in a stand-alone distillation unit as a method to improve the energetic performance of distillation. Considerable external energy savings can theoretically be achieved by using different intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> arrangements. The way the intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> is performed {{in terms of a}} combination of positions for side stream withdrawal and side stream return has a clear impact on the column performance. In a real column with constant number of trays and constant separation an optimisation of the intermediate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> will generate increased efficiencies locally together with improved separation. Some parts will run closer to reversibility than other parts.
