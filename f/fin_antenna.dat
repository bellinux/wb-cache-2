50|$|More than 900 base {{stations}} were installed at 450-900 meters interval to provide coverage {{over the entire}} length of the lines. Their signal within the 5 GHz limit is transmitted to <b>fin</b> <b>antennas</b> on the last cars of all 650 trains. From the routers under the antenna the signal is transmitted along the train to all access points in the cars. The network is automatically reconfiguring in case of restructuring the train, adding or detaching cars. Base stations were installed at night, workers laid approximately 2-3 kilometers of cable per shift; the total length of fiber-optic communication lines is more than 880 kilometers. This solution provides access to 70-100 Mbit/s connection (potentially this speed may be increased to 150 Mbit/s using a special software). Capacity of the whole network estimates 20 Gbit/s.|$|R

50|$|In the Philippines, the Honda City was {{launched}} in April 2014 and is available in 3 variants. The base 1.5 E is available in both manual and CVT transmissions. The manual transmission it receives full wheel cover and roof mounted antenna, while the CVT has different style alloy wheels and receives the shark's <b>fin</b> <b>antenna.</b> The 1.5 VX and VX+ which is {{top of the line}} model of the City, is only available in CVT and has unique style alloy wheels, front fog lights, HDMI and AUX/USB connection, 7 inch touch screen panel, side mirror with signal turning lights, push start/stop engine and blue illumination gauge. The VX+ receives leather seats, VSA (Vehicle stability assist and HSA (Hill start assist). A Modulo kit is available on the E CVT, VX and VX+. In early 2015, the E variants receive navigation system adding the variant 1.5 E +navi and 1.5 E CVT+ navi through the year 2015 the City {{is one of the best}} selling subcompact vehicles in the Philippine Market so the company added a new variant to the City the 1.5 E CVT Special Edition variant the differences is that the Special Edition Variant offers UV protection Glass, Air purifier and Ion Generator, keyless with panic button and speed sensing auto door lock. A new color has also added to the City the Ruby Red Pearl Color, the only color available for the Special Edition variant of the City are the Ruby red pearl, Taffeta White and Golden Brown Metallic.|$|E
40|$|Making {{traceable}} power measurements above 110 GHz using {{current measurement}} technologies is challenging. We investigate a design of power sensor {{consisting of a}} thermocouple-based integrated circuit (IC) mounted as a finline component in WR- 6 waveguide. The design is original in that it contains an antenna, terminating resistor and thermocouples on-chip. We detail the design and report results from simulations and measurements made on a two-port 16 : 1 scale model. Our design of scale model provides both insertion and reflection loss measurements. Electromagnetic simulation and easily-calibrated model measurements confirm that the short <b>antenna</b> <b>fins</b> feasible on a {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (MMIC) can achieve acceptable specifications. The design proves to be relatively insensitive to the value of the terminating resistance or the size of the <b>antenna</b> <b>fins...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{enormous}} {{diversity of}} extant animal forms {{is a testament}} to the power of evolution, and much of this diversity has been achieved through the emergence of novel morphological traits. The origin of novel morphological traits is an extremely important issue in biology, and a frequent source of this novelty is co-option of pre-existing genetic systems for new purposes (Carroll et al., 2008). Appendages, such as limbs, <b>fins</b> and <b>antennae,</b> are structures common to many animal body plans which must have arisen at least once, and probably multiple times, in lineages which lacked appendages. We provide evidence that appendage proximodistal patterning genes are expressed in similar registers in the anterior embryonic neurectoderm of Drosophila melanogaster and Saccoglossus kowalevskii (a hemichordate). These results, in concert with existing expression data from a variety of other animals suggest that a pre-existing genetic system for anteroposterior head patterning was co-opted for patterning of the proximodistal axis of appendages of bilaterian animals...|$|R
2500|$|The tripodfish Bathypterois grallator uses tactile and mechanosensory cues to {{identify}} food; it apparently {{does not have}} special visual adaptations to help it find food in the low-light environment. When the fish is perched with its long rays on the ocean floor, it can get food without even seeing it. The tripodfish’s mouth ends up {{at just the right}} height to catch shrimp, tiny fish, and small crustaceans swimming by. They seem to prefer to perch on the mud using much elongated fin rays in their tails and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream into the current to ambush with the pectoral fins turned forward so [...] the outthrust projecting <b>fins</b> resemble multiple <b>antennae.</b> The fish senses objects in the water with its front fins. [...] These fins act like hands. [...] Once they feel prey and realize it is edible, the fins knock the food into the fish’s mouth. [...] The fish faces into the current, waiting for prey to drift by.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to find out the clinical sign of the catfish sample that has been infected by the bacteria and to find out the causative agent bacteria diseases of Clarias gariepinus from Demak. The fish sample collection used purposive random sampling method. The observation of clinical sign was implemented toward ten catfish samples. The isolation of bacteria from moribund fish surface and kidney of catfish was conducted by streaking method on NA and GSP media. Based on the characteristic of morphology (colour, form of colony), it was obtained five isolate from eleven isolates of bacteria for the next test. The test of postulat koch toward five isolates of ten test fish and characterized them to causative agent bacterial through morphological and biochemical characterization. The result of {{the research}} showed that the clinical sign were detected irregular swimming, balance disorders, fish stand still {{at the bottom of the}} aquarium, the fish limp, injury/red blisters at the injection site, a pale body color, porous on tails, <b>fins</b> and <b>antennas.</b> The test results of postulates koch obtained that the five isolates (D 7, D 10, D 12, D 14, D 16) were capable of causing pain on test fish. Based on the postulate test also showed only two isolates (D 7 and D 12) were caused mortality of 30 % of the test fish. The results of the morphological and biochemical characterization found that the five agents causing disease in fish from Demak were abbreviated namely of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, Flavobacterium sp., Edwardsiella ictaluri, Aeromonas caviae and Aeromonas caviae, respectively...|$|R
