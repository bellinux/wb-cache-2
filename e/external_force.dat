When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E

Cornelius failed to give his seat to Corbula at a gladiatorial show, and the {{incident}} sparked a debate between the rights of age and the defenders of tradition, in which Drusus argued a rapprochement. In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it. The proposal was then abandoned, not because of the arguments made, but because of the intervention of an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> (the auctoritas of Drusus) the same reason for the later repeal of the Oppian law (lex Oppia).|$|E
40|$|We study numerically the photon {{emission}} from a semiconductor microcavity containing N> 2 quantum wells {{under the influence}} of a periodic <b>external</b> <b>forcing.</b> The emission is determined by the interplay between <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> and internal interaction between the wells. While the <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> synchronizes the periodic motion, the internal interaction destroys it. The nonlinear term of the Hamiltonian supports the synchronization. The numerical results show a jump of the photon intensity to very large values at a certain critical value of the <b>external</b> <b>forcing</b> when the number of quantum wells is not too large. We discuss the dynamics of the system across this transition. Comment: To be appeared in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden tells {{a mythical}} saga of life's {{evolution}} on Earth, with a subtext of a creation myth and polytheistic evolution. The player takes {{the role of}} one of many billions of lifeforms created by Gaia, the nurturing and benevolent daughter of Sol, the Sun. Among the creatures known as life, there is a competition to evolve, and the best lifeform will eventually be granted the privilege of entering the Garden of Eden and becoming the husband and partner of Gaia. As the game progresses, it soon becomes apparent some mysterious <b>external</b> <b>force</b> is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner. Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously powerful beings that dominate all other lifeforms, overconsume resources and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue as intended.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an <b>external</b> <b>force,</b> the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an <b>external</b> <b>force</b> to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

25|$|Resonance {{is simple}} to {{understand}} if {{the spring and}} mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no <b>external</b> <b>force</b> acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As {{in the case of}} the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.|$|E
