25|$|Like the Traditionalist Catholic {{movement}} in general, the SSPX was {{born out of}} opposition to changes in the Catholic Church that followed the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). The founder and central figure of the society was the French prelate Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had previously served the Catholic Church as apostolic delegate to <b>French-speaking</b> <b>Africa,</b> Archbishop of Dakar, and superior general of the Holy Ghost Fathers, a missionary order of priests. In May 1970, shortly after his retirement as Vicar General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by 11 French seminarians in Rome, who were criticized for their adherence to the traditional doctrines of the Catholic Church. They sought Lefebvre's advice on a conservative seminary where they could complete their studies. He directed them to the still conservative University of Fribourg, in Switzerland. But soon, the University had become as liberal as anywhere else.|$|E

40|$|Did {{colonisation}} {{change the}} distribution of prosperity within <b>French-speaking</b> West <b>Africa?</b> Using a new database on both pre-colonial and colonial contexts, this paper shows that some of West African best performing pre-colonial areas lost their advantage because of colonial experience. Politics are the mechanism at work: pre-colonial prosperity encouraged hostility towards colonial power which dissuaded European from settling. Since European settlement in colonial era had a strong positive impact on current outcomes, early political hostility toward colonial power had a persistent negative impact on development path. Nevertheless, there is no complete “reversal of fortune ” since more hostile areas were also more prosperous, and prosperity per se was an attractive factor for European settlement. Rich and hostile areas therefore did not receive less European settlers in absolute terms but they received less European settlers {{than they would have}} received had they not been so hostile. As a consequence, some less prosperous but also less hostile pre-colonial areas caught up and became the new leaders within <b>French-speaking</b> West <b>Africa...</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{divided the}} {{evolution}} of bilateral cooperation between Canada and the <b>French-speaking</b> countries of <b>Africa</b> into three major phases. During the first phase, which lasted from 1961 to 1968, Canadian aid was slight and discontinuous. The second phase, from 1969 to 1975, was characterized by a remarkable increase of the CIDA 's activities. That period was specially influenced, on the one had, by the rudeau and Chevrier missions and, on the other hand, by the reconsideration of Canada's foreign policy during the 1970 's. The third phase, from 1975 to 1981, was arked, among other things, by what one could call industrial cooperation, that is cooperation between « project-countries » and « program-countries ».
