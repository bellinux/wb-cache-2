5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may {{be made available to}} the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E

5|$|After Docter {{scrapped}} {{the initial}} {{concept of a}} 30-year-old terrified of monsters, he decided on a buddy story between a monster and a child titled simply Monsters, in which the monster character of Sulley (known at this stage as Johnson) was an up-and-comer at his workplace, where the company's purpose was to scare children. Sulley's eventual sidekick, Mike Wazowski, <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> added.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Johnson {{submitted}} the contributory negligence defense, he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> {{able to speak}} to Polehinke himself. By the time newspapers reported on the court documents, Johnson said he had already told Royse, who criticized the statements, that he would withdraw the argument. Prior to his employment by Comair, Polehinke worked for Gulfstream International as a captain.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> sufficiently developed.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to {{announce}} the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared {{on the order of}} 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> positively identified from ancient records. It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will not return to the inner solar system until approximately 4385.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, {{but the idea of}} Bart and Lisa {{attending}} a military academy had previously been pitched, and had been floating around since 1991. The idea <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> used as an episode plot, because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to a strange place early in the series.|$|E

5|$|The final {{task of the}} Einsatzgruppen in Poland was {{to round}} up the {{remaining}} Jews and concentrate them in ghettos within major cities with good railway connections. The intention was to eventually remove all the Jews from Poland, {{but at this point}} their final destination <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> determined. Together, the Wehrmacht and the Einsatzgruppen also drove tens of thousands of Jews eastward into Soviet-controlled territory.|$|E
5|$|After years, Ulmo {{returned}} to Beleriand {{to seek out}} the remaining Teleri. As Elwë <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother Olwë as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by Ossë. They took Círdan as their leader and became the Falathrim. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the Sindar.|$|E
5|$|As they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> {{approved}} by 11 of the 14 states, the ratification of Article One (ratified by 10) and Article Two (ratified by 6) remained incomplete. The ratification plateau {{they needed to}} reach soon rose to 12 of 15 states when Kentucky joined the Union (June 1, 1792). On June 27, 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly ratified all 12 amendments, however this action {{did not come to}} light until 1996.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:13pm, the aircraft's {{tail section}} sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming {{to bring the}} plane back to level flight. At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that he was gone.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Jack Souther {{produced}} {{a synthesis of}} volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera and delineated several Neogene to Quaternary volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One of these was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed {{control of}} the nuclear weapons program and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory {{became part of the}} Manhattan Project.

5|$|In the East, {{under cover}} of ground fog the field army {{successfully}} withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1872 election, Macdonald had yet to {{formulate}} a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar. Though the tribal name is Arabic, it was first transcribed in Assyrian (8th century BCE) and Aramaic (6th century BCE), as the Arabic alphabet <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> developed. In the Mareshah onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in Aramaic transliteration is QDRYN.|$|E
