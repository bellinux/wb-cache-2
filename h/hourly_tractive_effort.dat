The course of the research – dynamometer was designed and constructed for <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> measuring. <b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of the tractor „zetor forterra 125 “ researched using by methodology.

The results – the investigation found that the rear whlees <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> values was the grass by 29 kN, on the gravel 18 kN, on the asphalt 18 kN.

50|$|Maximum {{tractive}} effort: Maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{is defined}} as the highest tractive force that can be generated under any condition that is not injurious to the vehicle or machine. In most cases, maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is developed at low speed and may be the same as the starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calculated in {{the usual}} way (assuming equal <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> from the two engines and mean {{effective}} pressure adding up to 0.85 times boiler pressure) the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> was 135,200 lb in compound; in the US, compound Mallets were credited with 20% more <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> in simple mode, or 162,200 lb for the Virginian locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The Midland Railway {{introduced}} {{a system of}} locomotive classification based on the power output represented by a locomotive's <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> at 50 mph (passenger locomotives) or 25 mph (goods locomotives). This is the continuous <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> and is {{much lower than the}} starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> which is the figure usually quoted in technical publications.|$|R
50|$|Its 105 lt 13 lcwt kg {{adhesive}} weight and the SAR's ultra-conservative practice of reporting a Mallet's <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> at only 50% of boiler pressure {{resulted in a}} much lower than actual starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 48370 lbf kN. The Class MH was almost certainly capable of exerting more than 60000 lbf kN <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> at starting.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{is often}} {{qualified}} as starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> continuous <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> and maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b> These terms apply to different operating conditions, but are related by common mechanical factors: input torque to the driving wheels, the wheel diameter, {{coefficient of friction}} (μ) between the driving wheels and supporting surface, and the weight applied to the driving wheels (m). The product of μ and m is the factor of adhesion, which determines the maximum torque {{that can be applied}} before the onset of wheelspin or wheelslip.|$|R
50|$|The numbers 28 and 36 {{designate}} the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (pulling force) of the locomotives {{in thousands}} of pounds. The <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of K-28s is rated at 27500 lbf kN, and the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of a K-36 is a 36200 lbf kN. The weight of a K-28 with a full tender is 254500 lb, and a K-36 weighs 286600 lb with a full tender.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the graph is shown at right. The line AB shows {{operation}} at the maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> the line BC shows continuous <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> that is inversely proportional to speed (constant power).|$|R
50|$|For other {{numbers and}} {{combinations}} of cylinders, including double and triple expansion engines the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{can be estimated}} by adding the <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> due to the individual cylinders at their respective pressures and cylinder strokes.|$|R
50|$|Slip (also {{known as}} creep) is {{normally}} roughly {{directly proportional to}} <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b> An exception is if the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{and is no longer}} linear. With a little higher applied <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> the wheel spins out of control and the adhesion drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye—the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.|$|R
50|$|During 1218's {{excursion}} career, it was {{the most}} powerful operational steam locomotive in the world, with a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 125,897 lbf kN, well above the next-strongest-pulling operational steam locomotive (Union Pacific 3985, with a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 97350 lbf kN). Unlike diesel-electric locomotives of similar high <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (for starting heavy trains) but typical for a steam locomotive, it could easily run at 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) and more.|$|R
50|$|Starting <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> {{calculated}} in {{the usual}} way (85% mean effective pressure) comes out 76,400 lbf kN, but the engine used 70% limited cutoff (presumably to increase port openings at short cutoff) so the railroad claimed a correspondingly lower <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{the figure}} often quoted when {{comparing}} {{the powers of}} steam locomotives, but is misleading because <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> shows the ability to start a train, not the ability to haul it. Possibly the highest <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> ever claimed was for the Virginian Railway's 2-8-8-8-4 Triplex locomotive, which in simple expansion mode had a calculated starting T.E. of 199,560 lbf (887.7 kN) [...] - [...] but the boiler could not produce enough steam to haul at speeds over 5 mph (8 km/h).|$|R

50|$|As built, {{the boiler}} {{pressure}} {{was set to}} blow off at , which gave the engine a <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 53750 lbf kN at 50% of boiler pressure. The setting was later reduced to , which reduced the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> to 48370 lbf kN at 50% of boiler pressure.|$|R
50|$|Drawbar pull is a {{function}} of velocity, and in general decreases as the speed of the vehicle increases (due both to increasing resistance and decreasing transmission gear ratios). Drawbar pull is the difference between <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> available and <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> required to overcome resistance at a specified speed.|$|R
50|$|Freight {{locomotives}} {{are designed}} to produce higher maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> than passenger units of equivalent power, necessitated by the much higher weight that is typical of a freight train. In modern locomotives, the gearing between the traction motors and axles is selected to suit the type of service in which the unit will be operated. As traction motors have a maximum speed at which they can rotate without incurring damage, gearing for higher <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{at the expense of}} top speed. Conversely, the gearing used with passenger locomotives favors speed over maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
