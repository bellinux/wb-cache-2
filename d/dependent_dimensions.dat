Cartographic visualization can be one useful method of presenting dynamic spatial data and visualizing changes over time, hence assisting the study of spatio-temporal patterns and phenomena.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between ownership structure and firm performance, treating ownership concentration and owner identity as separate, but <b>dependent</b> <b>dimensions</b> of ownership structure. We use a large sample of quarterly data from non-financial companies at the Oslo Stock Exchange in the period 2001 - 2007. Using three different econometric approaches motivated by previous studies, we cannot conclude (econometrically) that ownership concentration influences firm performance, measured by Tobin’s Q. These findings {{are in line with}} previous research on Norwegian data. However, our results on owner identity differ. We find that when international investors hold large fractions of the stocks, or an international owner is the largest shareholder, firm performance is positively affected. The corresponding relationship between government ownership and firm performance is negative. Our findings therefore indicate that including owner identity as a dimension of ownership concentration could increase the insights into {{the relationship between}} ownership structure and firm performance...|$|E

Parameters of the details and the assemblies build up the dimensional chain. Existing dimension chain calculation theory is widely used in design process of new machines and other products. Theory can also be used in measurement analyse process for the existing product elements and it helps to analyse tolerances and limits effectiveness of a product already in use. The main goal in dimension chain solving is to fix tolerances and limits to all measurements in chain. In the process of dimension chain calculation, it's necessary to take into consideration the real work situation of chain links.

40|$|The {{dominance}} axiom {{states that}} the dissimilarity {{of a pair of}} stimuli differing on two dimensions must exceed the dissimilarities of the corresponding pairs of stimuli that differ on only one of the dimensions. This axiom is presented as a test of dissimilarity data to determine if the dimensions of the perceptual space are perceived independently, and as a diagnostic tool in assessing the INDSCAL model’s assumption of independent dimensions. The general recognition theory of similarity, which contains both the three-mode and INDSCAL multidimensional scaling models as special cases, is used to motivate the test. It is shown that general recognition theory predicts consistent violations of the dominance axiom with <b>dependent</b> <b>dimensions,</b> but not independent dimensions. A consistent pattern of violations of dominance suggests that the three-mode model is most appropriate. When the test of dominance is satisfied, the INDSCAL model is appropriate for the data. A simulation study was conducted to examine the pattern of violations of the dominance axiom when varying degrees of perceptual dependence exist. An examination of dissimilarity data from a study of the size-weight illusion revealed the expected pattern of violations of the dominance axiom.

40|$|O uso método de análise multivariada ICA (Análise de Componentes Independentes), mais o método K-NN (K-vizinhos mais Próximos) aplicados em dados de poços e em dados sísmicos buscando classificar fácies geológicas e suas características. Esses dois métodos foram aplicados em dados retirados do Campo de Namorado, na Bacia de Campos, Brasil. A ICA encontra as componentes independentes dos dados, que quando treinadas pelo método K-NN para reconhecer padrões nos dados, predizem fácies geológicas e outras informações sobre as rochas, como as características de reservatório. Essas componentes independentes configuram uma nova opção de interpretação das informações disponíveis, pois nessas novas variáveis, o espaço de análise não apresenta dimensões dependentes e exclui informações repetidas ou dúbias da interpretação dos resultados. Além disso, a maior parte da informação é resumida em poucas dimensões, resultando em uma possível redução de variáveis referentes ao problema. Um abundante número de testes foi feito procurando a taxa de sucesso desse método. Como taxa de sucesso, é compreendida a divisão do número de predições corretas dividido pelo número total de tentativas. O que se observa é uma taxa de sucesso alta, em torno de 85 % de acerto em algumas situações, ressaltando-se que as componentes têm distribuição gaussiana, sendo que o método funciona melhor em encontrar componentes não-gaussianas. Mesmo nessa situação adversa o método se mostrou robusto. A solidez do método mostra-se uma alternativa para novas formas de interpretação geológicas e petrofísicas. Um dos trunfos desse método é que a base da sua aplicação pode ser estendida para outros tipos de dados, {{inclusive}} de naturezas físicas diferentesThe use of {{multivariate analysis}} method ICA (Independent Component Analysis), plus the K-NN method (K-nearest Neighbor) applied on well log data and seismic data {{to predict the}} classification of geological facies and their characteristics. These two methods were applied to data from the Campo de Namorado, in the Campos Basin, Brasil. The ICA finds the independent components of the data that can be trained by K-NN method to recognize patterns in the data and predict the geological facies or other information about the rocks, as {{the characteristics of the}} reservoir. These independent components make up a new option for interpretation of available information, because with these new variables, the space has no <b>dependent</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the duplicate information or dubious interpretation of results are excluded. Moreover, most of the information is summarized in a few dimensions, resulting in a possible reduction of variables related to the problem. An abundant number of tests were done looking for the success rate of this method. As success rate, it is understood by the division of the number of correct predictions divided by total attempts. What is observed is a high success rate, around 85 % accuracy in some situations, pointing out that the components have a Gaussian distribution and the method works best in finding non-Gaussian components. Even in this adverse situation the method was robust. The robustness of the method proves that ICA can be an alternative to new forms of geological and petrophysical interpretation. One of the advantages of this method is that the basis of their application can be extended to other types of data, including datas with different physical nature...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{operating}} {{environment in which}} banks conduct their business, especially the credit risk environment, underwent significant changes since {{the latter half of}} the previous decade. Developments have resulted in a bombardment of quantitative and qualitative credit risk information and data on the one hand, and on the other an absence of a clear focus and management approach and philosophy to effectively manage credit risk. The primary objective of the research was the formulation of a process approach that could be applied in the management of credit risk of credit asset portfolios. Part of the objective was an implicit requirement that it should form the foundation from where the management of credit risk can be leveraged to exploit all the dimensions of credit risk while focussing on the maximisation of shareholder wealth. A literature study was undertaken to determine the theoretical aspects regarding the management of credit asset portfolios, credit risk management, the credit portfolio risk management approach and its principles. An empirical study aimed to establish the credit risk management practices being applied in the South African Banking Industry. The process approach developed for managing credit asset portfolios incorporate the account life cycle as point of departure. This was necessary to facilitate the various processes that need to be considered for effective credit portfolio risk management. The specific data requirements, as it culminate in a credit portfolio risk management functionality, enable the credit portfolio risk management approach and principles to be applied to credit asset portfolios within the context of two perspectives to credit portfolio risk management, namely: > The economic value perspective (also referred to as the shareholder wealth perspective) which has an ex post focus (after default has occurred) and which calculates the impact of credit risk on Credit RAROC or shareholder value; and > The earnings perspective which has an ex ante focus (before default occurs) and which addresses the bank's loss in income as a result of, and associated with, deterioration in credit standing (the cash flow implication to be considered when credit standing deteriorates). Applying the developed process approach to credit asset portfolios, two distinctive but <b>dependent</b> <b>dimensions</b> with underlying sub-dimensions to portfolio risk management is identified namely, micro portfolio risk management and macro portfolio risk management. The former focuses on the credit asset portfolio and the latter on the group portfolio in the context of all risks impacting the organisation. The final stage in the process approach is to establish a Business Health Forum that reports to the Board appointed committees. The forum ensures an independent view of all the risks and activities of the business, including credit risk. Adopting and applying the developed framework regarding the process approach to managing credit asset portfolios in a South African bank will assist executive management to ensure that the requirements (processes, systems, data) for effective credit portfolio risk management are met. It would also broaden the understanding regarding the interdependency between profit, sustainable growth and effective credit portfolio risk management. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of scale <b>dependent</b> spectral <b>dimension</b> has attracted {{special interest in}} the quantum gravity community {{over the last eight}} years. It was first observed in computer simulations of the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) approach to quantum gravity and refers to the reduction of the spectral dimension from 4 at classical scales to 2 at short distances. Thereafter several authors confirmed a similar result from different approaches to quantum gravity. Despite the contribution from different approaches, no analytical model was proposed to explain the numerical results as the continuum limit of CDT. In this thesis we introduce graph ensembles as toy models of CDT and show that both the continuum limit and a scale <b>dependent</b> spectral <b>dimension</b> can be defined rigorously. First we focus on a simple graph ensemble, the random comb. It does not have any dynamics from the gravity point of view, but serves as an instructive toy model to introduce the characteristic scale of the graph, study the continuum limit and define the scale <b>dependent</b> spectral <b>dimension.</b> Having defined the continuum limit, we study the reduction of the spectral dimension on more realistic toy models, the multigraph ensembles, which serve as a radial approximation of CDT. We focus on the (recurrent) multigraph approximation of the two-dimensional CDT whose ensemble measure is analytically controlled. The latter comes from the critical Galton-Watson process conditioned on non-extinction. Next we turn our attention to transient multigraph ensembles, corresponding to higher-dimensional CDT. Firstly we study their fractal properties and secondly calculate the scale <b>dependent</b> spectral <b>dimension</b> and compare it to computer simulations. We comment further on the relation between Horava-Lifshitz gravity, asymptotic safety, multifractional spacetimes and CDT-like models.

40|$|In Community Psychology, {{we assume}} that people at the {{grassroots}} can learn to help themselves if they are offered the means of understanding a problem and helped to discover the strategies needed to resolve it. Micro-computer technology is currently at a cultural crossroads: a technology in search of new applications. To date, research and concerns around {{the role of the}} computer in society have taken the macro view, being predominantly sociologically, politically, and economically oriented. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to bring these issues to the individual level and to examine some variables at the person-computer interface. In effect, we attempted to open the areas of communication between man and machine; to make the machine more accessible to people, and conversely, to help people in their approaches to the technology. The objectives were (a) to use a computer program that would be socially facilitative in a human-like way, so that the computer would be perceived by people as a social stimulus, (b) to provide a rich resource environment for an interaction that would be comfortable and non-threatening for participants, (c) to design the research methodology along the lines of the community oriented ‘collaborative’ model, and (d) to gather data on human performance with a micro-computer for purposes of predictive and correlational analysis as an evaluation of the process of the experience from both researcher and participant perspectives. The broad research question asked what approaches people would make toward the technology under the conditions of our particular model. What attitudinal, personality, and cognitive variables might be used to predict psychological success or competency in the use of the computer? The major hypothesis asserted that the variance in individuals’ interaction with the micro-computer on three <b>dependent</b> <b>dimensions,</b> 1) ease and competency of interaction, 2) lateral/divergent thinking processes, and 3) adventurousness/risk-taking, might be predicted from several independent variable measures: 1) orientation to technology (in relation to level of education and occupational standing); 2) general and personal attitudes towards computers (from which selection to group membership would be made: rational-positive/emotional-negative); and 3) personality attributes (tolerance/intolerance of ambiguity and complexity, and internal/external locus of control). The client system comprised 55 persons ranging in age from 17 to 69 years (mean age = 41 years; median age = 36 years) who consented to commit approximately two and one-half hours of their time in completing a questionnaire package and in one hour interaction with a micro-computer. The researcher and his assistant gathered observational data during each interaction for cross validation with a content analysis of each participant’s printout of interaction. Subsequently, both qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using descriptive, correlational, and multiple regression statistical procedures. The results suggested that our resource-rich environment enabled a large proportion of participants to perform with high levels of competency, creative thinking, and adventurousness, despite previous lack of skills in dealing with a computer, and in spite of previously held negative attitudes towards the personal use of a micro-computer. The issue of attitude alone was unconfirmed in affecting variance in dependent results. It appears that the personality dimensions of the independent variable in combination with predisposed orientation to a powerful social stimulus are much stronger influences on performance with a micro-computer than attitude alone. We concluded that micro-computer technology and its uses in society, in our communities, and in our homes is not necessarily a frightening or threatening experience given resources and approach strategies to the machine that are supportive and socially responsive to people. Future developments will, hopefully, take into account, not only the quality of intelligent and humanly responsive programs, but also the needs and feelings of the people who will interact with them, in a natural and relaxed environment. Participants in this study demonstrated that computer ‘literacy’ can be quickly and easily acquired in a short time, given proper resources and a ‘quality’ environment...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} several {{approaches}} to quantum gravity have found {{evidence for a}} scale <b>dependent</b> spectral <b>dimension</b> of space-time varying from four at large scales to two at small scales of order of the Planck length.

Since then little {{progress has been made}} in analytically understanding the numerical results coming from the CDT approach and showing that they remain valid when taking the continuum limit.

Blatt’s double helix theory posits that personality and psychopathology develop along two related pathways, one focusing on interpersonal relatedness (the anaclitic-dependent dimension) {{and the other}} on identity and achievement (the introjective-self-critical dimension). While this theory has formidably influenced research and practice, Shahar and others have observed that, empirically, the self-critical dimension confers much more vulnerability than the <b>dependent</b> <b>dimension.</b> Consequently, Shahar decided to decipher the nature of criticism in the self, relationships, and - more recently - in brain structure and function. His empirical work, spanning two decades, has illuminated the central role of self-criticism in diverse psychopathologies. He has identified interpersonal pathways through which self-criticism confers its vulnerability. Specifically, research suggests that self-critical individuals actively create a social environment marred with stress and replete with positive events and social support, which, in turn, brings about these individuals' distress. In adolescence, this distress feeds back to individuals' self-criticism, creating [...] "a self-critical cascade". This cascade is played out both within and outside psychotherapy, and even in the lives of chronic pain patients. In his recent book titled Erosion: The Psychopathology of Self-Criticism (published by Oxford University Press), Shahar offers a novel theory that illuminates the development of self-criticism throughout the life span. The theory depicts criticism in general and self-criticism in particular, as a distorted and addictive form of self-knowledge, which is amalgamated by societal norms and rules as well as by brain structures and functions.|$|R
