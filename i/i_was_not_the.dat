She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: [...] "Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am.... too has often remarked that she thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> kind of person with whom one could ever relax.... I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E

40|$|Following {{a comment}} of Peggy Sax that some clients “bring {{out the best}} in us,” I {{proposed}} in 2011 that, furthermore, some clients do more than that, they in fact inspire us. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only one to think so and decided to write up with Sam, then aged 20, and his mother, Jess, from the letters that summarized our meetings and several other meetings to confirm and review the conclusions we all reached at that time. This follows “Unsuffering,” co- authored by Julie King and David Epston, which appeared in Vol. 30, no. 1, 2011, pp. 84 – 96.

30|$|At {{the onset}} of the drought period, I moved my {{livestock}} from Kulamawe to Galana (in Merti). I had 500 head of cattle and most of them perished there.

30|$|It {{is clear}} from 41 and 42 that Huang (1988) and Huang et al. (2009) do <b>not</b> analyze <b>the</b> overt NP after -de in 30 and 40 as the {{syntactic}} subject of the verb or adjective after -de. In fact, Huang (1992 : 119) even analyzes V-DE constructions like i as having a similar structure to 41. In this analysis, Lisi in <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> syntactic subject of the de-part, either. Instead, the de-part involves a “Pro” and underlyingly Lisi is the “external object” of the Vʹ “ku-de Pro hen shangxin”.|$|R

I am not an enthusiast myself, but I like the company of those who are. Moir's talk, which made me feel as if we had a private pass-key through the door of death, filled me with a vague contentment. The soothing atmosphere of the séance with the darkened lights was delightful to me. In a word, the thing amused me, and so I was there.|$|E

40|$|Many authors, in {{this issue}} of the OSBR and elsewhere, {{highlight}} the relative lack of women entrepreneurs and suggest ways that we can overcome the challenges women face so that we can increase the numbers.

Though seldom remembered today, {{during his lifetime}} his musical virtuosity was widely admired by his contemporaries. Pablo Casals praised him as [...] "the greatest cello talent I ever heard in my life", and Gregor Piatigorsky told Christine Walevska's father, [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> greatest cellist in the world; neither is Feuermann.
