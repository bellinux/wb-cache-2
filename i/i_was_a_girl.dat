500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja.

Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E
