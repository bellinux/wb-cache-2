5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, since the end of World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E
5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now be restricted to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E

As with Fallout 4, the game can be played in both first-person and third-person perspectives, with main gameplay consisting of both questing and exploration. Upon completion of quests, the player is rewarded with both the Fallout franchise's main fictional currency, bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles, and experience points.|$|E

The collection features an HD remaster of Dream Drop Distance as well as Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover, a cinematic retelling of Kingdom Hearts χ that reveals new parts of the series' history, and Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, a new game taking place after the events of the original Birth by Sleep, told from the perspective of Aqua.

5|$|Several factors, however, soon {{reduced the}} value of the treaty for Prussia. Treaty of Reichenbach of July 27, 1790, meant that Prussia was no longer {{considering}} a war with Austria; the Polish–Prussian alliance now had only an anti-Russian angle. Then, on September 9, the Great Sejm, despite some opposition, declared that Commonwealth territories could not be divided. As Prussia was expecting to receive Gdańsk and Toruń from the Commonwealth as a compensation in a subsequent treaty (with Commonwealth being compensated through territorial gains from another neighbor), the Sejm declaration that meant that no territory could be traded to another state made the Commonwealth a much less valuable party for Prussian long-term goals. Already in fall and winter of 1790, Prussian diplomacy begun negotiations with Russians, and <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> its abandoning of Poland.|$|E
5|$|During their suspension, Mulder and Scully {{venture to}} Hollywood {{to view the}} {{production}} of Federman's film. It is revealed that Federman's movie will be called The Lazarus Bowl, and Garry Shandling will play Mulder and Téa Leoni will play Scully. After filming is done, Mulder and Scully attend a screening of the film with Skinner, but are thoroughly disgusted at how their case, and they, are portrayed on the big screen. Mulder and Scully leave the set holding hands, presumably {{on their way to}} dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been suggested in the last few episodes. As the agents leave, the dead who were resting underneath the film set are revived and begin to dance passionately, reinforcing a theory Mulder made earlier in the episode.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E

5|$|In {{the credits}} of HD 1.5 Remix, clips of Kingdom Hearts Re:coded were shown, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> its {{inclusion}} in another collection. On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced that Re:coded {{would be part}} of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection, released exclusively on the PlayStation 3. Due to the games touch screen use on the Nintendo DS, console conversion was ruled out as it would necessitate a full remake. Two additional hours of cinematics were created for the game to cover the entire story and show the games connections to other Kingdom Hearts titles. The collection features the game as HD cinematics, much like 358/2 Days was in the HD 1.5 Remix collection. The collection also includes both Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix in HD and trophy support. Additional events occur in the cinematic scenes not seen in the original, with new voice acting, orchestrated audio, and including new battle scenes and a scene that ties Re:coded and Dream Drop Distance together. The collection was released in Japan on October 2, 2014, North America on December 2, 2014, Australia on December 4, 2014, and Europe on December 5, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the credits}} of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix, clips {{of the games}} {{featured}} in the collection were shown, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> the collection. Additionally, when IGN interviewed Shinji Hashimoto about Kingdom Hearts III, he stated that the studio would consider another HD collection if {{the reaction to the}} first one was positive enough. The collection was announced on October 14, 2013, exclusively for the PlayStation 3. As with HD 1.5 Remix, the collection was developed mainly by the Square Enix 1st Production Department in Osaka, along with some help from Square Enix's Tokyo team. In July 2017, Nomura spoke on bringing the collection to the Xbox One, saying he did not believe there was much demand for it outside of North America, but felt it could be a possibility after Square Enix completed development on Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Shishman is {{the most}} {{prominent}} medieval ruler in Bulgarian folklore. His name is heard {{in a number of}} legends, myths, tales and songs. He is represented as a heroic ruler who fought and died for his country, facing overwhelming enemy forces. There are a number of places throughout Bulgaria named after the him, ranging from castles and ruins to rocks, caves and localities. That legendary “geography” is mainly concentrated in the region of Sofia, Ihtiman and Samokov, though it extends to the Rhodope Mountains, Sredna Gora, Vratsa, Pleven, Prilep, Varna, etc. Near Samokov are the ruins of “Shishman's Fortress” with the emperor's wells, which reputedly spouted from the ruler's seven wounds. Further north, along the cliffs and heights of the Iskar Gorge, are “Shishman's Holes”, the caves where he hid while fighting the Ottomans for seven years. Other related toponyms usually associated with the emperor's last stand are Kokalyane (derived from kokal, meaning “bone”), Cherepish (from cherep, “skull”) and Lyutibrod (“Fierce Ford”), all thought to be <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> the fate of the perished Bulgarian troops.|$|E

5|$|The 2008–09 {{campaign}} was Leicester's first season outside {{the top two}} levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions, the fastest seven-year {{rise to the top}} of the English football league system apart from Ipswich Town in 1962. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand. The 2009–10 season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{advanced}} level of metallurgy in the area, coupled with its ease of access from the Continent, meant that Hengistbury Head became a significant Late-Iron Age port; trading worked metal of iron, silver, and bronze {{in return for}} figs, glass, tools and other goods. Armorican coins and pottery uncovered here show links to the Brittany peninsula. Amphorae used for the transportation of North Italian wine {{have been found in}} such quantities (more than all other sites in the south of England put together), that {{it is clear that the}} Head was a main port of entry into the country. However, no similar amphorae have been unearthed in Armorica, <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> a more direct trade route between Hengistbury Head and Italy. Most of these vessels date from before 50 B.C., while later styles are absent despite being common in other parts of Britain, indicating the wine trade seems to have declined at about the time Caesar began his Gaulish campaigns.|$|E
5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and <b>hinting</b> <b>at</b> her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E
