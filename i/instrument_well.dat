I had emptied my revolver, and my cartridges, Government ones, were all in a parcel--a confounded Government parcel--fastened with a strong brass wire. Where's the good of giving you cartridges, which you need in a hurry if you need them at all, in a case you can't open without a special <b>instrument?</b> <b>Well,</b> as I ran, and the spears whizzed round me, I tore at the wire with my teeth. It gave at last, or my head would now be decorating a stake outside the chief's pah. But my teeth gave when the brass cord gave, and I'll never lift a heavy table with them again." ...|$|E
60|$|Values of the Weights.--After preparatory trials, I adopted 1000 grains as {{the value}} of W and 1020 as that of R, but I am now {{inclined}} to think that 1010 would have been better. I made the weights by filling blank cartridges with shot, wool, and wads, so as to distribute the weight equally, and I closed the cartridges with a wad, turning the edges over it with the <b>instrument</b> <b>well</b> known to sportsmen. I wrote the corresponding value of the index of R on the wad by which each of them was closed, {{to serve as a}} register number. Thus the cartridge whose weight was WR4 was marked 4'. The values were so selected that there should be as few varieties as possible. There are thirty weights in all, but only ten varieties, whose Register Numbers are respectively 0, 1, 2, 3, 3-1/2, 4-1/2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12. The reason of this limitation of varieties was to enable the weights to be interchanged whenever there became reason to suspect that the eye had begun to recognise the appearance of any one of them, and that the judgment might be influenced by that recognition, and cease to be wholly guided by the sense of weight.|$|E

60|$|Let ABCD [in Fig. 29.] {{represent}} a Glass spherically concave on the foreside AB, {{and as much}} convex on the backside CD, so that it be every where of an equal thickness. Let it not be thicker on one side than on the other, lest it make Objects appear colour'd and indistinct, and let it be very truly wrought and quick-silver'd over on the backside; and set in the Tube VXYZ which must be very black within. Let EFG {{represent a}} Prism of Glass or Crystal placed near {{the other end of}} the Tube, in the middle of it, by means of a handle of Brass or Iron FGK, to the end of which made flat it is cemented. Let this Prism be rectangular at E, and let the other two Angles at F and G be accurately equal to each other, and by consequence equal to half right ones, and let the plane sides FE and GE be square, and by consequence the third side FG a rectangular Parallelogram, whose length is to its breadth in a subduplicate proportion of two to one. Let it be so placed in the Tube, that the Axis of the Speculum may pass through the middle of the square side EF perpendicularly and by consequence through the middle of the side FG at an Angle of 45 Degrees, and let the side EF be turned towards the Speculum, and the distance of this Prism from the Speculum be such that the Rays of the Light PQ, RS, &c. which are incident upon the Speculum in Lines parallel to the Axis thereof, may enter the Prism at the side EF, and be reflected by the side FG, and thence go out of it through the side GE, to the Point T, which must be the common Focus of the Speculum ABDC, and of a Plano-convex Eye-glass H, through which those Rays must pass to the Eye. And let the Rays at their coming out of the Glass pass through a small round hole, or aperture made in a little plate of Lead, Brass, or Silver, wherewith the Glass is to be covered, which hole must be no bigger than is necessary for Light enough to pass through. For so it will render the Object distinct, the Plate in which 'tis made intercepting all the erroneous part of the Light which comes from the verges of the Speculum AB. Such an <b>Instrument</b> <b>well</b> made, if it be six Foot long, (reckoning the length from the Speculum to the Prism, and thence to the Focus T) will bear an aperture of six Inches at the Speculum, and magnify between two and three hundred times. But the hole H here limits the aperture with more advantage, than if the aperture was placed at the Speculum. If the Instrument be made longer or shorter, the aperture must be in proportion as the Cube of the square-square Root of the length, and the magnifying as the aperture. But it's convenient that the Speculum be an Inch or two broader than the aperture at the least, and that the Glass of the Speculum be thick, that it bend not in the working. The Prism EFG must be no bigger than is necessary, and its back side FG must not be quick-silver'd over. For without quicksilver it will reflect all the Light incident on it from the Speculum.|$|E

5000|$|Practice is {{the act of}} rehearsing a {{behavior}} over and over, or engaging in an activity again and again, {{for the purpose of}} improving or mastering it, as in the phrase [...] "practice makes perfect". Sports teams practice to prepare for actual games. Playing a musical <b>instrument</b> <b>well</b> takes a lot of practice. It is a method of learning and of acquiring experience. The word derives from the Greek [...] "πρακτική" [...] (praktike), feminine of [...] "πρακτικός" [...] (praktikos), [...] "fit for or concerned with action, practical", and that from the verb [...] "πράσσω" [...] (prasso), [...] "to achieve, bring about, effect, accomplish". In American English, practice is used as both a noun and a verb, but in British English, there is a distinction between practice, used as a noun, and practise, used as a verb (see spelling differences).|$|E
5000|$|Experienced organists {{will usually}} vary {{their use of}} stops {{throughout}} a hymn tune, but most change them for the last verse. They will usually pull out stops that emphasise the bassline, or that are particularly loud, rich or harsh sounding. If the organ has a tuba stop, then this will often be used with the pedalboard, as it provides the loudest bass notes on the organ, and reeds are also useful (if available). Sometimes hymnals and other compilations of tunes (such as Carols for Choirs) that publish last verse harmonisations will indicate suitable stops to be pulled out for them, but organists are generally assumed to know the <b>instrument</b> <b>well</b> enough to discern for themselves which stops to use. The popular expression [...] "pull out all the stops" [...] originates from organ music (especially hymn accompaniment), and this technique is indeed occasionally used, the effect being known as the Full Organ.|$|E

50|$|Born in 1980 in Boston, MA Dee grew up {{in nearby}} Arlington. He got his first taste of soul music from local oldies radio station WODS when he was eight years old. As a child, {{he was drawn to}} the sounds of The Drifters, The Shirelles, Smokey Robinson, Sam Cooke and other doo wop, Motown and R&B greats. He always loved singing, and would often record made-up tunes into his tape recorder. He sang in school theatre {{productions}} and church choir, and was writing songs by his mid-teens. Dee began fronting a band soon after, but didn't pick up his first guitar until he was 18. With help from his musically inclined father and The Bob Dylan Six-Chord Songbook, he taught himself the <b>instrument</b> <b>well</b> enough to start performing as a solo artist a year later. During this period, Jesse immersed himself in the music of Otis Redding, Jackie Wilson, Solomon Burke, Etta James, James Brown and all the deep soul masters, listening, learning, writing and continuing to hone his craft by playing live every chance he could get.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{percussion}} {{was recorded}} in a disused candy factory located in Madison; Butch Vig, Marker and sound engineer Billy Bush set up a drum kit within the factory and recorded various fills, utilising the acoustics of the dilapidated building. Forced to stop after local police officers responded to complaints about the noise, some of the percussion was later incorporated into [...] "Temptation Waits" [...] (and also {{found its way into}} [...] "I Think I'm Paranoid" [...] and [...] "Hammering in My Head"). The guitars would typically be run through either a filter or a wah wah pedal, and then gated off a sixteenth-note pulse to create a keyboard-like effect. Instead of using synth bass, Garbage had Daniel Shulman perform electric bass on [...] "Temptation", mixed in with sub-bass. The band had wanted to use a theremin to create the whistle-like melodic line on the outro, and had hired one for use at the studio. The band couldn't perform the <b>instrument</b> <b>well,</b> and so utilized a sound created by an analog modeling synthesizer instead.|$|E
5000|$|Gibson's [...] "own" [...] ES-150, a [...] "more-upmarket ES model" [...] {{compared}} to the Ward and Spiegel models, had minor changes from the contract models, such as a solid carved spruce top, maple back and sides, and an adjustable truss rod. The first guitar was shipped to Bailey's House of Music on November 20, 1936. The instrument sold for $155 including cord, six-tube amplifier, and case. The pickup placement, closer to the instrument's neck than on Gibson's EH steel guitars and on guitars made by other manufacturers, produced a warmer, less [...] "trebly" [...] tone which suited the <b>instrument</b> <b>well</b> for jazz and blues. In 1937, the model's peak year, an average of forty guitars a month were shipped. In early 1937 Gibson also began shipping two other versions: a tenor guitar (the EST-150, with four strings and a 23" [...] scale, renamed the ETG-150 in 1940) and a plectrum version (the EPG-150, with a 27" [...] scale). Early players were Eddie Durham, Floyd Smith and, {{the most famous of}} them, Charlie Christian, who bought an ES-150 in 1936. His joining the Benny Goodman Sextet in August 1939 gave it [...] "a near-mythical status" [...] (aided by a feature in that year's December issue of Down Beat).|$|E

5000|$|His piping {{was also}} {{appreciated}} in Scotland - {{on one occasion}} he played for Mr. Forest, a musician and gunsmith in Jedburgh, who on seeing that he played this instrument, [...] "his countenance brightened, and harmonious feelings seemed to be dancing about {{the corners of his}} lips, and sparkling in the dilating pupils of his eyes. He informed me, that he was a great admirer of the instrument.... My pipes were in beautiful tune, and I succeeded in making a favourable impression on the minds of my delighted and complimentary company. I have often been astonished to find that the Union Pipes were such strangers in Scotland. It is an <b>instrument</b> <b>well</b> suited for the performance of Scottish Melodies, especially those of the minor or plaintive description. The beautiful harmony produced; the sweet and melancholy appealings of the upper notes, and the subdued tones of the chanters, render the Union Pipes infinitely superior to the Scotch bagpipe; the screaming. screeching, tearaway yells of which, resemble the wild wailings of some angry hurricane or, to use a more humble figure, the caterwauling of a thousand ill-conditioned cats." [...] On another occasion he played for a dinner party hosted by Sir Walter Scott - Scott had also engaged two Highland pipers, who [...] "paraded up and down the room giving vent to their unearthly music, and screaming out their tunes in such a horrid way that put a stop to all familiar conversation".|$|E
