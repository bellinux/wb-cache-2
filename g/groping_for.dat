500|$|Shortly {{after her}} return to Britain early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in {{the world premiere of}} Britten's Spring Symphony, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Britten had written this work {{specifically}} for her. At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented [...] "a peak to which I had been <b>groping</b> <b>for</b> the last three years". A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: [...] "Walter's very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best".|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{linguists}} led by Leonard Bloomfield in 1933 {{call these}} [...] "hesitation forms", {{the sounds of}} stammering (uh), stuttering (um, um), throat-clearing (ahem!), stalling (well, um, that is), interjected when the speaker is <b>groping</b> <b>for</b> words or {{at a loss for}} the next thought.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristics}} of apraxia of speech include difficulties in imitating speech sounds, imitating no-speech movements, such as sticking out the tongue, <b>groping</b> <b>for</b> sounds, and in severe cases, {{the inability to}} produce any sounds, inconsistent errors and a slow rate of speech. However, {{patients who suffer from}} apraxia of speech may retain the ability to produce formulaic language, such as [...] "thank you" [...] or [...] "how are you?". Apraxia of speech can also occur in conjunction with dysarthria, an illness which inflicts muscle weakness affecting speech production), or aphasia, which causes language difficulties related to neurological damage.|$|E

2500|$|The NBC History Files at the Library of Congress lend {{support to}} the notion that NBC was {{gradually}} <b>groping</b> <b>for</b> a way to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network. [...] For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated May 13, 1936, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations. (Compare and contrast this with the way the Harry Lauder broadcast of 1929 was handled, above.) [...] There also exists an October 1938 sales force memorandum, which contains talking points on how to differentiate the Blue Network from the Red Network and CBS. Even as far back as December 1932, NBC had set forth a policy banning specific references not only to CBS, but even to the Red Network.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1947, {{she went}} to live at the Abbey Art Centre, an artists' {{community}} located in New Barnet, Hertfordshire, near London. King was a fairly early resident there. Quite a number of Australian artists lived at the Abbey at various times. These included Robert Klippel, James Gleeson,Phillip Martin, , Noel Counihan and Bernard Smith, who became an art historian. Grahame King, whom King later married, arrived later in 1947. King's early works at the Abbey were figurative, but not realistic. But {{it was during this}} period that King [...] "made an arbitrary decision to move away from representational work". [...] "I could not see how I could do any more with the figure, so I decided to move into what I call non-representational work. I don't like to call it abstraction as my work was not abstract in concept. I was <b>groping</b> <b>for</b> my own way." [...] She had two exhibitions in London, then spent six months in Paris, which she enjoyed. In September 1949, {{she went to}} New York.|$|E
2500|$|Album of the Year was {{released}} in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries (for example, in Germany, the album debuted at No.2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months). In Australia, Album of the Year went to No.1 and was certified Platinum. The album charted in many countries in Europe. To date, Album of the Year has sold around 2 million copies worldwide. [...] The singles [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] and [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow" [...] had minimal success (notably, the music video for [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow", which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, {{was inspired by the}} Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo). [...] "Stripsearch" [...] {{was released}} as a single in various countries (excluding the US and UK). The album received largely negative reviews from US-based critics at the time. Rolling Stone magazine wrote in their original review [...] " [...] are floundering around desperately, <b>groping</b> <b>for</b> a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant", while Pitchfork Media stated [...] "Album Of The Year leaves one feeling like waking up and finding last night's used condom -- sure, the ride was fun while it lasted, but what remains is just plain icky. And you definitely don't want it in your CD player." ...|$|E

60|$|He <b>groped</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} and sank into a chair. Quest fetched a {{decanter}} and a glass from the sideboard, poured out some wine and held it to his lips. The Professor drank it eagerly.|$|R
