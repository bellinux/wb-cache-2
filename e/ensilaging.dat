25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread <b>ensilaging,</b> it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today <b>ensilaging</b> can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E

40|$|Fodder beets (Beta vulgaris L.) are {{especially}} respected for their high feeding value and high netto-energy yield per hectare. The price per nutritive value is lowest {{as compared to}} other forages. Preservation of fodders beets demands thorough cleaning without damaging and regularly occurs as a whole in well closed piles. In addition, feeding them to the animals is labour demanding. These disadvantages enforce the research towards other preservation methods which {{may be able to}} valorise this valuable type of roughage. The preservation of fodder beets in silages using silo bags, either separately or in combination with maize was investigated. Fodder beets were harvested and ensilaged at the ideal moment of maize harvest (October) or fodder beets were harvested at the ideal moment for fodder beet harvest (November) and consequently ensilaged with previously ensilaged maize. Highest energy yields of the silages were recorded at optimal harvest time for fodder beets. <b>Ensilaging</b> fodder beets separately resulted in large energy losses due to effluent and dry matter losses. Using lab scale silage, possible solutions for these large losses were investigated. Addition of 10 % maize did reduce the effluent losses but dry matter losses remained at a high level. Addition of 4, 5 l propionic acid per ton beets reduced effluent and dry matter losses sufficiently. <b>Ensilaging</b> foliage was another point of interest.

This paper examines the feeding value of sun-dried brewers’ grain and maize silage (whole plant) for fattening rabbits. Twenty-four individually caged 8 -wk-old rabbits {{were used to determine}} the digestibility. Both wet products were sun-dried and ground before being incorporated into a basal diet. The inclusion level at the expense of all basal ingredients amounted to 30 %. Basal diet and both experimental diets were fed ad libitum to 8 rabbits during the 4 -d balance trial. The determined digestibility of protein, fat, crude fibre and neutral detergent fibre digestibility amounted to 76. 2 and 77. 2 %; 86. 5 and 99. 1 %; 8. 1 and 8. 3 % and 28. 0 and 13. 5 %, respectively, for brewers’ grain and maize silage.

40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} the control of lactic acid fermentation of selected plant substrates using microbial starters and enzyme preparation. Interactions between the starter culture of Enterococcus faecium M 74 and natural microflora were studied during the fermentation of cut onion and shredded cabbage. Fermentation experiments were held in evacuated plastic bags. The effect of probiotic-enzyme preparations on the course of beginning stages of <b>ensilaging</b> of wilted grass and alfalfa was studied. The evacuated plastic bags simulating the conditions during a large-scale ensiling technology were used. The starter culture of Enterococcus faecium M 74 {{was found to be}} a powerful tool for the control of lactic acid fermentation of cut onion and shredded cabbage. The results of the first part of experiments show that the use of starter culture allows to reduce the growth of heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria and to decreased production of their metabolites -acetic acid and carbon dioxide. The bigger inoculum of Enterococcus faecium M 74 in the range 104 to 108. g- 1 was used the faster production of lactic acid and corresponding decrease of pH value at the beginning stages of fermentation was observed. At the same time the production of carbon dioxide and acetic acid was reduced. The gas production during the fermentation cannot be totally suppressed by further increasing amount of inoculum due to the respiration of plant tissue. The starter culture also affected molds and yeast. The increasing amount of inoculum caused the inhibition of their growth at the beginning of fermentation and this effect did not correspond with the changes of the gas composition inside the package. The second part of experiments focused to the use of enzyme preparations during the <b>ensilaging</b> of wilted grasses and alfalfa shows that: glucose oxidase applied just before sealing the bag caused faster reduction of oxygen concentration inside the bag and slower carbon dioxide production. The fast introduction of anaerobic conditions inhibited the growth of molds and accelerated the production of butyric acid. During the fermentation of alfalfa the reduction of lactic acid production was observed too. Any effect of glucose oxidase on the pH value reduction was not found, it {{can be explained by the}} lack of oxygen inside the bag. To affect the pH value of ensilage the preparations should be added earlier before the silage sealing. The thesis summarizes the results of several years wide studies. The carried out experiments have been done usually as a part of practical study devoted to the given technological problem.

Ensiled HMEC was evaluated for fermentation quality, silage microbiology, and aerobic stability. In control and inoculated ensiled HMEC, maximum pH reduction was observed within 7 d; such pH reduction was observed only after 21 d of ensiling with PA-treated HMEC. Irrespective of treatment, ammonia concentration increased with storage time. The lactic acid content increased up to 42 d of ensilage; between 138 d and 202 d of <b>ensilage,</b> there was a substantial reduction in lactic acid with all treatments. Throughout <b>ensilage,</b> {{there was no difference in}} water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content between control and inoculated HMEC.

40|$|Global crop {{production}} is growing continuously, with {{large amounts of}} crop residues being produced. Besides, {{the high cost of}} concentrates and quality forages has raised the interest to include fibrous roughages in ruminant nutrition, as indicated by Alsersy et al. (2015) in their work on effect of Mediterranean saltbush (Atriplex halimus) <b>ensilaging</b> with two enzyme cocktails on feed intake, nutrient digestibility and ruminal fermentation in sheep. The increasing expansion of agricultural activities have resulted in an unending production of agricultural waste which constitutes environmental nuisance, if not properly disposed. In most developing countries, this waste is burnt causing environmental problems and health challenges. The utilization of biodegraded ensiled agricultural waste, as an energy source, in livestock nutrition is proposed as a viable solution of reducing pollution. Agricultural waste such as straws is carbohydrate-rich materials that have a large potential as a dietary energy source for ruminants. This study aimed to determine the effect of anaerobic ensiling of raw agricultural waste with a fibrolytic enzyme cocktail as a cleaner and sustainable biological product for animal feed. Ten samples of 1 kg each of wheat straw, corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse were ensiled with enzyme cocktail at 0, 1 or 3 mL/kg dry matter of feed. Before ensiling, feed samples were chopped at 5 cm and moistened to a relative humidity of approximately 50 % and then kept for 30 d in plastic bales. Feed type enzyme level interactions were observed (P < 0. 01) for nutrient contents and fermentation kinetics. Increasing the level of enzyme cocktail increased (P < 0. 01) crude protein and ether extract contents but decreased organic matter and non-structural carbohydrates contents of the three feeds. The enzyme cocktail also decreased (P < 0. 01) neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, cellulose and hemicellulose contents of corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse. The high level of the enzyme cocktail increased (P < 0. 05) methane production from corn stalks but decreased it from sugarcane bagasse. Fermentation parameters response to ensiling differed among the ensiled feeds. It can be concluded that anaerobic fermentation of enzyme-treated agricultural waste and feeding it to livestock is one of the viable ways of utilizing this waste which otherwise could have constituted nuisance and pollution to the environment, if incinerated or improperly disposed...|$|E

The assessed grass species were wilted after the cut for an identical time 36 hours (2008), resp. 24 hours (2009). The treatment was made either with a chemical preparation (formic acid, propionic acid, ammonium formate) and/or with a bio­lo­gi­cal inoculant (Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus salivarius, cellulase, hemicellulase and amylase). The amount of the chemical ingredient was 4 [*]l .  t− 1 and the amount of the biological additive was 10 [*]g .  t− 1. The biomass was after wilting ensilaged in con­tai­ners whose diameter and height were 0. 15 [*]m and 0. 64 [*]m, respectively. After 60 days of <b>ensilaging,</b> the silages were assessed for pH, organic acids content, ethanol content and acidity of water extract (AWE); organic nutrients assessed in the silages were crude fibre (CF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), crude protein (CP) and digestibility of organic matter (DOM). Hygienic safety was assessed from the contents of zearalenon, fumonisin and aflatoxin mycotoxins. The high (P < 0. 05) dry matter (DM) content in Festulolium pabulare silages indicates that the species tends to rapid wilting. The higher DM content reflected in lower biomass losses (P < 0. 05). The lowest pH values (P < 0. 05) were detected in silages made of Festulolium braunii. The fact relates to the higher content of lactic acid in the prepared microsilages. The use of ensiling additives affected {{the quality of}} extracts. Namely the application of the biological additive led to the increased content (P < 0. 05) of not only lactic acid but acetic acid too. Titrable acidity was not affected by the ensiling additives. As to the emanation of ethanol, heterofermentative bacteria of lactic fermentation apparently took part in the fermentation process of the silages as well. While the evaluated forage species showed differences in the di­ges­ti­bi­li­ty of organic matter (P < 0. 05), the application of preservatives did not influence the content of organic nutrients. Fumonisin was not detected at all and aflatoxins were below the level of detection.

Fermentointituotteella I säilöttyjen koerehujen säilönnällinen laatu jäi kuitenkin muurahaishapolla säilöttyä vertailurehua heikommaksi. Murskatun ohrarehuviljan säilönnässä käytetyn fermentointituotteen II säilöntävaikutus perustui ensisijaisesti vapaaseen maitohappoon. Rehuviljaa säilöttiin myös pelkällä heralla, jolloin säilöntä perustui laktoosin stimuloimaan maitohappokäymiseen. Vertailusäilöntäaineena käytetyn muurahaishapon ja fermentointituotteen II säilöntävaikutusten välillä ei ollut merkitsevää eroa. Rehuvilja säilyi hyvin myös ilman säilöntäainelisäystä. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to produce whey based preservatives for ensiling grass and high moisture barley grain. The lactose in whey was fermented to lactic, acetic and propionic acids in a batch process with Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The fermentation product was concentrated to a content of 43 - 51 % of lactic acid, 2 - 6 % of acetic acid and less than 1 % of propionic acid. The theoretical preservative action of fermentation product I was based on the combined effect of salts of these acids, mainly lactate and acetate. In the preservation experiment, fermentation product I was applied at various doses as a preservative when the first cut timothy (Phleum pratense) was <b>ensilaged.</b> The fermentation quality of subsequent silages was, however, poorer than that of controls <b>ensilaged</b> with formic acid. High moisture grains were first rolled and then <b>ensilaged</b> with fermentation product II, the preservative action of which was mainly based on free lactic acid. Fresh whey was also used as a preservative and its preservative action was based on lactic acid fermentation stimulated by lactose. There was no difference in fermentation quality between grains <b>ensilaged</b> with formic acid as control treatment and fermentation product II. The fermentation quality of grains <b>ensilaged</b> with no additive was also good. vokMyynti MTT tietopalveluyksikk...|$|R
40|$|ResumoObjetivou-se descrever as características quantitativas e qualitativas referentes à cultura da soja (Glicine max), com a finalidade de silagem de planta inteira. No Brasil, a área cultivada de soja na safra de 2010 / 2011, de acordo com dados da Embrapa (2011) foi de 24, 2 milhões de hectares. A irregularidade da ocorrência de chuvas tem inviabilizado economicamente muitas lavouras de soja para a produção de grãos pela diminuição da produtividade e aumento dos custos da produção, possibilitando a utilização da planta inteira de soja como silagem para a alimentação animal. As vantagens da utilização da silagem de planta inteira de soja em comparação a de outras gramíneas como o milho e o sorgo estão nos maiores valores médios encontrados, de 18 % proteína bruta, 31 % de matéria seca, 32 % de fibra em detergente ácido e 41 % de fibra em detergente neutro, 23 % de extrato etéreo e produtividade média de sete toneladas por hectare, onde a participação de grãos na silagem representa 35 %, permitindo que o produtor possa agregar maior valor ao seu produto final e não ficar dependente dos preços alternados do mercado interno na safra e da elevação do preço na entressafra para compra dos subprodutos do processamento da soja, tendo como {{principal}} limitação à competição da silagem de soja com a venda dos grãos. Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to describe the quantitative and qualitative characteristics referring to the culture of the soy (Glicine max), with the purpose of <b>ensilage</b> of entire plant. In Brazil, the cultivated area of soy in 2010 / 2011, according to data by Embrapa (2011) was 24, 2 million hectares. The irregularity of the rain occurrence has made impracticable economically many soy crops for the production of grains for the reduction of the productivity and increase of the costs of the production, having made possible the use of the entire plant of soy as <b>ensilage</b> for the animal feeding. The advantages of using <b>ensilage</b> of entire soy plant in comparison to other grassy ones, as the zea and sorghum ones, are the biggest joined average values, of 18 % crude protein, 31 % of dry substance, 32 % of acid detergent fiber and 41 % of neutral detergent fiber, 23 % of ether extract and average productivity of seven tons per hectare, where the participation of grains in the <b>ensilage</b> represents 35 %, allowing the producer to add greater value to its final item and not to be dependent on the alternating prices of domestic market in harvest and on the increase in price during the period between harvests in order to purchase by-products of the soy processing, having as main limitation the competition between soy <b>ensilage</b> and grains sales.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in order to evaluate in situ degradability and the degradation kineticsof dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber of silages of three sorghum genotypes. Twoisogenic lines of grain sorghum (CMSXS 114 and CMSXS 165) and one sorghum hybrid (double purpose, BR- 700) were used. The plantation of the genotypes {{was carried out in}} summer/ 2009, in seedbeds 5 m long, 3 m wide and 0. 75 m row spacing. After cutting, the material was <b>ensilaged.</b> After the opening of the silos the samples were pre-dried,milled and stored in glass bottles for analyses of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber,hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin, pH, NH 3 /NT and in situ digestibility of the dry matter. An entirely randomizedexperimental design was used, with four replications and four treatments, and the means were compared by the Tukeytest at 5 % significance. As for degradation rate of DM, the <b>ensilage</b> of CMSXS 165 line without tannin was superior toall of the treatments. The isogenic line genotype without tannin (CMSXS 165) presented greater effective degradabilityof CP than the line with tannin (CMSXS 114). Thus, the results found in this experiment allow concluding that thepresence of tannin can reduce the rumen degradability of the dry matter and crude protein of the <b>ensilages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} found world-wide in maize and cause not only {{considerable}} crop losses, but produce also toxic secondary metabolites (mycotoxins) like deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA). The {{purpose of this}} study was to carry out exploratory research about the presence of mycotoxins in maize. In a first experiment the varietal differences in susceptibility to Fusarium and contamination of mycotoxins were evaluated. Silage maize varieties seemed more susceptible to Fusarium than corn varieties. Even plants with no visible symptoms contained mycotoxins. High concentrations of DON and ZEA were found in kernels as well in the vegetative parts of the plant. Mycotoxins were especially located at the stem base. A clear relationship was detected between chlorophyll content and visible symptoms of Fusarium species. An <b>ensilage</b> experiment indicated that the <b>ensilage</b> process has no reducing effects on the mycotoxin content. Further research is necessary to confirm these first results...|$|R
