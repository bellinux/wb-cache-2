At Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} mean rating out of 100 to reviews by music critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 29 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick, Andy Gill of The Independent, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times each gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. McCormick felt that [...] "(f)or {{the first time}} in years, [...] doesn't sound desperate", praising it in comparison to Hard Candy and MDNA. Saeed called it: [...] "a fine collection of sturdy pop tunes in which Madonna finally allows herself to look back and sometimes pilfer from her peak periods of the late 80s and early 2000s". Murphy wrote [...] "the indisputable pop icon <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a tentative bang" [...] after MDNA had [...] "few memorable pop hits". For Gill, the most impressive aspect of Rebel Heart was Madonna's vocals, while Erlewine found the album to be a revival of Madonna's defiant side and her confessional mood.|$|E
