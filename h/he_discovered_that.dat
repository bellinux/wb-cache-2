5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|While on tour in 2011, Flatfoot 56 {{played at}} Summerfest in Milwaukee with Less than Jake. Less than Jake drummer Vinnie Fiorello, owner of Paper + Plastick, saw the band play and was {{impressed}} by their energy and performance. When <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the band {{was looking for a}} record label, he offered to sign them.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E

5|$|After joining up {{with the}} team for batting {{practice}} in June 1923, Gehrig was sent by Yankees manager Miller Huggins to the Hartford Senators. After a good start, Gehrig went through a long slump and suffered depression which led him to consider quitting baseball. Upon hearing this, Krichell was sent to Hartford {{to speak with the}} star player. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Gehrig was drinking, boosted his confidence and gave him batting advice, including one of Ty Cobb's batting tricks. Gehrig started hitting again, and eventually joined the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
50|$|As Moist {{attempts}} {{to revitalize the}} service, <b>he</b> <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> {{a few months before}} taking the job, a number of his predecessors have predeceased in the building within weeks of each other in unusual circumstances. <b>He</b> also <b>discovers</b> <b>that</b> the mail inside the building has taken {{on a life of its}} own, and is nearly suffocated as a result.|$|R

5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project {{that had already been}} penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Law {{originally}} {{found a job}} as {{a traveling}} carpet salesman. He continued until <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> his employer was misrepresenting domestic rugs as being imported and was also charging premium prices. His next employer, an outfitter of steamships and hotels, went out of business in the 1860s, when the American Civil War affected the business. Law struggled through unemployment, and even while working, pay was low. At one point, Law was employed at a store and was making eight dollars a week.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte then {{sailed to}} rejoin Sercey and the {{corvette}} Brûle-Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila. This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy {{gathering in the}} Pearl River in January 1799, but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were driven off by the Royal Navy escort squadron. Dispirited, Sercey returned westwards to Île de France, narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port. On arrival <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule were the only ships remaining of his original command, the others having returned to France or been lost in battle.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{synthetic}} element with complicated physical, chemical and metallurgical properties. It is {{not found in}} nature in appreciable quantities. Until mid-1944, the only plutonium that had been isolated had been produced in cyclotrons in microgram amounts, whereas weapons required kilograms. In April 1944, physicist Emilio Segrè, {{the head of the}} Los Alamos Laboratory's P-5 (Radioactivity) Group, received the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that,</b> in addition to the plutonium-239 isotope, it also contained significant amounts of plutonium-240. The Manhattan Project produced plutonium in nuclear reactors at the Hanford Engineer Works near Hanford, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Redheffer {{moved to}} New York City {{and set up}} a similar scam after {{rebuilding}} his machine. However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its unsteady motions at an exhibition. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the machine was operated by a man using a crank in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for his machine in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Odessa, where <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> no {{one would}} employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put {{together}} a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban {{was about to be}} placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{was asked}} to write a series called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the {{producers}} wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} on a summer replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{obscuration}} {{caused by}} yellow clouds had been {{noted in the}} 1870s when they were observed by Schiaparelli. Evidence for such clouds was observed during the oppositions of 1892 and 1907. In 1909, Antoniadi noted {{that the presence of}} yellow clouds was associated with the obscuration of albedo features. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy. He suggested windblown sand or dust as the cause of the clouds.|$|E

After realizing {{that the only way to}} betray his father is to hurt himself, Andrews tells Carlyon to leave and that he will take the blame for Elizabeth's death.|$|R
5|$|The {{first such}} campaign, an {{attempted}} reconquest of the Emirate of Crete led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring {{a victory over}} the Arabs in Crete, Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas. Theoktistos hurried back to Constantinople, where <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named Boletus puniceus by Harry D. Thiers in 1965, based on {{specimens}} {{he found in}} Napa County, California, on 23 November 1963. In 1975, Thiers changed the name to Boletus amygdalinus (a nomen nudum) as <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the epithet had already been used for a different bolete found in Yunnan, China, published in 1948. The fungus was transferred to Suillellus in 2014 after molecular phylogenetics demonstrated that S.amygdalinus was in a lineage distinct from Boletus.|$|E
5|$|Upon his release, Morris {{returned}} to Peekskill where <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> {{he had been}} promoted {{to the rank of}} captain while in the custody of the British. Morris commanded a company back to White Plains until he received orders to head south to Virginia. Upon arrival, Morris's company, under the overall command of General George Washington, aided in Siege of Yorktown, the last major battle of the American Revolution. Specifically, Morris's company of light infantry provided support to the forlorn hope commanded by Colonel Alexander Hamilton.|$|E
