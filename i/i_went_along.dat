Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E
2500|$|Cahill {{began his}} career with AFC Dronfield, a Sunday league team, where he played until he was 15. During his time there, he was scouted {{by a number of}} clubs, {{including}} Barnsley, Sheffield Wednesday, Derby County and Aston Villa, the last of which he signed for {{as a member of the}} club's Academy. [...] "All my friends played for the local side, AFC Dronfield, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> and started playing centre half and in centre midfield for them," [...] said Cahill in an interview with the Manchester Evening News. Cahill started his career as central midfielder but moved to centre back after a shot up in terms of his height within the space of a year when he was about 15 or 16, just when he was looking to get his first YTS contract.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

2500|$|Narrated Anas ibn Malik: [...] "I know (about) the Hijab (the {{order of}} veiling of women) {{more than anybody}} else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to ask me about it. Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> with him too. When we reached the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E

"Well, you see, I've been so {{bothered with}} my property, that I'm tired of it, and don't mean to save up any more, but {{give it away}} as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> and then nobody will envy me, or want to steal it, and I shan't be suspecting folks and {{worrying}} about my old cash," [...] replied Tommy, on whom the cares and anxieties of a millionaire weighed heavily.|$|R
