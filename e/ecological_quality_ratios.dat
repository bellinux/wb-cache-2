The need for a methodology to identify waterbodies impacted acidification and to assess the extent of biological recovery is relevant to the EUWater Framework Directive, which requires methods to quantify differences in biology between impacted and unimpacted or reference sites. This study presents a newWFD-compliant metric based on diatoms Diatom Acidification Metric: DAM) for assessing the acidification status of rivers. A database of 558 benthic diatom samples and associated water chemistry data was assembled. Diatom taxa were assigned to one of 5 indicator classes {{on the basis of their}} pH optimum, assessed using Gaussian logistic regression, and these indicator values used to calculate a DAM score for each site using weighted averaging. Reference sites were selected on the basis of their acid neutralising capacity (ANC) and calcium concentration, and a regression model developed to predict expected DAM for each site using pH and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. Site-specific DAM scoreswere used to calculate <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratios</b> ranging from≥ 1, where the diatom assemblage showed no impact, to (theoretically) 0, when the diatom assemblage was indicative of major anthropogenic activities. The boundary between ‘high’ and ‘good’ status was defined as the 25 th percentile of <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratios</b> (EQRs) of all reference sites. The boundary between ‘good’ and ‘moderate’ status was set at the point at which nutrient sensitive and nutrient-tolerant taxa were present in equal relative abundance.

40|$|Abstract: The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{is in need}} of a {{practical}} method and index suitable for comparing the ecological status of invertebrate fauna in rivers throughout Europe. The uncertainties that characterize lotic sampling methods can be omitted by increasing sampling effort up to a species detection probability threshold. We describe a statistical model which provides the background for applying a sampling protocol aiming to record the total number of common and abundant species. Methods, sample standards and sorting time become less significant to the result as long as the total sample is sufficiently large to detect common species. An index called the Intercalibrated Benthic Invertebrate Biodiversity Index – IBIBI – is proposed based on Observed / Expected species ratios for EPT groups. The <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratio</b> thus obtained may then be adjusted to WFD’s ecological status scale within each region or river type across Europe, which then can be compared and intercalibrated.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive EU 2000 / 60 /EC (WFD) was {{implemented}} for reservoirs at a regional scale (northeastern Spain). Twenty-one reservoirs were monitored quarterly {{over the course}} of a year. Using principal component analysis, the reservoirs were classified into types according to their geological and morphometric features. The <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> (EQ) of the reservoirs was assessed by integrating values of total chlorophyll a, cyanophyta chlorophyll a concentration, fish metrics, Secchi depth, averaged hypolimnetic oxygen concentration and total phosphorus. For each reservoir type, a reference condition of quality was selected. When possible, this reference was the reservoir displaying the best EQ; otherwise expert judgment was used. To allow comparison of quality among reservoirs belonging to different types, thus identifying intrinsic differences, an <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratio</b> (EQR) was calculated by dividing the EQ value of each reservoir by that of its reference. According to EQR, the majority of the reservoirs accomplished the quality criteria of the WFD. This study identified a number of useful indicators for EQ assessment.

In South Wales, these issues are exemplified by the rivers Taff and Ely, which have a well-documented history of pollution. We developed a network of river-monitoring sites to capture as many sources of impairment as possible and to provide an integrated assessment of basin-wide conditions using established, recently revised and new methods to assess ecological status {{as required by the}} Water Framework Directive (WFD). Most of the 34 river sites, except those in upstream areas, had moderate or poor ecological status and low species richness.

This intercalibration, the first attempted at such a wide European scale, was performed on the response of river macro-invertebrates to multiple stressors using national data from fifteen Member States belonging to the Central Baltic Geographical Intercalibration Group (CBGIG). Member State based their boundaries on samples that are not directly comparable because of differences in sampling methods and defined their boundaries using different biotic indices. In order to facilitate a comparison of boundaries, values of national classification systems were expressed as <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratios</b> (EQRs: ratio between the measured status of the biological quality element and the expected value of the biological status at reference state) and translated to a common metric.

A range representing an acceptable degree of uncertainty around the mean high/good and good/moderate boundary values, known as the ¿harmonisation band¿ (mean boundary value ± 0. 05 EQR units) was defined to account for variation between national methods.

The tendency of this index {{to show a}} unimodal relationship with productivity {{has been the subject}} of several studies. In the present work, the behavior of H′ and three related ecological indices (Simpson, Hill, and Evenness) was investigated using phytoplankton assemblages along a eutrophication gradient. We used both natural and simulated assemblages, whereby the comparison enabled us to assess the role of environmental ‘noise’ on index behavior. We developed simulated assemblages based on phytoplankton distributions predicted by two model types: the log series statistical model and the random fraction niche-based model. Using field data, H′ and the related Simpson index showed expected unimodal relationships with eutrophication. The same unimodal relationships were reproduced with simulated assemblages. Comparing the simulations with natural assemblages along a eutrophication gradient showed that there was much unexplained variance in the real-world data, suggesting that these diversity indices are sensitive to stochastic processes. An analysis of the simulated assemblages using relative abundance distributions suggested that increasing H′ and Simpson index values in the low range of the eutrophication gradient were due to increasing species richness, and that decreasing index values in the high range of the eutrophication gradient were due to decreasing evenness. In addition, this analysis revealed how assemblages of identical H′ values arose from contrasting community structures found in the low- and high-range of eutrophication. The high variability and non-linearity of the Shannon and Simpson indices along a eutrophication gradient suggests that these measures of diversity are inappropriate for use as water quality monitoring assessment tools.

40|$|AbstractThe Benthic Ecosystem Quality Index 2 (BEQI 2) is the Dutch multi-metric index (MMI) for {{assessing}} the status and trend of benthic invertebrates in transitional and coastal waters for the Water Framework Directive (WFD). It contains the same indicators, i. e. species richness, Shannon index and AMBI, as in the multivariate m-AMBI. The latter MMI has been adopted by several European countries {{in the context of}} WFD implementation. In contrast to m-AMBI, the BEQI 2 calculation procedure has been strongly simplified and consists of two steps, i. e. the separate indicator values are normalized using their long-term reference values resulting in three <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratios</b> (EQRs), which are subsequently averaged to give one BEQI 2 value. Using this method only small numbers of samples need to be analysed by Dutch benthos laboratories annually, without the necessity to co-analyse a larger historical dataset. BEQI 2 EQR values appeared to correlate quantitatively very well with m-AMBI EQR values. In addition, a data pooling procedure has been added to the BEQI 2 tool which enables the pooling of small core samples (0. 01 – 0. 025 m 2) into larger standardized data pools of 0. 1 m 2 {{in order to meet the}} data requirements of the AMBI indicator and to obtain comparable reference values. Furthermore, the BEQI 2 tool automatically and efficiently converts species synonym names into standardized species names. The BEQI 2 tool has been applied to all Dutch benthos data monitored by Rijkswaterstaat in the period of 1991 – 2010 in the transitional and coastal waters and salt lakes and these results are reported here for the first time.

40|$|The EU Water Framework Directive {{has imposed}} new {{challenges}} {{for development of}} the surface water classification and assessment methods. The ecological quality assessment based on <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratios</b> (EQRs) requires setting of type specific reference conditions for biological and chemical quality elements. One tasks of the CHARM project was to evaluate the applicability of different approaches and to provide guidance and tools {{for the establishment of}} reference conditions for phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea. In this report we evaluate the possibility to use historical data and long-term monitoring datasets to hind-cast past phytoplankton biomass and composition. We also discuss the potential applicability of paleoecological investigations, and dynamic modelling for reconstruction of historical reference conditions for phytoplankton indicators, such as biomass and composition of dominant taxonomic groups. The history of biological and oceanographical research in the Baltic Sea is relatively long in comparison to many other sea areas. Therefore it provides a unique possibility to evaluate the applicability of historical records for setting the reference conditions. In early 1900, a number of investigators carried out studies on composition and abundance of phytoplankton in several areas of the Baltic. However, the early studies were mostly based on qualitative sampling and covered only limited spatial and temporal scales. The methodological differences in sampling and in analytical methods, makes it very difficult to compare historical data with present day monitoring results. The potential approaches allowing proper comparison of current and historical data would require that the ‘reconstructed’ historical methods were calibrated against the current sampling and analytical methods throughout the seasonal cycle in several coastal type-areas. However, such approach {{is beyond the scope of}} the CHARM project. Instead we evaluated the historical records using ‘expert opinion’ (e. g. evaluation which species would have not been sampled by early researchers and scoring the dominance and abundance evaluations of the early researchers with most probable corresponding scoring of current data).

Its focus lies on the harmonization of national classification methods to guarantee a common understanding of Good Ecological Status' in surface waters. This article defines reference conditions and sets class boundaries for deep (mean depth [15 m, IC lake type L-AL 3) and moderately deep (mean depth 315 m, IC lake type L-AL 4) Alpine lakes [0. 5 km 2. Data were collated from each of the five EU member states included in the Alpine Geographical Intercalibration Group (Alpine GIG: Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia). Hydro-morphological, chemical and biological data from 161 sites (sampling stations) in 144 Alpine lakes over a period of seven decades were collated in a database. Based on a set of reference criteria, 18 L-AL 3 and 13 L-AL 4 reference sites were selected. Reference conditions were defined using a combined approach, based on historical, paleolimnological and monitoring data in conjunction with trophic modelling and expert judgement. Reference values and class boundaries were set for annual mean total biomass (biovolume), and then derived for annual mean chlorophyll-a using a regression between the two parameters. In order to allow for geographical differences within the Alpine GIG and to facilitate the inclusion of the broadly defined common IC types and national lake types, ranges were defined for each reference value. Range of reference values are 0. 2 0. 3 mg l- 1 (L-AL 3) and 0. 50. 7 mg l- 1 (L-AL 4) for total biovolume and 1. 51. 9 lg l- 1 (L-AL 3) and 2. 7 3. 3 lg l- 1 (L-AL 4) for chlorophyll-a.

40|$|The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{requires}} a good chemical and ecological status of European surface waters by 2015. Integrated, risk-based management of river basins {{is presumed to}} be an appropriate approach to achieve that goal. The approach of focusing on distinct hazardous substances in surface waters together with investment in best available technology for treatment of industrial and domestic effluents was successful in significantly reducing excessive contamination of several European river basins. The use {{of the concept of}} chemical status in the WFD is based on this experience and focuses on chemicals for which there is a general agreement that they should be phased out. However, the chemical status, based primarily on a list of 33 priority substances and 8 priority hazardous substances, considers {{only a small portion of}} possible toxicants and does not address all causes of ecotoxicological stress in general. Recommendations for further development of this concept are 1) to focus on river basin¿specific toxicants, 2) to regularly update priority lists with a focus on emerging toxicants, 3) to consider state-of-the-art mixture toxicity concepts and bioavailability to link chemical and ecological status, and 4) to add a short list of priority effects and to develop environmental quality standards for these effects. The ecological status reflected by <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratios</b> is a leading principle of the WFD. While on the European scale the improvement of hydromorphological conditions and control of eutrophication are crucial to achieve a good ecological status, on a local and regional scale managers have to deal with multiple pressures. On this scale, toxic pollution may play an important role. Strategic research is necessary 1) to identify dominant pressures, 2) to predict multistressor effects, 3) to develop stressor- and type-specific metrics of pressures, and 4) to better understand the ecology of recovery. The concept of reference conditions to define the ecological status is hard to apply and tends to ignore the fact that ecosystems can be highly dynamic. A better understanding of ecosystem responses to changes as well as early warning systems and concepts sensitive to various stressors to discriminate disturbances from natural variation are required. Because ecosystems are closely interconnected, an integrated monitoring, diagnosis, and stressors-based management of the whole water, sediment, groundwater, soil, and air system is required considering land use and the interaction with a changing climate. Extending this holistic approach beyond a consideration of existing pressures by anticipating on future ones to use and protect the aquatic environment in a sustainable way is one of the big challenges.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{large-scale}} pressure-impact relationships involves questions of hierarchy and scales. Answers {{to these questions}} will help managers define priorities for action to achieve the good ecological status' required by the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The main objectives of our study were 1) to establish the relative impact of pressures that degrade ecological status, especially those caused by agriculture and urbanization, 2) to identify regional patterns in these pressure-impact relationships and 3) to evaluate the relative weight of the pressures acting at the basin and riparian corridor scales, and the possible buffering effect of riparian areas. We developed large-scale models linking invertebrate indices of ecological quality to river basin and riparian land cover in France, Slovakia, Estonia and UK. Invertebrate indices, transformed to <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratios</b> (EQR), were taken from national monitoring networks. We based the models on Partial Least Squares (PLS) regressions at national and a hydro-ecoregion (HER) scales. The HERs provided a framework for grouping data in terms of natural river features and human activities. The different national methods provided consistent results that indicated the hierarchy of pressures impacting river invertebrates at the European scale. The most salient result was that artificial land cover (e. g. urban and industrial sites) in the river basin represented the pressure with the most negative impact on invertebrate indices, in all countries and regions. The impact of agricultural land cover was more variable. Arable land had a smaller impact than urban areas, and it was even insignificant in some models. The impact of vineyards depended on the natural geographical context. The effect of pastures seemed {{to be related to}} the intensity of the livestock they carried. These results supported the concept of regional pathologies for river ecosystems, as land use and anthropogenic influences are closely linked to physical landscape features. The proportion of arable land in the river basin appeared to be a weak predictor of agricultural impacts by itself; the type of cultivation and intensity as well as the proximity to the river must be taken into account. At the riparian corridor scale, the negative impact of artificial areas or arable land and the positive effects of forests and pastures were demonstrated in many regions. The protective effect of riparian forests against mixed agricultural and urban pressures was demonstrated in three regions in France. Riparian corridors appear to be manageable areas, and these results strongly support the idea of including their restoration in priority actions for achieving good ecological status...|$|E
40|$|The first Czech {{methodology}} {{for the assessment}} of ecological potential of heavily modified water bodies and artificial water bodies based on fish communities was developed. The first step of developing the methodology was preparing the typology of water bodies. The typology distinguishes between water bodies of different altitudes and with and without thermal stratification. Fish were sampled by multimesh gillnets following European standard procedures. The selection of fish metrics was based on statistical analyses in which metrics (fish community indicators) were correlated with the most common stressor – eutrophication. The analysis detected several sensitive metrics (metrics showing the best correlation with the stressor) in which ecological class boundaries were set. Afterwards, combination of sensitive metrics was used for calculation of the <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratio</b> (EQR) for each of the reservoir sampled. The EQR expresses the deviation between a reservoir’s current ecological status and its maximum potential. The next step consisted of validating the EQR with an independent pressure index and verifying the time stability of ecological potential assessment. The metrics used in the methodology fulfill all the obligations set forth in the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC), which include assessment of the composition, abundance and age structure of fish fauna...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} that member states assess all their surface waters {{based on a}} number of biological elements, including macroinvertebrates. Since 1989, the Flemish Environment Agency has been using the Belgian Biotic Index for assessing river water quality based on macroinvertebrates. Throughout the years, the Belgian Biotic Index {{has proven to be a}} reliable and robust method providing a good indication of general degradation of river water and habitat quality. Since the Belgian Biotic Index does not meet all the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, a new index, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for evaluating rivers and lakes was developed and tested. This index was developed in order to provide a general assessment of ecological deterioration caused by any kind of stressor, such as water pollution and habitat quality degradation. The MMIF is based on macroinvertebrate samples that are taken using the same sampling and identification procedure as the Belgian Biotic Index. The index calculation is a type-specific multimetric system based on five equally weighted metrics, which are taxa richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, number of other sensitive taxa, the Shannon–Wiener diversity index and the mean tolerance score. The final index value is expressed as an <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratio</b> ranging from zero for very bad <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> to one for very good <b>ecological</b> <b>quality.</b> The MMIF correlates positively with dissolved oxygen and negatively with Kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, total phosphorous, orthophosphate and biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. This new index is now being used by the Flemish Environment Agency as a standard method to report about the status of macroinvertebrates in rivers and lakes in Flanders within the context of the European Water Framework Directive...|$|R
40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{transitional}} waters should be differentiated according to type and, in some cases, divided into different water bodies. This raises a dilemma {{in trying to}} define parts of a continuum. In the sequence of WFD several indices have been proposed including the Estuarine Fish Assessment Index, which can be applied taking an estuary as a whole (EFAI - without water bodies division) or divided in water bodies (EFAI(WB)). The purpose of this work is to analyze the robustness of the Estuarine Fish Assessment Index, based on three different ways of dividing Portuguese estuaries into water bodies according to different criteria (criterion 1 - distance to the estuary mouth, criterion 2 - salinity and criterion 3 - morphology, salinity and human dimension as pressure and state). In this study we evaluated at which degree these three criteria could influence the <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratio</b> (EQR) results, when the index was applied to water body level (EFAI(WB)). Also, for each estuary, the EQR(WB) results for each criterion of EFAI(WB) were combined and weighted according to the water bodies areas (EFAI overall weighted - EFAI(Ow)). Finally, it was compared if the results obtained for each criterion with the EFAI(OW) were similar {{to the results of}} the index application taking the estuary as a whole (EFAI without water bodies division). No significant differences were found in both cases, which indicated that this index is a robust method regarding the division of the estuaries in different water bodies, which is an important element of a fish-based multimetric tool for assessing estuarine <b>ecological</b> <b>quality.</b> However, in some cases, different <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> statuses were achieved when applying the EFAI(Ow) or the EFAI. This work addressed several aspects regarding the possible division of water bodies at the WFD context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|EDITOR'S NOTE: This is 1 of 12 papers {{prepared}} by participants attending the workshop ¿Risk Assessment in European River Basins¿State of the Art and Future Challenges¿ held in Liepzig, Germany on 12 ¿ 14 November 2007. The meeting was organized {{within the framework}} of the European Commission's Coordination Action RISKBASE program. The objective of RISKBASE is to review and synthesize the outcome of European Commission FP 4 ¿FP 6 projects, and other major initiatives, related to integrated risk assessment¿based management of the water/sediment/soil environment at the river basin scale. The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires a good chemical and ecological status of European surface waters by 2015. Integrated, risk-based management of river basins is presumed to be an appropriate approach to achieve that goal. The approach of focusing on distinct hazardous substances in surface waters together with investment in best available technology for treatment of industrial and domestic effluents was successful in significantly reducing excessive contamination of several European river basins. The use of the concept of chemical status in the WFD is based on this experience and focuses on chemicals for which there is a general agreement that they should be phased out. However, the chemical status, based primarily on a list of 33 priority substances and 8 priority hazardous substances, considers only a small portion of possible toxicants and does not address all causes of ecotoxicological stress in general. Recommendations for further development of this concept are 1) to focus on river basin¿specific toxicants, 2) to regularly update priority lists with a focus on emerging toxicants, 3) to consider state-of-the-art mixture toxicity concepts and bioavailability to link chemical and ecological status, and 4) to add a short list of priority effects and to develop environmental quality standards for these effects. The ecological status reflected by <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratios</b> is a leading principle of the WFD. While on the European scale the improvement of hydromorphological conditions and control of eutrophication are crucial to achieve a good ecological status, on a local and regional scale managers have to deal with multiple pressures. On this scale, toxic pollution may play an important role. Strategic research is necessary 1) to identify dominant pressures, 2) to predict multistressor effects, 3) to develop stressor- and type-specific metrics of pressures, and 4) to better understand the ecology of recovery. The concept of reference conditions to define the ecological status is hard to apply and tends to ignore the fact that ecosystems can be highly dynamic.

40|$|Benthic {{habitats}} and the macrobenthic communities they support form an integral component of ecological quality assessments in marine and estuarine waters. Good conceptual understanding {{of change in}} benthic community structure in relation to environmental disturbances has underpinned {{the development of a}} wide range of techniques to detect, describe and interpret change in habitat quality. Many of these techniques have been proposed as monitoring tools under European environmental Directives (e. g. Habitats Directive, HD; Water Framework Directive, WFD; Marine Strategy Framework Directive, MSFD). The primary aim of this thesis was to build on current scientific understanding of the performance and sensitivity of a range of techniques currently used to meet the provisions of environmental legislation. This body of work is comprised of 4 separate, yet related, studies. The HD and WFD both share the common overall goal of conserving biodiversity and good habitat quality, and focus on aspects of coastal and transitional water systems. This thesis proposes a pragmatic approach for the integration of habitat classification (sensu the HD) and Ecological Status (ES) assessments (sensu the WFD) in sedimentary habitats. Integration of the HD and WFD has the potential to strengthen both Directives by mutual enlightenment between assessment outputs. The proposed approach also has potential to provide a framework for applying Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) designs for assessing change at a regional level for the WFD and HD. Natural spatial and temporal variability in monitoring data has been shown to have a confounding effect on reliability of ES assessments using WFD <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratios</b> (EQRs). BACI designs have the potential to improve current environmental assessments by objectively accounting for the effects of natural variability thus allowing the effects of impacts to be discriminated more accurately and reliably. Similarly, increasing the reliability and robustness of habitats classifications and maps revealing their spatial distribution have potential to improve the effectiveness of environmental management, particularly the HD which in part focuses on the management of conservation sites. This thesis determined the performance of different sediment particle size analysis techniques in terms of the ability of their resulting sediment distributions to explain variance and patterns in faunal datasets. Using sediment distribution data that best explains the underlying pattern within faunal datasets will allow communities and biotopes to be resolved with greater confidence. These elements have the potential to improve the effectiveness of environmental management. This thesis also highlighted the implications of changing sampling strategies on the allocation of ES (sensu the WFD). Adopting single sample survey designs caused ES to be classified as lower when compared to a multiple sample survey design. Consequently, the effects of sampling design must be taken seriously when assessing ES, particularly if assessments form the basis of scientific advice used to inform management decisions. Similarly, the reliability of EQRs must be determined before the indices are used to assess ES to geographical locations and conditions for which the techniques were not originally designed. This thesis proposes a novel approach of using abundances of taxa higher than species with EQRs as an effective way of facilitating the transfer of WFD-type management to a new geographic region at Hong Kong, China. A number of member states, including Ireland, have expressed interest in adopting OSPAR 2 ̆ 7 s Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) framework to help meet their obligations under the MSFD, however, there are concerns as to the performance of EcoQOs in a real world situation. This thesis used time-series data to validate the application of OSPAR 2 ̆ 7 s EcoQO for tributyltin contamination in Irish waters. It is suggested that the quantified temporal responses of the EcoQO provided by the time-series data could be potentially be used to objectively track change in environmental quality over time...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a multi-metric assessment {{system based on}} benthic macroinvertebrates to assess the hydromorphological status of sand-bottom lowland rivers in Central Europe. The criteria defined by the WFD for future biological monitoring set the conceptual framework for the assessment, i. e. stream type- and stressor-specificity, and assessment by comparison with biological reference conditions. The first study examines the role of stream type descriptors {{as defined by the}} WFD and its relevance for benthic macroinvertebrates. In particular, the abiotic ‘top-down’ typology of Germany is compared to a ‘bottom-up’ analysis by the in-stream community. In this context the role of spatial scales is highlighted, too, since the variables act at different scales from the ecoregion- to the site-scale and, furthermore, are reported to underlie a hierarchical structure. The analysis identifies ecoregion to predominantly control benthic macroinvertebrates and clearly separates the Alps, Central Mountains, and Central Lowlands of Germany. Further detailed analysis on the lowland data reveals the stream size to discriminate between small streams and medium-sized rivers at about 50 km² of catchment size. Opposed to findings of others, seasonal aspects in the community are barely reflected in this study. The second study focuses on the identification and measure of hydromorphological degradation affecting different stream types at different spatial scales. The analysis of 106 hydromorphological variables reveals catchment-related variables (land use, geology) to explain the predominant hydromorphological structure of a Central European dataset. If restricted to three German stream types and, thus, to a smaller geographical extent, the increasing role of reach- and site-related properties is obvious. Besides the agricultural and urban land use in the catchment degradation is characterized by bed and bank modification (e. g., rip-rap) and the loss of riparian wooded vegetation at the reach-scale, and by the loss of organic substrates, such as wood at the site-scale. A total of eight different hydromorphological aspects are combined to the German Structure Index (GSI) capable of measuring hydromorphological degradation by inclusion of different spatial scales: catchment: land use; reach: large wood, shading, riparian vegetation, flow modification, scouring, bank modification; site: organic substrates. The relation of hydromorphological variables and the benthic invertebrate community is subject of the third study of this thesis. A hydromorphological dataset, a taxa list, and a metric data set derived from the taxa list are analysed together using direct gradient analysis. In general, the comparison of metrics and taxa identifies metrics to be more indicative than taxa and, thus, to be better suited for river assessment. This is underlined by far shorter gradient lengths of metric datasets, which enable the use of linear models Functional community aspects (e. g., current preferences, feeding types) show a strong relation to reach-scaled hydromorphological variables, such as the proportion of bank fixation and riparian wooded vegetation, the amount of large wood on the river bottom, and flow modification. The important role of the reach-scale is also supported by the taxa results. Moreover, the taxa analysis reveals two major insect families; Trichoptera and Diptera to not only dominate the taxa list used for the analysis but also to dominate the list of indicative taxa. About 40 – 50 % of the relations are observed for both families. Compared to the number of taxa used for the analysis trichopterans are particularly related to site-scale hydromorphological features, such as organic substrates. As dipterans are shown to dominate the in-stream benthic community in this thesis, a certain dipteran family is focussed on in the fourth study. The aim is to identify the suitability of simuliid taxa (blackflies) {{to assess the impact of}} hydromorphological degradation. Prosimulium spp. is restricted to mountain streams, whereas Simulium vernum shows a clear preference for lowland rivers. Solely S. lineatum shows a significant preference for ‘unstressed’ lowland streams and rivers, however, the number of species is significantly higher at ‘unstressed’ sites with respect to the whole dataset. Linear regression revealed the occurrence of Prosimulium spp. To be mainly related to catchment land use, the number of organic substrates, and the amount large wood, whereas Simulium spp. shows a strong relation to the mean current velocity, the proportion of macrophytes at a site, and the degree of shading. The last study presents the multi-metric assessment system for sand-bottom lowland rivers in ecoregion 14, as was delineated before. The multivariate analysis is focussed on the impact of reach-scale degradation on the community, but also aims at detecting the impact of all three spatial scales. A total of five metrics is selected fulfilling the criteria except for ‘composition/abundance’ metrics, which show comparatively weak relations to the hydromorphological degradation. The metrics are combined to a multi-metric index (MMI) by using <b>ecological</b> <b>quality</b> <b>ratios</b> (EQR) as described by the WFD instead as scoring systems. The MMI is highly correlated with the hydromorphological degradation at each spatial scale (about 90 % of variance explained) and hydromorphological stress is also correctly detected for 85 % of the total samples if compared with expert judgement...|$|E
40|$|Marine macrobenthic {{dynamics}} {{have been}} intensively studied {{in response to}} environmental disturbances, {{and a large number}} of techniques, including a variety of indices, have been proposed and developed for assessment. Structural and functional variability have been summarized through both univariate and multimetric indices as integrative indicators in environmental monitoring programs. In general, multimetric indices are considered to be sensitive, stable, and robust, thus offer a promising approach for ecological assessment. This study is aimed to assess the degree of sensitivity for several indices in terms of their ability to determine environmental changes. Based on macrofaunal data, several univariate and multimetric indices were used to assess and compare the level of disturbance at fallowed farm and reference (control) sites. The two multimetric indices, the AZTI’s Marine Biotic Indices (AMBI) and <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratio</b> (EQR), were used as integrative indicators to assess the categorisation of each sampled site. The results showed that a combination of multimetric index and univariate indices provide a better assessment. The categories determined by multimetric indices seem to be in accordance with level of disturbance expressed by the trophic analysis, multivariate and graphical analyses used in this study. The AMBI has the ability to detect large scale differences among sites. However, AMBI was unable to discriminate slight changes in the macrobenthic assemblages between sites, as have been exposed by EQR...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBetween 1995 and 2001, the soft-bottom {{communities}} {{along the}} 1180 km of the Algerian coast were sampled in nine gulfs and 12 harbours, providing {{a total of}} 655 samples. Eight crozoobenthos-based biotic indices (S, N, H 0, BQI, AMBI, BENTIX, BO 2 A and ITI) were selected to describe the general patterns of the coastal water quality status and to establish a quality diagnosis for the different zones subjected to anthropogenic pressure (e. g., harbour construction, industrial and urban pollution). Reference values were determined {{for each of the}} eight indices selected by analyzing the indices' parameter distribution. The <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratio</b> (EQR) was estimated for each index, resulting in an EQR Mean Score and an EQR Bad Score. From these EQR, we deﬁned an EQS for each sample. The agreement between these EQS was analysed using the Kappa method in order to propose a survey strategy for the Algerian coastal waters that would take into account the soft-bottom biological compartment. The results clearly indicate that high and good quality assessments are prevalent in the gulfs, while quality assessments in harbours vary greatly from bad to good. The effect of pollution observed in the harbours can be classiﬁed in two main groups, according to when they were constructed and their relative degree of openness to the sea, which permits better water circulation and probably dilutes the pollution...|$|R
40|$|Enrichment of {{nutrients}} and metals in seawater associated with anthropogenic activities can threaten aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, nutrient and metal concentrations are parameters {{used to define}} water quality. The European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) goes further than a contaminant-based approach and utilises indices to assess the Ecological Status (ES) of transitional water bodies (e. g. estuaries and lagoons). One assessment {{is based upon the}} abundance of opportunistic Ulva species, as an indication of eutrophication. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterise Ireland's Ulva blooms through the use of WFD assessment, metal concentrations and taxonomic identity. Furthermore, the study assessed whether the ecological assessment is related to the metal composition in the Ulva. WFD algal bloom assessment revealed that the largest surveyed blooms had an estimated biomass of 2164 metric tonnes (w/w). DNA sequences identified biomass from all locations as Ulva rigida, with the exception of New Quay, which was Ulva rotundata. Some blooms contained significant amounts of As, Cu, Cr, Pb and Sn. The results showed that all metal concentrations had a negative relationship (except Se) with the <b>Ecological</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Ratio</b> (EQR). However, only in the case of Mn were these differences significant (p = 0. 038). Overall, the metal composition and concentrations found in Ulva were site dependent, and not clearly related to the ES. Nevertheless, sites with a moderate or poor ES had a higher variability in the metals levels than in estuaries with a high ES...|$|R
