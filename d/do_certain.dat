5|$|On January 29, 2010, the Pokémon Company {{announced}} that a new game was in development for the Nintendo DS to be released later that year. Director Junichi Masuda stated that several aspects of the series were being revamped for the new generation. On April 9, 2010, the Japanese website updated with the titles of the versions as Pokémon Black and White, and announced a Q3 2010 release date. The games feature an improved visual style from other Pokémon games, with an increased use of 3D computer graphics than any other of the handheld series. It also has a special feature that allows the user to upload their saved game to the Internet, allowing them to <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things on an official website.|$|E

In the United States it affects about 10-30% of people. Contact dermatitis is twice as common in females than males. Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 7% of people at some point in time. Irritant contact dermatitis is common, especially among people who <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> jobs; exact rates are unclear.|$|E

25|$|Customary laws favoured men {{more than}} women. For example, {{inheritance}} among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was {{passed on to}} the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over lives, property and bodies of their wives. However, there were some improvements for women as opposed to ancient custom for example they could inherit in the absence of their brothers, <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> trades without their husbands and widows to receive dower.|$|E
25|$|In {{a fourth}} case, the {{consequences}} of incapacity are more drastic. Although the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 {{made it possible for}} the government or emanations of the state to be sued on contracts {{in the same way as}} a normal individual, where statute confers power on a public body to <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> acts, actions by representatives beyond that power will be ultra vires and void. The result is the same as it was for companies before reform in 1989, so that whole chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} of the city (controlled by the game player) earn the money by driving around a vehicle for a given amount of time, picking up passengers and taking them to their destinations. The player receives money upon successfully dropping off each passenger, and bonuses are obtained when they are transported in {{a short amount of}} time. Players have to avoid certain hurdles, such as other vehicles and Burns' nuclear transit buses. The game contains seventeen different collectible vehicles, six starting locations, and ten different missions. In order to collect the vehicles and unlock starting locations, players must earn progressively more money for each vehicle or starting location they want to get. In order to complete missions, players must <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things (such as protecting Krusty the Clown from a fan mob by driving him away, and getting Homer to his workplace unnoticed).|$|E

25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults how to <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things that later {{will help the}} tribe. For example, girls {{learn how to make}} doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to do while hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. They watch the women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with Pablo S. Torre in ESPN The Magazine, Lin expressed belief that perceptions of Asians had affected {{his reputation as}} a player who was turnover-prone or unable to use both hands, despite statistics that suggested he had improved in both areas. He also cited the notion that he was a poor defender due to the belief that he lacked speed, while D'Antoni stated that Lin [...] "was one of the quickest athletes we've ever worked out". Lin also opined that, being an Asian basketball player, his performance with the Knicks may have gained excessive publicity. [...] "People just aren't used to seeing Asians <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things, so it creates a very polarizing effect," [...] Lin stated.|$|E

500|$|In September 1990 Jaleco {{released}} an American version of Maniac Mansion {{as the first}} NES title developed by Lucasfilm Games in cooperation with Realtime Associates. Generally, this port is regarded as being far closer to the original game than the Japanese effort. Company management was occupied with other projects, and so the port received little attention until employee Douglas Crockford volunteered to direct it. The team used {{a modified version of}} the SCUMM engine called [...] "NES SCUMM" [...] for the port. According to Crockford, [...] " [...] of the main differences between the NES and PCs is that the NES can <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things much faster". The graphics had to be entirely redrawn to match the NES's display resolution. Tim Schafer, who later designed Maniac Mansions sequel Day of the Tentacle, received his first professional credit as a playtester for the NES version of Maniac Mansion.|$|E
500|$|Islam is {{the common}} {{heritage}} in the region with a 97.22% Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet. Islamic influences {{are evident in the}} fundamental values of various inhabitants including cultural traditions, marriage, education, diet, ceremonies and policies with may reflect stark differences in rural villages as compared to urban areas. People live in tight-knit joint families, although a nuclear family system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions. Ancient Pakistani culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> restrictions related to ethnicity and caste. [...] However, the influences of more modern societies have effected some change, particularly {{in the area of the}} dowry system. As of 2016, monogamous and polygamous unions remain an acceptable marriage practice. In following ancient culture, marriages are customarily arranged by the parents or matchmakers. In some instances, the husband must buy his wife from her parents. Marriage ceremonies, which can be more or less formal, include rituals which are universal in nature and hold sociological importance. Studies conducted in 2007 and 2013, the latter in an outlying rural village in Faisalabad District, acknowledged the existence of gender bias and discrimination against females, stating that [...] "Gender discrimination is not a new phenomenon", and that it still exists in the modern world. It was further noted that situations may be worse in villages because [...] "whenever a girl is born, nobody celebrates her birth, whereas when a boy is born, it means great joy and celebration." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, [...] "The law threatens certain pains if you <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things, {{intending}} thereby to {{give you}} a new motive for not doing them.

[...] Due process procedural safeguards should apply equally to both of these punishments.|$|E

2500|$|HCN is {{obtainable}} from fruits {{that have}} a pit, such as cherries, apricots, apples, and bitter almonds, from which almond oil and flavoring are made. Many of these pits contain small amounts of cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile and amygdalin, which slowly release hydrogen cyanide. One hundred grams of crushed apple seeds can yield about 70mg of HCN. Some millipedes release hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism, as <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> insects, such as some burnet moths. Hydrogen cyanide is contained in the exhaust of vehicles, and in smoke from burning nitrogen-containing plastics. So-called [...] "bitter" [...] roots of the cassava plant may contain up to 1gram of HCN per kilogram.|$|E
2500|$|In the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood {{argued that}} Anti was the singer's most {{experimental}} album yet and [...] "remarkably tender at points", highlighting [...] "Kiss It Better" [...] and the [...] "radical vulnerability" [...] of the ballads near the end. Writing for The Independent, Emily Jupp found the record abundant with Rihanna's self-confidence and underrated singing, disapproving [...] "anyone who ever said her voice could only <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> things and showing them {{she can do}} anything she wants to." [...] Jia Tolentino of Spin viewed it as her first [...] "aesthetically personal album" [...] while praising Harrell's vocal production and the singing as [...] "extraordinary", highlighting the tone and roundness of Rihanna's vocals. Robert Christgau reviewed the deluxe edition in his blog for Vice, praising [...] "Work", [...] "Love on the Brain", and the bonus tracks and called Anti [...] "her best album for a reason so simple it's tautological—despite its supposed rejection of track-and-hook mechanics, it features catchier songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (2) Another {{pastoral}} {{problem is}} the tendency of some local American media to focus attention each year on the [...] (N.S.) / [...] (O.S.) celebration of Christmas, even in localities where most Orthodox parishes follow the new calendar. So too, in all likelihood, <b>do</b> <b>certain</b> non-Orthodox churches profit from the Orthodox remaining Old Style, since the [...] observance of Christmas among the Orthodox tends {{to focus attention on}} ethnic identifications of the feast, rather than on its Christian, dogmatic significance; which, in turn, tends to foster the impression in the public mind that for the Orthodox, the feast of Christ's Nativity is centered on the observance of the Julian date of that feast, rather than on the commemoration of Christ's birth. Such a focus appears to the defenders of the Revised Julian calendar and to many non-Orthodox as well, as a practice that is charming and quaint, but also anachronistic, unscientific and hence ultimately unreasonable and even cultish.|$|E
