50|$|Most of {{the film}} consist of flashbacks, {{depicting}} the events leading to the current situation. Some of these include Joshua being beaten by the school gang and his own father, being hanged by his collar from the school gate, and having his <b>face</b> <b>shoved</b> down the toilet.|$|R
50|$|Last is {{the cutting}} of cake. The cake {{is usually a}} {{traditional}} Mexican cake of tres leches, or three milks. It has several layers, with the figures of {{the bride and groom}} on top of the cake. The cake is large enough to serve over 100 people, as many guests come to Oaxacan weddings. The bride and groom cut the cake together and the couple can choose to have their <b>faces</b> <b>shoved</b> into the cake before it’s served, or not. After this the couple take pictures with their godparents, parents, family members, and friends.|$|R

50|$|Captain Judas: A debonair {{criminal}} who {{clashes with}} the heroes several times. A former partner of Burma's, he sustains severe facial burns when she throws a lamp in his <b>face.</b> He <b>shoved</b> Raven {{out of a}} truck, leading to her fatal injuries before being shot by Dude Hennick and presumably killed.|$|R
60|$|And {{then and}} there he boxed the sneak's ears and then threw him down in the snow, washing his <b>face</b> and <b>shoving</b> {{a lot of the}} snow down inside the lad's shirt. Mumps yelled like a wild Indian, but Pepper did not let up until he felt that he had given the sneak all he deserved.|$|R
60|$|If a {{dread of}} not being {{understood}} be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like {{the extent to which}} it used to be hidden in mine,--which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could, and had my <b>face</b> <b>shoved</b> against the kitchen wall.|$|R
60|$|When I reached home, {{my sister}} was very curious to know all about Miss Havisham's, and asked a number of {{questions}}. And I soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the {{nape of the neck}} and the small of the back, and having my <b>face</b> ignominiously <b>shoved</b> against the kitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} {{too heavy to}} suggest more than {{a hint of the}} sleepy {{surprise}} that perplexed her as she looked up at me, and she half stumbled, half tottered, as I led her to her cabin. Mugridge grinned insinuatingly in my <b>face</b> as I <b>shoved</b> him out and ordered him back to his galley work; and he won his revenge by spreading glowing reports among the hunters as to what an excellent “lydy’s-myde” I was proving myself to be.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1994, while {{a member}} of the Knicks, Anderson and Harold Ellis of the Los Angeles Clippers got {{involved}} in a seemingly bizarre shoving match at Madison Square Garden. As the two players ran downcourt, Ellis threw a forearm for no apparent reason into Anderson's <b>face.</b> They exchanged <b>shoves,</b> and were both given technical fouls. Anderson later said of Ellis: [...] "He was going crazy," [...] and [...] "I've never been involved in anything like that. I just got in the game. I'm a good guy. I have no idea why it happened." ...|$|R
50|$|Jessica is then {{paired with}} Spider-Man to do {{reconnaissance}} on Avengers Tower, where she reveals to him {{she is an}} agent of S.W.O.R.D. The duo are then found by Mandrill and Griffin who proceed to attack them. During the fight Mandrill gets close enough to Jessica and controls her into attacking Spider-Man. Spider-Man {{appears to be on}} the losing end of the fight but manages to lure Jessica away from Mandrill and the effects of his control begin to wear off.

Upon arriving in Asgard, Jessica {{and the rest of the}} heroes engage Iron Patriot's forces and witnesses the insane Sentry's defeat.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. The old chief pondered {{with the}} massive certitude of God, and Chugungatte seemed to wrap himself in the mists of a great antiquity. Keen looked with yearning upon the woman, and she, unnoting, held her eyes steadfastly upon her father's <b>face.</b> The wolf-dog <b>shoved</b> the flap aside again, and {{plucking}} courage at the quiet, wormed forward on his belly. He sniffed curiously at Thom's listless hand, cocked ears challengingly at Chugungatte, and hunched down upon his haunches before Tantlatch. The spear rattled to the ground, and the dog, with a frightened yell, sprang sideways, snapping in mid-air, and on the second leap cleared the entrance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, Nash becomes {{involved}} with mysterious investors willing {{to help him with}} his vineyard and make the Brennan Winery a major success, supplying Nash with large sums of cash to overhaul the business.

Enraged, Nash confronts Jared, blaming him and Jessica's sister Natalie for their deception and the loss of his vineyard. When Nash gets in Natalie's <b>face,</b> Jared <b>shoves</b> him away, and Nash accidentally trips over a railing, falling through a skylight to the floor of the Palace Hotel far below.|$|R
5000|$|Dima Wawi (November 20, 2003) was the {{youngest}} Palestinian prisoner in Israeli jails. She was released in April 24, 2016 after 75 days on charges of allegedly trying to stab an IDF soldier. She was arrested while {{on her way to}} school. While in incarnation Dima told her mother [...] "My shoes are muddy, Mama. I feel embarrassed and ashamed, I bled from the torture, I feel humiliated, I’m terrified and my body trembles from the cold, I was forced to invent stories and lie that I was there to stab a settler. Mama, don’t be angry, don’t believe anything they tell you, but this {{was the only way to}} stay alive.” Her mother released a statement that said [...] "Although I selfishly prayed that it was someone else’s daughter, that another mother would claim the little girl in the photo, it was unmistakable. Dima lay blindfold with her <b>face</b> violently <b>shoved</b> against the pavement. A settler’s foot was rammed against her back and a gun was pointed at her head. The photos and videos were taken near the illegal settlement of Karmi Tsur ... I held my tears, for I would not give the occupier the pleasure of victory over a child who was barely 12 years old.There are still 440 Palestinian children in Israeli prisons, including 104 between the ages of 12 and 15. Israel is the only state worldwide that prosecutes 700 children a year.|$|R
50|$|On April 30, , Pallone was {{involved}} in a highly controversial confrontation with Rose when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. Pallone was umpiring at first base when he called New York Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson safe on a delayed call in the ninth inning, with the delay giving Howard Johnson the time to score the eventual game-winning run. Rose immediately rushed to Pallone to argue both the call and how slowly it was made. With both tempers boiling over, Pallone was mocking Rose's gestures by pointing his finger at Rose, which led Rose to accuse Pallone of poking him in the <b>face.</b> Rose then <b>shoved</b> Pallone, causing Rose's immediate ejection. Pallone denied touching Rose and Major League Baseball never determined that he did in fact touch Rose, nor did they determine that he did not. The incident led to fans throwing garbage on the field, temporarily stopping the game and causing Pallone to be taken out of the game to ease tensions. The incident also resulted in Rose being suspended for 30 days with a $10,000 fine as well.|$|R

In 1987, the BBC Panorama program Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom? featured an interview with former member Don Larson, who described Miscavige's physical violence towards a staff member. In a 1995 interview for ITV, Stacy Young, Miscavige's former secretary and the ex-wife of Hubbard's former public relations spokesman, Robert Vaughn Young, had previously asserted that Miscavige emotionally tormented staff members on a regular basis. [...] "His viciousness and his cruelty to staff was unlike anything that I had ever experienced in my life," [...] she said. [...] "He just loved to degrade the staff." [...] In an incident also witnessed and supported by Amy Scobee, Jeff Hawkins, a former marketing guru for Scientology, claimed to have attended a meeting where Miscavige [...] "jumped up on the conference room table, like with his feet right on the conference room table, launched himself across the table at me—I was standing—battered my <b>face,</b> and then <b>shoved</b> me down on the floor". Church executive David Bloomberg confirmed that there was a physical confrontation during the meeting but stated that it was Hawkins who became belligerent and attacked Miscavige. In the confrontation Hawkins fell out of his chair and ended up putting a scissor lock on Miscavige's legs. Bloomberg stated [...] "Mr. Miscavige did not touch Jeff Hawkins." ...|$|R
