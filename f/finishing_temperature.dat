50|$|Hot rolling is a {{metalworking}} {{process that}} occurs above the recrystallization {{temperature of the}} material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as slabs, blooms, and billets. If these products came from a continuous casting operation the products are usually fed directly into the rolling mills at the proper temperature. In smaller operations the material starts at room temperature and must be heated. This is done in a gas- or oil-fired soaking pit for larger workpieces and for smaller workpieces induction heating is used. As the material is worked the temperature must be monitored {{to make sure it}} remains above the recrystallization temperature. To maintain a safety factor a <b>finishing</b> <b>temperature</b> is defined above the recrystallization temperature; this is usually 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) above the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature does drop below this temperature the material must be re-heated before more hot rolling.|$|E

The new steel aims {{to meet the}} demand of high strength, high toughness and resistance to chloride ion corrosion for the components used in the environment of sea water and oceanic atmosphere. Mechanical properties of the steel were tested and strengthening and toughening mechanisms were analyzed by comparing hot-rolled microstructures of the low carbon bainitic steels with and without Cu–P alloying.

The toughness loss caused by Cu–P alloying could be balanced by increasing the amount of martensite/remained austenite (M/A island) at lower <b>finishing</b> <b>temperature.</b> The static recovery process during rolling interval was delayed by the interaction of phosphorous, copper atoms with dislocations, which was favorable to the formation of bainitic plates.

40|$|Abstract. Rougher bar {{samples of}} 2. 0 %Si and 0. 25 %Al Non Oriented Grain with 25 mm {{thickness}} were rolled to 2. 3 mm {{in a pilot}} reversible mill with temperatures ranging from 920 to 1120 °C and processed until the final annealing to study the evolution of grain size and crystallographic orientation. The results showed that higher hot rolling <b>finishing</b> <b>temperature</b> results in larger hot band grain size, but the texture, composed mainly by alpha, gamma, { 100 }, and eta fibers suffers little effect. As a consequence, after final annealing, an increase of fraction of the grains with eta fiber orientation and a reduction of grains with gamma fiber orientation are observed, improving the magnetic induction. The final grain size decreases with hot rolling finishing temperatures above 1040 °C in spite of increasing hot band grain size, deteriorating the core loss results. This was explained by the increasing of shear bands when the grain size prior to cold rolling increases. More shear bands generates more sites for nucleation on recrystallization, then smaller final grain size results. The Goss orientation is generated mainly in the sites inside shear bands. The increasing of prior grain size also increases the fraction of grains with Goss orientation after final annealing and its fraction increases suddenly when the hot rolling <b>finishing</b> <b>temperature</b> achieves 1040 °C, supporting that affirmation...|$|E

This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} austenite potential and hot roll <b>finish</b> <b>temperature</b> {{on the evolution of}} microstructure in the ferritic stainless steel grade AISI 430. In particular, it focuses on the influence of these variables on the hot band annealing behaviour of this steel. The material employed was obtained from laboratory and commercial heats. Two hot roll <b>finish</b> <b>temperatures,</b> viz. 600 °C and 800 °C for the commercial heats and two alloy compositions of austenite potential 11 and 61 % for the laboratory heats were studied. Electron channelling contrast (ECC) obtained in scanning electron microscopy was used to follow the evolution of microstructure. Limited micro texture measurements were made using electron backscattered techniques. It was found that a low <b>finish</b> <b>temperature</b> produced a hot rolled microstructure that showed limited softening and a fully recrystallised microstructure after annealing while a high hot roll <b>finish</b> <b>temperature</b> produced a completely softened as-hot-rolled microstructure and only partial recrystallisation after annealing. A high austenite potential encouraged the ferrite phase to undergo extensive continuous recrystallisation during hot band annealing. However, the affinity for the precipitation of carbo-nitrides tended {{to play a role in}} slowing down the process. On the other hand, the ferrite phase deformed in the presence of a low austenite content mostly underwent extended recovery during hot band annealing. The softening here was affected by a low driving force. The end microstructures after annealing were however similar in both cases in as much as they consisted of elongated structures. The martensite phase was found to behave similarly regardless of the austenite content, where both recovery to produce subgrains and occasional recrystallisation occurred. During final recrystallisation after cold rolling, the high austenite potential coupled with a short hot band anneal time resulted in incomplete recrystallisation. This caused sharper alpha fibre texture components in the final sheet. A long hot band anneal time however resulted in sharper gamma-fibre texture components. In the case of low austenite potential, a long hot band anneal produced a random texture in the final texture. Ridging was observed in all cases but a high austenite content was found to lessen its severity. Also, it (ridging) was reduced by the random texture produced by long hot band annealing in the case where the austenite potential was low...|$|R
