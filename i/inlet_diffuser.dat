50|$|The key {{design feature}} for the Scimitar engines is the precooler, {{which is a}} heat {{exchanger}} that transfers {{the heat from the}} incoming air into the hydrogen fuel. This greatly cools the air, which allows the engines to burn more fuel even at very high speed, and allows the engines to be made of lighter, but more heat susceptible, materials such as light alloys. The engine <b>inlet</b> <b>diffuser</b> also has to slow the incoming air to subsonic speeds because if the air moved through the precooler and compressor at supersonic speeds, it would cause damage to them.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of devices. The most common are the types {{specified}} by ASME (American Society Of Mechanical Engineers), utilizing baffles, or a proprietary <b>inlet</b> <b>diffuser.</b> [...] Grease trap sizing {{is based on}} the size of the 2- or 3-compartment sink, dishwasher, pot sinks, and mop sinks. The cumulative flow rates of these devices, as well as overall grease retention capacity (in pounds or kilograms) are considered. Currently, ASME Standard (ASME A112.14.3) is being adopted by both of the National Model Plumbing Codes that cover most of the US. This standard requires that grease interceptors remove a minimum of 90% of incoming FOGS (fats, oils and greases). It also requires that grease interceptors are third-party tested and certified to 90 days compliance with the standard pumping. This third-party testing must be conducted by a recognized and approved third-party testing laboratory.|$|E
50|$|Ramjets utilize {{high-speed}} {{characteristics of}} air to literally 'ram' air through an <b>inlet</b> <b>diffuser</b> into the combustor. At transonic and supersonic flight speeds, the air upstream of the inlet {{is not able}} {{to move out of the}} way quickly enough, and is compressed within the diffuser before being diffused into the combustor. Combustion in a ramjet takes place at subsonic velocities, similar to turbojets, but the combustion products are then accelerated through a convergent-divergent nozzle to supersonic speeds. As they have no mechanical means of compression, ramjets cannot start from a standstill, and generally do not achieve sufficient compression until supersonic flight. The lack of intricate turbomachinery allows ramjets to deal with the temperature rise associated with decelerating a supersonic flow to subsonic speeds, but this only goes so far: at near-hypersonic velocities, the temperature rise and inefficiencies discourage decelerating the flow to the magnitude found in ramjet engines.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{computations}} of moderator flows inside calandria of {{the typical}} CANDU- 6 reactor are presented here. The numerical model is based on incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in artificial compressibility formulation with dual time-stepping approach for time-accurate computations. A high-resolution unstructured finite-volume scheme, based on the HLLC-AC Riemann solver for convective fluxes and central differencing type discretization for viscous fluxes, is used here. In order to simulate more realistic flow, the calandria tube matrix is considered directly, {{in contrast with the}} usual practice of indirect accounting of tube bundles through porosity modeling. The moderator flows are computed for different operating conditions. The nature of computed flow is found to be dependent on the relative balance between momentum and buoyancy forces as observed by Carlucci. A parametric study is also carried out to investigate the effect of moderator <b>inlet</b> <b>diffuser</b> location, moderator inlet flow velocity, and angle of moderator <b>inlet</b> <b>diffuser.</b> The inlet flow velocity and <b>inlet</b> <b>diffuser</b> location are found to have significant effect on flow features inside the calandria...|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} ties {{in with the}} {{investigations}} on the <b>inlet</b> <b>diffusers</b> by P. Ruden. The theory developed by Ruden had produced results which found excellent confirmation in wind-tunnel tests {{and in spite of}} certain still-existing defects, are technically very promising. The reasons for the new theory of the diffuser forms indicated by Ruden are twofold: first, the arguments adduced in Ruden's theory deal only with one specific operating condition, that is, a certain ratio of mean velocity within the diffuser to flying speed, while in the present report any desired velocity ratios are involved; second, a different choice of parameters and the increased possibilities of variation result in diffuser forms which cannot be reconciled at once with Ruden's theory. The first enables a theoretical check of the measurements made with Ruden's diffusers at variable velocity ratio, the second permits the calculation of diffuser types which in many respects are superior to Ruden's diffusers...|$|R

40|$|The {{unsteady}} phenomenon abounds in {{centrifugal compressors}} and significantly affects the compressor performance. In this paper, unsteady simulations {{are carried out}} to investigate the aerodynamic performance of a process-unshrouded centrifugal compressor and the unsteady mechanism in the vaned diffuser. The predicted stage performance and pressure fluctuations at some locations are in good agreement with experimental data. The predicted main pressure fluctuation frequency spectrums at the <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet {{are consistent with the}} measured results. The results indicate that at the <b>inlet</b> of the <b>diffuser</b> there are two pressure peaks in a passage cycle. The higher pressure peak relates to the impeller wake and the lower peak is connected with the vortex generated at the diffuser’s leading edge. With a decrease in the mass flow coefficient, the vortex core region becomes larger and the lower pressure peak becomes more pronounced. The change in circumferential flow angle at the <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> is mainly responsible for the unsteadiness in the diffuser flow field, which in turn affects the inlet incidence of the diffuser vane and the vane loading distributions...|$|R

40|$|A swirling-radial-flow {{generator}} {{has been}} developed {{for the study of}} fluid-dynamic phenomena in radial passage- and vaneless-diffusers. A unique feature of the swirling-flow generator is the capability of providing a wide range of <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> flow conditions. This is accomplished by means of a very-high-solidity rotating radial-outflow nozzle cascade in conjunction with annular cross-flow injection/suction slots in the flow-path walls immediately upstream and downstream of the rotor blading. The rotor generates a shockless and weak-wake axisymmetric transonic swirling flow which can be tailored to provide a desired level of <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> flow-field axial distortion by means of cross-flow injection and/or suction through the annular slots. A complete test-facility was designed and constructed based on this concept and was utilized to study effects of inlet flow-field axial distortion on the pressure-recovery performance and stability of a modem high-performance gas-turbine-engine radial discrete-passage diffuser. It was shown that the diffuser pressure-recovery coefficient, if based on the inlet availability-averaged total pressure, correlates well with the <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> momentum-averaged flow angle independent of flow-field axial distortion and Mach number over the wide flow parameter range investigated. It was argued that the generally accepted high sensitivity of diffuser pressure recovery performance to inlet flow distortion and boundary-layer blockage is largely due to inappropriate quantification of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> flow-field parameters. Time resolved pressure measurements in the vaneless space between the rotor and diffuser showed that the diffuser operating range is limited by the onset of rotating stall triggered by the loss of flow stability in the diffuser, independent of the rotor operating point (if overall compression system instability did not occur first). It was found that the loss of flow stability in the diffuser occurred at a critical value of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>inlet</b> momentum-averaged flow angle and corresponding overall-diffuser pressure recovery coefficient (based on the availability-averaged total pressure), independent of inlet flow-field distortion and Mach number, over the wide flow parameter range investigated. A simple analytical consideration of an idealized diffuser consisting of a constant-area mixing duct followed by an isentropic-flow diffuser was used to show that the observed insensitivity of the diffuser pressure-recovery performance to inlet flow-field distortion can be attributed to rapid mixing of the flow. It was shown that measurements of the static pressure distribution along the centerline of an individual diffuser-passage support this hypothesis. September 1991 Based on the author's Ph.
