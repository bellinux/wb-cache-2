5000|$|Citing the Byzantine siphon {{used for}} {{discharging}} Greek fire as an inspiration, al-Jazari {{went on to}} describe the first suction pipes, suction pump, <b>double-action</b> <b>pump,</b> and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism, when he invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The delivery pipes are joined above {{the centre of the}} machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons: ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis originated as a requirement of micropump for artificial heart with using a suitable type of electric drive. It is an interdisciplinary cooperation of FSI Brno, Department of Fluid Engineering of Viktor Kaplan, FEKT Brno, Department of Power Electronics {{and finally the}} doctors from Cardiology Medical Center in St. Annâ€™s Hospital. FSI Brno made mechanical solutions of micropump, FEKT Brno solved electric drive and Cardiologic Medical Center gave the knowledge of human anatomy. Work deals with design, creation and testing of various types micropumps for medicamentous using. In this thesis was suggested various solutions of electric drive for micropump, its structure and function. Work is primarily experimental in nature and is heavily supported by a creative approach in creating a variety of proposed solutions. Several proposals of micropump have been made with different types of electric drives (DC motors, hybrid stepper motor, piezomotors). Finally, from the technical and economical point of view was chosen the most suitable type of electric drive and it was created a functional prototype of the <b>double-action</b> <b>pump</b> and its properties were tested...|$|E

50|$|In 1206, Al-Jazari's Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices {{described}} many hydraulic machines. Of {{particular importance}} were his water-raising pumps. The first known {{use of a}} crankshaft in a chain pump {{was in one of}} al-Jazari's saqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump, which included the first suction pipes, suction <b>pumping,</b> <b>double-action</b> <b>pumping,</b> and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism. This pump is remarkable for three reasons: the first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum) in a pump, the first application of the double-acting principle, and the conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion, via the crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism.|$|R

2500|$|The Jesuit China {{missions}} of the 16th and 17th centuries [...] "learned {{to appreciate the}} scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture." [...] Western academic thought {{on the history of}} Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of Joseph Needham and the Needham Research Institute. Among the technological accomplishments of China were, according to the British scholar Needham, early seismological detectors (Zhang Heng in the 2nd century), the water-powered celestial globe (Zhang Heng), matches, the independent invention of the decimal system, dry docks, sliding calipers, the <b>double-action</b> piston <b>pump,</b> cast iron, the blast furnace, the iron plough, the multi-tube seed drill, the wheelbarrow, the suspension bridge, the winnowing machine, the rotary fan, the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the raised-relief map, the propeller, the crossbow, and a solid fuel rocket, the multistage rocket, the horse collar, along with contributions in logic, astronomy, medicine, and other fields.|$|R
