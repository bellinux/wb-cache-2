Based on the {{representation}} {{of a set of}} canonical operators on the lattice hZn, which are Clifford-vector-valued, we will introduce new families of special functions of hypercomplex variable possessing su(1, 1) symmetries. The Fourier decomposition of the space of Clifford-vector-valued polynomials with respect to the SO(n) × su(1, 1) -module gives rise to the construction of new families of polynomial sequences as eigenfunctions of a coupled n∑ of the Euler operator E = xj∂xj. system involving forward/backward discretizations E ± h Moreover, the interpretation of the one-parameter representation Eh(t) = <b>exp(tE</b> − h −tE+ h) of the Lie group SU(1, 1) as a semigroup (Eh(t)) t≥ 0 will allows us to describe the polynomial solutions of an homogeneous Cauchy problem on [0, ∞) × hZn involving the differencialdifference operator ∂t + E + h − E− h. Key words: Clifford algebras; finite difference operators; Lie algebra...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{balance of}} the {{benefits}} and risks of long term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have {{been a matter of}} debate for decades. In Europe, HRT requires medical prescription and its advertising is only permitted when aimed at health professionals (direct to consumer advertising is allowed in some non European countries). The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the appropriateness and quality of Internet advertising about HRT in Spain. Methods. A search was carried out on the Internet (January 2009) using the eight best-selling HRT drugs in Spain. The brand name of each drug was entered into Google's search engine. The web sites appearing on the first page of results and the corresponding companies were analysed using the European Code of Good Practice as the reference point. Results. Five corporate web pages: none of them included bibliographic references or measures to ensure that the advertising was only accessible by health professionals. Regarding non-corporate web pages (n = 27) : 41 % did not include the company name or address, 44 % made no distinction between patient and health professional information, 7 % contained bibliographic references, 26 % provided unspecific information for the use of HRT for osteoporosis and 19 % included menstrual cycle regulation or boosting feminity as an indication. Two online pharmacies sold HRT drugs which could be bought online in Spain, did not include the name or contact details of the registered company, nor did they stipulate the need for a medical prescription or differentiate between patient and health professional information. Conclusions. Even though pharmaceutical companies have committed themselves to compliance with codes of good practice, deficiencies were observed regarding the identification, information and promotion of HRT medications on their web pages. Unaffected by legislation, non-corporate web pages are an ideal place for indirect HRT advertising, but they often contain misleading information. HRT can be bought online from Spain, without a medical consultation or prescription constituting a serious issue for public health. In our information society, it is the right and obligation of public health bodies to ensure that such information is not misleading.
