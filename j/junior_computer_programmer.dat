40|$|Many {{argue that}} formal degrees are not {{necessary}} {{to be successful in}} the technology industry, and further argue that self-taught <b>computer</b> <b>programmers</b> are more productive than formally taught <b>computer</b> <b>programmers.</b> This sentiment is supported by the examples of industry leaders such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. This study examines the possible effects of this attitude on the returns to education for <b>computer</b> <b>programmers.</b> The empirical analysis finds that the wage return to formal education for <b>computer</b> <b>programmers</b> is less than for most other occupations including STEM and degree-dominated professions. These differences are attributed to the smaller impact of signaling through educational attainment on wages in the technology industry as well as the perceived ability to substitute the human capital accumulated through formal education with self-teaching and experience...|$|R
