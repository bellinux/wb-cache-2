40|$|Tie bars provide load {{transfer}} along longitudinal joints and prevent lane separation in jointed concrete pavements. Tie bars are normally {{located within the}} middle third of the pavement thickness and span the longitudinal joint of two slabs. Tie bars are placed by staking or by using tie bar baskets prior to {{the placement of the}} concrete or during paving via automatic <b>inserters.</b> Inspection of South Dakota pavements after construction using ground penetrating radar (GPR) has revealed that many bars were misaligned or missing. More bars were reported missing or misaligned when automatic <b>inserters</b> were used. Many states, including South Dakota, have banned the use of automatic <b>inserters</b> based on a lack of confidence regarding the placement of tie bars. The long-term effect on the pavement from misaligned or missing bars is unknown, but it can be assumed that additional maintenance costs and reduced pavement life are both possible. A NCHRP study concluded recently (Khazanovich et al. 2009) developed guidelines for dowel alignment in concrete pavements. The report provided a quite comprehensive summary on state-of-the-art practice and research related to dowel misalignment in concrete pavements. Regardless of the dowel placement method, it is concluded that there will be misalignment issues related to tolerance, material, and placement procedures.

After giving an alternative formulation of induction in terms of binary relations, we combine both principles and obtain a mixed induction/coinduction principle which allows us to reason about minimal solutionsX≅σ(X) whereXmay occur both positively and negatively in the type constructor σ. We further strengthen these logical principles to deal with contexts and prove that such strengthening is valid when the (abstract) logic we consider is contextually/functionally complete.

These examples {{do in fact}} admit all bilimits — those weakenings of the limit notion that represent not by an isomorphism but only by an equivalence — but much more is true: they admit important classes of honest limits, including products, cotensor products, comma objects, Eilenberg-Moore objects, descent objects, <b>inserters,</b> equifiers, inverters, lax limits, pseudo limits, and idempotent-splitting. We introduce the class of flexible limits, which includes {{all of the above}} and is, in the technical sense, a closed class. Note that such honest limits, when they exist, have many advantages over bilimits: they are unique to within isomorphism, and their universal properties are both stronger and more convenient to use, a whole level of coherent families of invertible 2 -cells being avoided...|$|R
40|$|Background: While {{the use of}} {{technologies}} such as ultrasound and electrocardiographic (ECG) guidance systems to place peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) has grown, {{little is known about}} the clinicians who use these tools or their work settings. Methods: Using data from a national survey of vascular access specialists, we identified technology users as PICC <b>inserters</b> that: (a) use ultrasound to find a suitable vein for catheter placement; (b) measure catheter-to-vein ratio; and (c) use ECG for PICC placement. Individual and organizational-level characteristics between technology users versus non-users were assessed. Bivariable comparisons were made using Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests; two-sided alpha with p 1000 PICCs (55 % vs. 45 %, p< 0. 001). A significantly greater percentage of technology users also reported being certified in vascular access by an external agency than non-technology users (75 % vs. 63 %, p< 0. 001). Technology users were more often part of vascular access teams with ≥ 10 members compared to non-technology users (35 % vs. 22 %, p< 0. 001). Some practices also varied between the two groups: for example, use of certain securement devices and dressings differed between technology users and non-users (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Technology use by vascular access clinicians while placing PICCs is associated with clinician characteristics, work setting and practice factors. Understanding whether such differences influence clinical care or patient outcomes appears necessary. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Infection with {{hepatitis}} B or C viruses {{is still}} one of the most dreaded infectious diseases worldwide. Health education and screening, particularly among vulnerable groups, are the most cost-effective interventions that can be provided in developing countries. Facility and community-based provision, of effective strategic health education and counseling, are dependent on better understanding of the factors that may be associated with the level of knowledge on hepatitis. One of such groups is men who sleep with men (MSM) or homosexuals, who are at high risk of hepatitis infection through unprotected anal intercourse. This study was therefore aimed at assessing the knowledge of hepatitis infection among MSM in Calabar, a metropolitan city in the oil-rich Niger-Delta region of Nigeria. Cross-sectional study design was utilized. The snow-ball sampling method was used to recruit subjects, with self-administration of structured questionnaires. Questionnaire assessed awareness, causes, sources, consequence, and prevention of hepatitis infection. Knowledge scores were obtained for each subject. Chi-square was used to assess factors associated with knowledge, with p-value fixed at 0. 05. Sixty-nine (69) consenting subjects were surveyed, with mean age of 22. 5 ± 3. 2 years, ranging from 16 to 31 years. Mean knowledge percentage score was 43. 5 ± 32. 0, ranging from 0 % to 100 %. Age group, occupation, and other sociodemographic characteristics were not significantly associated with the knowledge of hepatitis infection. There is inadequate knowledge of hepatitis infection among MSM in the study area. This inadequacy appears worse among receivers, who are even at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections compared with <b>inserters.</b> These findings have implications for control of viral hepatitis in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
40|$|Heterosexuals (n = 2 S), {{homosexual}} insertees (n = 25), and homosexual insertors (n = 2 S) {{were carefully}} {{selected from a}} reformatory population and administered the MMPI and the Mosher Forced-Choice Guilt Inventory. A comparison of MMPI profiles, scores on 3 aspects of guilt, and the intercorrelations between the MMPI scales and the guilt scales indicated many significant differences. The inmates generally seemed to be impulsive and antisocial men who acted out their thoughts and feelings and experienced little anxiety and guilt. The insertees were characterized by confusion concerning personal and sexual identity and an inhibition of aggression. The <b>inserters</b> displayed the greatest degree of psychopathology; they openly admitted rebelliously deviant thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and appeared quite psychotic-like in their thinking. One of the major sources of disciplinary problems within prisons arises from their homosexual subculture. Frequently prison officials must decide whether to segregate a homosexual inmate or to allow him freedom on the compound. While the decision to isolate homosexual from heterosexual prisoners may be partially based upon a moral judgment that homosexual behavior is abnormal or unacceptable, it also functions to minimize fighting and homosexual seduction and rape. Some heterosexual prisoners—perhaps those for whom homosexuality poses a psychological threat—attack the homosexual prisoners. Within the homosexual population a weak male will occasionally fight an aggressive male, attempt suicide, or try an escape in order to relieve pressure put on him {{to submit to the}} latter's sexual demands. The aggressive homosexuals—referred to as "wolves, " "daddies," or "studs"—fight among themselves for access to the weak, submissive, and passive males—referred to as "sweet boys.

40|$|Dowel Bar <b>Inserters</b> (DBI) are {{automated}} {{mechanical equipment}} that position dowel bars in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) after concrete is placed. Compared to the alternative approach, which is using dowel baskets, DBIs offer advantages in cost {{and speed of}} construction. However, as dowel bars are not anchored to the subgrade similar to dowel baskets, there is a concern {{about the quality of}} dowel placement using this equipment. Improper placement of dowel bars can lead to reduced load transfer between slabs, which results in pavement distresses such as faulting and spalling at joints. To determine the accuracy of dowel placement by DBI, the Nebraska Department of Roads has used an MIT Scan- 2 device to scan the joints in projects where a DBI was used. This device uses a nondestructive magnetic imaging technique to capture the position of dowel bars inside the pavement. The aim of the this project is to analyze the MIT Scan- 2 data of the joints constructed using a DBI, and to compare them with the corresponding field performance data. This will allow us to judge if DBI is a reliable alternative for dowel placement, and to improve Nebraska’s current specifications for dowel placement tolerances. To meet the objectives, the MIT Scan- 2 data of scanned joints were initially compared with dowel placement specifications suggested by national agencies. It was observed that the longitudinal translation and rotation of dowels in a portion of scanned joints fell outside recommended tolerances. The longitudinal and vertical translation of the dowels were respectively higher and lower than the average values reported by a similar study (Khazanovich et al. 2009). MIT Scan- 2 data and field performance data were then compared to find any linkage between pavement distresses and dowel misalignment levels, enabling us to potentially improve Nebraska’s current specifications as well as conclude if any of the distresses were caused by low placement accuracy of the DBI. No linkage was found between pavement performance and dowel misalignment levels for over 220 joints that were investigated in this study. No transverse cracking was observed during field investigation, and the spalling at joints was likely {{to be the result of}} joint saw-cut operations. However, measured distress from joints with missing or completely shifted dowels show that high severity dowel misalignment has an adverse effect on joint performance...|$|R
