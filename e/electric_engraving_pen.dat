50|$|In 1891 {{the first}} {{electric}} tattoo needle {{was invented in}} New York City by modifying Thomas Edison's <b>electric</b> <b>engraving</b> <b>pen.</b> This made the process cheaper and faster; it was {{taken up by the}} poor and abandoned by the rich. O'Reilly's machine was based on the rotary technology of the electric engraving device invented by Thomas Edison. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils. The first coil machine was patented by Thomas Riley in London in 1891, using a single coil. The first twin-coil machine, the predecessor of the modern configuration, was invented by another Englishman, Alfred Charles South of London, in 1899.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- We have {{developed}} a high-pressure electroluminescence (EL) detector consisting of a cathode, 5 drift rings, and an EL-generating structure which defines a sensitive volume of ‚àÖ 5 cm x 5 cm. The EL-generating structure consists of two parallel-plate, chemically etched grids and a high-pressure optical window which is optically coupled to an external photomultiplier tube. Ionizing radiation that is absorbed in the sensitive volume generates electrons, which drift into the EL region and produce an EL flash. The detector was filled with 20 -bar Xe gas that was highly purified (> 1 msec electron-life time) using a spark purification technique. In order to evaluate the potential for using an EL detector under adverse conditions, we disturbed the detector using a 10 W <b>electric</b> <b>engraver</b> working at 60 Hz.

40|$|AbstractThe {{quality of}} the surface of {{cyclically}} loaded components is very important. Many observations confirm that {{the root cause of}} the micro cracks (causing the fatigue fracture) are primarily a surface's defects appearing during production process. These surface defects can be also caused by engraving processes used to perform identification marks. This paper presents the failure analysis of broken blade of the cutter Ku 500 VX. The blade was subject of standard metallographic examination, hardness measurements, fractography analysis and metallographic studies using stereoscopic, light and scanning electron microscopes. The damage of the blade was caused by changes of the structure (formation of the brittle micro dendritic structure) that occurred during manual <b>electric</b> <b>engraving</b> process when the material was heated till its melting point. As a result the stresses occurred in surface what provided to micro cracking and to propagate the fatigue fracture.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{creation}} of a simplified software user intefaces that allow users to control mechanical devices. The software is based on the ‚ÄúWhat-You-See-Is-What-You-Get ‚Äù (WYSIWYG) paradigm where the user manipulates a graphical model that the output of the mechanical devices will ultimately map to. CAD programs are a form of WYSIWYG software. Output from CAD programs are commonly used for outputing to <b>engraving</b> machines and <b>pen</b> plotters. If one considers that the command interpretation from the software to the mechanical device controls largely the movements of the engraving or plotting head, the same idea could be used to control a roving robot. The controller plots out the movements of the robot all before execution occurs. This sort of control is not difficult to understand and can be designed for use by students. In fact, a simple drawing program can be designed for use as a CAD program for an <b>engraver</b> and <b>pen</b> plotter and as a robot controller that can be used by elementary school students...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores some of {{the system}} {{dynamics}} and control issues for a short-stroke rotary actuator that we designed and tested for a new fast tool servo {{referred to as the}} 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo. The use of a fast tool servo (FTS) with a diamond turning machine for producing non-axisymmetric or textured surfaces on a workpiece is well known. In a previous paper [1] the authors provide details on the mechanical design and trade-off issues that were considered during the design phase for the fast tool servo. At the heart of that machine is the normal-stress variable reluctance rotary actuator described in more detail in this paper. In addition to producing the torque that is needed for the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, the actuator produces a force and is therefore referred to as a hybrid rotary/linear actuator. The actuator uses bias and steering magnetic fluxes for linearizing the torque versus current relationship. Certain types of <b>electric</b> <b>engraving</b> heads use an actuator similar in principle to our hybrid actuator. In the case of the engraving heads, the actuator is used to produce and sustain a resonating mechanical oscillator. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} arbitrary trajectory point-to-point closed-loop control of the tool tip that we demonstrate with our actuator and the 10 kHz FTS. Furthermore, we demonstrate closed-loop control of both the rotary and linear degrees of freedom for our actuator. We provide a brief summary of the demonstrated performance of the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, and discuss the magnetic circuit for the actuator and {{some of the}} related control issues. Montesanti [2] provides a more detailed and thorough discussion on the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, the hybrid actuator, and the pertinent prior art...|$|R

40|$|Printmaking one of {{the five}} basic area of {{creation}} in visual art. It represents an extremely interesting art field. The very base of each printmaking is a drawing and a motive, which is represented by it. Light-dark contrasts which arise help to a greater visual art expression. It's known that the drawing can be printed from different matrixes. It takes quite a lot of time for techniques of intaglio print and other graphic techniques to be carried out. In my master thesis I analysed the use of new materials and tools making printmaking techniques of intaglio printing. My thesis consists of three parts- theoretical, practical and pedagogical part. In my theoretical part I focused on the elements of art light-dark, which is the basic element of printmaking technique and my master‚Äôs thesis, too. We can create it with different elements of art and plastic variables, among which I chose four basic elements of art: shape, light-dark, line and pixel and I used them, too. I decided for texture in plastic variables, together with number and density. I also talked about the modelation and its connection with the elements of art- light-dark. I presented some of Slovenian and foreign printmaking artists and their works and I found out what brightness keys were used in separate work. I chose the following graphic artists: Morandi, Picasso, Kovaƒçiƒç, Rembrandt, Borƒçiƒç. I also explained the process of printmaking techniques of intaglio printing which I dealt with in my second part of my master's thesis. My author part consists of two parts. In the first part I used standard materials and tools. With different techniques of intaglio printing I used different elements of art and plastic variables which enable to carry out the element light- dark. I also placed my work in brightness key and described its expressive value. I analysed the use of new materials and tools which I later used in my pedagogical part, too {{in the second part of}} my thesis. In my pedagogical part I directly explored non-standard materials for intaglio printing in learning process. I did it in the primary school Franceta Bevka in Tolmin in elective course art edducation. Carrying out this technique {{one of the}} very important things is good organization of the teacher, together with a well selected task and motive, the correct material and the right equipment in the Art classroom. The best is introductory motivation, carrying out the techniques, teacher's positive energy and cooperation and help among students. Teachers don‚Äôt often practise printmaking techniques because they‚Äôre demanding and expensive. In my thesis I wanted to search for cheap materials which would make this technique more affordable, as far as the give many creative and technical encouragement. The majority of schools don‚Äôt give enough financial support to printmaking techniques. Zinc panels and additional material for gravure printing are quite expensive. I wanted to find alternative for those materials perpsex, plastic foils, crilex, CDs [...] ) which are less expensive. The needles which I create the motive were replaced with nails, tools for linocut, which should be in every classroomand <b>engraving</b> <b>pens.</b> I used ordinary and replacing elements and printmaking tools. In the beginning I put down some questions which I tried to answer. I analysed students' experience with questionnaires they had with a certain material and printmaking tool. I also got some results with their works. All the datas helped me to find out which material or tool is the most suitable for the printmaking technique, which is the most interesting and which cause the least problems to students. The results were firstly shown for each work...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} two high bandwidth short-stroke rotary fast tool servos and the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator developed for one of them. Design insights, trade-off methodologies, and analytical tools are developed for precision mechanical systems, power and signal electronic systems, control systems, normal-stress electromagnetic actuators, and {{the dynamics of the}} combined systems. A fast tool servo (FTS) is a high-speed auxiliary servo axis that is added to a diamond turning machine (ultra-precision lathe) to allow generating free-form non-axisymmetric or textured surfaces on a workpiece. A rotary fast tool servo produces an in-and-out motion of the tool relative to a workpiece by swinging the tool along an arc having a fixed radius. The rotary fast tool servos developed in this project were designed for diamond turning prescription textured surfaces on small spherical workpieces (diameters in the range of 10 mm or less), and are suitable for generating free-form non-axisymmetric surfaces on similar-sized workpieces. Straightforward modifications would allow them to be used on larger workpieces. These rotary fast tool servos set new benchmarks for demonstrated closed-loop bandwidth (2 kHz and 10 kHz) and tool tip acceleration (400 g). (cont.) The first machine, referred to as the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo, uses a commercially available moving-magnet galvanometer as the actuator (Lorentz force), and provides proof-of-principles for a flexure bearing, small diamond tool and mounting method, circuit topology for a high bandwidth current-mode amplifier, and control system design. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 2 kHz rotary fast tool servo: - 3 dB bandwidth of 2 kHz, 20 g tool tip acceleration at 2 kHz, maximum tool travel of 50 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 10 nm PP. The 2 kHz FTS is integrated with a diamond turning machine and used to produce optical quality textured surfaces on the face and outside diameter of aluminum workpieces while operating at 2 kHz. The machining tests validate that a rotary-type fast tool servo can be used to produce optical quality surfaces on a spherical workpiece from its pole to its equator. The second machine, referred to as the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo, incorporates the proof-of-principles from the first machine and is the vehicle for developing the hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator used in it. (cont.) The actuator is a normal-stress variable reluctance machine with a demonstrated order of magnitude increase in the peak torque and in the ratio of peak torque divided by the electrical power at its terminals, when compared to the actuator used in the 2 kHz FTS. By integrating the tool holder directly to the moving mass of the actuator to form a single rigid body, the overall torque-to-inertia ratio for the system and the frequency of the first uncoupled-mass resonance are both increased. The following closed-loop performance is demonstrated for the 10 kHz rotary fast tool servo: - 3 dB bandwidth of 10 kHz, 400 g tool tip acceleration at 5 kHz, 870 g tool tip acceleration at 10 kHz (aided by a stable mechanical resonance), maximum tool travel of 70 [mu]m PP, and tool position noise level of 1. 4 to 2. 5 nm rms (depending on the magnitude of the bias flux used). The hybrid rotary/linear electromagnetic actuator utilizes a constant bias magnetic flux, which linearizes the torque versus drive-current relationship for the actuator and provides up to half of the torque-producing magnetic flux in the rotor/stator air gaps. The actuator is similar to the rotary actuators used to drive and sustain a resonance in a mechanical oscillator in certain <b>electric</b> <b>engraving</b> heads. (cont.) This research is distinguished from the prior art by the ability to generate closed-loop arbitrary trajectories for the tool tip. Using a separate current-mode amplifier for each stator half allows demonstrating closed-loop control of the rotary and linear degrees of freedom that are inherent in this class of actuators. This research is further distinguished from the prior art by a magnetic circuit that substantially decouples certain magnetic flux paths when a coil is used instead of a permanent magnet to provide the bias magnetic flux. This reduces the complexity of the actuator electrical dynamics from a MIMO system to a SISO system, and allows using loop-shaping techniques with classical control theory to design the control systems. Torque control for the hybrid rotary/linear actuator in the 10 kHz FTS is independent of force control, but force control requires a torque-generating current to act as an operating point. Alternate magnetic circuit topologies that fully decouple torque and force control are described and compared. Future work that utilizes the linear mode as an active suspension for improving the performance of a predominantly rotary system is considered. Using the experience gained by designing, building, and testing the 10 kHz FTS and hybrid rotary/linear actuator, future work involving alternate concepts for the actuator is suggested for a follow-on rotary fast tool servo, and a high bandwidth steering mirror. by Richard Clement Montesanti.
