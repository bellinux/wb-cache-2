5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} <b>history</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back}} to the 1940s and '50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, The Swinging Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as Cuban bolero, Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, Trinidadian calypso, and American funk.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the life history of hawksbills. Their life <b>history</b> <b>can</b> be divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from {{hatching}} to about 20cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40cm (2–4 years).|$|E
5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American <b>history</b> <b>can</b> be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E

5|$|High Street {{contains}} two Grade II listed public houses: Ye Olde George Inne, once a coach house, and the Ship Inn {{which has the}} oldest licence in Christchurch. A known haunt of smugglers, the Ship Inn's <b>history</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back to}} 1688. At the end of High Street is Church Street which contains Church Hatch, a Grade II* listed Georgian residence. Once the home of Sir Owen Tudor Burne, it was saved from demolition in 1929 by public appeal. Ye Olde Eight Bells, a Grade II listed gift shop in Church Street, was once another alehouse frequented by smugglers and central to a number of local legends. Close by in Castle Street is the Perfumery, a 14th-century thatched property {{often referred to as the}} old courthouse; although some local historians maintain that this was next door and long gone.|$|E
5|$|NFL postseason <b>history</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced}} to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933, though in the early years, {{qualification}} for the game was based solely on regular season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, pitting the league's two division winners (pending any one-game playoff matches that needed to be held to break ties in the division standings). The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967, when four teams qualified for the tournament. When the league merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs expanded to eight teams. The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990.|$|E
5|$|The PanzerI's design <b>history</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced}} to the British Carden Loyd tankette of which it {{borrowed}} much of its track and suspension design. After six prototype Kleintraktor were produced the cover name was changed to Krupp-Traktor whereas the development codename was changed to Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper (LaS) (Agricultural Tractor). The LaS was intended not just to train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult engineering feat for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92mm MG 13 machine guns in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armour of the time, restricting the PanzerI to a training and anti-infantry role by design.|$|E

5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan <b>History</b> <b>can</b> be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E

This paper summarizes our SAR signal modeling experience using the XPatch simulated scattering data. We apply several 2 D parametric estimation techniques including 2 D TLS-Prony, MEMP, 2 D IQML, and 2 D CLEAN to estimate the complex exponential model parameters. From the estimation results, we discuss the engineering trade-offs among memory requirement, computation requirement, and estimation accuracy.
