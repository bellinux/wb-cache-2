30|$|A second {{possible}} explanation is that a 2 -level <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>variable</b> is not sufficiently descriptive to give adequate treatment to one or more rules. For example, Rule 2 attempts to capture the situation by which a feature shows strong presence in high quality solutions and a not-weak presence in low quality solutions.

If the sufficient input data cannot be generated due to limitations in technical and/or facility resources, the possibility-based design optimization (PBDO) method {{can be used to}} obtain reliable designs by utilizing membership functions for epistemic uncertainties. For RBDO, the performance measure approach (PMA) is well established and accepted by many investigators. It is found that the same PMA is very much desirable approach also for the PBDO problems.

As less detailed information is available for the input data, the membership function that provides more conservative optimum design should be selected. For statistical random variable, the membership function that yields least conservative optimum design is proposed by using the possibility-probability consistency theory and the least conservative condition.

The engineering system for which the controller was designed and simulate was the container crane. The fuzzy logic algorithm that was investigated was the 'predictive control' algorithm. The plant dynamics of the container crane is representative of many important systems including robotic arm movements. The container crane that was investigated had a trolley motor and hoist motor. Total distance to be traveled by the trolley was 15 meters. The obstruction height was 5 meters. Crane height was 17. 8 meters. Trolley mass was 7500 kilograms. Load mass was 6450 kilograms. Maximum trolley and rope velocities were 1. 25 meters per sec. and 0. 3 meters per sec., respectively. The fuzzy logic approach allowed the inclusion, in the controller model, of performance indices that are more effectively defined in linguistic terms. These include 'safety' and 'cargo swaying'.

However, using singleton fuzzification assumes that the input measurements are clean signals with no noise or uncertainty associated with them. The {{vast majority}} real world applications have high values of noise and uncertainty associated with the sensor and input values. Higher order Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) such as interval type- 2 FLSs {{have been shown to}} be very well suited to dealing with the high levels of uncertainties present in the majority of real world applications. However, it seems a paradox to use type- 2 FLS to handle the encountered uncertainties while assuming that the input values to the type- 2 FLS are perfect inputs when considering singleton fuzzification. Hence, we propose a hybrid approach, which employs non-singleton type- 2 FLS where the inputs will be modeled by type- 2 fuzzy sets to handle the numerical uncertainties, while the antecedent and consequent type- 2 fuzzy sets in the type- 2 FLS will be used to handle the linguistic uncertainties.

During a typical conversation, talk-spurts comprise only 35 % of each party's speech while the remaining 65 % are silence. Wireless communication systems can achieve significant gains in spectral and energy efficiency by disconnecting the user from the spectral resource during the silence periods. Therefore, {{a simple and}} robust voice activity detector is critical for a wireless system's efficiency and speech quality. This thesis presents a new voice activity detection algorithm based on fuzzy logic. The fuzzy soft decisions are made based on four parameter values: energy level, spectral distribution, periodicity, and stationarity. The input signal to the proposed fuzzy voice activity detection algorithm is subdivided into 15 -msec frames. Each frame is processed and measured for relative energy content, percentage of signal energy below 1000 Hz, and the periodicity. Stationarity between adjacent frames is also measured as a continuous variable using the spectral covariance method. All four parameter values are extracted from every speech frame based on conventional speech processing techniques, and then act as <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>variables.</b> The <b>fuzzy</b> rule base, on which the fuzzy inference phase is based, consists of 16 empirically designed fuzzy rules.

For example, Zheng et al. propose a dynamic access category (AC) selection mechanism to provide dynamic {{protection of the}} video frames while transmitting the video over IEEE 802.11 e networks [23]. Since the video data rate, coding structure and the network load may change very frequently, they use a fuzzy logic controller to adjust parameters of their dynamic frame assignment algorithm. In this controller, queue length of ACs and frame loss rates of frame priorities are used as an input. CONSEQ [24] is another work which avoids congestion via fuzzy logic-based dynamic rate adaptation. As the <b>fuzzy</b> control <b>inputs,</b> CONSEQ uses error and change-in-error of effective queue length which is computed based on the virtual queue lengths, observed packet drops, {{and the effect of}} probabilistic load balancing. Urathal et al. propose a Fuzzy-Based Congestion Control (FCC) algorithm which has three fuzzy parameters as congestion indicators [25]. The first parameter is the node degree which is basically calculated by using the location of the sensors and the number of hop count among them. The second and the third parameters are queue length and the data arrival rate, respectively. In case of high congestion level, FCC performs rate adaptation and also it uses a back-pressure technique to inform neighboring upstream nodes to send fewer number of packets. Zarei et al. propose a Fuzzy-Based Trust Estimation (FTE) as a {{congestion control}} scheme to find the corrupt or malicious sensors [26]. After finding these nodes, FTE isolates them to remove the traffic overhead arising from their packets. Each sensor monitors its neighbor node and finds their trustworthiness. FTE uses three <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>variables</b> which are forwarded packet ratio, delay and validity. Forwarded packet ratio is defined as the number of packets forwarded by the suspected node divided by the number of packets forwarded by the other sensor nodes. For the packets forwarded by the suspected node, the delay is calculated by dividing the actual delay by the expected delay and the validity is calculated by dividing the number of valid packets to the number of all packets. According to the fuzzy result, the malicious nodes are detected and useless packets are dropped to increase the packet delivery rate.|$|R

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth of}} freight transportation has placed significant stress on U. S. and European transportation networks. The dominance of trucking {{as the main}} mode of domestic general cargo transportation has caused environmental and societal problems, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, highway accidents, noise, and increased energy consumption. Using inland and coastal waterways, short sea shipping (SSS) can alleviate these problems. SSS can provide efficient door-to-door transportation {{as part of an}} intermodal system, where ships perform the long-haul and trucks the short haul cargo collection and distribution. This dissertation examines the economic feasibility of SSS. The environmental and societal advantages of SSS over competing modes are translated into lower external costs. External costs or externalities are the hidden costs not reflected in transportation prices. This non-inclusion is considered a market failure by economists. Estimating their monetary value is a challenging task. There is an inherent subjectivity, imprecision, and vagueness in current external cost valuation methods. This dissertation addresses this vagueness and imprecision of externalities using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic treats subjectivity with mathematical rigor. Several factors that determine the impact level of transportation externalities are modeled as <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>variables.</b> The outputs are the damage costs of major air pollutants and the external costs of traffic congestion. A fuzzy inference system can provide site-specific monetary estimation for these externalities under defined conditions, instead of average values. The results show that SSS has great potential for further improving its environmental performance by lowering ship emissions at ports, where most of its external costs occur, by implementing procedures, such as “cold ironing. ” The dissertation assesses the feasibility and competitiveness of SSS, in comparison to the all-truck mode, in two realistic cases of prospective short sea operations along the U. S. East Coast. SSS is highly competitive, due to its significant energy efficiencies. Furthermore, its environmental performance, in terms of monetary impact of emissions is superior, due to location.

However, to improve results in tenus of both classification accuracy and running time are necessary if the techniques are to be widely adopted in industry, which has motivated this research. This research presents a method using rough sets based neural network with <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> (RNNFI). <b>Variable</b> precision rough set (VPRS) method is proposed to remove redundant features utilising the characteristics of VPRS for data analysis and processing. The reduced data is fuzzified to represent the feature data in a more suitable foml for input to an improved BP neural network classifier. The improved BP neural network classifier is improved in three aspects: additional momentum, self-adaptive learning rates and dynamic error segmenting.

It plays a very useful role in industrial applications in order to relieve human inspectors and improve the inspection accuracy and hence increasing productivity. Research has previously been done in defect classification of wood veneers using techniques such as neural networks, and a certain degree of success has been achieved. However, to improve results in tenus of both classification accuracy and running time are necessary if the techniques are to be widely adopted in industry, which has motivated this research. This research presents a method using rough sets based neural network with <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> (RNNFI). <b>Variable</b> precision rough set (VPRS) method is proposed to remove redundant features utilising the characteristics of VPRS for data analysis and processing. The reduced data is fuzzified to represent the feature data in a more suitable foml for input to an improved BP neural network classifier. The improved BP neural network classifier is improved in three aspects: additional momentum, self-adaptive learning rates and dynamic error segmenting. Finally, to further consummate the classifier, a uniform design CUD) approach is introduced to optimise the key parameters because UD can generate a minimal set of uniform and representative design points scattered within the experiment domain. Optimal factor settings are achieved using a response surface (RSM) model and the nonlinear quadratic programming algorithm (NLPQL). Experiments have shown that the hybrid method is capable of classifying the defects of wood veneers with a fast convergence speed and high classification accuracy, comparing with other methods such as a neural network with <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> and a rough sets based neural network. The research has demonstrated a methodology for visual {{inspection of}} defects, especially for situations where there is a large amount of data and a fast running speed is required. It is expected that this method can be applied to automatic visual inspection for production lines of other products such as ceramic tiles and strip steel.

The problem discussed in this paper concerns the simulation of processes where the raw materials and the operational parameters possess fuzzy characteristics.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of the underwater trash detection system effectively, the gain fuzzy controller is employed to make programmable gain amplifier work in the optimum status, and its gain will be adjusted according to target distance and echo amplitude in time. The target distance and the echo amplitude are <b>input</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables,</b> and the amplifier gain is output fuzzy variable. After designing membership functions and fuzzy control rules, defuzzification of the output variable is achieved according to the largest membership degree algorithm. FPGA is used to realize gain fuzzy controller with the inference lookup table, and the system experiments are completed. The results show: the functions of the gain fuzzy controller based on FPGA are implemented correctly, and the design is effectively simplified, and the real-time performance is improved by using the fuzzy inference lookup table...|$|R
40|$|Voting {{algorithms}} {{are used}} to arbitrate between the results of redundant modules in fault-tolerant systems. Inexact majority and weighted average voters {{have been used in}} many applications, although both have problems associated with them. Inexact majority voters require an application- specific 'voter threshold' value to be specified, whereas weighted average voters are unable to produce a benign output when no agreement exists between the voter inputs. Neither voter type is able to cope with uncertainties associated with the voter inputs. This paper introduces a novel voting scheme based on fuzzy set theory. It softens the harsh behaviour of the inexact majority voter in the neighbourhood of the 'voter threshold', and handles uncertainty and some multiple error cases in the region defined by the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>input</b> <b>variables.</b> The voter assigns a fuzzy difference value to each pair of voter inputs based on their numerical distance. A set of fuzzy rules then determines a single fuzzy agreeability value for each individual input which describes how well it matches the other inputs. The agreeability of each voter input is then defuzzified to give a weighting value for that input which determines its contribution to the voter output. The weight values are then used in the weighted average algorithm for calculating the voter final output. The voter is experimentally evaluated {{from the point of view}} safety and availability, and compared with the inexact majority voter in a Triple Modular Redundant structured framework. The impact of changing some fuzzy variables on the performance of the voter is also investigated. We show that the fuzzy voter gives more correct outputs (higher availability) than the inexact majority voter with small and large errors, less incorrect outputs (higher safety) than the inexact majority voter in the presence of small errors, and less benign outputs than the inexact majority voter. The percentage of the benign outputs of the majority voter that are successfully handled by the fuzzy voter (resulting in correct outputs) is more than the percentage of those that are unsuccessfully resolved by the fuzzy voter (resulting in incorrect outputs). Our results suggest that the fuzzy voter is a viable alternative to a traditional inexact voter in cases where the benefits of a large increase in availability, and a considerable decrease in the number of benign outputs outweighs the cost of a small degradation in the safety performance of the system. The fuzzy voter is also a useful voting algorithm when arbitrating between the responses of dynamic channels of control systems incorporating uncertainties. This is the first reported use of a complete fuzzy voter in the context of fault tolerance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
