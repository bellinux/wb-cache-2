Furthermore, they administer the local land registry. In regard to the administrative tasks, these functions may be assigned to an assessor, which is a deputy judge. An electronic reform of the land registry system is being implemented, making the system entirely electronic.|$|E

Article 16 also grants exclusive jurisdiction to specified jurisdictions as the lex situs of immovable property and a res, and for the status of companies, the validity of public registers with particular reference to the registration and validity of patents, and the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgments.</b> Subsequent articles allow forum selection clauses and other forms of agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a given forum.

In the next part of this work I interpret a fundamental conception of these subjects such as legal force, enforcement and decision.

I analyze legal force and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> {{from the point of view}} of the formal legal force, material legal force and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> too.

2500|$|Virtually every {{significant}} commercial {{country in}} the world is a party to the Convention, but relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> of the court. [...] Hence in many countries, particularly in emerging markets, a foreign arbitration award is much easier to enforce than an award of the court.

Canada also proposed that the Hague Conference work on a Convention to address what it termed [...] "legal kidnapping." [...] The Hague received Canada's request enthusiastically and, inspired by a Swiss proposal originally submitted at the Council of Europe in 1976 coined a new term in international family law – [...] "international child abduction."

To make a breakthrough, the essentials for achieving recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>judgments</b> in China must be unveiled from a practical perspective rather than for purpose of purely theoretical analyses. Investigation into the representative cases in this regard shows that there are two requirements that are of Chinese courts first and foremost concern, namely the principle of reciprocity and the due service requirement. Special attention should be paid to both requirements informing the aforesaid cases. Satisfaction of these two requirements may well bring an anticipated recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>judgments</b> in China. As a necessity, applicants and foreign courts must enrich their knowledge of the Chinese law and judicial practice in this respect...|$|R
