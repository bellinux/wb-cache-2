For the annealing at 700 /spl deg/C for 20 min, although only 0. 1 % of the implanted Si ions remained, it can cause a <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> shift of - 21. 3 V, and the <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> shift reduces with time under a negative gate voltage showing neutralization of the trapped ions by the injected electrons from the gate. However, the annealing at 900 /spl deg/C for 20 min has {{reduced the number of}} the remaining ions to the lowest limit corresponding to a <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> shift of - 0. 1 V, and the application of the negative voltage does not change the <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage.</b> A higher annealing temperature or a longer annealing time does not show further improvement, suggesting that the annealing at 900 /spl deg/C for 20 min is sufficient for eliminating the effect of the trapped ions. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The bias to the MOS capacitor supplied through the capacitance meter is provided by a ramp voltage going from a negative toward a positive voltage level and vice versa.

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of CVD single crystal diamond plates of which only {{recently}} has been made commercially available saw significant advancements during the last decade. In parallel to that, detonation nanodiamond (DND) particles also now widely made accessible for requisition are provoking a lot of scientific investigations. The remarkable properties of diamond including its extreme hardness, low coefficient of friction, chemical inertness, biocompatibility, high thermal conductivity, optical transparency and semiconducting properties make it attractive for a number of applications, among which electronic and micro electrical-mechanical systems devices for chemical and biological applications are few of the key areas. A detailed knowledge of diamond devices at the prototypical stage is therefore critical. The work carried out encapsulated in this thesis describes the employment of the nanometer-scale diamond structures for the design, fabrication and testing of electronic devices and micro electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) structures for chemical sensing applications. Two major approaches are used to achieve engineering novelty. The first type being devices based on single crystal diamond substrates, which include state of the art δ-doped single crystal diamond Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor with an intrinsic layer capping the delta-doped layer for pH sensing and the fabrication and characterization of a triangular-face single crystal diamond MEMS. A comprehensive set of characterisations was systematically performed on the delta ISFET devices. Cyclic Voltammetry has been used to determine the devices’ potential window determining the limits of the applied potential for the Current-Voltage measurements. In solutions of different pH levels, an improved sensitivity of 55 mV/pH compared to cap-less design in a previous study is taken as the salient figure of merit. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy sheds some light on device performance in terms of <b>flatband</b> <b>voltages</b> and conduction pathways through circuit modelling. Improved ISFET characteristics such as lower flat-band voltage at 3. 74 V, simpler conduction paths and drain current saturation onsets show the chosen design is correct and advances delta-doped diamond ISFET research and development work. For the single crystal diamond cantilever, the theoretical modelling supports the triangular-face design to be a better option, generating 3 x greater deflections in relation to the conventional rectangular-face design, when operated as a static mode sensor. Based on experimental characterisation methods such as Raman and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, the focusedion beam only milling technique inflicts minimum damage to the beam structure. In the second approach, a novel hybrid device idea was conceived and implemented using off-the-shelf silicon ISFETs and cantilevers with a coat of nanodiamond particles on the ‘active area’ surfaces of the respective devices. These nanodiamond-coated silicon devices exhibit high sensitivity for tracing threat signatures such as explosive precursors and analogues with the former in both liquid and vapour medium, and the latter in the vapour phase. The nanodiamond-gated ISFET shows a voltage response of a commendable maximum voltage shift of 90 mV throughout 0 to 0. 1 M concentration range of NO 2 - and ClO 3 - solutions. In the vapour phase detecting 2, 4 -DNT, a sensitivity of 20 mV/ 0. 4 ppm is observed. The nanodiamond-coated silicon cantilever demonstrates a performance advantage of 7. 4 Hz/ppb to 1. 7 Hz/ppb in a previous study. Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy was carried out on the nanodiamond surfaces hosted by potassium bromide (KBr) discs to ascertain the vapour chemisorption. With the fabrication technique simplified, commercialisation of these proof-of-concept devices should be less time consuming thus enabling quicker deployment of diamond-based surface sensing technology...|$|R

Before irradiation, the electrical characteristics of the thermal oxide and buried oxide are significantly different. The fluorine implantation in the smart-cut® buried oxide results in a large negative threshold shift due to the trapping of positive charges. These charges are associated with positively charged fluorine ions on implantation and are trapped at pre-existing trap sites, particularly at the bonding interface, and at additional defects caused by the ion implantation damage. This shift is absent in the wet thermal oxide. After Co 60 irradiation up to 500 Krad(Si), the negative <b>flatband</b> and threshold <b>voltage</b> shift in the fluorine implanted buried oxide is larger than in the unimplanted buried oxide indicating that any potential positive effect of fluorine on the passivation of interface states is more than offset by the additional trapping sites created during implantation.

We find that the thermal budget during oxidation {{and the type of}} oxidizing agent (slow vs. fast) affect the amount of fixed charge in the film significantly. Oxidation of 0. 8 nm of Zr metal on Si at 600 °C in N 2 O for 15 s results in EOT= 1. 2 nm and a shift in the <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> by ~- 0. 2 V indicating generation of positive fixed charge. Oxidation of similar films for 300 s result in EOT= 2. 8 nm and shift of the <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> by ~- 0. 95 V. Hf films oxidized in N 2 O also show increased concentrations of fixed charge for longer oxidation times. By comparison, Si oxidized in the same environment does not show this extent of <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> shift. A significantly reduced charge generation rate is observed for Hf oxidation under low O 2 partial pressure. Extended oxidations (up to 1 h) result in increased EOT and a slight decrease in the charged defect state density. Forming Gas Anneal (FGA) results in partial neutralization of the charge. FGA after the Al gate deposition also leads to significant decrease of the EOT (from 2. 7 to 2. 1 nm) indicating significant reaction of the film with the gate metal. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for thin films indicates formation of Zr and Hf-silicates. However, for thick Hf films the low O 2 oxidation process results in less silicon incorporation in the film as compared to films oxidized in N 2 O.

40|$|This {{focus of}} this paper is charge {{trapping}} within HfO 2 high-κ metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors. Charge was injected by constant voltage stress and internal photoemission. Capacitance-voltage and photocurrent-voltage measurements were taken {{in order to determine the}} centroid of oxide charge within the high-κ gate stack. Shifts in photocurrent response of the Al/HfO 2 /SiO 2 /p-type Si capacitors place the centroid within the HfO 2 dielectric, near the Al gate. Large <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage</b> and photocurrent shifts were measured which indicates a large density of traps within these films. Measurements and observations support the result that it is the bulk traps in the HfO 2 which contribute to charge trapping...|$|E
40|$|Surface voltage {{and surface}} {{photovoltage}} measurements have become important semiconductor characterization tools, {{largely because of}} the availability of commercial equipment and the contactless nature of the measurements. The range of the basic technique has been expanded through the addition of corona charge. The combination of surface charge and illumination allows surface voltage, surface barrier height, <b>flatband</b> <b>voltage,</b> oxide thickness, oxide charge density, interface trap density, mobile charge density, oxide integrity, minority carrier diffusion length, generation lifetime, recombination lifetime and doping density to be determined. In this review I shall briefly review the history of surface voltage, then discuss the principles of the technique and give some examples and applications...|$|E
