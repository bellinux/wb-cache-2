40|$|The initial {{strength}} hype over carbon nanotubes arose from {{predictions of the}} strength of individual graphene layers, encouraged by measurements of individual MWCNTs and SWCNT bundles in AFM [1, 2]. However, while the scientists were professionally explicit as to what they had measured, the publicity assumed that these figures could also be readily realized in materials made from these components. It’s against a background of this overselling that we examine the gradual improvement in strength of macroscopically useful materials.

40|$|Organic {{electronic}} devices {{are expected to}} be easily scalable and highly cost-effective, presuming the good solution processability of high-performance organic semiconductors. However, there are cases where an organic compound with promising semiconducting properties lacks adequate processability and does not form well-performing thin films through conventional solution-based deposition techniques. The photoprecursor approach, in which a soluble photoprecursor is solution-deposited on a substrate and then converted to a target material by in situ photoreaction, can be an effective means to evade such a problem. Herein, we describe a comparative evaluation of thin films deposited by three different methods; i. e., vacuum deposition, photoprecursor approach, and <b>direct</b> <b>spin</b> coating. Two highly crystalline molecular semiconductors, hexyl-substituted anthra[1, 2 -b: 4, 3 -b': 5, 6 -b'': 8, 7 -b''']tetrathiophene (C 6 -ATT) and anthra[1, 2 -b: 5, 6 -b']dithiophene (or bent anthradithiophene, C 6 -BADT), are employed in this study along with the corresponding newly synthesized α-diketone-type photoprecursors. In the case of C 6 -ATT, thin films prepared through the photoprecursor approach are as good as those obtained by vacuum deposition in terms of surface smoothness and space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mobility, while <b>direct</b> <b>spin</b> coating affords highly inhomogeneous films. For C 6 -BADT, on the other hand, employment of the photoprecursor approach is not as effective, albeit it is still advantageous as compared to <b>direct</b> <b>spin</b> coating. These results highlight the power and limitations of the photoprecursor approach, and will serve as a basis for the preparation of practically useful organic devices through this unique approach...|$|R

30|$|The CNT fiber is {{yet another}} {{macroscopic}} assembly of CNT bundles in a densified manner. CNT fibers have attracted intensive experimental and theoretical interests and are of increasing practical importance because of their unique 1 D structure inherited from individual CNTs [21]. Early research efforts mainly focused on organizing discontinuous nanotubes into ribbon/fiber-like materials. We first reported that long single-walled CNT (SWNT) strands consisting of aligned SWNTs could be synthesized directly with a vertical floating chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method [22]. Many approaches have been developed since then for the assembly of CNTs into continuous fibers through <b>direct</b> <b>spinning</b> [23 – 26] and post-synthesis spinning [27 – 30]. Compared to the CNT film, the 1 D CNT fiber composed of densely aligned CNT bundles has higher conductance. When forming a heterojunction with silicon, though the fiber itself (generally microns thick) is essentially opaque, the photo-generated charge holes excited from the exposed underlying silicon wafer will transport to it.|$|E
40|$|Assembling carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) in to ensembles like fibres, yarns or films {{is aimed}} at exploiting the exceptional properties of individual CNTs at a macroscopic scale. Amongst the various production methods, continuous and <b>direct</b> <b>spinning</b> of CNT assemblies (specifically, fibres) from the gas-phase chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor is attractive due to its scale-up potential. Although, these fibres exhibit remarkable mechanical, electrical and thermal properties, their performance is limited by compositional heterogeneity – stemming from the presence of non-CNT inclusions and nanotubes with a wide distribution of diameters, lengths and chiralities. The work presented here attempts to explore strategies to control {{the composition of the}} CNT fibres. Reduction of impurity levels can stem to either post-spinning removal of extraneous materials or to direct synthesis of pure fibres. In this work, each of these routes has been pursued. A post-spinning purification methodology, involving sonication of the continuously spun fibres in a solvent has been attempted and the structure, composition and performance of the purified fibres have been assessed. In addition, having evaluated the origins of the compositional heterogeneity associated with the CVD-based synthesis employed for fibre spinning, CNT fibres with minimal impurities could be directly produced by coordinating the pyrolysis chemistry of the CVD-reactants. As a step further, morphology control of the constituent nanotubes, specifically with respect to limiting their diameter distribution and regulating the number of walls, was also attempted. As a result, CNT fibres composed of exclusively multiwalled/doublewalled/singlewalled nanotubes with minimal impurities have been produced. Having developed protocols to exercise a definite degree of control on the contents of the CNT fibres, effects of the composition on the fibre-performance have also been examined.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of protein motions and related conformational changes {{is a prerequisite}} for the understanding of enzymatic processes. Site <b>directed</b> <b>spin</b> labeling (SDSL) has emerged as a powerful technique to determine the required data, especially for problems where it is difficult to apply X-ray crystallography or solution NMR methods. In the present approach, X- and W- band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structure and conformational changes of site <b>directed</b> <b>spin</b> labeled proteins. The method is evaluated here with the light driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) from Halobacterium salinarum. Site directed mutagenesis has allowed to introduce nitroxide side chains at almost any desired site in a protein. Recent studies on a large number of spin labeled protein mutants have shown that the dynamic properties of the nitroxide side chain and thus the EPR spectral line shape contain direct information about the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein {{in the vicinity of the}} nitroxide binding site [1]. Supplementary data on the protein structure were extracted from the accessibility of the nitroxides for hydrophobic or hydrophilic quenchers and from the polarity of the nitroxide environment, which can be determined by high field...|$|R
