5|$|Back in La Pointe, Buffalo {{took several}} actions to {{forestall}} and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US government {{for the next two}} years to no avail. They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of the debacle <b>in</b> <b>Sandy</b> Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is common}} and {{widespread}} among beetle families, {{especially those that}} feed on wood or vegetation, such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, which are often green) and weevils. In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the avocado weevil Heilipus apiatus to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many beetles that live <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> environments {{blend in with the}} coloration of that substrate.|$|E

5|$|During the Quaternary Period (2.6million {{years ago}} up to today), {{deposits}} of windblown sand and alluvium covered {{much of the}} Chinle and Bidahochi. Older dunes {{range in age from}} 500,000years at higher elevations {{in the northern part of}} the park to about 10,000years <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> drainage areas such as Lithodendron Wash. Stabilized by grasses and other vegetation, young dunes of about 1,000years old are found throughout the park.|$|E
5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's distributaries.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{cochineal}} {{lives on}} herbaceous plants growing <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> and arid, infertile soils. Its primary host plant is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), {{but it has}} also been known to feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and cinquefoil (Potentilla).|$|E

The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton.|$|E
5|$|A {{squad of}} 16 members, {{built around the}} core of the former Rhodesia team, was hastily {{assembled}} by Liz Dreyer, {{the president of the national}} women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white. Ann Grant, the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. Anthea Stewart, who had played for South Africa 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while Arlene Boxall, the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters <b>in</b> <b>Sandy</b> Chick and Sonia Robertson.|$|E
5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded <b>in</b> <b>sandy,</b> alkaline soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> environments.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive <b>in</b> <b>sandy,</b> chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its predilection for dead wood, the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E
50|$|Common shrubs are maple-leaved {{viburnum}} (Viburnum acerifolium), spicebush (Lindera benzoin), and {{witch hazel}} (Hamamelis virginiana). <b>In</b> <b>sandier</b> or more acidic soils are mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum).|$|R
5000|$|Casey Sandy (born 21 May 1984) is a Canadian gymnast who {{competed for}} Penn State from 2006 to 2009. <b>In</b> 2007, <b>Sandy</b> participated <b>in</b> World Championships. <b>In</b> 2008, <b>Sandy</b> was the NCAA {{all-around}} national champion. He was discouraged by Canada from trying {{for a place}} on its 2008 Olympic team. <b>In</b> 2009, <b>Sandy</b> was the Canadian national champion. In that year, he also was awarded the Nissen-Emery award (the [...] "Heisman" [...] of men's gymnastics).|$|R
5000|$|A {{reported}} tornado {{ripped the}} roofs off several homes <b>in</b> <b>Sandy's</b> parish {{on the afternoon}} of November 2, 2005. [...] A later investigation by the Bermuda Weather Service suggested this was the work of a gustnado with gusts up to 80kts.|$|R
5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic ecozone, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> lake or river beds.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Spanish explorers {{arriving}} in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> graves, while upper class members were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves. One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands. The loss of such {{a large amount of}} mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of mummia, a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{sites are}} varied, though {{cavities}} are preferred. Nests {{are most frequently}} built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used. A sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> banks or rotten branches, but more frequently uses the nests of other birds {{such as those of}} swallows in banks and cliffs, and old tree cavity nests. It usually uses deserted nests, though sometimes it usurps active ones. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe, putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters, and thereby contributing to their population declines.|$|E
50|$|Damaging winds, {{possibly}} {{related to}} tornadic activity impacted the island {{early in the}} morning on February 19th 1993. The storms effects were felt hardest <b>in</b> <b>Sandy's</b> Parish and along North Shore. One person was injured and 100 customers lost electricity in the storms.|$|R

5|$|Plants {{and animals}} include those {{generally}} common to Central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute {{one-third of the}} forests; conifers are increasing {{as a result of}} reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver. The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium {{occurs in}} {{uraninite}} (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{is found}} in Africa (Tunisia), Australia, Asia (including the eastern Himalayas of India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, China, the Far East of Russia, and Turkey) and Europe (including the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain). It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala. Widely distributed in North America, it is most common in the southeast and along the Pacific Coast. The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa, limited in distribution to Lewis County, Washington, associates with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Variety compactospora is known from Sardinia, Italy, {{where it has been}} found growing <b>in</b> <b>sandy</b> soil in forests comprising strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), tree heath (Erica arborea), and holm oak (Quercus ilex).|$|E
