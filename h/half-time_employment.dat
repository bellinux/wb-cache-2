5000|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} literary assistant to Winston Churchill, who had just begun work on his biography Marlborough: His Life and Times. Ashley provided Churchill with original material from archives in Britain and Europe, earning £300 a year for this <b>half-time</b> <b>employment.</b> Although he was unimpressed by Ashleys socialistic views, Churchill praised his [...] "competence and industry as an historical investigator". Ashley later wrote Churchill as Historian (1968), a perceptive analysis of Churchills methods.|$|E
5000|$|In 1900 the Society {{produced}} Fabianism and the Empire, {{the first}} statement of its views on foreign affairs, drafted by Bernard Shaw and incorporating the suggestions of 150 Fabian members. It was {{directed against the}} liberal individualism of those such as John Morley and Sir William Harcourt. It claimed that the classical liberal political economy was outdated, and that imperialism was the new stage of the international polity. The question was whether Britain would be the centre of a world empire or whether it would lose its colonies and end up as just two islands in the North Atlantic. It expressed support for Britain in the Boer War because small nations, such as the Boers, were anachronisms {{in the age of}} empires. In order to hold onto the Empire, the British needed to fully exploit the trade opportunities secured by war; maintain the British armed forces in a high state of readiness to defend the Empire; the creation of a citizen army to replace the professional army; the Factory Acts would be amended to extend to 21 the age for <b>half-time</b> <b>employment,</b> so that the thirty hours gained would be used in [...] "a combination of physical exercises, technical education, education in civil citizenship ... and field training in the use of modern weapons".|$|E
40|$|The {{data for}} this study were taken from the survey titled Monitoring the Future (MtF), an annual {{cross-section}} of high school seniors across the nation, using the 1976 and 1981 cohorts. Log-linear analysis was the primary analytic technique, supplemented by factor analysis where appropriate. The topic is not new. With graduation approaching, high school seniors must consider four major decision areas: further education, employment, marriage, and/or parenthood. Yet, each of these is increasingly problematic {{within the context of a}} Post-Industrial society. These decision areas are in fact inextricably bound together in a dynamic and complex fashion. That is, goals are eminently lifestyle choices. What is new, then, is this study's perspective and the central role of gender in shaping such choices. Given these two premises, this study primarily critiques conventional Status Attainment models of youths' aspirations drawing upon Bernard (1981), Gilligan (1982), Baruch, Barnett, and Rivers (1983), and Gerson (1985). As lifestyle choices, seniors were confronted with such issues as employed wives/mothers, division of housework and child care labor between spouses, and househusbands. The majority of young women and men alike considered both a job and homelife central to their futures. Yet, occupational aspirations reflected the sex-segregation of the labor market. In general, homelife scenarios found that either wife's full-time or <b>half-time</b> <b>employment</b> was favored in contrast to full-time homemaking when no preschool children were involved. Once children were involved, however, most seniors preferred the wife remain home. With respect to child care and housework, equal responsibility was strongly preferred by virtually all seniors. Many seniors also preferred arrangements in which the wife was primarily responsible for these tasks, regardless of her employment status. Shifts in husband's roles were generally unacceptable, particularly full-time househusbands. Overall, more young men supported traditional arrangements, while more young women supported change. Seniors' aspirations, thus, found evidence for both a diversity of future lifestyles, as well as areas of potential conflict...|$|E
40|$|L'auteur définit et examine la notion de travail à temps partiel et en présente les différentes implications. Part-time {{employment}} {{has become}} a considerable phenomenon in the labour market in developed countries: 11 million in the USA, 9 million in the EEC and 1. 3 million in Canada. And it is constantly growing. Three definitions apply {{to the sort of}} works: <b>half-time</b> employment; part-time <b>employment</b> which may be more or less than half-time; occasional or temporary employment which is full-time but of short duration. The groups mainly affected in developed countries are women, the handicap-ped, students and young people generally, as well as the aged. The first group, how-ever, is by far the largest comprising from 70 % to 90 % depending on the country concerned. The areas mainly affected are those of the public and para-public sectors, but the private sector can also be included although to a much lesser extent. The rational behind part-time employment can be described as economic, social and egalitarian. In the first case, it permits a better use of available abilities. In the second, it permits a better integration of man in society and favours fuller development of personality. Finally, it permits better use of women's abilities, and makes it possible for the society to benefit from their participation. There are several advantages in this type of employment: as concerns the employer, the employee, and particularly women. To take full advantage of it, nevertheless, a series of problems must be resolved: in the law, technical and organizational aspects, and in psychological attitudes. The French experience can be useful in this regard, for both its strong and weak points. A complete solution, however may be found in the following: a clarification of the nature of part-time employment as a social objective; a clarification of its best spheres of application; the avoidance of the establishment of a System of second class labour.
