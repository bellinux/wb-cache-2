Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II).

40|$|The recent {{launches}} of the X-ray satellite observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton, {{have opened}} up {{a new era in}} studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

Here we discuss the importance for understanding these <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> of M-shell iron dielectronic recombination (DR) via 3 - 3 core electron excitations.

ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI Active galaxies have a small core of emission embedded in an otherwise typical galaxy. The nuclei of these galax-ies often emit more radiation than the entire rest of the galaxy. This emission is believed to be powered by ac-cretion onto a supermassive black hole in the center of such galaxies [1]. The intense emission from these active galactic nucle...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|The model {{assumes that}} bubble nuclei are always {{present in a}} {{specific}} size distribution, and that a certain number are induced to grow by compression and decompression.

50|$|For any {{temperature}} {{below the}} critical point, {{the density of}} the gas will be less than that of the liquid. At the critical point, {{the density of the}} liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> are identical and the compound becomes a supercritical fluid.|$|R

5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E
5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> and at {{very low}} {{temperatures}} in the condensed phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital. The opposite trend is shown for the metal–metal bond-dissociation energies. The Uue–Uue bond should be slightly stronger than the K–K bond. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of ununennium is predicted to be 94kJ·mol−1 (the value for francium should be around 77kJ·mol−1).|$|E
40|$|An {{abridged}} {{method for}} high speed shadowgraph and diffraction based imaging of combusting sprays, capable to discern among spray and flame regions is presented and discussed.

A set of examples are shown where the visualisation and localisation of the liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> of reacting sprays are possible regardless of the injection sequence which is implemented. Further, the penetration of the liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases</b> can be measured along a single injection {{with the possibility of}} doing spray characterisation and combusting studies of a single spray spatially resolved and as function of time...|$|R

5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the <b>gas</b> <b>phase,</b> glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} task {{of statistical}} physics {{is to start}} with a microscopic Hamiltonian, predict the system's statistical properties and compare them with observable data. A notable current fundamental challenge is to tell whether and how an interacting Hamiltonian predicts different energy spectra, including solid, liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases.</b> Here, we propose a new idea that enables a unified description of all three states of matter. We introduce a generic form of an interacting phonon Hamiltonian with ground state configurations minimising the potential. Symmetry breaking, from the group of rotations in reciprocal space to its subgroup, leads to emergence of energy gaps of shear excitations {{as a consequence of the}} Goldstone theorem, and readily results in the emergence of energy spectra of solid, liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>phases.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
