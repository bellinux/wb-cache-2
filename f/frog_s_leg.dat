40|$|For people {{bound to}} a wheelchair, {{the ability to}} elevate one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>legs</b> {{is as much a}} comfort concern as it is a health concern. The {{elevation}} of one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>legs</b> changes the user 2 ̆ 7 s sitting position, thereby increasing their comfort level {{while at the same time}} increasing circulation, ultimately aiding in the prevention of pressure sores and lower extremity swelling. Unfortunately, the motion of current legrests on manual wheelchairs does not accurately match the motion of the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> lower <b>leg.</b> This mismatch of motion causes the legrest to push up on the leg, shortening it while applying torque to the hip. An elevating/articulating wheelchair legrest that consisted of a planar sixbar linkage coupled with a worm gear set was designed and manufactured to address the shortcomings of standard elevating legrests. The legrest prototype elevates and articulates simultaneously from a single user interface, allowing the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>leg</b> to be straight in the elevated position. The prototype design was evaluated by a potential user, his nurse, and the Director of Rehabilitation Engineering at the Massachusetts Hospital School. The collective response from this evaluation was very favorable. The design was successful in meeting the design specifications. Further modifications are needed before the design is ready for the commercial market...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the abdominal manual muscle testing protocols proposed by Kendall et al. and Clarkson et al. to determine if these testing grades were significantly different from each other, and if they correlated with a maximum isometric contraction. Fifty healthy male and female volunteers, between the ages of 21 and 67, participated in this study. Subjects began the testing procedure with a maximum isometric contraction (X= 12. 68 kilograms). Subjects were randomized using a counterbalanced design for the remainder of the testing. Subjects performed Clarkson et aI. 2 ̆ 7 s hook-lying sit-up, Kendall et aI. 2 ̆ 7 s trunk-curled sit-up, and Kendall et al. 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>leg</b> lowering test.

40|$|According {{to legal}} principles, a driver who negligently breaks a {{pedestrian}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>leg</b> should {{pay the same}} damages as a doctor who negligently breaks a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>leg.</b> According to economic principles, however, the driver should pay more than the doctor. Non-negligent drivers impose risk on others without being liable for it. When liability externalities are mainly negative as with driving, liability should increase beyond full compensation to discourage the activity. Unlike pedestrians, patients contract with doctors for treatment and willingly submit {{to the risk of}} harm. Imperfections in medical markets cause some kinds of doctors to convey more positive than negative externalities on their patients. Increasing liability for these doctors would discourage an activity that needs encouragement. The argument for decreasing doctors 2 ̆ 7 liability is especially strong when doctors must choose among risky procedures, such as cesarean or vaginal delivery of a baby, which we call a 2 ̆ 2 mandatory choice 2 ̆ 2. Given equal benefits, the doctor ought to choose the least risky alternative. If the doctor negligently chooses a more risky alternative and harm materializes, courts award damages equal to the harm suffered by the patient. Even without the doctor 2 ̆ 7 s faulty choice, however, the patient would have been exposed to the least risky alternative. Economic efficiency requires reducing the doctor 2 ̆ 7 s liability below the victim 2 ̆ 7 s actual harm, which current legal rules usually prohibit. We propose that legislatures give courts the choice of lowering tort damages for doctors in well defined circumstances, and for their mandatory choices in particular, and we suggest some principles for doing so...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between unilateral squat strength and measures of static balance to compare balance performance between the dominant and non-dominant leg. Seventeen apparently healthy men (mean mass 90. 5 ± 20. 9 kg and age 21. 7 ± 1. 8 yrs) and 25 women (mean mass 62. 2 ± 14. 5 kg and age 21. 9 ± 1. 3 yrs) completed the study. Weight bearing unilateral strength was measured with a 1 RM modified unilateral squat on the dominant and non-dominant leg. The students completed the stork stand and wobble board tests to determine static balance on the dominant and non-dominant leg. Maximum time maintained in the stork stand position, on the ball of the foot with the uninvolved foot against the involved knee with hands on the hips, was recorded. Balance was measured with a 15 second wobble board test. No significant correlations were found between the measurements of unilateral balance and strength (r values ranged between - 0. 05 to 0. 2) for the men and women. Time off balance was not significantly different between the subjects' dominant (men 1. 1 ± 0. 4 s; women 0. 3 ± 0. 1 s) and non-dominant (men 0. 9 ± 0. 3 s; women 0. 3 ± 0. 1 <b>s)</b> <b>leg</b> for the wobble board.

Mycobacterium fortuitum, M. chelonae, M. marinum, and M. xenopi {{are some of}} the mycobacteria that infect amphibians, causing subcutaneous nodules, edema, and chronic wasting (1). The aquatic, pipid frog, Silurana tropicalis, is an emerging laboratory model for genetic and embryologic/ ontogenetic research. Although smaller than the related Xenopus laevis, S. tropicalis has research advantages: diploidy and brief maturation time make this species ideal for genetic analyses over multiple generations (2). In 2004, Trott et al. characterized a new mycobacterial pathogen in pipid frog colonies (3), now named M. liflandii (4). On Middlebrook 7 H 11 agar supplemented with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase, M. lifl andii form rough, nonpigmented, slightly buff-colored colonies. Visible colonies develop after 30 to 35 days at 28 °C on Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium (3).

Preincubation of plasma membranes from <b>frog</b> erythrocytes and <b>S</b> 49 cells with 20 mM-fluoride for 20 min at 30 degrees C strongly stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, the preactivated membranes were still able to bind beta-adrenergic agonist with high affinity, as determined by radioligand-binding techniques. Moreover, high-affinity agonist binding in fluoride-treated membranes was fully sensitive to guanine nucleotide, which decreased beta-adrenergic-receptor affinity for agonist. Very similar results were obtained for [3 H]prostaglandin E 1 binding to S 49 membranes pretreated with fluoride. Incubation of human platelet membranes with increasing concentrations of fluoride (1 - 50 mM) resulted in biphasic regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, with inhibition observed at concentrations greater than 10 mM. Preincubation of platelet membranes with 20 mM-fluoride did not affect agonist high-affinity binding to alpha 2 -adrenergic receptors, nor receptor regulation by guanine nucleotide.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether or not losses of strength or endurance following eccentric and concentric exercise are associated with reduced excitation. The effects of eccentric and concentric work on maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and surface electromyogram (EMG) of the quadriceps were studied in 10 healthy male subjects following bench-stepping for 20 min with a constant leading leg. Prior to stepping and at 0, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1, 3. 24 and 48 h afterwards the subjects performed a 30 <b>s</b> <b>leg</b> extension MVC with each leg during which the isometric force and the root mean square voltage of the EMG were recorded. In the eccentrically exercised muscles (ECC), MVC 0 - 3 (force during the first 3 s of contraction) fen immediately after the bench-stepping exercise to 88 +/- 2 % (mean SE) of the pre-exercise value and remained significantly lower than the concentrically exercised muscles (p < 0. 05). The muscle weakness in the ECC could not be attributed to central fatigue as surface EMG amplitude at MVC 0 - 3 increased during the recovery period. Muscle weakness after eccentric exercise appears to be due to contractile failure, which is not associated with a reduction in excitation as assessed by surface EMG. Muscular fatigue over 30 s did not change in the two muscle groups after exercise (p = 0. 79), indicating that the ECC were weaker but not more fatiguable after exercise...|$|R
40|$|To {{simulate}} a skiing using {{a pair of}} skis, {{it is necessary to}} estimate separately forces and moments acting to each ski from the skier separately from each other. One of the authors and his collaborator have proposed a numerical approach for the estimation. The approach requests a moment acting on a ski through a skier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> lower <b>leg</b> and ski boots. In the present study the moment has been discussed experimentally and a convenient formula has been proposed to estimate the acting moment not from the deformation of the ski boots but from the angle of a skier 2 ̆ 7 s lower le...|$|R

40|$|Premature newborns were {{observed}} longitudinally while undergoing heelsticks. Behavioral and cardiac measures were taken over 5 tests days. On Tests 1, 3, and 5, the phlebotomist {{picked up the}} baby 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>leg</b> and held it for 10 s and then proceeded to collect blood. This manipulation was geared towards observing whether, over days, babies learned that the pick-up of the leg was predictive of a painful event. Infants 2 ̆ 7 reactions were also observed during the invasive parts of the blood collection. It was hypothesized that if infants increased their reactivity to the leg pickup over days, it would suggest that this neutral event had acquired signal value for the subsequent painful stimulus. If infants 2 ̆ 7 response to the heelstick itself increased over days, this {{could be due to}} either maturation, sensitization and/or anticipation. However, if infants decreased their reactivity, it could be due to a specific learning mechanism, Stress-Induced-Analgesia. ^ Results or the leg pick-up yielded a marginally significant cardiac increase on the final test day, suggesting anticipation. Infants demonstrated reliable behavioral and cardiac reactions to the heelstick but no change was observed in reactivity over days. Behavioral pain reactions were positively related with gestational age at Test 1, 2, 4 and 5. A greater number of heelsticks was related to fewer facial reactions at Test 5. Further research {{needs to be done to}} specify the nature of anticipation and to separate the effects of gestational age and number of invasive procedures on facial reactivity. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a parallel robotic arm for deep-sea maintenance operations on oil and gas exploitation scaffoldings and piping, at 2000 ÷ 3000 m under sea-level. Resort to the innovative architecture looks to be a useful improvement as compared with traditional approaches, due to inherent capabilities in terms of stiffness, accuracy and effectiveness, which grant higher mission success with lower power consumption. The difficulties for theoretical analysis, which is main drawback of closed chains, can be faced by means of a highly concurrent design methodology, considering, with a single course, all related aspects, such as: workspace optimisation; cinematic, static and dynamic behaviour; task performance evaluation; structural checks; mission issues reliability; and the likes. The development has recently been tackled, when the results of several projects exploiting the features of parallel kinematics manipulators have been combined with the technical requirements that deep-sea maintenance faces for unmanned operation. A six-degrees of freedom arm, based on the Stewart platform architecture, is considered, with special focus on the functional and structural optimisation of the double spherical and universal joints and on the actuators design. By means of an associative solid modeller, a multi-body simulator and a FEM analyser, the equipment performance is investigated. The paper further summarises details on the conceptual design and on development steps; finally, virtual mock-up tests and life-cycle simulation checks assess the soundness of the proposed solution.
