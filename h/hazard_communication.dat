40|$|Abstract: In {{spite of}} the OSHA Laboratory and <b>Hazards</b> <b>Communication</b> Standards, {{incidents}} which result in injuries and property loss continue {{to occur in the}} research and teaching locations. Application of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) to laboratory pilot plant operations has the potential to further reduce risk associated with this location. However, a major challenge is unavailability of the easy and effective system to comply with PHA requirements. This study presents a system to manage the implementation of PHA in pilot plant namely Process Hazards Management for Lab Scale Pilot Plant (PHM-LabPP). It provides organized strategies to manage and track information, documents, recommendations and corrective actions related to the process hazards. Application of PHM-LabPP at High Gravitational Natural Gas pilot plant as a case study is examined and discussed. The implementation of this system could help end users to overcome inadequate of managing and controlling process hazards in pilot plant that had contributed to numbers of accidents...|$|R

When an officer anticipates rotation, reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower's repayment prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to officer reports. The threat of rotation improves communication because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an officer's career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor.

40|$|SUMMARY Differences in the {{delineation}} of Klebsiella spp. in the United Kingdom {{from that}} {{in the majority of}} other countries is discussed. An attempt is made to trace and interpret the reasons for these differences and suggestions are made for a rapid resolution of this problem which <b>hazards</b> <b>communication.</b> Cowan (1974), in a brief review of the taxonomy of the genus Klebsiella, recognised seven named species, viz, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, K. edwardsii, K. atlantae, K. pneumoniae (sensu stricto), K. ozaenae, and K. rhinoscleromatis. However, 0 rskov (1974), in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (8 th edition), described only three species including K. ozaenae, K. rhinoscleromatis, and K. pneumoniae (sensu lato) which embraced those species, K. aerogenes/oxytoca/edwardsii/atlantae, demonstrated by Bascomb et al. (1971) to form a single large cluster of wide spectrum. 0 rskov (1974) did not include K. pneumoniae (sensu stricto) which Bascomb et al. (1971) believed on traditional taxonomic grounds could be defined as a separate taxon. At present publications in many United Kingdom medically orientated journals tend to use the binomial K. pneumoniae (sensu stricto) to describe Friedlander's bacillus, and to refer separately to K. aerogenes, K. oxytoca, K. edwardsii, and K. atlantae which fall within the species K. pneumoniae (sensu lato) exclusively referred to in American and many Western European journals. Some British hospital scientists (Barr and Mahood, 1977) accept the close association of several Klebsiella species and refer to K. aerogenes/oxytoca/edwardsii/atlantae as an identi-fiable group which, on the basis of Bascomb's study (Bascomb et al., 1971), would be adequately de-scribed as K. aerogenes. This would result in the definition of two species, K. aerogenes and K. pneumoniae (sensu stricto), in United Kingdom clinical bacteriology literature, in conflict with a single species, K. pneumoniae (sensu lato), in othe...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{in water}} tends to travel {{much faster than}} in air. Cetaceans started to use the hearing system as a tool for their {{communication}} and so this system must have been adapted during the evolution. Every species form his specific sound repertoire which is used mainly for food finding, detection of predator or other <b>hazards,</b> <b>communication</b> and reproduction. Ocean ambient noise is created by natural sources of sound and man-made sounds (also called as anthropogenic sounds). Natural sounds are produced by marine organisms and processes like earthquakes, rainfall and so on. Anthropogenic sounds are made by man either intentionally or unintentionally and these sounds mostly disrupt the oceanic environment. Sound frequency and intensity level are the main factors when we determine the intensity of distortion in communication of Cetaceans. The most detrimental sounds are those with low frequency (from 10 to 500 Hz) and long-ranged propagation (hundreds of kilometers). Into this category we can include shipping and seismic surveys. In general, the most of anthropogenic sources of noise belong to this category. Other sources of anthropogenic noise are industrial activities, military sonar and acoustic deterrent and harassment devices (ADDs/AHDs). Responses of Cetaceans to anthropogenic noise {{can be divided into}} three categories: physiological, behavioral and acoustic. The physiological reaction can be increasing metabolism, increasing baseline concentration of glucocorticoids in the blood and ultimately reducing immunity. Behavioral responses include changes in heading patterns and swim speed, changes in diving and breathing. Also included are social activities like food finding or nursing. Every change in vocalization represents acoustic responses. With growing number of studies which prove a negative influence of anthropogenic noise on Cetaceans there is an increasing need to introduce effective measures which could reduce or limit this negative influence. For this purpose there are established marine protected areas and safety zones which avoid exposure to loud noise (circa 120 dB and more) thanks to their regulations. As well there was developed a technology to modify the ship equipment and the using of an air bubble curtain in the immediate area of the industrial activity shows efficiency in acoustic attenuation...|$|R

The angles of flexion and abduction of the arm were increased in 22.2 % and 36.1 % respectively but the classification of “conditionally acceptable” obtained without any intervention was preserved. For MLO position in the same postural alternative scenario, seating the radiographer, allowed a reduction of 100 % of head/neck angle, 80.6 % in the trunk angle, 56.8 % and 17.5 % in the angles of the arm during the flexion and abduction, respectively. These improvements in radiographers’ postural alternatives during mammography performance can reduce the risk of WRMSDs and for that reason should be implemented in a clinical context. Several authors [2, 4 – 6] showed in previous studies that the prevention should be prioritised, introducing changes that allow maintenance or even promotion of the workers’ health.

40|$|Wireless {{sensor network}} {{is widely used}} to monitor natural {{phenomena}} because natural disaster has globally increased which causes significant loss of life, economic setback, and social development. Saving energy in a wireless sensor network (WSN) is a critical factor to be considered. The sensor nodes are deployed to sense, compute, and communicate alerts in a WSN which are used to prevent natural <b>hazards.</b> Generally <b>communication</b> consumes more energy than sensing and computing; hence cluster based protocol is preferred. Even with clustering, multiclass traffic creates congested hotspots in the cluster, thereby causing packet loss and delay. In order to conserve energy and to avoid congestion during multiclass traffic a novel Priority Based Congestion Control Dynamic Clustering (PCCDC) protocol is developed. PCCDC is designed with mobile nodes which are organized dynamically into clusters to provide complete coverage and connectivity. PCCDC computes congestion at intra- and intercluster level using linear and binary feedback method. Each mobile node within the cluster has an appropriate queue model for scheduling prioritized packet during congestion without drop or delay. Simulation results have proven that packet drop, control overhead, and end-to-end delay are much lower in PCCDC which in turn significantly increases packet delivery ratio, network lifetime, and residual energy when compared with PASCC protocol...|$|R
