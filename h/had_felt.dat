5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, which could be used for revolution—he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

He said the band had approved {{a team to}} start filming later in 2011, and Baron Cohen's eagerness had been the key to progress. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen {{dropped out of the}} role due to creative differences with the members of Queen. May said they had parted on good terms and said that the band <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> Cohen's presence would have been distracting.|$|E

5|$|After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the {{outbreak}} of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a market gardener. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool. Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman {{at the end of}} the Australians' 1948 tour. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall. The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> unusually tired {{at the end}} of {{her second}} senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> {{that he should}} leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished {{to be free to}} accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of the}} 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{participated in}} the lengthy Palm Sunday {{ceremony}} in Vienna in 1490, although he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> so ill that morning {{that he could not}} eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not exclude the possibility of poisoning. Matthias's funeral was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July, Contador's agent {{announced}} that Contador had {{turned down an}} offer to remain with Astana under a new four-year contract because he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortable being caught between the Kazakhs {{on one side and}} Bruyneel on the other, and he was hoping to leave Astana before his contract expired in 2010. However, on 11 August, Contador's close friend Sergio Paulinho accepted a two-year contract with Team RadioShack, indicating that Contador {{might not be able to}} leave Astana as he and his agent wished. This was confirmed on 15 August, when a spokesperson for the Kazakh sponsors of Astana said that they intended to sponsor the Astana team on the UCI ProTour through 2013 and that they intended to enforce the last year of Contador's contract with Astana in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The commander, Bill Shepherd, was {{a former}} Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the {{beginning}} of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks. Questions had been raised by the Russian space agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience. Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on Mir, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice. He <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning. Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard Mir.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> the Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E
5|$|By 360, Gaul was {{sufficiently}} secure to permit Julian to despatch reinforcements of about 3,000 men under magister armorum Lupicinus to Britain, which {{had suffered a}} serious land and sea invasion by the Picts of Caledonia (Scotland) and the Scoti of Hibernia (Ireland). But at the same time, Julian received a demand from Constantius, who {{was unaware of the}} British expedition, that he send 4 auxilia palatina regiments plus select squadrons of cavalry (about 2,500 men) under Lupicinus to the East as reinforcements for the war against the Persians. This triggered a near-mutiny by Julian's soldiers, who again proclaimed him Augustus. He again refused, but this time, the troops insisted, making it clear they would mutiny if he refused and march against Constantius with or without him. Alarmed, but also secretly pleased, Julian accepted the title and wrote an apologetic letter to Constantius explaining why he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> it necessary to bow to his soldiers' wishes and requesting his ratification. But this was refused by Constantius, who replied demanding that Julian revert to Caesar status. Julian ignored the order, but to prove his good faith and also to keep his near-mutinous troops occupied, he crossed the Rhine and attacked the Attuarii tribe of the Frankish confederation.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a premium on signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had not learned his plays.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E
5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the visual quality of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E
