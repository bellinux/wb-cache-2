5|$|After his cricket career ended, Halcombe had a {{successful}} career as a sports broadcaster. In 1947 he was appointed as the sports supervisor for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Perth. He was Western Australia's first full-time sports broadcaster, a state that he filled {{until his retirement in}} 1968. Halcombe won a strong personal following for his flamboyant description of cricket and Australian rules football matches. Halcombe also conducted regular segments on his Saturday sports programs such as Strange but True and People <b>I</b> <b>Met</b> <b>This</b> Week. Halcombe developed a reputation as a raconteur and had a habit of rummaging through old newspapers in search of sporting items. Halcombe travelled widely throughout the state to interview notable sports personalities and presented his broadcasts in a distinctive humorous style. He was particularly remembered for his commentary partnerships with Johnnie Moyes and Englishman Arthur Gilligan during English tours to Australia.|$|E

6000|$|... "Simply this," [...] {{answered}} Richard. [...] "That I knew of {{what had}} happened in New York, and when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him <b>this</b> morning <b>I</b> cowhided him. Ugh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said John. [...] "Why aren't {{you on the}} News any more? Nobody {{seemed to}} know where you were, till <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Faraday <b>this</b> morning, who told me you were here." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{ten years}} are nearly passed, and I {{am on the}} road to find her. As in passing <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> {{merchant}} and the old man with the hind, I stayed with them.|$|E
6000|$|It was doubtless {{because my}} friend irritated me {{more and more}} that <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> with a {{sharpness}} possibly excessive. [...] "She's perfectly natural. What I saw was a test. And so is he." ...|$|E
60|$|Watch. An please your worship, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> {{couple in}} the street late, and so, seeing them {{to be a man}} and woman, I brought them along with me, upon {{suspicion}} of felony together.|$|E
6000|$|... "That being so," [...] Francis continued, [...] "I {{am going}} to make a {{proposition}} to you for what it is worth. Where were you going when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you <b>this</b> morning, Shopland?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{have had}} it before. Besides, I've often been as wet; so have you. Anyhow, the pain's going, and there's a thing I forgot to mention. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Wilkinson <b>this</b> afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob," [...] he said, with irresistible gravity, [...] "I did {{not know}} when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you <b>this</b> morning that I had the honor of {{addressing}} a poet--none other than the famous author of 'Underbrush.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Town-End, 1800. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> woman {{near the}} Wishing-Gate, on the high-road that then led from Grasmere to Ambleside. Her {{appearance}} was exactly as here described, and such was her account, {{nearly to the}} letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{two hours}} ago <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> yer Leftenant Calvert," [...] he went on with {{increasing}} awkwardness, [...] "and--oh, I say, Mag--he said he saw you, and hoped he hadn't troubled ye, and--and--ye saw him, didn't ye?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will think}} me {{looking for another}} Sepoy likeness," [...] said the Colonel, [...] "but I am sure <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>this</b> young lady or her twin sister somewhere in my travels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will look}} after it for you," [...] I said. [...] "You can {{leave it in}} my hands. It is rather an odd thing, but I believe that <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>this</b> man in Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is {{become of}} your friend Tregarva? <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him <b>this</b> morning after he parted from you, {{and had some}} talk with him. I was sorely minded to enlist him. Perhaps I shall; in the meantime, I shall busy myself with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{apparently}} {{gave some}} hope to Babington, for he answered--"Yes, I protest that, before <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> Ballard, I never meant nor intended for {{to kill the}} Queen; but by his persuasions I was induced {{to believe that she}} being excommunicate it was lawful to murder her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to say truth, I {{was equally}} unfortunate until <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> luckless goose, and fired the shot {{that brought him}} down and brought you up. But I've had enough o' this now, and shall back to the fort again. What say you? Will you go in my canoe or walk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{they were}} about to start on their homeward trail, Serviss sought {{opportunity}} to say: [...] "Mr. Lambert, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> man Clarke at your house last night, and I want to say that I don't think his influence on your family is particularly wholesome. He's morbid and given to fads." ...|$|E
60|$|When Clarkson {{first came}} here to prosecute his {{inquiries}} into the subject, a mob collected around him, and endeavored to throw him off the dock into the water; he was rescued by a gentleman, some of whose descendants <b>I</b> <b>met</b> on <b>this</b> occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite needless, Lepel. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> {{your doctor}} <b>this</b> morning. I {{know that a}} council of {{physicians}} decided you would die before the year was out." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} a good deal worried to-day about the {{question}} of what luggage to take with me. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> a man <b>this</b> morning, and he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even now, Sir John, as I rode my mule up {{the road}} <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> man {{speeding}} toward his home. A woman rode by his side, and though her face was hooded I heard her laugh as she passed me. That laugh I have heard before, and it was under this very roof, from the lips of Mistress Edith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{suppose you}} are {{surprised}} {{to meet me}} here,' said the toll-gate woman, 'but {{this is the way}} of it: a neighbor and his wife came along soon after you left, and offered to bring me to Thompsontown; and of course I jumped at the chance, and left the toll-gate in charge of my brother, who lives hard by. And in the town, at the house of a friend, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> young lady, and--' glancing at her companion, she added: 'I really did not catch the name.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> same Bambino, in {{the street}} a short time afterwards, going, in great state, {{to the house of}} some sick person. It is taken to all parts of Rome for this purpose, constantly; but, I {{understand}} that it is not always as successful as could be wished; for, making its appearance at the bedside of weak and nervous people in extremity, accompanied by a numerous escort, it not unfrequently frightens them to death. It is most popular in cases of child-birth, where it has done such wonders, that if a lady be longer than usual in getting through her difficulties, a messenger is despatched, with all speed, to solicit the immediate attendance of the Bambino. It is a very valuable property, and much confided in--especially by the religious body to whom it belongs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope,' said Joe {{after some}} hesitation, 'that you won't {{tell this story}} against me--this of my having been beat like the boy they'd make of me--at all events, till <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>this</b> man again and settled the account. It'll be a better story then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ** <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with <b>this</b> idea {{in an old}} English tale, which I am [...] now {{unable to}} obtain and quote from memory:--"The verie [...] essence and, as it were, springe-heade, and origine of all [...] musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the trees of [...] the forest do make when they growe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A friend," [...] said Sybil, {{dropping}} {{her arms and}} bending her head in woe; [...] "a kind good friend. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him but <b>this</b> morn, and he warned me of all this." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> attorney, {{and gave}} him all the {{particulars}} at large, as they are recited above; and he assured {{me it was a}} case, as he said, that would very well support itself, and that he did not question but that a jury would give very considerable damages on such an occasion; so taking his full instructions he began the prosecution, and the mercer being arrested, gave bail. A few days after his giving bail, he comes with his attorney to my attorney, to let him know that he desired to accommodate the matter; that it was all carried on in the heat of an unhappy passion; that his client, meaning me, had a sharp provoking tongue, that I used them ill, gibing at them, and jeering them, even while they believed me to be the very person, and that I had provoked them, and the like.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll have to, of course, if I do that. You see, it {{happened}} this way: Every feller <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> mornin' {{told me what}} Skip had threatened to do, an' I reckon he means business. He says we've both got to leave this town before he goes to work ag'in, an' what's more, he an' Sid Barker wouldn't let me stay 'round Printin' House Square at all. I {{had to take a}} sneak, or else stand the chance of gettin' 'rested for fightin', so I went down to Vesey Street Market. Trade wasn't so awful good there, an' I was kind er loafin' 'round when a farmer come up an' says, 'Hello, son. Don't know of any boy 'round here what wants {{to go out in the}} country, do you?' Well, you know, that struck me jest right. I said of course I knew a boy, an' I showed him right up, 'cause it was me, an' I hadn't far to go to find myself. Well, the farmer acted as if he was tickled 'most to death, an' he said as how I was the very kind of a feller he was lookin' for; that he'd give me a good home an' make it cheerful; besides, I'd have lots of fun runnin' in the fields." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Was I? Then {{that was}} chiefly the reason. Well, I decided to think {{no more of}} her, and I was helped {{to do it by}} the {{troubles}} that came upon us shortly afterwards; it is a blessed arrangement that one does not feel a sentimental grief at all when additional grief comes in the shape of practical misfortune. However, on the first afternoon of the little holiday I took for my walking tour last summer, I came to Anglebury, and stayed about the neighbourhood {{for a day or two}} to see what it was like, thinking we might settle there if this place failed us. The next evening I left, and walked across the heath to Flychett--that's a village about five miles further on--so as to be that distance on my way for next morning; and while I was crossing the heath there <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>this</b> very woman. We talked a little, because we couldn't help it--you may imagine the kind of talk it was--and parted as coolly as we had met. Now this strange book comes to me; and I have a strong conviction that she is the writer of it, for that poem sketches a similar scene--or rather suggests it; and the tone generally seems the kind of thing she would write--not that she was a sad woman, either.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that it's not enough," [...] he said; [...] "for {{of all the}} {{poisonous}} places <b>I</b> ever <b>met</b> <b>this</b> is the worst. I wish whoever built it had thought {{to put in a}} few windows. His idea of ventilation was apparently to leave a hole {{about the size of a}} lima bean and let the thing go at that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly; I am made like {{everyone}} I {{have ever seen}} until <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you and <b>this</b> little boy. It strikes me you {{are the ones who}} are queerly made. You don't seem to be candy at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, what a battery!' exclaimed Alfred, {{stopping}} short, 'and one - two - three - all foreboders of no good, in {{the great}} sea before me. I am glad {{you are not the}} first <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>this</b> morning: <b>I</b> should have taken it for a bad omen. But, Grace was the first - sweet, pleasant Grace - so I defy you all!' ...|$|R
