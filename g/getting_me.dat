500|$|During later {{interviews}} {{he spoke}} about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. [...] "The Actors Studio {{meant so much to}} me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> to quit all those jobs and just stay acting." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{following}} her starring {{roles in the}} 1996 dramas Fear and Freeway, Witherspoon found herself in an unexpected career slump that led her towards a change in direction. [...] "All my serious dramatic performances suddenly weren't <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> the jobs or opportunities that I really wanted," [...] {{she said in a}} 2005 interview. [...] "I have stacks and stacks of letters from great directors saying I can't cast you because you don't mean anything to the studios. That's why I turned the boat toward comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{believed}} in empowering children by {{practices such as}} greeting their audience members with [...] "Hello, everyone", instead of [...] "Hello, boys and girls" [...] because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting [...] "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit". [...] When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.|$|E

500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E

2500|$|Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led {{the team}} to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia's ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media {{questioning}} over his playing future. Waugh's reply was, [...] "We've just beaten the next {{best team in the}} world 5–1, and all {{you want to talk about}} is <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> out of the team." ...|$|E

Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading {{him out of his}} native land: [...] "Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> out (dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (en bibliois) I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} former Károlyi gymnasts, both {{supporters}} and detractors, have acknowledged {{that some of}} the allegations about Károlyi were true, but have also claimed that the ends — medals — justified the means. In Joan Ryan's Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, 1992 Olympian Betty Okino said: [...] "What Béla did worked. He motivated me by <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> mad." [...] Some have claimed that Károlyi stopped treating gymnasts harshly when parents directly requested that he do so. In a column she wrote rebutting many of the claims of Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, Okino wrote: [...] "Károlyi structured his training in a way that built your physical and mental strength to such a remarkable level that even he couldn't tear you down. Béla wanted to know that when push came to shove, his athletes could handle any situation thrown at them." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, {{swinging}} conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourate deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; [...] "I remember him <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> out in the 1958–59 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which I drove hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before I spotted it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not seem to notice the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal". Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for 1 off Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.|$|E
