50|$|One of {{the leading}} groups in academy for {{creating}} ion-trap MMS is Prof. Graham Cooks with his associate Professor Zheng Ouyang at Purdue University. They have built a series of mini mass spectrometer based on quadrupole ion trap called Mini 10, Mini 11, Mini 12. The group used Mini 10 mass spectrometer weighing 10 kg to analyze proteins, peptides and alkaloids in complex plant materials with electrospray ionization ESI. The group used low radio frequency of resonant ion ejection to increase mass range up to 17,000 Da proteins. For interfacing ESI source with MMS, a 10 cm stainless steel capillary was fabricated to transfer the ions directly into the vacuum manifold. The resulting high pressure of 20 mTorr, which is several orders of magnitude higher than that used in lab-scale mass spectrometers is compensated by using the pressure-tolerant rectilinear ion trap (RIT). One of the key component of this MMS is the commercial turbo-bump and the MS can be operated at 10−3 torr. To overcome the problem of continuous sample introduction {{because of the small}} size of the pump, the group developed a technique called discontinuous atmospheric pressure introduction (DAPI). This technique performs <b>direct</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> without sample pretreatment and enables the coupling of miniature mass spectrometers to atmospheric pressure ionization sources, including ESI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and various ambient ionization sources. The ions are transferred from ionization source and hold at a punch-valve and injected to MS periodically.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that extended photoperiod accelerates pubescence in dairy heifers thereby limiting time for mammary development, which could be detrimental to future milk yield. We hypothesized that the potential negative effects of rapid growth and puberty through long-day photoperiod (LDPP) exposure could be overcome with a greater supply of metabolizable protein in dairy heifers fed rumen-undegradable protein (RUP). In an initial slaughter study, we compared deuterium oxide (D 2 O) and <b>direct</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> to assess body composition at 5 and 7 mo of age in heifers (n = 20) exposed to LDPP or short-day photoperiod (SDPP). Before slaughter, D 2 O dilution was used to estimate body composition and results were compared with actual values determined by <b>direct</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> of body tissue. In 5 -mo-old heifers, the correlations between estimates of body protein, water, and mineral contents as determined by D 2 O dilution and <b>direct</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> of body tissue were 0. 86, 0. 85, and 0. 76, respectively; however, fat content values were not correlated (r = - 0. 068). In 7 -mo-old heifers, we were unable to accurately estimate body composition using the D 2 O dilution method. A second study was conducted to determine if LDPP, which has previously been shown to hasten puberty, could be combined with RUP to promote lean growth without limiting body stature in prepubertal heifers. Thirty-two weaned heifers (86 +/- 2 d old; 106. 2 +/- 17. 3 kg of body weight) were assigned to LDPP or SDPP and RUP or control diet in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement until the onset of puberty. Relative to SDPP, LDPP increased prolactin secretion and promoted lean growth. Exposure to LDPP also enhanced body weight, withers height, and heart girth. Furthermore, RUP supplementation increased withers height and heart girth. There was a significant interaction between LDPP and RUP for hip height. Moreover, LDPP hastened the onset of puberty. In summary, D 2 O was a feasible method to estimate lean composition in heifers at younger ages; however, it failed to accurately estimate body composition in heifers around puberty.

For instance, heterogeneous catalysis may be used to produce methanol by CO 2 hydrogenation. To improve the efficiency of respective catalysts, a sound understanding of the reaction processes at the molecular level is required. This paper reports the study of CO 2 adsorption as well as CO 2 +H 2 reaction on nanosized rhodium field emitter crystals. The systems have been studied using field emission techniques. Rhodium samples are characterized by FIM, whereas CO 2 adsorption and dissociation are followed by FEM. Modifications of the local surface composition are translated to variations of brightness through the work function and eventually brightness analysis is used to monitor the reaction during the ongoing process. The introduction of pure CO 2 during imaging causes a brightness decrease due to dissociative adsorption of CO 2 (g). Upon increase the hydrogen pressure, reactive phenomena are observed from 650 K to 700 K, as indicated by increasing brightness.

In the study area, four trenches were constructed with a total volume of about 25, 000 m(3). They were almost totally filled with re-refined lubricating oil waste for approximately 25 years. No protection liners were used in the bottoms and laterals of the disposal trenches. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the potential of the resistivity and ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods in characterizing the contamination of this lubricant oil waste disposal area in Ribeiro Preto, SP, situated on the geological domain of the basalt spills of the Serra Geral Formation and the sandstones of the Botucatu Formation. Geophysical results were shown in 2 D profiles. The geophysical methods used enabled the identification of geophysical anomalies, which characterized the contamination produced by the trenches filled with lubricant oil waste. Conductive anomalies (smaller than 185 Omega m) immediately below the trenches suggest the action of bacteria in the hydrocarbons, as has been observed in several sites contaminated by hydrocarbons in previously reported cases in the literature.
