5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors <b>enalapril</b> and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E

25|$|Frequently {{prescribed}} ACE inhibitors include benazepril, zofenopril, perindopril, trandolapril, captopril, <b>enalapril,</b> lisinopril, and ramipril.|$|E
25|$|Other {{ineffective}} treatments include leukocyte elastase protease inhibitors, the EIPH Patch, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, pentoxyfylline, guanabenz, clonidine, snake venom, and <b>enalapril.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ACE {{inhibitor}} <b>enalapril</b> {{has also}} been shown to reduce cardiac cachexia in patients with chronic heart failure. Cachexia is a poor prognostic sign in patients with chronic heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Captopril was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, <b>enalapril,</b> was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{may also}} be used to help {{decrease}} excessive water consumption in people with schizophrenia resulting in psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, <b>enalapril</b> lead to decreased consumption (determined by urine output and osmality) in 60% of people; the same effect has been demonstrated in other ACE inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effect}} and {{pharmacokinetic}} limitations of captopril stimulated {{the development of}} <b>enalapril</b> and subsequent ACE inhibitors. These were specifically designed to lack the sulfhydryl moiety believed {{to be responsible for}} rash and taste disturbance. Most subsequent ACE inhibitors are given as prodrugs, to improve oral bioavailability. All have longer half-lives and are given once or twice daily, which may improve patient compliance.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms and Treatment: There are few {{reports of}} ACE {{inhibitor}} overdose in the literature. The most likely manifestations are hypotension, {{which may be}} severe, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and renal impairment with metabolic acidosis. Treatment should be mainly symptomatic and supportive, with volume expansion using normal saline to correct hypotension and improve renal function, and gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal and a cathartic to prevent further absorption of the drug. Captopril, <b>enalapril,</b> lisinopril and perindopril {{are known to be}} removable by hemodialysis.|$|E
25|$|Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) {{also known}} as neprilysin is the enzyme that metabolizes natriuretic peptides. Several inhibitors of NEP are {{currently}} being developed to treat disorders ranging from hypertension to heart failure. Most of them are dual inhibitors (NEP and ACE). In 2014, PARADIGM-HF study was published in NEJM. This study considered as a landmark study in treatment of heart failure. The study was double blinded; compared LCZ696 versus <b>enalapril</b> in patients with heart failure. The study showed lower all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in LCZ696 arm.|$|E
25|$|NOS3 {{variants}} {{may also}} affect {{the responses to}} drugs that affect NO signaling, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (PDE5i). Statin treatment was more effective in increasing NO bioavailability in subjects carrying the CC genotype for the g.-786T>C polymorphism than in TT carriers. Hypertensive patients carrying the TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better antihypertensive responses to ACEi <b>enalapril.</b> Likewise, patients with erectile dysfunction carrying the C allele for g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better responses to PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil. Together, these studies suggest that statins, ACEi and PDE-5 inhibitors may restore an impaired NO production in subjects carrying the variant allele/genotype for g.-786T>C NOS3 polymorphism, thus attenuating the cardiovascular risk. In addition to analysis of genetic polymorphisms individually, haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 were showen to affect the responses to sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Enalapril</b> is {{pregnancy}} category D. Some {{evidence suggests}} {{it will cause}} injury and death to a developing fetus. Patients are advised not to become pregnant while taking <b>enalapril</b> and to notify their doctors immediately if they become pregnant. In pregnancy, <b>enalapril</b> may result in damage to the fetus’s kidneys and resulting oligohydramnios (not enough amniotic fluid). <b>Enalapril</b> is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Enalapril</b> is used {{to treat}} hypertension, {{symptomatic}} heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It has been proven to protect {{the function of the}} kidneys in hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes, and may be used in the absence of hypertension for its kidney protective effects. It is widely used in chronic kidney failure. Furthermore, <b>enalapril</b> is an emerging treatment for psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, <b>enalapril</b> lead to decreased water consumption (determined by urine output and osmality) in 60% of patients.|$|E
50|$|The PARADIGM-HF trial (in which Milton Packer {{was one of}} the {{principal}} investigators) compared treatment with sacubitril/valsartan to treatment with <b>enalapril.</b> People with heart failure and reduced LVEF (10,513) were sequentially treated on a short-term basis with <b>enalapril</b> and then with sacubitril/valsartan. Those that were able to tolerate both regimens (8442, 80%) were randomly assigned to long-term treatment with either <b>enalapril</b> or sacubitril/valsartan. Participants were mainly white (66%), male (78%), middle aged (median 63.8 +/- 11 years) with NYHA stage II (71.6%) or stage III (23.1%) heart failure.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{side effects of}} <b>enalapril</b> include {{increased}} serum creatinine (20%), dizziness (2-8%), low blood pressure (1-7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1-2%). The most serious common adverse event is angioedema (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient’s airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with <b>enalapril</b> but is most common {{after the first few}} doses. Angioedema and fatality therefrom is reportedly higher among black people.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonists, eprosartan is generally better tolerated than <b>enalapril</b> (an ACE inhibitor), {{especially among the}} elderly.|$|E
