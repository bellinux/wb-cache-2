500|$|The {{device was}} {{released}} to mostly positive reception; the G2 was universally praised for LG's efforts {{to produce a}} more seamless and compact design, its high performance, {{the quality of its}} display and camera, along with its long-lasting battery. Critics were divided on certain aspects of its design, such as its rear button layout, and its plastic chassisâ€”which was panned for closely resembling recent Samsung Galaxy products and being a regression from the glass-based chassis of the Optimus G. Similarly, while its software and user interface was praised for its usability and large number of customization options, some reviewers felt that the software suffered from <b>feature</b> <b>creep</b> and contained notable usability regressions in comparison to [...] "stock" [...] Android.|$|E
500|$|LG's Android {{interface}} design received mixed reviews; TechRadar gave it {{a positive}} review, describing it as being [...] "easy enough for novice and expert smartphone users alike", and noting its dynamic elements and customization features. [...] Its increased customization abilities (including different lock screen and home screen animations, {{and the ability to}} change the background and layout of the on-screen navigation buttons) was noted by reviewers. The usefulness of the [...] "Slide Aside" [...] feature was questioned due to the availability of other, more efficient means to switch apps. LG's software was generally panned for being unpolished in places, suffering from <b>feature</b> <b>creep,</b> and containing too many unneeded visual effects and skeuomorphic elements (the latter having generally fallen out of favor). The G2's software was also panned for containing usability digressions in comparison to stock Android, such as the notification tray being taken up by options, not using Android 4.2's updated [...] "Complete action using" [...] menu and behavior, and, despite using on-screen buttons, continued use of the [...] "Menu" [...] key which was officially deprecated by Google in its Android human interface guidelines for Android 4.x (on apps which comply with the HIG, overflow menus are intended to be displayed within the apps themselves. The device's Menu key is replaced by a [...] "Recent apps" [...] key, and a small [...] "Menu" [...] key appears to the side when needed). The Nexus 5 was released by LG shortly afterwards and shares much of the G2's hardware albeit with a lower-quality rear camera and smaller battery to hit a lower price point; the Nexus 5 has been touted as a clean Android software alternative with the added advantage of running the latest Android 4.4 [...] "KitKat" [...] while the G2 had to make do with a bloatware-filled Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] for a time.|$|E

40|$|Procedures are {{presented}} for characterizing an alloy and predicting cyclic life for isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue conditions {{by using the}} total strain version of strainrange partitioning (TS-SRP). Numerical examples are given. Two independent alloy characteristics are deemed important: failure behavior, as reflected by the inelastic strainrange versus cyclic life relations; and flow behavior, {{as indicated by the}} cyclic stress-strain-time response (i. e., the constitutive behavior). Failure behavior is characterized by conducting creep-fatigue tests in the strain regime, wherein the testing times are reasonably short and the inelastic strains are large enough to be determined accurately. At large strainranges, stress-hold, strain-limited tests are preferred because a high rate of creep damage per cycle is inherent in this type of test. At small strainranges, strain-hold cycles are more appropriate. Flow behavior is characterized by conducting tests wherein the specimen is usually cycled far short of failure and the wave shape is appropriate for the duty cycle of interest. In characterizing an alloy pure fatigue, or PP, failure tests are conducted first. Then depending on the needs of the analyst a series of creep-fatigue tests are conducted. As many of the three generic SRP cycles are featured as are required to characterize the influence of creep on fatigue life (i. e., CP, PC, and CC cycles, respectively, for tensile creep only, compressive creep only, and both tensile and compressive creep). Any mean stress effects on life also must be determined and accounted for when determining the SRP inelastic strainrange versus life relations for cycles <b>featuring</b> <b>creep.</b> This is particularly true for small strainranges. The life relations thus are established for a theoretical zero mean stress condition...|$|R

40|$|A new {{numerical}} {{method is}} proposed to simulate intergranular creep fracture in large polycrystalline aggregates. The method utilizes so-called grain elements {{to represent the}} polycrystal. These grain elements {{take care of the}} average elastic and creep deformation of individual grains. Grain boundary processes, like cavitation and sliding, are accounted for by grain boundary elements connecting the grains. Results are compared with full-field finite element calculations. The method is demonstrated to capture the essential <b>features</b> of <b>creep</b> fracture, like creep constrained cavitation and the interlinkage of microcracks. Also the performance in polycrystals with random variations in microstructure, in terms of grain shape, is shown to be reasonably well. For the size of the unit-cell considered, a factor of around 600 is gained in computer time as compared with the full-field calculations. ...|$|R

30|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the <b>feature</b> that <b>creep</b> around an asperity {{is necessary for the}} recurrent rupture of the same small asperity (small repeating earthquakes), we have estimated the spatio-temporal distribution of quasistatic slip (creep) around the 2005 Miyagi-oki earthquake (M= 7.2) using the distribution of small repeating earthquakes. The creep was detected mainly outside of the coseismic slip areas for the 2005 Miyagi-oki, 1978 Miyagi-oki (M= 7.6) and 2003 Fukushima-oki (M= 6.8) earthquakes. The creep rates estimated from the recurrence intervals and slip amounts of small repeating earthquakes for 21 years were almost constant for the areas near the western limit of the interplate earthquakes but they varied temporally in the areas nearer to the Japan trench. The changes in the creep rates before and after the 2005 Miyagi-oki earthquake were not significant with the exception of small slip accelerations in some areas near the Japan trench. These results suggest that the plate boundary around the source area for the 2005 earthquake is still mostly locked.|$|R
