40|$|The {{concept of}} {{fairness}} is being discussed {{related to the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> power among different actors <b>of</b> <b>voting.</b> We are using the following, intuitively natural principle of fairness: each unit of resources (shares, seats) should yield the same voting power (influence). Voting power is not directly observable: {{as a proxy for}} it voting weights are used. Therefore, fairness is usually defined in terms <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> weights (e. g. voting weights are proportional to the results of an election).

50|$|The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> is {{not even}} across {{different}} polling stations, and also varies {{at different times of}} day. As a result, a single exit poll may give an imperfect picture of the national vote. Instead, the exit poll is primarily used to calculate swing and turnout. Pollsters return to the same polling stations at the same times at each election, and by comparing the results with previous exit polls they can calculate how the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> has changed in that constituency. This swing is then applied to other similar constituencies, allowing an estimate of how national voting patterns have changed. The polling locations are chosen to cover the entire gamut of society and where possible, to include especially critical marginal seats. Data is presented in one of three ways, either as a table, graph or written interpretation.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} reform <b>of</b> the <b>voting</b> rules {{at the heart}} of the {{governance}} of the IMF and World Bank (the BWIs) in terms of three principles that we suggest ought to be fundamental: simplicity, transparency and democratic legitimacy. By simplicity we mean that the rules should make sense in terms of the purposes of the BWI and be easy to understand. By transparency we mean that the rules mean what they appear to mean in the sense of leading to the same <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> power as the institution's designers intended. We show using voting power analysis that the inequality in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> power among countries is greater than that <b>of</b> their <b>voting</b> weight. By democratic legitimacy, we consider whether we can reconcile weighted voting with democracy. Our conclusion is that the voting rules as they currently exist are far from satisfying any of these criteria and that recent reform proposals do not lead us to change this conclusion. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of various values of the quota of QMV in an enlarged, 27 -member Council of Ministers of the EU.

This enables us to examine the effect of q (with an equitable <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> power) on various quantities, including: the <b>voting</b> power <b>of</b> each member; the blocking power (Coleman’s ‘power to prevent action’) of each member; the sensitivity of the decision rule; Coleman’s parameter A (‘ability of the collectivity to act’); the mean majority deficit.

40|$|Abstract The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> decisional power among {{member states}} of the EU has {{remained}} a hot issue in recent discussions about the future design of European Union decision making and the Lisbon revision of the unsuccessful proposal of the Constitutional Treaty. Usually only the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> weights in the Council of Ministers under the qualified majority vot-ing rule is taken into account. In contrast, {{in this paper we}} formulate simplified models of the consultation and co-decision procedures in the decision making of European Union institutions, reflecting the fact that together with the Council of Ministers the Commission and European Parliament are also important actors in EU decision making. The main conclusion of this paper is that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> power in the Council <b>of</b> Ministers <b>voting</b> provides incomplete evidence about national influences in European Union decision making. With rare exceptions decision making is based on the consultation and co-decision procedures involving the Commis-sion and/or European Parliament. Legislative procedures change the inter-institutional distribu-tion of power (among the Council, Commission and European Parliament) reducing the power of the Council {{and at the same time}} they change intra-institutional power in the Council (the relative power of the Member States compared to the Council voting without taking into account the Commission and Parliament) ...|$|R
