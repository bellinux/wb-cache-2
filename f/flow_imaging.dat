25|$|Technetium {{exits the}} {{generator}} {{in the form}} of the pertechnetate ion, TcO4−. The oxidation state of Tc in this compound is +7. This is directly suitable for medical applications only in bone scans (it is taken up by osteoblasts) and some thyroid scans (it is taken up in place of iodine by normal thyroid tissues). In other types of scans relying on Tc-99m, a reducing agent is added to the pertechnetate solution to bring the oxidation state of the Tc down to +3 or +4. Secondly, a ligand is added to form a coordination complex. The ligand is chosen to have an affinity for the specific organ to be targeted. For example, the exametazime complex of Tc in oxidation state +3 is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and flow through the vessels in the brain for cerebral blood <b>flow</b> <b>imaging.</b> Other ligands include sestamibi for myocardial perfusion imaging and mercapto acetyl triglycine for MAG3 scan to measure renal function.|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the role of clinical examination, angiography, color <b>flow</b> Doppler <b>imaging,</b> and other diag-nostic tests in identifying injuries to the vascular or aerodigestive structures in patients with penetrating injuries to the neck. A prospective study was made of patients with penetrating neck injuries. All patients had a careful physical examination according to a written protocol. Stable patients underwent routine four-vessel angiography and color <b>flow</b> Dopp-ler <b>imaging.</b> Esophagography and endoscopy were performed for proxim-ity injuries. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of physical examination, color flow Doppler studies, and other diagnostic tests were assessed during the evaluation of vascular and aerodigestive tract struc-tures in the neck. Altogether 223 patients were entered in the study. After physical examination 176 patients underwent angiography and 99 of them underwent color <b>flow</b> Doppler <b>imaging.</b> Angiographic abnormalities were seen in 34 patients for an incidence of 19. 3 %, but only 14 (8. 0 %) require...|$|R

Automated interpretation of <b>flow</b> doppler <b>imaging</b> has so far been restricted to obtaining hemodynamic information from velocity-time profiles depicted in these images. In this paper we exploit the shape patterns in Doppler images to infer the similarity in valvular disease labels for purposes of automated clinical decision support. Specifically, we model the similarity in appearance of Doppler images from the same disease class as a constrained non-rigid translation transform of the velocity envelopes embedded in these images. The shape similarity between two Doppler images is then judged by recovering the alignment transform using a variant of dynamic shape warping. Results of similarity retrieval of doppler images for cardiac decision support on a large database of images are presented...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{shape is}} {{emerging}} as a key design parameter for tailoring the interactions between particles and cells. Herein, we report the preparation of rod-shaped layer-by-layer (LbL) -assembled polymer hydrogel capsules with tunable aspect ratios (ARs). By templating spherical and rodlike silica particles, disulfide-stabilized poly(methacrylic acid) hydrogel capsules (PMA HCs) with different ARs (from 1 to 4) are generated. The influence of capsule AR on cellular internalization and intracellular fate was quantitatively investigated by <b>flow</b> cytometry, <b>imaging</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry, and fluorescence deconvolution microscopy. These experiments reveal that the cellular internalization kinetics of PMA HCs are dependent on the AR, with spherical capsules being internalized more rapidly and {{to a greater extent}} compared with rod-shaped capsules.

50|$|In {{off-axis}} configuration, holographic interferometry {{is sensitive}} enough to enable wide-field, laser Doppler imaging of optical fluctuations in amplitude and phase, either {{with a slow}} or a fast camera. A slow (e.g. video rate) camera will record time-averaged holographic interferograms which will result in lowpass filtering of the optical fluctuation signal. By shifting {{the frequency of the}} reference beam, the lowpass filter becomes a bandpass filter centered at the detuning frequency, and selective narrowband detection and imaging can be performed. This method permits microvascular blood <b>flow</b> <b>imaging,</b> and wide-field measurement of photoplethysmograms by detection of out-of-plane tissue motion. The wide temporal bandwidth of a high throughput camera can enable wideband detection and analysis of optical fluctuations. It can be used for pulsatile blood <b>flow</b> <b>imaging.</b>|$|E

The proteasomal pathway is responsible for degradation of proteins, whereas autophagy can degrade cytoplasmic material in bulk, including whole organelles such as mitochondria (mitophagy), bacteria (xenophagy), or lipids (lipophagy). Although signs of autophagy can be present during cell death, it remains controversial whether autophagy can execute cell death in vivo.

40|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>imaging</b> is an {{important}} technique {{in a range of}} disease areas, but estimating low flow speeds, especially near the walls of blood vessels, remains challenging. Pulsed photoacoustic <b>flow</b> <b>imaging</b> can be an alternative since there is little signal contamination from background tissue with photoacoustic imaging. We propose <b>flow</b> <b>imaging</b> using a clinical photoacoustic system that is both handheld and portable.

Thirty-nine patients were investigated. Based on clinical findings, 36 of 39 patients had normal prosthetic valve function. Seventeen patients were interrogated {{within a few days}} after surgery. Systolic regurgitant jets in the left atrium were absent in all patients by both transthoracic pulsed and color Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>imaging.</b> Using transthoracic continuous wave Doppler, however, jets were demonstrated in 8 of 39 patients (21 %). Transesophageal color Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>imaging</b> demonstrated systolic regurgitant jets originating from the prosthesis in all patients.

Thus, transthoracic color Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>imaging</b> is not sensitive for detecting regurgitant jets in mechanical prostheses in the mitral valve.
