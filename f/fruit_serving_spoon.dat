40|$|Abstract Background: This study {{evaluated}} {{an environmental}} intervention intended to increase {{consumption of the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>serving</b> among elementary school children participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). Methods: Children's fruit consumption was measured in two schools by observation. In the intervention school, cafeteria workers provided the verbal prompt, "Would you like fruit or juice with your lunch?" as the children stood in line {{in front of the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>serving</b> options. The control school had the same fruit and 100 % juice options available, but the cafeteria workers did not provide a verbal prompt to take a <b>fruit</b> <b>serving.</b> Two variables were assessed: (1) Did children leave the lunch line with a <b>fruit</b> <b>serving</b> on their trays? and (2) Did they subsequently eat the <b>fruit</b> <b>serving?</b> Results: The average percentage of children who took a <b>fruit</b> <b>serving</b> was 60 % in the control school and 90 % in the intervention school. In both schools, approximately 80 % of children ate the fruit on their tray. As a result, nearly 70 % {{of the children in the}} intervention school consumed a <b>fruit</b> <b>serving</b> at lunch, while fewer than 40 % did so in the control school. Conclusion: A simple verbal prompt appears to have a significant impact on the likelihood that children will take, and subsequently consume, a <b>fruit</b> <b>serving</b> as part of their purchased school lunch. If these findings are replicated, policymakers may consider adding verbal prompts to the serving policy of the NSLP in an effort to increase fruit consumption among school children. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Before about 1700, it was {{customary}} {{for people}} of European descent to bring their own spoons to the table. Spoons were carried as personal property {{in much the same}} way as people today carry wallets, key rings, etc. From about 1700 the place setting became popular, and with it the [...] "table-spoon", [...] "table-fork" [...] and [...] "table-knife". Around the same time the tea-spoon and dessert-spoon first appeared, and the table-spoon was reserved for eating soup. The 18th century witnessed a proliferation of different sorts of spoons, including the mustard-spoon, salt-spoon, coffee-spoon, and soup-spoon. In the late 19th century UK, the dessert-spoon and soup-spoon began to displace the table-spoon as the primary implement for eating from a bowl, at which point the name [...] "table-spoon" [...] took on a secondary meaning as a much larger <b>serving</b> <b>spoon.</b> At the time the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1928, [...] "tablespoon" [...] (which by then was no longer hyphenated) still had two definitions in the UK: the original definition (eating spoon) and the new definition (<b>serving</b> <b>spoon).</b>|$|R

50|$|A spoon is a utensil {{consisting}} of a small shallow bowl, oval or round, {{at the end of}} a handle.
