40|$|The need {{to operate}} a boiler {{efficiently}} in today’s environment {{is at the top}} of many plant owners and operators lists. Unfortunately, operating a boiler efficiently and meeting local emission regulations do not always go hand in hand. However, advances in boiler system design and technology have made this a much more achievable task. The potential for energy improvements and cost savings is substantial when considered that most boilers operating today are performing at efficiencies that are less than 70 percent. The performance calculation and rectification measures are essential for performance evaluation and efficiency enhancement. Since the efficiency decreases from time to time it is required to find out the losses occurring in boiler using proper methodology. The environmental issues and economy are the secondary factors to be considered after finding the losses. Due to increase in fuel price and demand in more energy requirement in everyday life, proper utilization of materials and resources are necessary.

40|$|Investigations {{of damage}} {{evolution}} and life prediction methodologies of {{thermal barrier coating}} (TBC-) systems pose a current challenge. In order to determine properties of TBC system components (bond coat, thermal grown oxide layer (TGO) and ceramic top coat) testing methods have been developed following the strategy to identify mechnical and phyiscal properties prior to lifing studies. Testing methods comprise experiments for •	individual components of TBC systems and •	TBC systems without/with TGO layer. The simulation of complex loading and damage evolution requires data e. g. for elastic plastic (time independent) behaviour and time dependent (creep) behaviour of bond coat as well as TGO layer. Further adhesion experiments distinguish between global experiments and local experiments. Hardness test is of interest with respect to getting local data of top coat. Further crack propagation experiments lead to e. g. energy release rate, which can directly feed in a life prediction model. Herefrom the problem arises that properties may depend on specimen design. In addition, morphology of individual TBC system components cause problems at the generation of data and their interpretation. Consequently, efforts are necessary to harmonise •	specimen geometry •	testing methods and •	assessment procedures. The purpose of this presenation <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> to give an overview about typical testing methodologies and corresponding specimen design. The harmonisation of testing practices followed by a standard is a future challenge of interest for research {{as well as for}} industry as the end user of components operating with TBC systems.

Chapter 2 is mainly a review of relevant literature and <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> and functioning of Guidance Services I Education Aid Services in general, with specific reference to the organization and administration of such services and the nature of guidance programmes in the United States of America, Britain and West Germany. Different approaches to Guidance and the principles of Guidance Services were reviewed. The training and qualifications of Guidance personnel in the • above-mentioned countries were also investigated. The aim of this review was to set criterion on which the Education Aid Service of the TED could be judged in chapter 5. The origin and development of the Education Aid Service of the TED since its modest inception in 1914 is described in chapter 3. This was outlined in four clearly distinguishable stages, viz. the origin and development of the Psychological Service, the development of the Vocational Guidance Service, the amalgamation of these two services in 1955 and the inception of the present Education Aid Service in 1983. The aims and policy, organization and administration as well as personnel aspects of the Transvaal Education Aid Service of the present day were investigated in chapter 4. A distinction was drawn between the general guidance program in schools and the activities of the specialised field of the Education Aid Centres and Child Guidance Clinics. The Education Aid Service was evaluated in chapter 5 and general conclusions derived from the study were summarized. A few recommendations based on these conclusions were finally made. They include an empirical investigation into the aims of the present guidance programmes of the Education Aid Service, a change in approach by the Educational Aid Centre, understaffing at Child Guidance Clinics and Education Aid Centres, physical facilities for guidance in schools and training and qualifications of guidance personnel.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{combines}} {{studies in}} urban, environmental and public sociology and political science. Adequate and unimpeded {{access to water}} supply in poor black communities arguably {{lie at the heart}} of urban and environmental sociology, social policy and democratic local government. It explores water as a basic and non-substitutable resource and a human right, the countervailing pressures to commercialise and commodify it and the evolving countermovement to these pressures. It also explores the sufficiency of the present water lifeline and the appropriateness or otherwise of prepaid water meters in poor communities and the disempowering and alienating social consequences they appear to have. The contending theses of commodification and decommodification and their underlying social relations is the theoretical framework within which we situate the study. The first section <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> of the study, its rationale, methodology and the theoretical considerations. The second part focuses on the historical and institutional dynamics which both inform and are consequential to water commercialisation and commodification in South Africa. It explores and analyses the technology, ideology and sociology of prepaid water meters in general terms and the specific impacts they have had in Soweto, where the case study is situated. It furthermore critically explores these impacts in relation to the notions of human rights and social justice in the South African context. The epistemic heart of the thesis is the case study, based on a critical examination and analysis of the impacts the limited free water lifeline and the installation of prepaid water meters have had in Phiri, Soweto. It also critically analyses the problems and prospects for resistance to these meters and for developing an anti-commodification countermovement. In conclusion this thesis explores an alternative political, policy and institutional framework which may become necessary in the future if the problems identified as a result of the case study are to be seriously addressed by the service provider, Johannesburg Water, and the City of Johannesburg...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is Effect of intensive physiotherapy on overweight and obesity in people from 40 to 50 years. Obesity is severe illness quickly becoming a heavy {{problem in the}} society. In spite of this, a little emphasis is put on monitoring and solving {{the increasing number of}} overweight and obese people. In my opinion it is a hot issue considering the incidence of obesity is increasing, and occurring in countries which have not been affected so far. The theoretical part <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> to find out, whether the addition of physical activity to the daily routine influences losing weight. The next point includes the research of the influence both physical activities connected with the change of eating habits on losing weight. The last aim was to compile and realize the remedial program helping overweight and obese people to lose weight. There was a qualitative research based on casuistry of four people used in the practical part of the thesis. The kinesiology analysis from the opening and resultant examination provided information. A part of this analysis is an anamnesis including structural dialogue, visual and physical examination, anthropometry and specific physiotherapeutic examination, such as callipers-Ace and detection of the deep stabilization spine system. The therapy took place for three months. Probands participated in the conditional training, aerobic kinetic activity and the deep stabilization spine system mobilization. It figured out from the research that the most suitable way how to reduce body weight is the combination of more physical activity and the change of eating habits. The best results were achieved within probands who changed their eating habits at the time the therapy started. Only the application of kinetic activity while treating obesity and overweight cannot cause marked losing weight. One of the probands even gained weight as well as made smaller his waist girth. The research confirmed the necessity of individual approach to each of the probands. Every person responds and adapts differently although the problem is alike. The obesity and excess weight treatment is a long term matter, however, three months confirmed the effectiveness of the therapy. This thesis can serve in clinical physiotherapeutic practice for overweigh and obesity treatment. Next it can be used like study materials for students and graduates of the physiotherapy branch or for laic public...|$|E
40|$|This Master's thesis called "Labour as a Social Determinant and its Influence on the Health of Medical Staff in Selected Hospitals" {{is divided}} into two main sections. The first section {{summarizes}} current knowledge from both Czech and world literature from the field of social determinants related to health and labour. The second part of this work <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> of the research, data collection and data processing methods {{as well as with the}} very evaluation of the output information and a discussion of the results elicited. The theoretical part {{is divided into}} four chapters and consists of basic issues related to the aim of this Master's thesis. The first chapter describes social determinants of health from various points of view. One of the chapter's components is a description of a current conception of these determinants. The second chapter deals with the construct of health, its definition and its conception. Last but not least it treats health as a determiner. The third chapter summarizes a social determinant of labour and labour-related terms. The author is further concerned with the importance of work for humans and with labour safety and hygiene. The fourth and last chapter is dedicated to public health of the Czech republic, its history, the system of health care and further focuses on the structure and services of Ostrov hospital and Sokolov hospital. The aim of this Master's thesis is proposed in the empirical part of this work. The aim was to map the influence of labour as a social determinant of the health of medical staff in selected hospitals. Next, constitutive objectives were established. Their purpose was to map the impact of workplace relationships and their influence on the overall health of medical staff as well as the impact of working environment including salary, working hours, work agenda and workplace security on the overall health of medical staff. The following hypotheses were assessed in connection with the objectives of this work: H 1 : Workplace relations of medical staff affects their overall health. H 2 : Salary affects the overall health of medical staff. H 3 : Working hours affects the overall health of medical staff. H 4 : Work agenda affects the overall health of medical staff. H 5 : Workplace safety affects the overall health of medical staff. Based on the statistical testing hypotheses 1, 3 and 4 were confirmed. Hypotheses 2 and 5 were not confirmed. The enquiry within the framework of this Master's thesis was conducted using a quantitative research. The interviewing method and the technique of questionnaire were used for data acquirement. The questionnaire was composed from questions regarding the matter of inquiry, questions evaluating subjective health of the respondents, questions related to the occupation of the people addressed. The round of questions was finally targeted at the issue of respondents' health vs. their work. The questionnaire was anonymous. The research distribution was accomplished via Deputy Minister of health care in both hospitals. The research file was formed by a medical staff who work in Sokolov hospital and Ostrov hospital. The resulting data were entered and processed using SPPS program vision 16. 0 and 23. 0 (Statistical Package for Social Science). The data were further evaluated and processed via graphs and tables in absolute numbers and percentages. After the evaluation of all questions in the questionnaire I reached a conclusion that labour as a social determinant of health has impact on the health of medical staff. I shall also assume that the majority of respondents were quite positive while rating the overall complacence with their jobs. Their complacence appears despite the mental rather than physical demand which undoubtedly goes with medical careers as well as despite their work conditions and workplace relationship which all impact their overall health...|$|E
40|$|This is a licentiate {{dissertation}} {{consisting of}} a summarizing section and two free-standing but coherent articles, one of which has previously been published in ascientific journal while the other is accepted for publication. The unifying link {{is the theme of}} attempting to establish the kernel of outdoor education, as it isunderstood by teachers active in the field. The study depicts with the help of semi-structured interviews the respondents’ conceptions of teaching and outdooreducation. The first article is a survey (accomplished in A - School and B - School) of teachers’ perceptions of learning and teaching outdoors in preschool – (to) thefirst year of the compulsory school. The second article is a study of teachers’ perceptions of the possible special nature of outdoor education after having experiencedan educational intervention in the subject (preschool to first year). Both articles treat the special nature of outdoor education coupled with learning and outdoorteaching in light of the overall research question, what perceptions do teachers have of learning and teaching outdoors? The summarizing section which discusses thetwo articles is divided into five different parts. Chapter I comprises a social and environmental analysis and indicates the need for research in the field of outdoor education. Chapter II <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aim,</b> issuesand theoretical perspectives of learning which are tied to knowledge through action, ecological readability and bodily learning. A number of restricted examples areselected among theoreticians and representatives of these three perspectives within the reform pedagogy movement, American pragmatism, the environmental studymovement and theories of the phenomenology of the body, the learning body in movement. The methodological basis for the analysis of the two articles is phenomenographic and is described in Chapter III. In Chapter IV the possible special nature ofoutdoor education is analysed, noting what stands out as especially prominent in the respondents’ answers and in what way, proceeding from questions such as what isoutdoor education for you, {{what is the difference between}} learning outdoors and indoors, and why teach outdoors? Four categories of response can be distinguished: aplace for learning, a way of learning, an object of learning and bodily learning. At the end of Chapter IV the results of both articles are summarised. Finally, Chapter Vcomprises a discussion proceeding from a metacategorisation of all descriptive categories from both articles. The discussion has led to the identification of threethematised perspectives, namely the place perspective, the environment perspective and the body perspective. These perspectives, place, environment and body, arelinked back to the technical frame of reference in Chapter II. The result of the two part studies, the survey study in article 1 and the educational intervention in article 2, indicates a multiplicity of varied perceptions of thespecial nature of outdoor education and can thus be said to characterise this as richly diversified. As regards teachers’ notions of the principal reasons for learning andteaching outdoors, the following four aspects are foregrounded: the place for learning the object of learning the way of learning bodily learning Two main categories were identified in article 2 which are treated in education in the subject after a five-day course (10 half study days), teachers who perceive aspecial nature in outdoor education and teachers who do not. Both main categories crystallised out after the educational intervention was implemented in Byskolan andStadsskolan (the Village School and the Town School), the latter being the reference school. One year after the completion of the educational intervention mostteachers in the Village School associated the special nature of outdoor education with a more authentic, body and sensory experience related, movement intensive and health promoting learning than traditional learning in the classroom. Proceeding from a metacategorisation the three above-mentioned thematised perspectives are described in Chapter V. These reflect the identified responsecategories in articles 1 and 2. The analysis of the empirical material of the investigation reveals that the special nature of outdoor education from the respondents´ perspective is related to place,to the environment and to the body.
