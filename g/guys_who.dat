5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E

25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player of my time, a guy who had {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but the <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E
500|$|Dworsky was a {{four-year}} starter under Michigan's legendary coach, Fritz Crisler. Dworsky later said that Crisler's [...] "real genius" [...] was in blending all the elements. The 1947 championship team included several older veteran players who {{had returned from}} military service. Dworsky recalled: [...] "About half of us were 18-year old kids, and half were veterans. We had <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> were serious guys and <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> were excitable. Fritz struck a balance, so we never had to be pushed, but we never lost our focus either." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1969, Maryland {{athletic}} director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one players told Ward {{that they no}} longer wished to play on the team and accused him of using intimidation tactics that included verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was the <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> don't know what football's all about...He gets on the campus newspaper {{and all of a sudden}} he's got power he never thought of having." ...|$|E

5000|$|The outspoken Holmes was {{critical}} of Tyson, promising several times before the fight that he would knock Tyson out. Immediately after the Tyson-Tyrell Biggs fight, Holmes, who had attended the fight, was interviewed and called Tyson a [...] "dirty fighter" [...] stating [...] "I didn't see a guy with class in there, I see a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> throws elbows, I see a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> throws (head)butts and I see a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> hits after the bell." ...|$|R
500|$|The game {{restarted}} {{with two}} new goaltenders and the Senators {{on the power}} play, but within three seconds, the fighting started again — Ottawa's Chris Neil poked Radovan Somik with his stick, and the pair started scrapping. At the same time, Zdeno Chara started a fight with the Flyers' Mattias Timander, for which the former received an instigator penalty. Both fights angered Philadelphia Head Coach Ken Hitchcock, who claimed that, [...] "Their tough guy [...] got beat up and then their next two lines fought <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> don't fight." [...] Flyer General Manager Bob Clarke was also critical, saying, [...] "I understand Rob Ray fighting Donald Brashear. That's okay. [...] But don't go after <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> don't know how to defend themselves like Somik and Timander." [...] As Chara had been ejected from the game, his penalty was served by Martin Havlat, who had been placed there {{to protect him from}} any possible attempts at retribution. Chara's penalty meant that at the next restart, the teams were back to even strength, with four players each. Immediately after the ensuing face-off, Michal Handzus and Mike Fisher took part in the seventh fight of the game.|$|E

500|$|I {{think the}} {{standard}} of our cricket was really good. We were up to the mark in the finals. We lost as a team. There were a few errors in batting and bowling.

That's what sport is all about. the response from our team was great. even the <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> didn't get a chance were completely behind the team. So the spirit was great." ...|$|E

[...] However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as experts discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen.
