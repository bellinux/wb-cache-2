6000|$|That in {{the year}} 1777 the said Warren Hastings did {{recommend}} and appoint John Belli, at that time his private secretary, to be agent for supplying the garrison of Fort William with victualling stores; that the stores were to be purchased with money advanced by the Company, and that the said agent was to be allowed a commission or percentage for his risk and trouble; that, in order to ascertain what sum would be a reasonable compensation for the agent, the Governor-General and Council agreed to consult some of the principal merchants of Calcutta; that the merchants so consulted reported their opinion, that twenty per cent on the prime cost of the stores would be a reasonable compensation to the agent; that, nevertheless, the said Warren Hastings, supported by the vote and concurrence of Richard Barwell, then {{a member of the}} Supreme Council, did propose and carry it, that thirty per cent per annum should be allowed upon all stores to be provided by the agent. That the said Warren Hastings professed that [...] "he preferred an agency to a contract for this service, because, if it were performed by contract, it must then be advertised, and the world would know what provision was made for the defence of the fort": as if its being publicly known that the fort was well provided for defence were likely to encourage an enemy to attack it. That in August, 1779, in defiance of the principle laid down by himself for preferring an agency to a contract, the said Warren Hastings did propose and carry it, that the agency should be converted into a contract, to be granted to the said John Belli, without advertising for proposals, and fixed for the term of five years,--"pretending that he had received frequent remonstrances from the said agent concerning the heavy losses and inconveniences to which he was subjected by the indefinite terms of his agency," [...] notwithstanding it appeared by evidence produced at the board, that, on a supply of about 37,000l., he had already drawn a commission of 22,000l. and upwards. That the said Warren Hastings pledged himself, that, if required by the Court of Directors, the profits arising from the agency should be paid into the Company's treasury, and appropriated as the Court should direct. That the Court of Directors, {{as soon as they were}} advised of the first appointment of the said agency, declared that they considered the commission of twenty per cent as an ample compensation to the agent, and did positively order, that, according to the engagement of the said Warren Hastings, [...] "the commission paid or to be paid to the said agent should be reduced to twenty pounds per cent." [...] That the said John Belli did positively refuse to refund any part of the profits he had received, or to submit to a diminution of those which he was still to receive; and that the said Warren Hastings has never made good his own voluntary and solemn engagement to the Court of Directors <b>hereinabove</b> mentioned: and as his failure to perform the said engagement is a breach of faith to the Company, so his performance of such engagement, if he had performed it, and even his offering to pledge himself for the agent, in the first instance, ought to be taken as presumptive evidence of a connection between the said Warren Hastings and the said agent, his private secretary, which ought not to exist between a Governor acting in behalf of the Company and a contractor making terms with such Governor for the execution of a public service.|$|E

They are stated to be simple in construction and operation. It is essentially a canister of potassium superoxide connected to one-way flow valves to an air bag and thence to the user, as in Rebreathers whose absorbent releases oxygen <b>hereinabove.</b> There are no controls or operable valves of any kind. Breathing rate controls oxygen production. The main disadvantage is the 4-lbs canisters are good for only about 45-minutes of rapid climbing before another canister must be switched in.

We are also {{of the view}} that there was some negligence {{on the part of the}} Airport Authority of Ahmedabad in not providing the latest visibility report to the aircraft by getting the RVR from the Meteorological office at the airport (paras 53 to 57 <b>hereinabove).</b> The degree of negligence on the part of the pilot-in-command and the co-pilot of the Indian Airlines was so high that the same amounted to recklessness on their part as contemplated by Rule 25 to the Second Schedule to the Carriage by Air Act, 1972. The accident in question was because of recklessness on the part of the Indian Airlines and their servants, particularly the pilot-in-command as well as the co-pilot, with knowledge of the probable consequences of attempting to land without any clearance from the Air Traffic Control, Ahmedabad, without having cared to spot the VASI lights and without having cared to take note of NOTAMS sent by the Airport Authority of India, Ahmedabad about availability of VASI lights and non-availability of Instrument Landing System and non-operational approach lights.|$|E

The study is based on 2023 observations of 119 firms whose stocks were in process uninterruptedly in the period of 1995 - 2011 in ISE. As a result of the study, it is proven that proportional increase in sales resulted in proportional increase in costs to some extent, but proportional decrease in sales resulted in less proportional decrease in costs when compared to the case <b>hereinabove.</b> Thus, it is argued that the relationship between sales and costs is not linear for the firms analyzed. To put another way, cost stickiness is valid for the whole costs modeled in current term but it is valid for the costs of the sales in consecutive periods...|$|E

40|$|The FP 7 4 WARD clean-slate Project envisions {{overcoming}} {{the limitations of}} current Internet by redefining it to efficiently support complex value-added sessions and services, such as location-based, health-care, critical-mission, and geo processing. The list of networking innovations from 4 WARD’s Future Internet (FI) proposal includes a new connectivity paradigm called Generic Path (GP), a common representation for all communications. From the networking point of view, a GP is mapped to a communication path for data propagation. For that, GP architecture relies on routing mechanism for selecting best communication paths. In order to assure reliable communications, the routing mechanism must efficiently provision QoS-aware multi-party capable paths, with robustness functions, while keeping network performance. Therefore, this paper proposes the QoS-Routing and Resource Control (QoS-RRC) mechanism {{to deal with the}} <b>hereinabove</b> requirements by means of an over provisioning-centric (bandwidth and paths) approach. QoS-RRC achieves scalability by avoiding per-flow operations (e. g., signaling, state storage, etc.). Initial QoS-RRC performance evaluation was carried out in Network Simulator v. 2 (NS- 2), enabling drastic reduction of overall signaling exchanges compared to per-flow solutions...|$|E

40|$|Chronic cough, {{defined as}} lasting more than 8 weeks, is a {{frequent}} and difficult problem. Since 1981, the north American group of Irwin and coworkers has proposed a diagnostic algorithm with chronic cough being explained in {{a vast majority of}} cases by three possible diagnoses :asthma, chronic rhino-sinusitis and gastroesophageal reflux. This algorithm has been amended in order to include eosinophilic bronchitis and has further been severely criticized because of frequent failure in clinical practice. In 2008, Pavord and Chung have proposed to put the emphasis in chronic cough on non specific cough hyperreactivity, with the aetiological factors suggested by the Irwin group acting at most as modulating agents. Severe or persistent chronic cough should be quantitatively assessed, using for instance a visual analogue scale or a cough specific quality of life questionnaire. Where treatment for chronic cough is concerned, the sole definitely effective interventions are smoking cessation and discontinuation of a converting enzyme inhibitor. Long term inhaled steroids are also effective in case of eosinophilic cough (defined on basis of eosinophilia in induced sputum or increased level of exhaled NO). In case of chronic cough unresponsive to the <b>hereinabove</b> described management, an antitussive agent should be considered. As codeine is relatively ineffective, research about new antitussive agents should be encouraged. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

30|$|The nulling {{broadening}} algorithms {{can solve}} such problems <b>hereinabove</b> {{and avoid the}} additional complexity of the adaptive weight vector continuously updating. In [12], the approach to robust beamforming, with null widening, imparts robustness into adaptive pattern by judicious choice of null placement and width through introducing {{the concept of a}} covariance matrix taper (CMT), while the performance degradation of the method is evident because the relative high sidelobe and the depth become somewhat shallower when the null width is broadened. Several null widening techniques based on matrix tapers have been proposed to overcome the pattern distortion resulting from the nonstationary interference [13, 14]. Nevertheless, these methods are somewhat identical in essence and attain similar performance in output SINR. In [15], a beamforming framework has been proposed based on a set of beam pattern shaping constraints; this method enjoys adaptive interference-rejection capability and controls direct sidelobe, meanwhile, achieves robustness against steering direction errors with magnitude response constraints. However, these constraints consume the number of adaptive degrees of freedom (DOFs) to trade off the output SINR. The multiparametric quadratic programming for covariance matrix taper minimum variance distortionless response beamformer is proposed to resolve null broadening and sidelobe control problem in [16]. Nevertheless, the sidelobe domain constraint is obviously broadening the mainlobe beam pattern which decreases in array gain.|$|E
40|$|Brush seals are compliant, contact seals {{that have}} long-life, low-leakage {{characteristics}} desirable {{for use in}} rocket engine turbopumps. 50. 8 -mm (2. 0 inch) diameter brush seals with a nominal initial radial interference of 0. 127 -mm (0. 005 inch) were tested in liquid nitrogen at shaft speeds up to 35, 000 rpm and differential pressure loads up to 1. 21 MPa (175 psi) per brush. The measured leakage rate of a single brush was 2 - 3 times less than that measured for a 12 -tooth, 0. 127 -mm (0. 005 inch) radial clearance labyrinth seal used as a baseline. Stage effects were studied and {{it was found that}} two brush seals with a large separation distance leaked less than two brushes tightly packed together. The maximum measured groove depth on the Inconel 718 rotor was 25. 4 (mu) m (0. 001 inch) after 4. 31 hours of shaft rotation. The Haynes- 25 bristles wore approximately 25. 4 - 76. 2 (mu) m (0. 001 - 0. 003 inch) under the same conditions. Three seal runner coatings, chromium carbide, Teflon impregnated chromium, and zirconium oxide, were tested in liquid hydrogen at 35, 000 and 65, 000 rpm with separate 50. 8 mm diameter brush seals made of Haynes- 25 bristles and having a nominal initial radial interference of 129 rpm. Two bare Inconel- 718 rotors were also tested as a baseline. The test results revealed significant differences between the wear characteristics of the uncoated and coated seal runners. At both speeds the brush seal with the bare Inconel- 718 seal runner exhibited significant bristle wear with excessive material transferring to the runner surface. In contrast, the coated seal runners inhibited the transfer and deposit of bristle material. The chromium carbide coating showed only small quantities of bristle material transferring to its surface. The Teflon impregnated chromium coating also inhibited material transfer and provided some lubrication. This coating, however, is self-sacrificing. The Teflon remained present on the low speed runner, but it was completely removed from the high speed brush seal, which was tested considerably longer. The tests of the Teflon coating revealed the importance of using a lubricating and low friction coating for brush seals to reduce bristle and seal runner wear. The zirconium oxide coating exhibited the greatest amount of coating wear, while the brushes incurred only slight wear. Further testing of ceramics is recommended before making a final judgement on the viability of ceramic coatings for brush seals because of the contrast between the results reported by Carlile and the results presented herein. Strictly based on the results presented <b>hereinabove,</b> the chromium carbide and Teflon impregnated chromium coatings were considered preferable to the uncoated Inconel- 718 and zirconium oxide coatings because of their good wear resistance and characteristics to inhibit bristle material wear and transfer to the seal runner...|$|E
