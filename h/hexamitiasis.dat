40|$|<b>Hexamitiasis</b> was {{diagnosed}} in nine chelonians of eight species. The causative organism {{was identified as}} Hexamita parva (Alexeieff, 1912). the disease appeared to affect the organs which have an open connection with the intestinal tract. The kidneys were affected especially. Hexamites could be recognized in collecting ducts and in tubules showing acute and subacute lesions and inflammatory reactions. Parasites were generally absent in tubules revealing signs of regeneration. In the liver, the bile ducts {{were found to be}} invaded. <b>Hexamitiasis</b> is a slowly progressing disease causing no specific symptoms...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{generally}} describe the hole-in-head disease and introduce a new method oftreatment that called cupping. Cupping is important and old treatment for specific diseases in human,used by Iranian and Chinese medicinists in the past. This disease, often called <b>hexamitiasis,</b> is causedby {{a member of the}} genus Hexamita or Spironucleus. This parasite has two forms of infection one ofthem is external and cause hole-in-head disease and the other form is internal that cause intestinalproblems. Hole-in-head disease cause death in flower horn fishes which are expensive and verypopular members of Cichlidae family. Flower horn fish is a genetically improved hybrid between Amphilophus labiatus and Amphilophus trimaculatus. This simple method of cupping combined withstress factors removal was applied by us for the treatment of external <b>hexamitiasis</b> resulting in morethan 50 % cases of fish health recovery. The first signs of heath in treated specimens become visibleafter 4 - 6 days of treatment...|$|E
40|$|An acute rise of unexplained mortalities (reaching 84, 000 fish at one farm in 2002, 32 %) was {{observed}} at a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farm on the southeastern Black Sea coast from January to June {{for at least the}} last four years. Three rainbow trout farms on the same river system were surveyed for eight months to determine the occurrence and spread of the suspect- ed causative agent, Hexamita salmonis. We found that this protozoan was endemic to the trout farms from December through late August. The main determinants of the incidence and intensi- ty were water temperature (non-linear regression, r 2 = 0. 77) and oxygen and nitrate levels (ANOVA, r 2 = 0. 83). The mean intensity of the parasite gradually decreased while prevalence gradually increased from February to April at the farm with the highest values. There was no weight loss in infected fish compared to uninfected fish (p = 0. 4). The downstream farm had a higher level of parasitic intensity than the upstream farm during the high risk season. <b>Hexamitiasis</b> was the main cause of the high mortality in May and June when water tempera- tures were around 6 - 13 oC. Prophylactic measures should be taken in systems where this para- site is endemic. This is the first report of <b>hexamitiasis</b> from Turkey...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hexamitiasis</b> was {{encountered}} in a breeding colony of C 3 H/HeJ mice. The disease {{was observed in}} animals under three weeks of age. It was characterized clinically by retarded development, hunched attitude, lethargy, {{and in some cases}} by diarrhea and death. Lesions were noted particularly in the duodenum. The intestinal contents were watery and foamy. Histologically, cyst-like formations due to the dilation of the glands of Lieberk√ºhn were seen together with inflammatory reaction in the lamina propria and sloughing of the epithelium. The infection was controlled by the routine administration of dimetridazole in the drinking water...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of {{the records of the}} Laboratory Diagnostic Service {{for the past ten years}} reveals that a number of diseases which were scarcely known to exist or were unknown at the beginning of the period are now of major importance to the turkey industry. A list of such diseases includes coccidiosis, <b>hexamitiasis,</b> infectious sinusitis, moniliasis, paratyphoid infection, pullorum disease, swine erysipelas, trichomoniasis, ulcerative enteritis, and so-called unknown disease. Enterohepatitis (blackhead) still undoubtedly is the most important disease of turkeys, but the time when it was the only disease of turkeys which merited serious consideration has passed. During the past five years more cases of coccidiosis than of enterohepatitis have been directed to the attention of the laboratory. This does not mean that coccidiosis is more prevalent than enterohepatitis because the latter is usually more readily recognized by growers of turkeys and specimens may not be submitted for laboratory examination...|$|E

40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WHICH HAS AS OBJECT THE PARASITIC AND FUNGAL DISEASES OF THE RAINBOW TROUT IN GREECE, WAS THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PARASITES AND FUNGI OF THE RAINBOW TROUT, THEIR FREQUENCY IN THE RAINBOW TROUT FARMING INDUSTRY AND THE INTENSITY OF THE DISEASES WHICH THEY CAUSE WITH RESPECT TO FARMING CONDITIONS AND NUTRITION OF THE TROUT IN OUR COUNTRY. THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES DUE TO PARASITIC AND FUNGAL INFECTIONS ARE ALSO INCLUDED. IN GENERAL, 3, 620 FISH OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS WERE EXAMINED. THE FISH WERE TAKEN FROM 53 FARMS, OUT OF 120 RAINBOW TROUT FARMS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN TOTAL, IN GREECE. THEFOLLOWING DISEASES WERE DETECTED: 1) ICHTHYOSPORIDIASIS WAS FOUND IN 21 FISH FARMS. 2) SAPROLEGNIASIS WAS FOUND IN 18 FISH FARMS. 3) COSTIASIS IN 3 FISH FARMS. 4) <b>HEXAMITIASIS</b> WAS FOUND IN 2 FARMS. 5) ICHTHYOPHTHIRIASIS WAS FOUND IN 16 FISH FARMS. 6) PARASITIC CATARACT WAS OBSERVED IN 1 FARM. THE CAUSE OF THISDISEASE WERE THE METACERCOIDS OF THE TREMATODE DIPLOSPOMUM SPATHACEUM. 7) HEPATIC CAPILARIASIS, DUE TO HEPATICOLA PETRUSCHEWSCKI WAS FOUND IN 2 FISH FARMS. 8) ACANTHOCEPHALOSIS, DUE TO ACANTHOCEPHALUS JACKSONI WAS FOUND IN 1 FISH FARM. ...|$|E
