5000|$|A [...] "reentrant <b>interrupt</b> handler" [...] is an <b>interrupt</b> handler that re-enables <b>interrupts</b> {{early in}} the <b>interrupt</b> handler. This may reduce <b>interrupt</b> latency.In general, while {{programming}} <b>interrupt</b> service routines, it is recommended to re-enable <b>interrupts</b> {{as soon as possible}} in the <b>interrupt</b> handler. This practice helps to avoid losing <b>interrupts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In computing, <b>interrupt</b> latency is {{the time}} that elapses from when an <b>interrupt</b> is {{generated}} to when {{the source of the}} <b>interrupt</b> is serviced. For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's <b>interrupt</b> handler is executed. <b>Interrupt</b> latency may be affected by microprocessor design, <b>interrupt</b> controllers, <b>interrupt</b> masking, and the operating system's (OS) <b>interrupt</b> handling methods.|$|R
30|$|MicroBlaze also {{supports}} reset, <b>interrupt,</b> user exception, break and hardware exceptions. For <b>interrupts,</b> MicroBlaze supports only one external <b>interrupt</b> source (connecting to the <b>interrupt</b> input port). If multiple <b>interrupts</b> are needed, an <b>interrupt</b> controller {{must be used}} to handle multiple <b>interrupt</b> requests to MicroBlaze. An <b>interrupt</b> controller is available for use with the Xilinx EDK software tools. The processor will only react to <b>interrupts</b> if the <b>interrupt</b> enable (IE) bit in the MSR is set to 1. On an <b>interrupt</b> the instruction in the execution stage will complete, while the instruction in the decode stage {{is replaced by a}} branch to the <b>interrupt</b> vector (address 0  ×  10). The <b>interrupt</b> return address (the PC associated with the instruction in the decode stage {{at the time of the}} <b>interrupt)</b> is automatically loaded into general-purpose register R 14. In addition, the processor also disables future <b>interrupts</b> by clearing the IE bit in the MSR. The IE bit is automatically set again when executing the RTID instruction.|$|R
5|$|In July 1985, the Who {{performed}} at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London. The BBC transmission truck blew a fuse during the set, temporarily <b>interrupting</b> the broadcast.

5|$|On 23 February 1987, a Douglas DC-9 from Scandinavian Airlines {{landing at}} Værnes {{en route from}} Bodø Airport was written off after a hard landing on the runway.

50|$|External <b>interrupts</b> are {{triggered}} by falling/rising edges or high/low potential at the <b>interrupt</b> port, {{leading to an}} <b>interrupt</b> request (IRQ) in the controller. Hardware <b>interrupts</b> are divided into maskable <b>interrupts</b> and non-maskable <b>interrupts</b> (NMI). The triggering of maskable <b>interrupts</b> can be stopped in some time-critical functions. If an <b>interrupt</b> is called, the current instruction pointer (IP) is saved on the stack, and the stack pointer (SP) is decremented. The address of the <b>interrupt</b> service routine (ISR) is read from the <b>interrupt</b> vector table and loaded to the IP register, and the ISR is executed as a consequence.|$|R
40|$|Hardware <b>interrupt</b> {{management}} method based on field {{programmable gate array}} is proposed in this study according to the requirement of embedded real-time operating system for real-time performance and the structure model of <b>interrupt</b> management module is also given. <b>Interrupt</b> is subdivided into system and user <b>interrupts</b> owing to different characteristics of <b>interrupt</b> request and response method. <b>Interrupt</b> source management, <b>interrupt</b> vector management, <b>interrupt</b> nesting and clock tick <b>interrupt</b> management have all been implemented by hardware. The simulation results show the feasibility and stability of this kind of <b>interrupt</b> {{management method}}. In a word, the implementation of <b>interrupt</b> management by hardware improves not only the utilization rate of CPU, but also the real-time performance of the whole system...|$|R

5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, <b>interrupting,</b> destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{camouflage}}, {{also known}} as razzle dazzle (in the U.S.) or dazzle painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I, {{and to a lesser}} extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a rejected prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, <b>interrupting</b> and intersecting each other.|$|E
5|$|Off the field, Trumble {{worked for}} the National Bank of Australasia, rising to the {{position}} of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments <b>interrupting</b> his banking career. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) into a stadium capable of holding over 70,000spectators. He held this post until his death in 1938 from a heart attack, aged71.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>interrupt</b> is an {{indication}} to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. A thread sends an <b>interrupt</b> by invoking <b>interrupt</b> on the Thread object for the thread to be <b>interrupted.</b> The <b>interrupt</b> mechanism is implemented using an internal flag known as the <b>interrupt</b> status. Invoking [...] sets this flag. By convention, any method that exits by throwing an [...] clears <b>interrupt</b> status when it does so. However, it's always possible that <b>interrupt</b> status will immediately be set again, by another thread invoking <b>interrupt.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Level-triggered <b>interrupt</b> {{is favored}} by some {{because it is}} easy to share the <b>interrupt</b> request line without losing the <b>interrupts,</b> when {{multiple}} shared devices <b>interrupt</b> at the same time. Upon detecting assertion of the <b>interrupt</b> line, the CPU must search through the devices sharing the <b>interrupt</b> request line until one who triggered the <b>interrupt</b> is detected. After servicing this device, the CPU may recheck the <b>interrupt</b> line status to determine whether any other devices also needs service. If the line is now de-asserted, the CPU avoids checking the remaining devices on the line. Since some devices <b>interrupt</b> more frequently than others, and other device <b>interrupts</b> are particularly expensive, a careful ordering of device checks is employed to increase efficiency. The original PCI standard mandated level-triggered <b>interrupts</b> because of this advantage of sharing <b>interrupts.</b>|$|R
25|$|The CPU recognizes seven <b>interrupt</b> levels. Levels 1 through 5 are {{strictly}} prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered <b>interrupt</b> can always <b>interrupt</b> a lower-numbered <b>interrupt.</b> In the status register, a privileged instruction {{allows one to}} set the current minimum <b>interrupt</b> level, blocking lower or equal priority <b>interrupts.</b> For example, if the <b>interrupt</b> level in the status register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered Non-maskable <b>interrupt</b> (NMI). Level 1 can be <b>interrupted</b> by any higher level. Level 0 means no <b>interrupt.</b> The level is stored in the status register, and is visible to user-level programs.|$|R
5|$|On the February 21, 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H returned, <b>interrupting</b> {{the return of}} The Undertaker and {{challenging}} him to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, which later became a No Holds Barred match. A week later, he attacked Sheamus with a Pedigree through a broadcast table in retaliation for Sheamus giving him a ten-month injury. At WrestleMania XXVII, Triple H lost, which extended Undertaker's undefeated streak to 19–0; Undertaker was carried from the ring on a stretcher whereas Triple H left on his own accord.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Brian {{had never}} gotten over {{the end of}} his {{relationship}} with Jillian, Lauren encourages him to let her know about his still-strong feelings for her. Brian uses Jillian's wedding as this opportunity, <b>interrupting</b> the ceremony to passionately profess his love for her. Jillian, however, tells Brian (gently) that he had his chance and blew it, as she decided to move on and he needs to as well. Brian is now a miserable, single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped him because he gave her worms.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then <b>interrupting</b> the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{a single}} <b>interrupt</b> line on the PDP-8 I/O bus. The {{processor}} handled any <b>interrupt</b> by disabling further <b>interrupts</b> and executing a [...] to location 0000. As {{it was difficult to}} write reentrant subroutines, it was difficult to nest <b>interrupts</b> and this was usually not done; each <b>interrupt</b> ran to completion and re-enabled <b>interrupts</b> just before executing the [...] instruction that returned from the <b>interrupt.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PDP-11 {{supports}} hardware <b>interrupts</b> at four priority levels. <b>Interrupts</b> are {{serviced by}} software service routines, which could specify whether they themselves could be <b>interrupted</b> (achieving <b>interrupt</b> nesting). The event {{that causes the}} <b>interrupt</b> is indicated by the device itself, as it informs the processor of the address of its own <b>interrupt</b> vector.|$|R
40|$|<b>Interrupts</b> and in {{particular}} precise <b>interrupts</b> constitute {{an integral part of}} all computer architectures. Implementing precise <b>interrupts</b> can substantially inhibit the performance of computers. To gain some insight into the problem, we divide common <b>interrupts</b> into four classes, and examine the cost of implementing precise <b>interrupts.</b> Two of these classes, external-critical and external-error, can be implemented cheaply on a pipelined processor, with little or no impact on performance. We propose that <b>interrupts</b> be implemented imprecisely, except during debugging, of a third class of <b>interrupts,</b> internal-error <b>interrupts.</b> Finally, we introduced some techniques {{that can be used to}} cheaply implement precise <b>interrupts</b> for the fourth class of <b>interrupts,</b> internal-critical <b>interrupts,</b> but may not apply generally. While the central concern is precision, or lack thereof, we also deal with several peripheral issues that arise when implementing <b>interrupts</b> on aggressive implementation [...] ...|$|R
5|$|After leaving TNA, Kim re-signed with WWE in late 2008. She {{made her}} return {{as a fan}} {{favorite}} on the March 27, 2009 episode of SmackDown, <b>interrupting</b> a WWE Divas Championship match between the villainous Diva's Champion, Maryse and Michelle McCool by attacking both competitors. Kim made her in-ring return on the March 30 episode of Raw on the winning team of an 18-Diva tag team match. She made her first WrestleMania appearance in the 25-Diva Miss WrestleMania battle royal on April 5, 2009 at WrestleMania XXV. On the April 17 episode of SmackDown, Kim defeated then-Divas Champion Maryse. This earned her a championship match the following week, which she failed to win.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of <b>interrupting</b> the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept <b>interrupting</b> the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
50|$|The design {{philosophy}} of the Propeller is that a hard real-time multi-core architecture negates the need for dedicated <b>interrupt</b> hardware and support in assembly. In traditional CPU architecture, external <b>interrupt</b> lines are fed to an on-chip <b>interrupt</b> controller and are serviced {{by one or more}} <b>interrupt</b> service routines. When an <b>interrupt</b> occurs, the <b>interrupt</b> controller suspends normal CPU processing and saves internal state (typically on the stack), then vectors to the designated <b>interrupt</b> service routine. After handling the <b>interrupt,</b> the service routine executes a return from <b>interrupt</b> instruction which restores the internal state and resumes CPU processing.|$|R
50|$|A FLIH {{implements}} {{at minimum}} platform-specific <b>interrupt</b> handling similar to <b>interrupt</b> routines. In {{response to an}} <b>interrupt,</b> there is a context switch, and the code for the <b>interrupt</b> is loaded and executed. The job of a FLIH is to quickly service the <b>interrupt,</b> or to record platform-specific critical information which is only {{available at the time}} of the <b>interrupt,</b> and schedule the execution of a SLIH for further long-lived <b>interrupt</b> handling.|$|R
50|$|In the x86 architecture, <b>interrupts</b> {{are handled}} through the <b>Interrupt</b> Dispatch Table (IDT). When a device {{triggers}} an <b>interrupt,</b> the <b>interrupt</b> flag (IF) in the flags register is {{set and the}} processor's hardware looks for an <b>interrupt</b> handler in the table entry corresponding to the <b>interrupt</b> number, or IRQ. <b>Interrupt</b> handlers usually save the state of all or some registers before handling it and restore the registers when done.|$|R
5|$|Cooper, Truman and Brennan visit a {{veterinarian}} connected to Gerard; they find twine there {{of the type}} used to bind Laura. They believe that the bird that clawed her body {{is one of the}} animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, <b>interrupting</b> Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, {{after several}} naval successes against Spain along the Mediterranean, Cardinal Mazarin planned a naval {{expedition}} {{to conquer the}} Spanish-held State of Presidi {{with the aim of}} <b>interrupting</b> Spanish communications with the Kingdom of Naples, threatening the initial stage of the Spanish military corridor, the so-called Spanish Road, and also to frighten pope Innocent X, whose Spanish sympathies displeased him. For this purpose, a fleet commanded by young Admiral Marquis of Brézé was assembled at Toulon. Made of 36 galleons, 20 galleys and a large complement of minor vessels, it had on board an army of some 8,000 infantry and 800 cavalry with baggage under the command of Thomas Francis of Savoy, who had previously been at the employ of the Spanish Crown.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Major General Ironside {{launched}} his offensive against the 6th Red Army, with the British force subsequently inflicting {{large numbers of}} casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought through thick pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged in holding operations only. It {{has been suggested that}} they probably had no intention of <b>interrupting</b> the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. To be sure the main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} cause is when a device [...] "behind" [...] another signals an <b>interrupt</b> to a APIC (Advanced Programmable <b>Interrupt</b> Controller). Most {{computer}} peripherals generate <b>interrupts</b> through an APIC {{as the number of}} <b>interrupts</b> is most always less (typically 15 for the modern PC) than the number of devices. The OS must then query each driver registered to that <b>interrupt</b> to ask if the <b>interrupt</b> originated from its hardware. Faulty drivers may always claim [...] "yes", causing the OS to not query other drivers registered to that <b>interrupt</b> (only one <b>interrupt</b> can be processed at a time). The device which originally requested the <b>interrupt</b> therefore does not get its <b>interrupt</b> serviced, so a new <b>interrupt</b> is generated (or is not cleared) and the processor becomes swamped with continuous <b>interrupt</b> signals. Any operating system can live lock under an <b>interrupt</b> storm caused by such a fault. A kernel debugger can usually break the storm by unloading the faulty driver, allowing the driver [...] "underneath" [...] the faulty one to clear the <b>interrupt,</b> if user input is still possible.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>interrupt</b> {{has its own}} <b>interrupt</b> handler. The {{number of}} {{hardware}} <b>interrupts</b> {{is limited by the}} number of <b>interrupt</b> request (IRQ) lines to the processor, but there may be hundreds of different software <b>interrupts.</b> <b>Interrupts</b> are a commonly used technique for computer multitasking, especially in real-time computing. Such a system is said to be interrupt-driven.|$|R
50|$|The Rabbit {{processor}} {{family has}} unique features. For example, the Z80/Z180 family disables <b>interrupts</b> once an <b>interrupt</b> is serviced by an <b>interrupt</b> service routine. However, the Rabbit processors permit <b>interrupts</b> to <b>interrupt</b> service routines according to priorities (a total of 4).|$|R
