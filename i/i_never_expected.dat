That October saw {{the release of a}} DVD set containing concert footage of the band: It's Alive 1974-1996 includes 118 songs from 33 performances over the span of the group's career. In February 2011 the group was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Drummers Tommy, Marky, and Richie attended the ceremony. Marky declared, [...] "This is amazing. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> this. I'm sure Johnny, Joey, and Dee Dee would never have expected this." [...] Richie noted that {{it was the first time}} ever that all three drummers were under the same roof, and mused that he couldn't [...] "help thinking that [...] is watching us right now with a little smile on his face behind his rose-colored glasses." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{sometimes}} struggled {{to define the}} immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About everywhere you go, people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".|$|E

500|$|Lansbury was {{defensive}} about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives {{to put her}} in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> in my entire life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{was fired}} from the soap opera in 2011, and Cane {{was shot to death}} onscreen on the episode dated February 2. There were rumors that Maria Arena Bell, Latham's successor, killed the {{character}} because he was created by Latham, but this was denied. Soap Opera Weekly reported another rumor regarding the firing, saying tension between the actor and his co-stars resulted in Goddard's exit. Cane's onscreen death caused a [...] "massive outcry" [...] from viewers, and fans campaigned for the actor's return by sending emails and making phone calls to CBS and Sony Pictures Television. As part of the campaign, a group of viewers paid for an airplane to fly over CBS Studios with the message: [...] "Y Fans Want Daniel Goddard As Cane Ashby". The plane flew over the building for about an hour. Regarding the campaign, Goddard stated: [...] "When they started their campaign to bring Cane back, I wrote on my Facebook page that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> this. I have the greatest fans. There are no ifs, ands or buts about it. One of my fans coined Goddard's Family of Fans and that's what it is, GFF." [...] In another interview, he stated he was [...] "humbled" [...] by viewer efforts to have him remain as the character. The actor was then rehired, revealing within the storyline that Cane's death had been faked and his twin brother, Caleb, was the one who died. Goddard had stated that he was very impressed with the soap opera's ability to keep Cane's faked death a secret. For his death scene, Goddard said he did research on how the human body reacts muscularly, how much control the person has, and what their breathing is like. Goddard stated {{that he did not know}} which character he was portraying until a certain point through the storyline, and that he [...] "had to play it ambiguously". He also commented that it was difficult as an actor as he did not want it to look like Cane was ever manipulating Lily, however, he said it thought it was a [...] "great storyline the fans could get behind".|$|E

I saw it simply as a chance to go on holiday because my {{grandmother}} was ill at the time in Samoa. It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. I could not have cared less about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{hearing of}} his death sentence, Seyss-Inquart was fatalistic: [...] "Death by hanging... well, {{in view of the}} whole situation, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> {{anything}} different. It's all right." [...] He was hanged on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. He was the last to mount the scaffold, and his last words were the following: [...] "I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. He told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", so <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
2500|$|Rachmaninoff {{sought the}} company of fellow Russian musicians and befriended pianist Vladimir Horowitz in 1928. For Horowitz, the {{opportunity}} represented {{a dream come true}} as Rachmaninoff was [...] "the musical god of my youth ... the most unforgettable impression of my life!" [...] About the pianist's interpretation of Rachmaninoff's own third concerto, the composer said to Abram Chasins that Horowitz [...] "swallowed it whole ... he had the courage, the intensity, the daring." [...] The men remained supportive of each other's work, each making a point of attending concerts given by the other. Horowitz remained a champion of Rachmaninoff's solo works and his Piano Concerto No. 3, about which Rachmaninoff remarked publicly after 7 August 1942 performance at the Hollywood Bowl: [...] "This is the way I always dreamed my concerto should be played, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> to hear it that way on Earth." ...|$|E

2500|$|With [...] "The Truth About Heaven", {{the group}} were {{initially}} unsure {{of how to}} go into the first verse. According to Decicco, Jorgensen came up with a part [...] "and he was like, 'I think this would be really cool over the verses." [...] I played it and I was like, [...] "That actually is really cool." [...] Decicco called it a riff [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> to hear over it". Decicco said the group wanted [...] "Remember to Feel Real" [...] to [...] "just have it start and ... kick your ass". The pre-chorus riff was written by Jorgensen and Decicco while on tour. The bridge in [...] "Stay on the Ground" [...] features a flange effect, which was written by Decicco and played through a Line 6 Pedal. Jorgensen came up with a keyboard part, which he wrote a song around that became [...] "A Quick Little Flight".|$|E
2500|$|Sharon Knolle of TV Squad stated [...] "From the {{inspired}} 'Tik Tok' musical opening sequence to {{the last}} gag, 'To Surveil With Love' {{ranks as one of}} the best 'Simpsons' episodes in years. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> the rest of the episode to live up to that killer opening, but, unbelievably, it just got better as it went along." [...] Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- and said [...] "I thought this was a strong episode of The Simpsons. I laughed frequently throughout, I thought both of the major storylines mostly made sense and concluded well, and I enjoyed some of the ways the episode turned satire on its ear. I particularly liked the idea of Lisa conforming by becoming a brunette after everyone made fun of her for being a blonde. Dumb blonde jokes are as old as time itself, but the way the episode turned the whole thing into a sly parody of diversity and conformity was winning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Mara Clara, Santos {{appeared}} in ABS-CBN's 1996 weekly series Star Drama Theatre Presents as its featured artist.

She has successfully established her place in show business." [...] After her stint in the show, she reprised two more featured appearances, having held the distinction of being the youngest artist with the most number of appearances in the series, starring in twelve. Asked about her accomplishment in the drama series, Santos stated, [...] "Doing Star Drama Presents was another highlight, because I was the first young actress to be given the multi-episode treatment. I was overwhelmed, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> that. I was only 16 years old then." [...] In June of the same year, the Talent Center—TFC (now traded as Star Magic) co-production Gimik (1996) gave Santos her first leading role in a teen drama television series, as a young socialite portrayed in the fictional lives of a close-knit group of teenagers through high school and college, alongside Rico Yan, Diether Ocampo, Giselle Toengi, Mylene Dizon, Bojo Molina, Jolina Magdangal, and Marvin Agustin.

"Mabel," [...] Lunn wrote, [...] "was invincibly English and I {{was much}} consoled during the dark days of 1940 {{by the fact}} that her {{confidence}} in final victory was never shaken." [...] Lunn once said something nice to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel. [...] "I want Jaqueta to feel," [...] she said, [...] "that the only thing which calls for comment in war time is cowardice." [...] Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: [...] "Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> her to follow our example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of England." [...] An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church.

[...] But Lunn could never have written [...] "anything unpleasant" [...] about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, [...] "Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen.

Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
