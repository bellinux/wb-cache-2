40|$|Chlorophylls and {{carotenoid}} pigments {{were investigated}} in leaves of beet (Beta vulgaris L.) obtained from SDE Cluj-Napoca, harvested in September 1987. Leaves had a <b>higher</b> <b>content</b> both in chlorophylls and carotenoids than petioles. The <b>high</b> <b>content</b> in chlorophyll b and B-carotene {{is of great}} importance. The chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b ratio was of 1, 8 in leaves and 1, 36 in petioles respectively. The main carotenoids in leaves are lutheine and B-carotene, followed by violaxanthine, criptixanthins, zeaxanthine and neoxanthine in decreasing order of their content. Carotenoids with provitaminic structure represent 41, 4 % of the total carotenoid content in leaves and 38 % in petioles.
