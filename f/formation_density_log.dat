30|$|The litho-density and {{compensated}} neutron crossplot for the Matulla Formation in Tawila N- 1 Well {{is presented}} in Fig.  7 b, c. The photoelectric capture measurement taken by Schlumberger litho-density tool (LDT) is very sensitive to barite, and so it can detect fractures that have been invaded by barite mud (Fig.  7 b). In front of the fractured zones at the specified depths, the tool measures very high values of photoelectric effect (Pe). The increase in Pe values indicates the presence of fractures within the formation. Sharp Pe peaks have been noticed at seven zones at 3032.5, 3034, 3036 – 3038, 3042, 3045, 3048 – 3050 and 3052  m. Five out of seven of suggested fractured zones from SPI (3034, 3038, 3040 – 3042, 3048.5 and 3052  m from Fig.  5 b are supported by the Pe result with good agreement with each others. Moreover, {{the presentation of the}} neutron-density overlay shows a sharp decrease in the formation matrix density, which is accompanied by another sharp increase in the neutron log reading. This can be interpreted as a result of invasion of mud filtrate into the formation fractures, which destroys the readings of <b>formation</b> <b>density</b> <b>log.</b> Simultaneously, the plot also indicates that the neutron log has been dramatically increased as it is measuring within the fractures occupied mud (Fig.  7 c).|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} the thin bed {{responses}} and correction methods in cased hole <b>density</b> <b>logging</b> can provide a theoretical basis for research to improve data processing methods. By using the Monte Carlo program MCNP, the change of detector count from thin beds with the vertical depth was calculated at different casing thicknesses. The calculation showed that with the low density thin bed moving upward, detector count first increased to a maximum then decreased. The responses of a thin bed with a high density were opposite to those of a thin bed with a low density. The change curve was symmetrical, and the maximums or minimums appeared at the midpoint between the detector and source. Besides, detector count increased with increasing thin bed thickness. At a specific thin bed thickness, further increase of thin bed thickness resulted in a slow increase of detector count then the count rate leveled off. In actual logging, the influence of adjacent <b>formations</b> on <b>density</b> <b>log</b> measurements can be ignored. Finally, based on numerical simulation correction methods for the dual influence of casing and thin beds are discussed.|$|R

The vertical stress was calculated using both the original density and corrected density and plotted against depth to show variation (Fig.  5).

Although this value may seem trivial, it may have {{a great impact on}} the limits of the mud window prediction since the vertical stress is incorporated in the empirical calculations of pore pressure gradient and fracture gradient.

5000|$|A popular {{method of}} obtaining a {{formation}} porosity estimate {{is based on the}} simultaneous use of neutron and <b>density</b> <b>logs.</b> Under normal logging conditions, the porosity estimates obtained from these tools agree, when plotted on an appropriate lithology and fluid scale. However, {{in the case of a}} reservoir where there is gas instead of water or oil in the pore space, the two porosity logs separate, to form what is referred to as gas crossover. Under these conditions, the true formation porosity lies between the measured neutron and <b>density</b> values. <b>Log</b> interpreters often find it difficult to accurately estimate the true formation porosity from these two curves.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{laboratory}} and in-situ testing {{has been carried}} out in an onshore test site on the North Sea Coast near Cuxhaven, Germany. The test site was chosen due to initially high cone resistance (> 30 MPa) in sand and close stratigraphic links to soil conditions for North Sea offshore wind projects. The in-situ program included cone penetration testing, geophysical downhole logging and sampling. A correlation between relative density, shear wave velocity and mean effective stress is proposed based on laboratory measurements with bender elements under anisotropic stress conditions.
