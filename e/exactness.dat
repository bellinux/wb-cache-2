Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500florins, yet its <b>exactness</b> may be taken {{with a grain of}} salt.|$|E
5|$|The pilot-in-command was 50-year-old Urs Zimmermann. At {{the time}} of the accident, he had {{approximately}} 10,800 hours of total flying time, of which 900 hours were in an MD-11. He was also an instructor pilot for the MD-11. Before his career with Swissair, he was a fighter pilot in the Swiss Air Force. Zimmermann was described as a friendly person with professional skills, who always worked with <b>exactness</b> and precision.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of <b>exactness</b> in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E

25|$|Vladimir Nabokov {{severely}} criticised Arndt's translation, {{as he had}} criticised many previous (and later) translations. Nabokov's main {{criticism of}} Arndt's and other translations is that they sacrificed literalness and <b>exactness</b> {{for the sake of}} preserving the melody and rhyme.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} exact {{sequence}} arises naturally in this setting, {{and it turns}} out that exact functors, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between Abelian categories. This <b>exactness</b> concept has been axiomatized in the theory of exact categories, forming a very special case of regular categories.|$|E
25|$|When we have {{grasped the}} spirit of the infinitesimal method, and have {{verified}} the <b>exactness</b> of its results either by the geometrical method of prime and ultimate ratios, or by the analytical method of derived functions, we may employ infinitely small quantities as a sure and valuable means of shortening and simplifying our proofs.|$|E
25|$|For {{any value}} of the slowly varying field H, the free energy (log-probability) is a local {{analytic}} function of H and its gradients. The free energy F(H) is defined to be the sum over all Ising configurations which {{are consistent with the}} long wavelength field. Since H is a coarse description, there are many Ising configurations consistent with each value of H, so long as not too much <b>exactness</b> is required for the match.|$|E
25|$|Scientists and historians, for example, {{study the}} {{objective}} world, hoping to elicit {{the truth of}} nature—or perhaps the truth of history. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more <b>exactness</b> and perhaps take control of events {{that in the past}} appeared to fall outside the control of humans.|$|E
25|$|In {{characteristic}} p {{the most}} obvious analogue of the crystalline site defined above in characteristic 0 does not work. The reason is roughly {{that in order to}} prove <b>exactness</b> of the de Rham complex, one needs some sort of Poincaré lemma, whose proof in turn uses integration, and integration requires various divided powers, which exist in characteristic 0 but not always in characteristic p. Grothendieck solved this problem by defining objects of the crystalline site of X to be roughly infinitesimal thickenings of Zariski open subsets of X, together with a divided power structure giving the needed divided powers.|$|E
25|$|In certain situations, the Galois group acts {{on other}} {{mathematical}} objects, for example a group. Such a group is then {{also referred to}} as a Galois module. This enables the use of group cohomology for the Galois group Gal(F), also known as Galois cohomology, which in the first place measures the failure of <b>exactness</b> of taking Gal(F)-invariants, but offers deeper insights (and questions) as well. For example, the Galois group G of a field extension L / F acts on L×, the nonzero elements of L. This Galois module plays a significant role in many arithmetic dualities, such as Poitou-Tate duality. The Brauer group of F, originally conceived to classify division algebras over F, can be recast as a cohomology group, namely H2(Gal (F), ×).|$|E

But Seurat, one feels, saw it almost as one might suppose some visitant from another planet would have done. He saw it with this penetrating <b>exactness</b> of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's {{thoughts}} on biography and on poetry coalesced in {{his understanding of}} what {{would make a good}} critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote: [...] "I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, for the use of such as aspire to <b>exactness</b> of criticism, or elegance of style". Although a smaller edition of his Dictionary became the standard household dictionary, Johnson's original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered {{to be the most important}} literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.|$|E
500|$|Hale {{was born}} on 1 November 1609 in West End House (now known as The Grange or Alderley Grange) in Alderley, Gloucestershire to Robert Hale, a {{barrister}} of Lincoln's Inn, and Joanna Poyntz. His father gave up his practise as a barrister several years before Hale's birth [...] "because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings". This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury, through claiming a (false) allegation about this right. Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact, and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors. Although in common use, Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and [...] "contrary to the <b>exactness</b> of truth and justice which became a Christian; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country". John Hostettler, in his biography of Matthew Hale, points out that his father's concerns about giving colour in pleadings {{could not have been}} very strong [...] "since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife's inherited income, but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law".|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} critic in the Monthly Magazine disparaged the [...] "writhings and twinings" [...] of the painting's subjects, describing them as [...] "as {{close to}} the unpardonable limits as anything that has lately appealed to the public eye". This same writer disapproved of the dark skin tones {{of some of the}} figures, arguing that [...] "the brown visage of the [...] gives but a dingy image of the roses and lilies that, from time immemorial, have made the charm of British beauty". The correspondent for The London Magazine felt that although the painting was [...] "in many respects worthy of admiration... is a spirit, a boldness, and a startling effect", the work was poorly executed overall. Its depiction of women drew particular ire: [...] "the expression of the faces is vapid; the features rather homely; the limbs, though not ill-drawn, have not that finish and play of the muscles, which alone give lightness and elasticity. They seem lifted up with difficulty, and ready to fall." [...] The review upbraided Etty as an artist who had [...] "advanced half way on his road to classic excellence; and there, when he should have proceeded with increased ardour and more careful <b>exactness</b> from being in view of his object, he has stopped short." [...] Etty's fellow artist John Constable privately described the work as [...] "a revel rout of Satyrs and lady bums as usual".|$|E
2500|$|Numbers {{may have}} the quality of <b>exactness.</b> [...] An exact number can only be {{produced}} by a sequence of exact operations involving other exact numbers—inexactness is thus contagious.

2500|$|The R5RS {{standard}} specifies procedures exact->inexact and inexact->exact {{which can}} be used to change the <b>exactness</b> of a number.

2500|$|The early Church in the post-apostolic {{period was}} much more {{involved}} in [...] "defending its frontiers against alternative soteriologies— either by defining its own position with greater and greater <b>exactness,</b> or by attacking other religions, and particularly the Hellenistic mysteries." [...] In fact, {{a good deal of}} the early Christian literature is devoted to the exposure and refutation of unorthodox [...] theology, mystery religions and Gnostic groups. Irenaeus, Tertullian and Hippolytus of Rome were among the greatest early Christian apologetes who engaged in critical analyses of unorthodox theology, Greco-Roman pagan religions, and Gnostic groups.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{mathematical}} work, Oresme {{developed the}} notion of incommensurate fractions, fractions {{that could not be}} expressed as powers of one another, and made probabilistic, statistical arguments as to their relative frequency. From this, he argued that it was very probable that the length of the day and the year were incommensurate (irrational), as indeed were the periods of the motions of the moon and the planets. [...] From this, he noted that planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way. [...] Oresme maintained that this disproves the claims of astrologers who, thinking [...] "they know with punctual <b>exactness</b> the motions, aspects, conjunctions and oppositions… [...] rashly and erroneously about future events." ...|$|E
