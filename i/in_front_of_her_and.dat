500|$|The {{design team}} for the series {{conceived}} eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's [...] and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti. Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes [...] "wouldn't be possible in real life". [...] "There's {{a moment in the}} episode," [...] Jean resumed, [...] "when she starts out with her hair down. Then, there's a curtain pulled <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> in seconds, she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy. In real life, that would probably take 8 hours." [...] Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn, including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress. [...] "We did a lot of research, looking back at her old outfits, and she's really been in a million different things, had a million different looks." ...|$|E
