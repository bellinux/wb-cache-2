Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital.

2500|$|Helm was {{requested}} by the Board of Church Extension to formulate a plan including constitution and bylaws for establishing a Woman's Department of Church Extension for parsonage-building, to be submitted to the Board of Church Extension held in January, 1886. She did so and her paper was referred to a committee consisting of Bishop R. K. Hargrove (Chairman) and Rev. H. C. Settle and J. G. Carter, Esq. Her idea was to make provision in the constitution at that time for some phases of local home mission work, but this was strenuously opposed {{on the ground that}} it would embrace too much. In May, 1886, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South authorized the Board of Church Extension to organize the woman's organization known as the Woman's Department of Church Extension, until 1890, when it received a more definite title, Woman's Parsonage and Home Mission Society. Helm was appointed the General secretary of the department, and her work grew rapidly from the very beginning. Helm went from one Conference to another, organizing Parsonage Societies and inspiring the women with a zeal for the work. Letters poured <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>office</b> from the Indian Mission, Montana, Oregon, California, and all of the Southern states and she replied to all of them. In all her explanatory leaflets and articles, and in her plans for the establishment of new departments of the work she wrote clearly, accurately, and with a mastery of the subject.|$|E

Her plan, born in one lightning-like flash of thought, necessitated the careful wording of telegrams to Washington, to New York, to San Antonio. These were to Senators, Representatives, men high {{in public and}} private life, men who would remember her and who would serve her to their utmost. Never before had her position meant anything to her comparable with what it meant now. Never in all her life had money seemed the power that it was then. If she had been poor! A shuddering chill froze the thought at its inception. She dispelled heartbreaking thoughts. She had power. She had wealth. She would set into operation all the unlimited means these gave her--the wires and pulleys and strings underneath the surface of political and international life, the open, free, purchasing value of money or the deep, underground, mysterious, incalculably powerful influence moved by gold. She could save Stewart. She must await results--deadlocked in feeling, strained perhaps almost beyond endurance, because the suspense would be great; but she would allow no possibility of failure to enter her mind.|$|E
