5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget <b>deficit</b> <b>by</b> increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Insight Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:30p.m. EST on December 26, 2003. From the {{beginning}} of the game, it was a quick-paced, high-scoring contest. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech jumped out to a 21–7 lead courtesy of the Tech passing game, which was coordinated by quarterback Bryan Randall, who threw four touchdowns during the game. In the second quarter, California recovered from its 14-point first-quarter <b>deficit</b> <b>by</b> scoring twotouchdowns. Tech, meanwhile, scored another, and took a 28–21 lead into halftime.|$|E

5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation {{was running}} a major <b>deficit</b> <b>by</b> 1996, and in April Edmonton City Council {{declined}} to renew a $100,000 annual grant which the Foundation had received since 1985. The Foundation needed cash, and quickly sold the theatre for $450,000 to Calgary’s Brar family, owners of the Plaza Theatre in that city. The decision was not popular, and even Old Strathcona Foundation member Judy Berghofer called the sale hasty.|$|E
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound <b>deficit</b> <b>by</b> 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{rallied to}} beat the New Orleans Saints 20–17 in front of 72,769 fans at Giants Stadium in week four. They {{came back from a}} 17–0 second quarter <b>deficit,</b> <b>by</b> scoring 20 points in the final three quarters. Rueben Mayes of the Saints {{returned}} the second half kickoff 99yards for an apparent touchdown only to have the play called back because of an illegal block by linebacker Sam Mills. The decisive points came on Phil Simms's 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zeke Mowatt midway through the fourth quarter. The Giants dominated the Saints in time of possession, holding the ball for 38 minutes and 47 seconds to the Saints 21 minutes and 13 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time <b>deficit</b> <b>by</b> one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
