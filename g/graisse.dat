60|$|One evening, perhaps {{four days}} after Nick's departure, I went into the common room of the tavern, and there I was {{surprised}} to see an old friend. His square, saffron face was just the same, his little jet eyes snapped as brightly as ever, his hair--which was swept high above his forehead and tied in an eelskin behind--was as black as when I had seen it at Kaskaskia. I had met Monsieur Vigo many times since, for he was a familiar figure amongst the towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi, and from Vincennes to Anse a la <b>Graisse,</b> and even to New Orleans. His reputation as a financier was greater than ever. He was talking to my friend, Mr. Marshall, but he rose when he saw me, with a beaming smile.|$|E

If travelling in a hot, dry country, grease plentifully both your shoes and all other leather. [...] "La <b>graisse</b> est la conservation du cuir," [...] as I recollect a Chamouni guide enunciating with profound emphasis. The soles of plaited cord used {{in parts of the}} Pyrenees, are durable and excellent for clambering over smooth rock. They have a far better hold upon it than any other sole of which I have knowledge. Sandals are better than nothing at all. So are cloths wound round the feet and ankles and tied there: the peasants of the remarkable hilly place where I am writing these lines, namely Amalfi, use them much. They are an untidy chaussure, but never seem to require to be tied afresh. In the old days of Rome this sort of foot-gear was common. Haybands wound round the feet are a common makeshift by soldiers who are cut off from their supplies. It takes some months to harden the feet sufficiently {{to be able to walk}} without shoes at all. Slippers are great luxuries to foot-sore men. They should of course be of soft material, but the soles should not be too thin or they will be too cold for comfort in camp life.|$|E

50|$|<b>Graisse</b> {{is a white}} French {{wine grape}} variety that is grown {{primarily}} in the Armagnac region of western France where the grape is used for both wine production and distillation. The pulp of the grape is characterized by its high viscosity levels, which can create some difficulties in winemaking, to produce a wine that expert Jancis Robinson describes as being of average to low quality. In recent years, plantings of <b>Graisse</b> have been steadily declining.|$|E

Chalosse Noire can also refer to a number of black grape varieties.|$|E
50|$|Such {{a highly}} conventionalized theme, with {{undertones}} of eroticism justified by its mythological context, was ripe for modernist deconstruction; in 1870 Arthur Rimbaud evoked {{the image of}} a portly Clara Venus ("famous Venus") with all-too-human blemishes (déficits) in a sardonic poem that introduced cellulite to high literature: La <b>graisse</b> sous la peau paraît en feuilles plates ("the fat under the skin appears in slabs").|$|E

50|$|In 1788, the Spanish Crown offered Morgan a land {{grant in}} order to create a colony on the western bank of the Mississippi River, a {{territory}} formerly controlled by France as a part of French Louisiana, New France, and ceded to Spain in 1763 after the French and Indian War. In January 1789 - June 1789, Morgan conducted surveying expedition which included Colonel Israel Shreve. The expedition left Pittsburgh on January 3, 1789; traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi River, and arrived at Anse a la <b>Graisse,</b> a Lenape settlement in the Spanish Louisiana Territory, on March 13, 1789. Morgan mapped out a town which he called New Madrid, one mile below the present site of New Madrid, Missouri. He returned to Pittsburgh in June 1789 and continued to negotiate with the Spanish. After a few years, he abandoned his colonization plans.|$|E

He was to [...] "set forward the device for Berwick": {{to design the}} new works. Lee also went to the Siege of Leith on 27 April 1560 asked to, [...] "prick them forward to an end." [...] This was probably to help plan the assault on 7 May which failed. Lee made a map of Leith which was sent to London on 15 May 1560. Lee and Pelham, a captain at Leith, were called before Elizabeth I of England in June 1564, perhaps to give their testimony on affairs at Leith. When in London at this period, Lee stayed {{at the house of}} Mr. <b>Graisse</b> in Cheapside. In 1565 Lee viewed the site of Lindisfarne Castle on Beblowe Crag.|$|E
50|$|In 1788 he led {{his wife}} and six of his children, along with twenty one other {{settlers}} to south-western Pennsylvania, and settled in Rostraver Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. In January 1789 - June 1789, Shreve accompanied retired Continental Army colonel George Morgan to Spanish Louisiana Territory to survey the western bank of the Mississippi River. Morgan, who was a land developer, received permission from the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Don Diego de Gardoqui to establish a colony on the Mississippi River at Anse a la <b>Graisse,</b> located in present-day Missouri. On January 3, 1789, the expedition departed from Pittsburgh and traveled along the Ohio and Mississippi River until they reached Anse a la Graisse; a new town was demarcated and named New Madrid by Morgan. On June 19, 1789, members of the expedition including Shreve safely returned to Pittsburgh. During the journey, Shreve kept a journal, in which he described geography, environment, and encounters with the Native Americans.|$|E

This rather bizarre phrase is a throw-away line neither explained nor repeated, but it adds to Duvivier’s unsavoury portrait of the Kasbah, the gist of which he probably assumed viewers would grasp.
