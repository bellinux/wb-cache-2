5000|$|These {{types of}} {{polymers}} {{have played a}} role in biomedical and robotic applications and liquid crystalline polymers. In 1974, R.B. Meyer predicted ferroelectricity in chiral smectic liquid crystals by pure symmetry conditions. Shortly after, Clark and Lagerwall had done work on the fast <b>electrooptic</b> <b>effect</b> in a surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) structure. This opened up promising possibility of technical applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals in high-information display devices. Through applied research, it was shown that SSFLC structure has faster switching times and bistability behavior in comparison with commonly used nematic liquid crystal displays. In the same time period, the first side-chain liquid crystalline polymers (SCLCP) were synthesized. These comb-like polymers has mesogenic side chains that are covalently bonded (via flexible spacer units) to the polymer backbone. The most important feature of the SCLCP's is their glassy state. In other words, these polymers have a [...] "frozen" [...] ordered state along one axis when cooled below their glass transition temperature. This is advantageous for research in the area of nonlinear optical and optical data storage devices. The disadvantage is that these SCLCP's suffered from their slow switching times due to their high rotational viscosity.|$|E

The electromagnetic fields computed by FDTD are coupled to standard electro-optic relations that characterize electo-optic interactions. This novel approach to LiNbO 3 electro-optic modulators using a coupled FDTD technique allows for previously unattainable investigations into device operating bandwidth and data transmission speed. On the other hand, the proposed multiresolution approach {{presented in this paper}} solves Maxwell’s Equations on nonuniform self-adaptive grids, obtained by applying wavelet transforms followed by hard thresholding.

40|$|HERE HAS been a {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} elecrroop T tic effects in semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) for their improved performance in various optoelectmnic devices [l]. This is because of a large change in the electric field induced refractive index variation (An/n M 1 %) due to the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) in the QWs around the excitonic absorption edge as compared to those in mnven-tional materials, such as bulk III-V semicondum (An/n M 0. 01 %) and LiNbO 3 (An/n = 0. 1 %). Recently the technique of using thermal annealing to produce diffusion modified non-square QWs (DFQW's) has received much attention for the monolithic integration of devices, such as waveguides, modulators, and lasers, in optoelectronic integrated circuits 121.

Colloidal particles can be added as a “dopant” to the liquids in these devices to provide functionality that cannot be obtained with homogenous fluids. We examine <b>electrooptic</b> <b>effects</b> in liquid suspensions asymmetric metallic nanoparticles. The theoretical optical properties of gold nanorods and noble metal nanohalfshells are computed and {{compared with those of}} actual colloidal dispersions. We discuss the design and fabrication of electro-optic waveguides utilizing these suspensions as the active material. We also study the dynamics of photothermal holograms recorded by nanosecond laser pulses in suspensions of silver nanospheres. Unexpected transients in the grating diffraction efficiency correspond to the nanoscale inhomgeneity of the colloid. Longer timescale decay can be used to measure the thermal conductivity of the liquid as predicted by the established theory of heat conduction. This technique is extended to perform spatial imaging of the thermal diffusivity of immiscible binary liquids. Gold nanosphere coated substrates for microfluidic devices are employed to enable optical actuation of fluids. Nanoparticle absorption of continuous wave laser light was used to trap air bubbles inside partially filled microfluidic channels. Light focused on the array near one side of the trapped bubble will drive a mass flow across the bubble. This evaporative bubble assisted mass transport mechanism can be operated as a pump powered by a stationary laser beam. In addition, the process efficiently separates volatile and non-volatile materials and can concentrate and purify specimens in solution. Finally, several schemes for storing and extracting data from subwavelength volumes using spectral multiplexing of semiconductor quantum dots are explored. We demonstrate microfluidic composition and delivery of cocktails of several colors of quantum dots to act as information packets for optical storage. In addition we analyze imaging at the subwavelength level using a patterned surface of quantum dots. The theoretical performance of such a surface is compared to imaging through nanoapertures as is currently implemented in optofluidic microscopy. ...|$|R

40|$|We present {{measurements}} and calculations of the terahertz (THz) electric field measured in the near field of a metal tip used in THz apertureless near-field optical microscopy (THz-ANSOM). An analytical model in which we treat the metal tip as a linear wire antenna allows us to predict {{almost all of the}} features observed in the measurements, such as the relatively slow decay of the near-field amplitude when the tip-crystal separation increases. When the tip-crystal separation is modulated, in conjunction with lock-in detection at the modulation frequency, a smaller THz spot size is observed underneath the tip. A comparison with analytical expressions shows that in this case the electric field originates predominantly from the tip apex, with negligible contributions from the tip shaft. In the unmodulated case, the observed signal is the spatial integral of the <b>electrooptic</b> (EO) <b>effect</b> over the interaction length between the THz near field and the probe laser pulse.

OCIS codes: (230. 4110) Modulators; (230. 5750) Resonators. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) based optoelectronic and photonic devices and circuits are attractive {{due to their}} fabrication compatibility with the CMOS process and possibility of monolithic integration on CMOS chips. Most of the proposed Si electro-optic (E-O) modulators, however, are long and require high drive powers for obtaining a significant modulation depth.
