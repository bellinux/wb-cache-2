25|$|Turing Award laureate Vinton Cerf was a {{doctoral}} student in the computer science department under Kleinrock in the early 1970s and also worked on the ARPANET.

25|$|The {{population}} of Babylonia was multi-ethnic from early times, and <b>intercommunication</b> between the cities was incessant. Every city {{had a large}} number of resident aliens. This freedom of intercourse must have tended to assimilate custom. It was, however, reserved for the genius of Hammurabi to make Babylon his metropolis and weld together his vast empire by a uniform system of law.|$|E

However, these two streams hypothesis, although useful, are a simplification of the visual system because the two streams maintain <b>intercommunication</b> along their entire rostral course.|$|E
25|$|The {{armoured}} regiments {{were organized}} along British lines although with fewer tanks than their British counterparts. A New Zealand armoured regiment consisted of 52 Sherman tanks.

60|$|For some minutes, Granville gazed around him, half dazed, {{and in a}} {{turmoil of}} surprise, yet with a vivid passion of acute inquiry. Now he was once well awake, he must know all immediately. But how? Who to ask? This was terrible, terrible. He had no means of <b>intercommunication</b> {{with the people in}} the hut. He knew none of their language, nor they of his. He was utterly alone, among unmitigated savages.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, {{thinking}} {{it best to}} speak the truth at once. 'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present.

60|$|The {{transitory}} mental aberration of Sidney Davidson, remarkable {{enough in}} itself, {{is still more}} remarkable if Wade's explanation is to be credited. It sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of <b>intercommunication</b> in the future, of spending an intercalary five minutes {{on the other side}} of the world, or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected eyes. It happened that I was the immediate witness of Davidson's seizure, and so it falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper.|$|E
60|$|On a {{comprehensive}} summing {{up of the}} processes and present and hitherto condition of the United States, with reference to their future, and the indispensable precedents to it, my point, below all surfaces, and subsoiling them, is, that the bases and prerequisites of a leading nationality are, first, at all hazards, freedom, worldly wealth and products on {{the largest and most}} varied scale, common education and <b>intercommunication,</b> and, in general, the passing through of just the stages and crudities we have passed or are passing through in the United States.|$|E
60|$|At {{the time}} of which we write {{it was not an}} {{uncommon}} thing, in the provinces on the western coast of South America, for dissatisfied military officers, with a number of malcontents, to get up miniature revolutions, which were generally put down after much plundering and bloodshed. These bands of armed men went about like regular banditti, disturbing the peace of the whole country. They were not much heard of in Europe, because <b>intercommunication</b> and telegraphy did not exist then as they do now, and insignificant affairs of the kind were not taken much notice of.|$|E
6000|$|As for the unselfish and tender-hearted Rinka, she {{of course}} {{returned}} with Ondikik to {{the realms of}} ice, and made that fortunate savage happy. Indeed, she made every one happy who came within her benign influence, and if the truth had been spoken out by every one, we suspect {{it would have been}} found that to her attractive powers was due much of the enthusiasm for <b>intercommunication</b> that existed between the Red men and the walrus-hunters, for the principle still holds good, in savage not less than in civilised lands, that [...] "love is the fulfilling of the law." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the power}} of <b>intercommunication</b> is {{certainly}} of high service to many animals, there is no a priori improbability in the supposition, that gestures manifestly of an opposite nature to those by which certain feelings are already expressed, should at first have been voluntarily employed {{under the influence of}} an opposite state of feeling. The fact of the gestures being now innate, would be no valid objection to the belief that they were at first intentional; for if practised during many generations, they would probably at last be inherited. Nevertheless it is more than doubtful, as we shall immediately see, whether any of the cases which come under our present head of antithesis, have thus originated.|$|E
60|$|One hears {{a lot of}} the {{rigorous}} research into the problem of cancer that is now going on. Does the reader realise that all the men in the whole world who are giving any considerable proportion of their time to this cancer research would pack into a very small room, that they are working in little groups without any properly organised system of <b>intercommunication,</b> and that half of them are earning {{less than a quarter of}} the salary of a Bond Street shopwalker by those vastly important inquiries? Not one cancer case in twenty thousand is being properly described and reported. And yet, in comparison with other diseases, cancer is being particularly well attended to.|$|E
6000|$|Oct. 17, '79.--To-day {{one of the}} {{newspapers}} of St. Louis prints the following informal remarks of mine on American, especially Western literature: [...] "We called on Mr. Whitman yesterday and after a somewhat desultory conversation abruptly asked him: 'Do you think we are to have a distinctively American literature?' 'It seems to me,' said he,'that our work at present is to lay the foundations of a great nation in products, in agriculture, in commerce, in networks of <b>intercommunication,</b> and in all that relates to the comforts of vast masses of men and families, with freedom of speech, ecclesiasticism, &c. These we have founded and are carrying out on a grander scale than ever hitherto, and Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas and Colorado, {{seem to me to}} be the seat and field of these very facts and ideas. Materialistic prosperity in all its varied forms, with those other points that I mentioned, <b>intercommunication</b> and freedom, are first to be attended to. When those have their results and get settled, then a literature worthy of us will begin to be defined. Our American superiority and vitality are in the bulk of our people, not in a gentry like the old world. The greatness of our army during the secession war, was in the rank and file, and so with the nation. Other lands have their vitality in a few, a class, but we have it in the bulk of the people. Our leading men are not of much account and never have been, but the average of the people is immense, beyond all history. Sometimes I think in all departments, literature and art included, that will be the way our superiority will exhibit itself. We will not have great individuals or great leaders, but a great average bulk, unprecedentedly great.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|To conclude. The railway power, we know well, {{will not}} admit of being {{materially}} counteracted by sentiment; {{and who would}} wish it where large towns are connected, {{and the interests of}} trade and agriculture are substantially promoted, by such mode of <b>intercommunication?</b> But be it remembered, that this case is, as has been said before, a peculiar one, and that the staple of the country is its beauty and its character of retirement. Let then the beauty be undisfigured and the retirement unviolated, unless there be reason for believing that rights and interests of a higher kind and more apparent than those which have been urged in behalf of the projected intrusion will compensate the sacrifice. Thanking you for the judicious observations that have appeared in your paper upon the subject of railways, ...|$|E
6000|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have been made}} in consciously transferring thoughts or emotions from one mind to another. These are very liable to be vitiated by bad observation, collusion and other causes. Meanwhile, <b>intercommunication</b> between mind and mind without the aid of the recognised senses--a supposed process of [...] "telepathy"--is a current explanation of the dreams in which knowledge is obtained that exists in the mind of another person, and of the delusion by virtue of which one person sees another who is perhaps dying, or in some other crisis, at a distance. The idea is popular. A poor Highland woman wrote to her son in Glasgow: [...] "Don't be thinking too much of us, or I shall be seeing you some evening in the byre". This is a simple expression of the hypothesis of [...] "telepathy" [...] or [...] "mental telegraphy".|$|E
60|$|Signalling by {{heliograph}} was {{throughout the}} operations of the greatest value. I had always realised the advantages of a semi-permanent line of signal stations along the communications to the telegraph, but I had doubted the practicability of using such complicated arrangements in action. In this torrid country, where the sun is always shining, the heliograph is always useful. As soon as any hill was taken, communication was established with the brigadier, and no difficulty seemed to be met with, even while the attack was in progress, in sending messages quickly and clearly. In a country intersected by frequent ravines, over which a horse can move but slowly and painfully, it is the surest, the quickest, and indeed the only means of <b>intercommunication.</b> I am delighted to testify to these things, because I had formerly been a scoffer.|$|E
6000|$|... "In days of old," [...] I {{said to my}} skipper, in {{our last}} {{conversation}} on this subject, which we were fond of discussing, [...] "the nations were less educated than now, and less imbued perhaps {{with the principles of}} the peace-teaching gospel, which many of them profess to believe; but now the Christian world is almost out of its teens; <b>intercommunication</b> of ideas and interests is almost miraculously facile. Thought is well-nigh instantaneously flashed from hemisphere to hemisphere, if not from pole to pole; commerce is so highly cultivated that international exhibitions of the raw material and the fabrics of all nations are the order of the day; while good-will between man and man--to say nothing of woman--is so prevalent, that I really {{find it hard to believe}} in the possibility of a great European war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{anybody could}} call {{you up at}} any time and talk?" [...] said the Man in Asbestos, with {{something}} like horror. [...] "How awful! What a dreadful age yours was, to be sure. No, the telephone {{and all the rest of}} it, all the transportation and <b>intercommunication</b> was cut out and forbidden. There was no sense in it. You see," [...] he added, [...] "what you don't realise is that people after your day became gradually more and more reasonable. Take the railroad, what good was that? It brought into every town a lot of people from every other town. Who wanted them? Nobody. When work stopped and commerce ended, and food was needless, and the weather killed, it was foolish to move about. So it was all terminated. Anyway," [...] he said, with a quick look of apprehension and a change in his voice, [...] "it was dangerous!" ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not believe}} for one moment the thing would stop at such a subsidized body of authors, such a little {{aristocracy}} of thought, as this project presents. But {{it would be an}} efficient starting-point. There are those who demand a thinking department for Army and Navy; and that idea admits of extension in this direction, this organized general literature of mine would be the thinking organization of the race. Once this deliberate organization of a central ganglion of interpretation and presentation began, the development of the brain and nervous system in the social body would proceed apace. Each step made would enable the next step to be wider and bolder. The general innervation of society with books and book distributing agencies would be followed by the linking up of the now almost isolated mental worlds of science, art, and political and social activity in a system of <b>intercommunication</b> and sympathy.|$|E
60|$|But {{it could}} not be. A few hours at Grenada, and a few hours at St. Lucia, were all the {{stoppages}} possible to us. The steamer only passes once a fortnight, and {{it is necessary to}} spend that time on each island which is visited, unless the traveller commits himself-- which he cannot well do if he has a lady with him--to the chances and changes of coasting schooners. More frequent and easy <b>intercommunication</b> is needed throughout the Antilles. The good people, whether white or coloured, need to see more of each other, and more of visitors from home. Whether a small weekly steamer between the islands would pay in money, I know not. That it would pay morally and socially, I am sure. Perhaps, when the telegraph is laid down along the islands, the need of more steamers will be felt and supplied.|$|E
60|$|A {{friendly}} <b>intercommunication</b> being thus commenced, {{the example}} spread very rapidly; matrimonial alliances {{began to be}} formed, and, in a word, a short time only elapsed before the two camps were united and intermingled, the Scythians and the Amazons being all paired together in the most intimate relations of domestic life. Thus, true to the instincts of their sex, the rude and terrible maidens decided, when the alternative was fairly presented to them, in favor of husbands and homes, rather than continuing the life they had led, of independence, conflict, and plunder. It is curious to observe that {{the means by which}} they were won, namely, a persevering display of admiration and attentions, steadily continued, but not too eagerly and impatiently pressed, and varied with an adroit and artful alternation of advances and retreats, were precisely the same as those by which, in every age, the attempt is usually made to win the heart of woman from hatred and hostility to love.|$|E
60|$|And {{now from}} the sixteenth century onward, as an {{inevitable}} by-product of systematic thought, appeared a steadily increasing series of inventions and devices affecting the <b>intercommunication</b> and interaction of men with one another. They all tended towards wider range of action, greater mutual benefits or injuries, and increased co-operation, and they came faster and faster. Men's minds had not been prepared for anything of the sort, and until the great catastrophes {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century quickened men's minds, the historian has very little to tell of any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new conditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating. The history of mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an imprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison that restrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking but incorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and incongruous dreams, than like that of a man consciously awake to danger and opportunity.|$|E
60|$|Involuntary and purposeless contractions of {{the muscles}} of the chest and glottis, excited in the above manner, may have first given rise to the {{emission}} of vocal sounds. But the voice is now largely used by many animals for various purposes; and habit seems to have played an important part in its employment under other circumstances. Naturalists have remarked, I believe with truth, that social animals, from habitually using their vocal organs as a means of <b>intercommunication,</b> use them on other occasions much more freely than other animals. But there are marked exceptions to this rule, for instance, with the rabbit. The principle, also, of association, which is so widely extended in its power, has likewise played its part. Hence it follows that the voice, from having been habitually employed as a serviceable aid under certain conditions, inducing pleasure, pain, rage, &c,, is commonly used whenever the same sensations or emotions are excited, under quite different conditions, or in a lesser degree.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{division}} of the country into so many States and nations that made Thuggee possible and prosperous. It is difficult to realize the situation. But perhaps one may approximate it by imagining the States of our Union peopled by separate nations, speaking separate languages, with guards and custom-houses strung along all frontiers, plenty of interruptions for travelers and traders, interpreters able to handle all the languages very rare or non-existent, and a few wars always going on here and there and yonder as a further embarrassment to commerce and excursioning. It would make <b>intercommunication</b> in a measure ungeneral. India had eighty languages, and more custom-houses than cats. No clever man with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice what a chance for business was here offered. India was full of clever men with the highwayman instinct, and so, quite naturally, the brotherhood of the Thugs came into being to meet the long-felt want.|$|E
6000|$|The general {{complacency}} {{with the}} progress in knowledge we have made and are making is ridiculously unjustifiable. Enormous things were no doubt done {{in the nineteenth century}} in many fields of knowledge, but all that was done was out of all proportion petty in comparison with what might have been done. I suppose the whole of the unprecedented progress in material knowledge of the nineteenth century was the work of two or three thousand men, who toiled against opposition, spite and endless disadvantages, without proper means of <b>intercommunication</b> and with wretched facilities for experiment. Such discoveries as were distinctively medical were the work of only a few hundred men. Now, suppose instead of that scattered band of un-co-ordinated workers a great army {{of hundreds of thousands of}} well-paid men; suppose, for instance, the community had kept as many scientific and medical investigators as it has bookmakers and racing touts and men about town--should we not know a thousand times as much as we do about disease and health and strength and power? ...|$|E
6000|$|We now {{proceed to}} examine those islands {{which are the}} very reverse of the [...] "oceanic" [...] class, being {{fragments}} of continents or of larger islands from {{which they have been}} separated, by subsidence of the intervening land at a period which, geologically, must be considered recent. Such islands are always still connected with their parent land by a shallow sea, usually indeed not exceeding a hundred fathoms deep; they always possess mammalia and reptiles either wholly or in large proportion identical with those of the mainland; while their entire flora and fauna is characterised either by the total absence or comparative scarcity of those endemic or peculiar species and genera which are so striking a feature of almost all oceanic islands. Such islands will, of course, differ from each {332} other in size, in antiquity, and in the richness of their respective faunas, as well as in their distance from the parent land and the facilities for <b>intercommunication</b> with it; and these diversities of conditions will manifest themselves in the greater or less amount of speciality of their animal productions.|$|E
60|$|We {{will now}} {{consider}} how the principle of antithesis in expression has arisen. With social animals, the power of <b>intercommunication</b> between {{the members of the}} same community,--and with other species, between the opposite sexes, as well as between the young and the old,-- is of the highest importance to them. This is generally effected by means of the voice, but it is certain that gestures and expressions are to a certain extent mutually intelligible. Man not only uses inarticulate cries, gestures, and expressions, but has invented articulate language; if, indeed, the word INVENTED can be applied to a process, completed by innumerable steps, half-consciously made. Any one who has watched monkeys will not doubt that they perfectly understand each other's gestures and expression, and to a large extent, as Rengger asserts,[1] those of man. An animal when going to attack another, or when afraid of another, often makes itself appear terrible, by erecting its hair, thus increasing the apparent bulk of its body, by showing its teeth, or brandishing its horns, or by uttering fierce sounds.|$|E
60|$|The {{suggestions}} of the Postmaster-General for {{improvements in the}} Department presided over by him are earnestly recommended to you, special attention. Especially do I recommend favorable consideration of the plan for uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, rendered. It would secure the further advantage of extending the telegraph through portions {{of the country where}} private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into a community of interest are always benefited by a rapid <b>intercommunication.</b> Education, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encouraged by increasing the facilities to gather speedy news {{from all parts of the}} country. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General for full details of the operations of last year and for comparative statements of results with former years.|$|E
6000|$|The {{other men}} in the gang were not {{agreeable}} or congenial companions. They taught me their established modes of <b>intercommunication,</b> and told me several facts about themselves, which did not tend to endear them to me. One of them, 1247, was put in for the manslaughter of his wife by kicking; he was a low-browed, brutal London drayman, and he occupied the next cell to mine, where he disturbed me much in my sleepless nights by his loud snoring. Another, a much slighter and more intelligent-looking man, was a skilled burglar, sentenced to fourteen years for [...] "cracking a crib" [...] in the neighbourhood of Hampstead. A third was a sailor, convicted of gross cruelty to a defenceless Lascar. They all told me {{the nature of their}} crimes with a brutal frankness which fairly surprised me; but when I explained to them in return that I had been put in upon a false accusation, they treated my remarks with a galling contempt that was absolutely unsupportable. After a short time I ceased to communicate with my fellow-prisoners in any way, and remained shut up with my own thoughts in utter isolation.|$|E
