Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Eventually, he lobbied to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> {{duckling}} as fat {{as possible}} {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

The first aircraft were operational in 1948, consisting of three three-passenger Republic RC-3 Seabees and a one-passenger Luscombe 8A Silvaire.

However, the airline never signed a fixed contract with the health authorities and had to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> trip refunded on a case for case basis form the National Insurance Administration.|$|E

25|$|In Southeast Asia, {{presence}} of Hui Muslims may date back 700 {{years to the}} time of Zheng He who was a Hui. Hui also became part of the wave of Chinese migrants that peaked between 1875 and 1912, and they inhabited Penang, Sabah, Singapore and Pangkor prior to World War II. Most were Hokkien-speaking coolies and merchants originating from Fujian. The colonial British welfare system was commissioned according to language groups, so the Hui were classed as Hokkien. The small number of Hui may have become assimilated into mainstream Chinese society and local Muslim populations. In 1975, five Hui leaders started a campaign to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> clansman to put up a notice listing their ancestral for 40 generations, as a way of reminding them of their origins. The exact Hui population is unclear today as many families left Islam before independence. In 2000 official census figures gave the number of Muslim Chinese in Malaysia as 57,000 but most were Han converts. According to the Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association the surnames Koay, Ma, Ha, Ta, Sha, Woon, and An (or Ang) may indicate Hui ancestry.|$|E
500|$|D'Esposito {{chose to}} {{differentiate}} the short from The First Avenger by avoiding the sepia tone used for that film by director Joe Johnston, instead using a cooler blue color. The production used two old lenses (for both night and day) {{that gave the}} short some [...] "better" [...] lens flares that D'Esposito felt gave the period setting a more modern feel. D'Esposito used a Steadicam or a camera dolly for the action sequences, to avoid a [...] "quick cutty or blurry or shaky" [...] feel. D'Esposito said that the crew was ultimately [...] "pushing our limit" [...] to get the planned shots on schedule, and he eventually realized that he [...] "wasn’t going to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> shot and I wasn’t going to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> punch and kick, so {{what we do is}} get the optimum".|$|E

He said, [...] "I'm reaching out to everyone I possibly can to <b>get</b> <b>every</b> side of the story." [...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Dale {{replaced}} Peter Davison in {{the lead}} role of King Arthur in the London West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at the Palace Theatre. He accepted the role {{because he was a}} fan of Monty Python and considered that [...] "life's too short" [...] for him to have turned down a West End part. Although he has seen all of the shows and the other films, Dale had never seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail (from which Spamalot is [...] "lovingly ripped off") and had to buy a copy to prepare for the role. It was not his first experience in musical theatre because he appeared in a 1984 Australian production of Applause, but Dale found the comic timing of the part to be the hardest task. [...] "On stage, the battle is to find all of the humorous moments and not skip over them. [...] There's an art to Python humour and I'm aiming to try and <b>get</b> <b>every</b> single joke just right." [...] He was succeeded in the role by Sanjeev Bhaskar on 23 June 2008.|$|E
