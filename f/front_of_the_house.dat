5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E
5|$|The house {{includes}} several paintings from the National Trust's collection, including {{a painting of}} the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> by John S. Goodall.|$|E
50|$|In the 1770s, the Varlaam Khutynsky chapel {{was built}} on a little cape in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> <b>The</b> chapel remains almost {{completely}} intact, although all icons were removed from it after the Russian Revolution.|$|R

5|$|Most {{scenes of}} the video {{take place in a}} large house. Throughout the video, the pair are {{touching}} and kissing with each other, and McKee is shown in the bathtub. In the concluding scenes, she leaves the house and is depicted as a bright star that travels towards the sky, while Cruz stands in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> by the pool.|$|E
5|$|The pond garden, seat {{garden and}} croquet lawn are interlinked, with aligned {{openings}} {{to form a}} vista from the bay windows of the Great Parlour and Great Chamber on the south <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> over to the Sparkford plain. A short tunnel of hornbeams link the Pond Garden to the Vase Garden, where variegated weigela is underplanted with euphorbia and vinca.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|Eva and {{her ex-husband}} take Ellen {{to the airport}} for her flight to college. A few months later, on Thanksgiving Day, Eva drives by Albert's home and stops in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{on her way to}} pick up Ellen from the airport. He sees her and she awkwardly waves. He {{eventually}} comes outside, to Eva's surprise, and sits with her on the porch while they begin to renew their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In the grounds, {{the only}} certain {{survivor}} from the medieval period {{is the small}} crenellated drum tower. Its original purpose is unknown. It adjoins a substantial wall that may also have origins in the 13th century. The other garden walls have unknown dates of origin but mostly pre-date around 1730, when the stables were built. All of the other buildings, including the lodge at the South entrance (1851) are Georgian or Victorian.

5|$|Like all Hindu Marathi {{people and}} to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians, Diwali is {{celebrate}}d over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins. Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up {{early in the morning}} and having an Abhyangasnan. People light their houses with lamps and candles, and burst fire crackers over the course of the festival. Special sweets and savouries like Anarse, Karanjya, Chakli, Chiwda and Ladu are prepared for the festival. Colourful Rangoli drawings are made in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Marathi children make a replica mud fort in memory of Shivaji, the great Maratha king.|$|E
5|$|The Mao {{family lived}} in a clay-brick {{farmhouse}} which had been constructed in 1878, although Yichang oversaw its extension during Zedong's boyhood. They occupied the eastern wing of their house, with the neighboring Zou family living in the western half. The building was large enough for Zedong to be allocated his own bedroom; a rarity at the time. In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was a pond and a rice paddy, while pine and bamboo groves grew behind the building.|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a table in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E

He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and flies {{him to the}} North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) {{only to find out}} that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer has to give him a dirt bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are.|$|E
5|$|In 1741, the 2nd Marquis of Annandale left Craigiehall to his nephew, Charles Hope-Weir (1710–1791), {{second son}} of Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. Hope-Weir {{travelled}} to Europe on the grand tour in 1754-55, taking {{with him the}} young architect Robert Adam, and was inspired to improve the Craigiehall policies on his return. A walled forecourt and the formal gardens in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> were removed. He also planted numerous trees across the estate, laid out avenues, and had several garden buildings constructed. A lake was excavated, and a new bridge over the River Almond was constructed to link the neighbouring estate of Lennie, which Hope-Weir had bought in 1750.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E

50|$|In Tañarandy, {{a company}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> is usually painted with {{illustrations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work their inhabitants do.

5|$|On {{the first}} floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery. The east bedchamber is at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and {{projects}} out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York. Some of the makers' marks of the original builders can still {{be seen on the}} timbers in the room. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th-century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling has been left in place. The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, tiled with Cornish slate.|$|E
5|$|Rififis heist {{scene was}} based on an actual {{burglary}} that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> Un-American Activities Committee. This act was not in the original novel.|$|E
5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in the ceiling of the Brew-house below.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} <b>the</b> {{invasion}} <b>of</b> Iraq had begun, protests {{were held in}} cities around the world.
