25|$|A {{feral cat}} population, {{descendants}} of cats likely brought by colonists in the 1930s, wrought disruption to the island's wildlife and vegetation. These cats were removed through efforts {{which began in}} the mid-1960s and lasted until 1990 when they were completely eradicated. Nineteenth-century tram track remains {{can be seen in the}} dried lagoon bed at the island's center and the late 1930s-era lighthouse-shaped <b>day</b> <b>beacon</b> still stands on the western shore at the site of Millersville.|$|E
25|$|John T. Arundel & Co. resumed mining guano from 1886 to 1899. The United Kingdom annexed {{the island}} on June 3, 1889. Phosphate and copra {{entrepreneur}} John T. Arundel visited {{the island in}} 1909 on maiden voyage of the S.S. Ocean Queen and near the beach landing on the western shore members of the crew built a pyramidal <b>day</b> <b>beacon</b> made from slats of wood, which was painted white. The beacon was standing in 1935, and remained until at least 1942.|$|E

25|$|The atoll has no {{economic}} activity. It {{is perhaps best}} known as the island Amelia Earhart was searching for but never reached when her airplane disappeared on July 2, 1937, during her planned round-the-world flight. Airstrips constructed to accommodate her planned stopover were subsequently damaged, were not maintained and gradually disappeared. There are no harbors or docks. The fringing reefs may pose a maritime hazard. There is a boat landing area along the middle of the sandy beach on the west coast, as well as a crumbling <b>day</b> <b>beacon.</b> The island is visited every two years by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
25|$|Jarvis {{was visited}} by {{scientists}} during the International Geophysical Year from July 1957 until November 1958. In January 1958 all scattered building ruins {{from both the}} nineteenth century guano diggings and the 1935–1942 colonization attempt were swept away without a trace by a severe storm which lasted several days and was witnessed by the scientists. When the IGY research project ended the island was abandoned again. By the early 1960s a few sheds, a century of accumulated trash, the scientists' house from the late 1950s and a solid, short lighthouse-like <b>day</b> <b>beacon</b> built two decades before were the only signs of human habitation on Jarvis.|$|E
25|$|Colonists, sent to {{the island}} in the mid-1930s to {{establish}} possession claims by the United States, built the Earhart Light , named after Amelia Earhart, as a <b>day</b> <b>beacon</b> or navigational landmark. It is shaped somewhat like a short lighthouse. It was constructed of white sandstone with painted black bands and a black top meant to be visible several miles out to sea during daylight hours. It is located near the boat landing at {{the middle of the}} west coast by the former site of Itascatown. The beacon was partially destroyed during early World War II by the Japanese attacks, but it was rebuilt in the early 1960s by men from the U.S. Coast Guard ship Blackhaw. By 2000, the beacon was reported to be crumbling and it had not been repainted in decades.|$|E
50|$|For {{historical}} reasons, {{there are}} two systems for lateral <b>day</b> <b>beacons.</b> When proceeding from open water towards harbor, marks with cylindrical topmarks or square dayboards are kept to port in both regions, but colors and numbers are reversed.|$|R
50|$|A {{navigational aid}} (not to be {{confused}} with aid to navigation, ATON, or navaid) is any sort of marker which aids the traveler in navigation; the term is most commonly used to refer to nautical or aviation travel. Common types of such aids include lighthouses, buoys, fog signals, and <b>day</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cardinal <b>day</b> <b>beacons</b> {{are used}} to {{indicate}} {{the position of a}} hazard and the direction of safe water as a cardinal direction (north, east, south or west) relative to the mark. This makes them meaningful regardless of the direction or position of the approaching vessel, in contrast to the lateral mark system.|$|R
25|$|While a few {{offshore}} anchorage {{spots are}} marked on maps, Jarvis island has no ports or harbors, and swift currents are a hazard. There is a boat landing {{area in the}} middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling <b>day</b> <b>beacon,</b> and another near the southwest corner of the island. The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated, which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century. The island has a tropical desert climate, with high daytime temperatures, constant wind, and strong sun. Nights, however, are quite cool. The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet (7 meters) at its highest point. Because of the island's distance from other large landmasses, the Jarvis Island high point is the 36th most isolated peak in the world. The low-lying coral island has long been noted as hard to sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef.|$|E
25|$|Jarvis Island was {{reclaimed}} by the United States {{government and}} colonized from March 26, 1935 onwards, under the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project (see also Howland Island and Baker Island). President Franklin D. Roosevelt assigned {{administration of the}} island to the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 13, 1936. Starting out as a cluster of large, open tents pitched next to the still-standing white wooden <b>day</b> <b>beacon,</b> the Millersville settlement on the island's western shore was named after a bureaucrat with the United States Department of Air Commerce. The settlement grew into a group of shacks built mostly with wreckage from the Amaranth (lumber from which was also used by the young Hawaiian colonists to build surfboards), but later, stone and wood dwellings were built and equipped with refrigeration, radio equipment, and a weather station. A crude aircraft landing area was cleared on the northeast side of the island, and a T-shaped marker which {{was intended to be}} seen from the air was made from gathered stones, but no airplane is known to have ever landed there.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cemetery}} and rubble from earlier settlements are {{located near the}} middle of the west coast, where the boat landing area is located. There are no ports or harbors, with anchorage prohibited offshore. The narrow fringing reef surrounding the island can be a maritime hazard, so there is a <b>day</b> <b>beacon</b> near the old village site. Baker's abandoned World War II runway, [...] long, is completely covered with vegetation and is unserviceable.|$|E
50|$|The United States Coast Guard Aids To Navigation Team, ANT Coos Bay was {{established}} in 1976 and is located {{near the mouth of}} Coos Bay in the fishing and tourist community of Charleston, Oregon, southwest of the city of Coos Bay. ANT Coos Bay's area of responsibility ranges over 240 miles of the Oregon coast and includes 3 lighthouses, 18 primary buoys, 43 secondary buoys and 156 other lights, <b>day</b> <b>beacons</b> and fog signals.|$|R
50|$|Vizhinjam {{lighthouse}} {{is situated}} near Kovalam beach in Kerala. It started functioning on 30 June 1972. Vizhinjam was a busy seaport {{in the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries. Before the current light was installed, there were no lighthouses at this location. A <b>day</b> mark <b>beacon</b> (flag mast) must have been there in 18th century. After 19th century, this port was in a neglected state. A lighted beacon was constructed in 1925 at nearby Kolachal. Subsequently, a <b>day</b> mark <b>beacon</b> was provided at Vilinjam during 1960.|$|R

The MSA Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Aids to Navigation Office (北海航海保障中心天津航标处) {{is responsible for}} the maintenance of all navaids within the Tianjin area. In 2004, the AtoN office controlled 141 navaids in the Tianjin jurisdiction, including 3 lighthouses, 12 light beacons, 22 lead markers, 44 <b>day</b> <b>beacons,</b> 55 light buoys, 1 NDB station, 1 RBN/DGPS station, 3 radar transponders, 2 large AtoN ships, 2 small AtoN ships and 1 survey ship operating from two wharves.|$|R
2500|$|The Stannard Rock Reef {{is located}} off Keweenaw Peninsula about [...] south of Manitou Island and [...] north of Marquette, Michigan. In 1835, Captain Charles C.

A temporary marker was placed at the location in 1866. [...] The opening of the Soo Locks and the rapid increase in commerce between Duluth, Minnesota, and the lower Great Lakes demanded construction of a lighthouse. The lighthouse was named for Captain Stannard. The Stannard Rock Light is [...] from the nearest land making it the most distant from shore of any lighthouse in the United States.
