Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind, with the <b>institutional</b> <b>investor</b> contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in the basket of assets.|$|E

While {{studies have examined the}} impact of different categories of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> on strategic decisions of firms in developed markets (e. g., internationalization), we argue that the impact of different categories of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> on internationalization of emerging economy firms would be different. We develop theoretical arguments by combining insights from institutional theory with agency perspective to highlight the differential impact of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> in an emerging economy. Based on a large sample of Indian firms, we find that foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> due to their excellent information advantage select potentially good performing emerging economy firms and support their internationalization endeavours, whereas pressure-sensitive (banks, insurance companies and lending institutions) <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> actively dissuade the internationalization of emerging economy firms. We also find that pressure-resistant <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> such as mutual funds are also increasingly playing an active role in strategic decisions of portfolio firms.

30|$|There {{has been}} {{dramatic}} growth in foreign institutional investment in global capital markets {{over the past}} few decades (Karolyi, 2006). Researchers have so far focused on the monitoring role played by foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> in firms in which they invest. For example, foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> are credited with promoting domestic firms’ corporate governance (Gillan and Starks, 2003). Foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> play a more active monitoring role than domestic <b>institutional</b> <b>investors,</b> because foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> are less likely to seek business relationships with local firms (Ferreira and Matos, 2008). Aggarwal et al. (2011) find a positive relation between foreign institutional ownership and firm-level governance efficacy. However, an unexplored but equally important question is whether foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> play an informational role in influencing firms’ information environment. To fill this gap, we investigate whether foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> facilitate firm-specific information flows in the global market, thereby mitigating excess stock return comovements.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on the top 100 ranking listed {{companies}} on the corporate governance in Main Board of Exchange in Malaysia by the end of December in 2007. Among these 100 companies, according to the percentage shareholdings owned by the <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> in each company of 2006, I will investigate that if the more percentage shareholding by the <b>institutional</b> <b>investors,</b> the higher ranking of the corporate governance of the company. In other words, I am trying {{to find out if the}} <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> are able to improve the corporate governance in Malaysia in 1 year time. With the help of Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way ANOVA), I find that there are very big differences of the percentage shareholdings of the <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> among different ownership structure companies (Government-Linked Company, Family-Controlled Company, Multinational Company and Others), the specialty of this study from others is that I divide the 100 companies into 4 groups, and testify the effect of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> (domestic plus foreign) on corporate governance separately via Spearman’s order correlation test. Moreover, the extent of the impact of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> on the corporate governance is also attempted to be evaluated. Besides, the impact of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> on corporate governance also depends on the nature of them. Therefore, I classified the domestic and foreign <b>institutional</b> 7 <b>investors</b> into 2 groups: one is pressure insensitive investors (domestic and foreign long-term and stated-owned <b>institutional</b> <b>investors)</b> and another is pressure sensitive investors (domestic and foreign short-term and private <b>institutional</b> <b>investors).</b> Finally, the foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> are extracted from the total shareholdings, and its impact on improvement of corporate governance will also be investigated in more detail. In addition, beyond the univariate and bivariate analysis to test of differences and association between variables, the multiple regression as the extension of the correlation will be used to represent the best prediction of corporate governance score from 2 independent variables (ownership structure and shareholdings of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors).</b> The findings of this study are: The shareholdings owned by <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> in 4 ownership groups are quite different from each other. Among of these, shareholding of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> in GLCs’ is the highest one, followed by MNCs and FCCs. As to the impact of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> (domestic plus foreign) on the good corporate governance, the pressure sensitive <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> can improve the corporate governance in FCCs and GLCs for one year time, but not in MNCs. For the foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors,</b> the foreign <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> themselves can make the corporate governance improved in one year time in GLCs. As to the FCCs and MNCs, the positive effects are not significant on corporate governance...|$|R
25|$|Controversy also arose {{around the}} fact that retail investors were {{excluded}} from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an <b>institutional</b> <b>investor</b> but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{relationship}} between institutional holdings and analyst coverage in the context of the heterogeneous nature of <b>institutional</b> <b>investors.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Similar to prior studies (e. g. Ke and Ramalingegowda; Ramalingegowda and Yu), this paper obtains institutional investors' trading classifications (transient, dedicated, and quasi-indexing) from Brian Bushee directly. To examine the hypotheses, the paper uses a two-step instrumental variable approach demonstrated in O'Brien and Bhushan to mitigate the simultaneity relationship between the change in analyst coverage and the change in the number of heterogeneous <b>institutional</b> <b>investors.</b> Findings – The findings suggest that such relations are different among transient, dedicated, and quasi-indexing <b>institutional</b> <b>investors.</b> Specifically, there are three major results. First, a change to the number of analyst coverage has the lowest impact on the change in the number of dedicated <b>institutional</b> <b>investors.</b> Second, a change in the number of transient <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> has a higher impact on change in analyst coverage than those for change in the number of dedicated and quasi-indexing <b>institutional</b> <b>investors.</b> Third, changes to analysts' buy or sell recommendations have the least impact on the change in the number of dedicated institutions, relative to transient and quasi-indexing institutions. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> are not homogeneous. Research studies on <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> need to disentangle the differences among different types of institutions. Originality/value – The paper provides a comprehensive study on different <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> and analyst coverage.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{advocated}} within corporate governance that <b>institutional</b> <b>investors</b> may discipline management in listed firms and thereby alleviate the free rider problem associated with dispersed ownership.

2500|$|While {{shareholders}} have {{a privileged}} position in UK corporate governance, most are themselves institutions - mainly asset managers - holding [...] "other people's money" [...] from pension funds, life insurance policies and mutual funds. Shareholding institutions, who are entered on the share registers of public {{companies on the}} London Stock Exchange, are mainly asset managers and they infrequently exercise their governance rights. In turn, asset managers take money from other institutional investors, particularly pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through pensions, are beneficiaries from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. Under the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241 to 243 require that pension fund trustees are elected or appointed to be accountable to the beneficiaries of the fund, while the Companies Act 2006 section 168 ensures that directors are accountable to shareholders. However, the rules of contract, equity and fiduciary duty that operate between asset managers and the real capital investors have not been codified. Government reports have suggested, and case law requires, that asset managers follow the instructions about voting rights from investors in pooled funds according to the proportion of their investment, and follow instructions entirely when investors have separate accounts. Some institutional investors {{have been found to}} work [...] "behind the scenes" [...] to achieve corporate governance objectives through informal but direct communication with management, although an increasing concern has developed since the global financial crisis that asset managers and all financial intermediaries face structural conflicts of interest and should be banned from voting on other people's money entirely. Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and <b>institutional</b> <b>investor</b> ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other people's money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. The Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital.|$|E
