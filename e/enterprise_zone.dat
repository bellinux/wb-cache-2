40|$|<b>Enterprise</b> <b>zones</b> are California 2 ̆ 7 s {{second most}} {{important}} tool for attempting to resuscitate urban areas (after redevelopment). Businesses get generous tax benefits for locating and hiring in these areas. There are now 40 <b>enterprise</b> <b>zones</b> in the state, from Eureka to Calexico in North-South space, and from Central Los Angeles to Porterville, Delano, and Thermal in urban size hierarchy. The legislature regularly considers bills proposing to expand the number of zones. This experience costs the taxpayers over 70 million per year. So, do they work? A reasonable test would be whether there was more job growth in <b>enterprise</b> <b>zones</b> than in comparable areas, and whether worker incomes went up. To make this comparison, we collected data about the economic and demographic characteristics of census tracts in <b>enterprise</b> <b>zones,</b> and then matched those tracts with census tracts with very similar characteristics that were not in <b>enterprise</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

A questionnaire survey and in-depth study of four zones revealed that, in the event, pollution problems have been below the average for similar industrial areas. The pollution which has arisen in <b>enterprise</b> <b>zones</b> has been associated mostly with developments not requiring planning permission rather than with the many firms that still require such permission. Landlord powers, controls over the nature of developments, the location of <b>enterprise</b> <b>zones,</b> prior negotiations, and residual planning and other controls have all been used to replace statutory planning powers. However, these alternative controls are {{much less likely to}} prove effective in simplified planning zones where local authorities may succeed mainly in attracting potentially polluting development. ...|$|R
