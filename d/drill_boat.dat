50|$|A muster drill, {{sometimes}} referred to as a lifeboat <b>drill</b> or a <b>boat</b> <b>drill,</b> is an exercise that is conducted by the crew of a ship prior to embarking on a voyage. A muster drill prepares passengers for safe evacuation, {{in the event of an}} emergency on board the ship, and familiarizes the crew and the passengers with escape routes. In a muster drill, the use of life vests and the escape routes from the ship are explained to the passengers.It is typically conducted approximately 30 minutes prior to the ship's scheduled departure time, and all guests must remain silent during the drill so that everyone will be able to hear the safety announcements from the captain. To alert that the drill is in progress, a general emergency alarm is sounded, and the captain then explains what the passengers need to do.|$|R

500|$|Royal Edward {{was able}} to get off an SOS before losing power, and Soudan arrived on the scene at 10:00 after making a 180° turn and rescued 440 men in six hours. Two French destroyers and some {{trawlers}} rescued another 221. According to authors James Wise and Scott Baron, Royal Edwards death toll was 935 and was high because Royal Edward had just completed a <b>boat</b> <b>drill</b> and the majority of the men were below decks re-stowing their equipment. Other sources report different numbers of casualties, from 132 [...] to 1,386 [...] or 1,865.

50|$|Scientific {{drilling}} {{into the}} Earth {{is a way}} for scientists to probe the Earth's sediments, crust, and upper mantle. In addition to rock samples, drilling technology can unearth samples of connate fluids and of the subsurface biosphere, mostly microbial life, preserved in drilled samples. Most of the technology used for drilling come from advances in the oil and gas industry. Scientific drilling is carried out on land by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) and at sea by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). Scientific drilling on the continents includes drilling down into solid ground as well as <b>drilling</b> from small <b>boats</b> on lakes. Sampling thick glaciers and ice sheets to obtain ice cores is related but will not be described further here.|$|R

This study is also the first assessment of nearshore marine fishes of the Southern California islands.

A contemporary newspaper article described how four of Arcadian's overcrowded lifeboats were successfully lowered before she sank. Some of the dead were cooks and stokers who were working below decks. The escorting destroyer had two torpedoes launched at her while she was attempting to rescue men from the water; survivors reported that she had lowered three of her own boats while going [...] "at full speed". More survivors, who had been clinging to a raft, were rescued at midnight by the Q-ship [...] Among the dead was the eminent bacteriologist, Sir Marc Armand Ruffer, who was returning to Alexandria after advising on the control of an epidemic among troops based at Thessaloniki.|$|R

5000|$|On 11 August 1943, the {{personnel}} of the 20th departed California aboard three trains {{and arrived at}} Camp Miles Standish, Massachusetts, five days later. From this European staging area {{the members of the}} 20th embarked on [...] and departed for the United Kingdom on 20 August 1943. If the members of the 20th had expected a typical Queen Elizabeth pleasure cruise, they were sorely disappointed. The ship had been refitted to accommodate over 19,000 men. Staterooms designed for two or three people had 20 to 30 bunks double and triple stacked for officers and enlisted men. In addition to these conditions, enlisted personnel also served shifts of 24 hours on deck, followed by 24 hours below deck. This doubled the number of personnel the cramped quarters could accommodate. Due to her high speed, the ship traveled unescorted, despite the ever-present threat posed by German U-Boats. The five-day trip across the Atlantic was reported as uneventful, except for long chow lines (two meals per day) and frequent <b>boat</b> <b>drills.</b> HMS Queen Elizabeth dropped anchor on 25 August and the men of the 20th disembarked at the Firth of Clyde. From there they were transported to the docks at Greenock, Scotland, and then, by train, to their new home, RAF Kings Cliffe, England.|$|R
