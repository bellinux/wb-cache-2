Industrial Research Ltd (IRL) has {{developed}} a novel metallic-diaphragm pressure wave generator technology for large high-frequency (30 - 60 Hz) pulse tube cryocoolers. A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pressure</b> wave generator, using a conventionally lubricated motor-crank drive, provides a clean pressure wave for a cryocooler. High frequency pulse tubes are at their most efficient when closely coupled to pressure wave generators. There are, however, many applications which require the physical separation of the compressor from the cold head such as a Gifford McMahon (GM) system. Furthermore, GM cryocoolers perform well at low temperatures {{due in part to}} their low frequency (~ 1 Hz) operation.
