5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Homosexuality is {{addressed}} in Catholic moral theology under two forms: homosexual orientation {{is considered an}} [...] "objective disorder" [...] because Catholicism views it as being [...] "ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil", but not sinful unless acted upon.

2500|$|Organ gifting entails two {{simultaneous}} gifts: {{the gift}} of the organ itself and the <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The first form of gift is a transaction where the giver provides an object to the receiver. [...] This action leads {{to the creation of a}} relationship among individuals where the receiver is compelled to provide a counter-gift. The obligation to return the gift has received various interpretations, but one common assumption is that the object that is given tends to keep a portion of the identity of the giver (hau used by Mauss). In the case of organ gifting, this personalization of the gifted object reaches extreme proportions because the gift is actually a piece of the giver's body.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Phinehas in {{the name}} of Rabbi Reuben {{interpreted}} the words [...] "If your brother grows poor [...] [...] [...] then shall his kinsman [...] [...] [...] redeem" [...] in [...] to exhort Israel to acts of charity. Rabbi Phinehas taught that God will reward with life anyone who gives a coin to a poor person, for the donor could be giving not just a coin, but life. Rabbi Phinehas explained that if a loaf costs ten coins, and a poor person has but nine, then the gift of a single coin allows the poor person to buy the loaf, eat, and become refreshed. Thus, Rabbi Phinehas taught, when illness strikes the donor, and the donor's soul presses to leave the donor's body, God will return the <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Similarly, Rav Nahman taught that [...] exhorts Israel to acts of charity, because fortune revolves like a wheel in the world, sometimes leaving one poor and sometimes well off. And similarly, Rabbi Tanhum son of Rabbi Hiyya taught that [...] exhorts Israel to acts of charity, because God made the poor as well as the rich, so that they might benefit each other; the rich one benefiting the poor one with charity, and the poor one benefiting the rich one by affording the rich one the opportunity to do good. Bearing this in mind, when Rabbi Tanhum's mother went to buy him a pound of meat, she would buy him two pounds, one for him and one for the poor.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church defines {{marriage}} as a covenant [...] "by which {{a man and a}} woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring." [...] The church teaches that [...] "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved." [...] Nevertheless, homosexuals [...] "must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided." [...] Some Roman Catholics take this to mean that voting in favor of [...] "benefits for lifelong partners" [...] is a compassionate act, whereas others see voting in favor of [...] "benefits for lifelong partners" [...] as merely promoting behavior contrary to natural law. According to a 2009 survey, 59% of practicing Catholics oppose same-sex marriage, while those who are not practicing support it by 51%. Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor was an outspoken critic of homosexuality; other prominent Catholics who were outspoken critics have included John Boehner, David Vitter, Paul Ryan, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Bob McDonnell, Marco Rubio, Michael Steele, Donald Carcieri, Sam Brownback, and Democrat Tim Kaine. Catholics Rudolph Giuliani, Chris Christie, and Bob Casey, Jr. have supported gay rights and civil unions but not same-sex marriage. [...] Liberal Catholics have generally supported repeal of sodomy laws that called for jail time for homosexuals and Employment Non-Discrimination laws that would prohibit large employers from firing workers because of sexual orientation. [...] Conservative Catholics have taken the contrary view, rejecting claims that these are examples of [...] "unjust discrimination" [...] and that because homosexual act is an intrinsic evil, it must always be opposed.|$|E
