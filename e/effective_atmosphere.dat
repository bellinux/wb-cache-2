This paper aims at exploring how distinctive atmospheres affect the users' judgment on the service quality of public transport in two different cities, Torino and Teheran. To this end, a survey has been designed to investigate the attitudes among a sample of students living in the two cities to understand if the different social and cultural contexts can influence their perception, considering that, despite the difference in the urban systems, Tehran and Torino have comparable public transport infrastructures. The survey provided the design of a questionnaire to be administered to the sample, who also participated to a focus group. The data were analyzed using the SPSS for the statistical analysis and ATLAS. ti for the textual analysis of the discussions. The results show some independent factors related to the customers' satisfaction of the public transport.

Greater emphasis are now placed on project management in a dynamic and <b>effective</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> As a result of this, companies try to understand how culture influences decision making in project teams in different countries. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate how culture influence decision making in project teams through an empirical study of telecommunication industry in Nigeria and Sweden by using Hofstede's framework on cultural dimensions. Research Questions : (1) How does culture influence decision making in project teams? (2) what are the similarities and differences in decision making in project teams between Nigeria and Sweden? Approach : The research design for this study includes literature review and qualitative method. The primary data was collected using semi-structured interviews with project managers and workers in project teams. The secondary data was collected through articles, journals and books. Data from the findings were analysed using coding. Results & Conclusions : It was found that culture influence decision making in project teams. In Nigeria, decision making in teams is more relax type because people try to avoid conflict by not hurting another person’s feelings while in Sweden decision making is more of a participating type in which each member in team has to be consulted and a consensus is arrived at before making the decision. Nigerian team values respect for senior colleagues and prefer hierarchy where codes of conduct exist, formality and inflexibility at work when compared to Sweden. 3 Contribution of the study : We recommend that prospective project managers of the mixed Swedish-Nigerian project team should encourage a participative involvement of all the members of teams in decision making and high degree of flexibility at work. This will lead to an efficient and effective project teams. The fact that this study was based on an important field of studies - project management, we could recommend that the impact of culture on project management could be explored in future research.

40|$|M. Ed. (Education Management) Communication {{is without}} doubt the most {{important}} aspect of the daily duties of the school principal. There are seldom less than 20 members on the staff of a school, all reporting directly to the principal on numerous aspects. The principal also engages in holistic conversations with his entire staff. It is therefore imperative that the school principal has a sound knowledge of the art of communication. The concepts "communication", "nonverbal communication" and "diadic conversation" have been examined. The communication problem was attributed to the inability of principals to engage effectively in face-to-face conversations as opposed to instructional staff meetings. To be successful, the principal can no longer depend only on his intuition for effective communication, but must possess a practical grasp of the networks of communication which constitute the educational system and develop the ability to handle the interpersonal conversation with ease. To achieve this aim, the characteristic principles of the interpersonal conversation were investigated. The diadic conversation prescribes to all the rules of communication, inclUding nonverbal communication which plays an important role in any type of conversation. The meaning of the diadic conversation was investigated, as well as the factors that influence effective interpersonal conversation. Certain conditions that have a bearing on the diadic conversation were high-lighted. The effectiveness of the interpersonal communication could be hampered by factors haVing a negative effect on the outcome of the conversation. Factors directly related to the personalities of one or both of the conversationists were studied. In this respect, the following factors were determined: peergroup pressure, assumptions, the inclination to evaluate, and the halo effect. To achieve the aims that the principal has set for himself at the beginning of the interpersonal conversation, it is of the utmost importance that the principal should be aware of these factors that may cause a hinderance to the goals which he wishes to achieve. Only by breaking down these barriers, will a situation of trust develop between the teacher and the principal. The successful interpersonal conversation depends on the management acumen of the principal in this respect. To enable the teacher to develop to the maximum of his ability, the principal should provide the necessary guidance and encouragement. The management functions of the school principal are so numerous and entangled that it is impossible to do a meaningful study thereof within the framework of this ~tudy. Management styles were investigated, and the participative style was identified as the most suitable to the education sitaation. A two-pronged aim can be ascribed to the diadic conversation, namely the influence by the school principal and influence of the principal. Not only should the principal possess the necessary management acumen, but his communication acumen in the following aspects are of vital importance: planning, motivating, decision-making, persuasion, the handling of conflict, complaints and grievances and the creation of an <b>effective</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The following conclusions were drawn from the investigation into the diadic conversation as an educational managerial technique: maximum trust should exist between the principal and teachers the diadic conversation should be directed at a specific aim the principal should possess the necessary knowledge and prowess to conduct the interpersonal conversation xiii - the necessary communication networks should be established the lack of upward communication has a detrimental effect on the effectiveness of interpersonal communication the school principal should be able to handle the factors and conditions pertaining to the diadic conversation with ease the importance of nonverbal communication should not be underestimated - certain factors have a negative effect on the diadic conversation At the conclusion of this study, the following recommendations were made: - opportunities should be created for the diadic conversation to take place the diadic conversation should be seen as a continuous process principals should endeavour to gain the necessary communication knowledge and skills future leaders in Education should make a thorough study of the art of communication - opportunities should be created for voluntary upward communication guidelines are given for future studies in the field of interpersonal communicatio...|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{cover is}} one of the most {{important}} variables affecting the earth radiation budget (ERB) and, ultimately, the global climate. The present investigation is concerned with several aspects of the effects of extended cloudiness, taking into account hourly visible and infrared data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satelite (GOES). A methodology called the hybrid bispectral threshold method is developed to extract regional cloud amounts at three levels in the <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>effective</b> cloud-top temperatures, clear-sky temperature and cloud and clear-sky visible reflectance characteristics from GOES data. The diurnal variations are examined in low, middle, high, and total cloudiness determined with this methodology for November 1978. The bulk, broadband radiative properties of the resultant cloud and clear-sky data are estimated to determine the possible effect of the diurnal variability of regional cloudiness on the interpretation of ERB measurements...|$|R
