During World War II, he worked for the US Navy in Washington, DC, de-gaussing submarines, and from 1942 to 1946 was a faculty member in physics at the University of Michigan. From 1946 to 1948 he was an assistant professor at the McMath-Hulbert Solar Observatory, then operated by the university, while also studying the effective radiation temperature of the ozone layer for the US Air Force at a base in New Mexico.

40|$|The {{classical}} Kuiper belt contains objects {{both from}} a low-inclination, presumably primordial, distribution {{and from a}} high-inclination dynamically excited population. Based on a sample of classical TNOs with observations at thermal wavelengths we determine radiometric sizes, geometric albedos and thermal beaming factors as well as study sample properties of dynamically hot and cold classicals. Observations near the thermal peak of TNOs using <b>infra-red</b> space <b>telescopes</b> are combined with optical magnitudes using the radiometric technique with near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM). We have determined three-band flux densities from Herschel/PACS observations at 70. 0, 100. 0 and 160. 0 μm and Spitzer/MIPS at 23. 68 and 71. 42 μm when available. We have analysed 18 classical TNOs with previously unpublished data and re-analysed previously published targets with updated data reduction to determine their sizes and geometric albedos as well as beaming factors when data quality allows. We have combined these samples with classical TNOs with radiometric results in the literature {{for the analysis of}} sample properties of a total of 44 objects. We find a median geometric albedo for cold classical TNOs of 0. 14 and for dynamically hot classical TNOs, excluding the Haumea family and dwarf planets, 0. 085. We have determined the bulk densities of Borasisi-Pabu (2. 1 g/cm^ 3), Varda-Ilmare (1. 25 g/cm^ 3) and 2001 QC 298 (1. 14 g/cm^ 3) as well as updated previous density estimates of four targets. We have determined the slope parameter of the debiased cumulative size distribution of dynamically hot classical TNOs as q= 2. 3 +- 0. 1 in the diameter range 100 <D< 500 km. For dynamically cold classical TNOs we determine q= 5. 1 +- 1. 1 in the diameter range 160 <D< 280 km as the cold classical TNOs have a smaller maximum size.

30|$|Cosmic {{microwave}} background (CMB) measurements were ranked second by the journal Science {{among the top}} 10 Achievements of the Decade[1]. In 2000 and 2003, an experiment known as Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERanG) measured the CMB in detail in patches of the sky[2]. Then in 2003, NASA's space-based Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe mapped the CMB across the sky, producing an exquisite “baby” picture of the cosmos. These and the measurements that followed have started to transform cosmology from a largely qualitative endeavour to a precision science with a standard theory, known as Precision Cosmology[1, 2]. Recent cosmology experiments have discovered that the universe mainly consists of dark energy and dark matter. Several cosmology instruments (e.g. BOOMERanG- 3, SPICA (Space <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Telescope</b> for Cosmology and Astrophysics telescope)[3], MILLIMETRON[4], and B-POL) are currently being designed to resolve {{the nature of these}} dark components. The science of SPICA and MILLIMETRON will include the cool universe, encompassing galaxy formation in the early distant universe, star formation in the local universe and planet formation in our own galaxy. The observing capabilities on the aforementioned instruments will extend to wavelengths shorter than those on Herschel.|$|E

The line emission maps of Hubble V show the typical structure of a photo-dissociation region (PDR) where an ionized core, traced by compact He I emission (2. 0587 µm) and Brγ emission (2. 1661 µm), is surrounded by an outer layer traced by molecular hydrogen (H 2) emission. The measured line ratios of H 2 2 − 1 S(1) (2. 2477 µm) / 1 − 0 S(1) (2. 1218 µm) from 0. 2 to 0. 6 and the un-shifted and un-resolved line profiles suggest that the H 2 emission originates purely from a photo-dissociation region (PDR). By comparing the H 2 results with a PDR model, we conclude that Hubble V includes dense (10 4. 5 cm − 3) and warm PDRs. In this environment, most of the H 2 molecules are excited by far-UV photons (with a field strength of 10 2 − 4 {{times that of the}} average interstellar field), although collisional processes de-excite H 2 and contribute significantly to the excitation of the first vibrational level.

SDSS J 110217. 48 + 411315. 4 has a proper motion of 1. 75 ′ ′ /year and redder optical colors than all other known featureless (type DC) white dwarfs. We present SDSS imaging and spectroscopy of this object, along with near-infrared photometry obtained at the United Kingdom <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Telescope.</b> Fitting its photometry with up-to-date model atmospheres, we find that its overall spectral energy distribution is fit reasonably well with a pure hydrogen composition and Teff ≈ 3800 K (assuming log g = 8). That temperature and gravity would place this white dwarf at 35 pc from the Sun with a tangential velocity of 290 km s − 1 and space velocities consistent with halo membership; furthermore, its combined main sequence and white dwarf cooling age would be ≈ 11 Gyr. However, if this object is a massive white dwarf, it could be a younger object with a thick disk origin. Whatever its origin, the optical colors of this object are redder than predicted by any current pure hydrogen, pure helium or mixed hydrogen-helium atmospheric model, indicating that there remain problems in our understanding of the complicated physics of the dense atmospheres of cool white dwarfs.

We construct the optical-to-near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of the galaxies in the clumps, and find that the colour-magnitude relation (CMR) of the red galaxies in the clumps is sharply truncated below K_s= 22. Interestingly, the main cluster shows a clear relation down to K_s= 23 (Lidman et al. 2004). We suggest that galaxies follow the 'environment-dependent down-sizing' evolution. Massive galaxies in high density environments first stop forming stars and become red. Less massive galaxies in less dense environments become red at later times.

40|$|We {{have used}} the NASA <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Telescope</b> Facility (IRTF) to observe the nuclear stellar cluster in the nearby, face-on, giant Scd spiral IC 342. From high {{resolution}} (R = 21500) spectra at the 12 CO (2 - 0) bandhead at 2. 3 micron we derive a line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion sigma = (33 +- 3) km/s. To interpret this observation we construct dynamical models based on the Jeans equation for a spherical system. The light distribution of the cluster is modeled using an isophotal analysis of an HST V-band image from the HST Data Archive, combined with new ground-based K-band imaging. Under the assumption of an isotropic velocity distribution, the observed kinematics imply a K-band mass-to-light ratio M/L_K = 0. 05, and a cluster mass M ~ 6 times 10 ^ 6 Msun. We model the mass-to-light ratio with the `starburst 99 ' stellar population synthesis models of Leitherer and collaborators, and infer a best-fitting cluster age in the range 63 - 630 Myears. Although this result depends somewhat {{on a number of}} uncertainties in the modeling (e. g., the assumed extinction along the line-of-sight towards the nucleus, the IMF of the stellar population model, and the velocity dispersion anisotropy of the cluster), none of these can be plausibly modified to yield a significantly larger age. We discuss the implications of this result on possible scenarios for the frequency of nuclear starbursts and their impact on secular evolution of spiral galaxy nuclei. As a byproduct of our analysis, we infer that IC 342 cannot have any central black hole more massive than 0. 5 million solar masses. This is ~ 6 times less massive than the black hole inferred to exist in our Galaxy, consistent with the accumulating evidence that galaxies with less massive bulges harbor less massive black holes.

40|$|Context: This is {{the third}} paper in a series devoted to the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS). WINGS is a {{long-term}} project aimed at gathering wide-field, multiband imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies in a complete sample of 77 X-ray selected, nearby clusters (0. 04 <z< 0. 07) located far from the galactic plane (|b|≥ 20 °). The main goal of this project {{is to establish a}} local reference sample for evolutionary studies of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Aims: This paper presents the near-infrared (J,K) photometric catalogs of 28 clusters of the WINGS sample and describes the procedures followed to construct them. Methods: The raw data has been reduced at CASU and special care has been devoted to the final coadding, drizzling technique, astrometric solution, and magnitude calibration for the WFCAM pipeline-processed data. We constructed the photometric catalogs based on the final calibrated, coadded mosaics (≈ 0. 79 deg^ 2) in J (19 clusters) and K (27 clusters) bands. A customized interactive pipeline was used to clean the catalogs and to make mock images for photometric errors and completeness estimates. Results: We provide deep near-infrared photometric catalogs (90 % complete in detection rate at total magnitudes J≈ 20. 5, K≈ 19. 4, and in classification rate at J≈ 19. 5 and K≈ 18. 5), giving positions, geometrical parameters, total and aperture magnitudes for all detected sources.

40|$|While {{continuum}} imaging data at far-infrared to sub-millimeter wavelengths {{have provided}} tight {{constraints on the}} population properties of dusty star-forming galaxies up to high redshifts, future space missions like the Space <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Telescope</b> for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) and ground based facilities like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT) will allow detailed investigations of their physical properties via their mid-/far-infrared line emission. The goal of this thesis project was to carry out predictions for these spectroscopic surveys using both a phenomenological approach and physically grounded models. These predictions are useful to optimize the planning of the surveys. In {{the first part of}} the work, I present updated predictions for the number counts and the redshift distributions of star-forming galaxies spectroscopically detectable by these future missions. These predictions exploit a recent upgrade of evolutionary models, that includes the effect of strong gravitational lensing, in the light of the most recent Herschel and South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. Moreover the relations between line and continuum infrared luminosity are re-assessed, considering also differences among source populations, with the support of extensive simulations that take into account dust obscuration. My reference model for the redshift dependent IR luminosity functions is the one worked out by Cai et al. (2013) based on a comprehensive hybrid approach combining a physical model for the progenitors of early-type galaxies with a phenomenological one for late-type galaxies. The derived line luminosity functions are found to be highly sensitive to the spread of the line to continuum luminosity ratios. Estimates of the expected numbers of detections per spectral line by the SpicA FAR infrared Instrument (SAFARI) and by CCAT surveys for different integration times per field of view at fixed total observing time are presented. Comparing with the earlier estimates by Spinoglio et al. (2012), I find, in the case of SPICA-SAFARI, differences within a factor of two in most cases, but occasionally much larger. More substantial differences are found for CCAT. Thereafter I present new estimates of redshift-dependent luminosity functions of IR lines detectable by SPICA-SAFARI and excited both by star formation and by AGN activity. The new estimates improve over previous work by dealing in a self consistent way with the emission of galaxies as a whole, including both the starburst and the AGN component. While the galaxy-AGN co-evolution was already worked out by Cai et al. (2013) in the case of proto-spheroidal galaxies, the evolution of late-type galaxies was dealt with independently of that of AGNs associated with them. I upgraded the model to enable it to take into account in a coherent way the contributions of both starbursts and AGNs to the IR emission during the cosmic evolution also of late-type galaxies. New relationships between line and AGN bolometric luminosity have been derived and those between line and IR luminosities of the starburst component have been updated. These ingredients were used to work out predictions for the source counts in 11 mid/far-IR emission lines partially or entirely excited by AGN activity. I find that the statistics of the emission line detection of galaxies as a whole is mainly determined by the star formation rate, because of the rarity of bright AGNs. I also find that the slope of the line integral number counts is flatter than 2 implying that the number of detections at fixed observing time increases more by extending the survey area than by going deeper. I thus propose a spectroscopic survey of 1 hour integration per field-of-view over an area of 5 deg^ 2 to detect (at 5 σ) 760 AGNs in [OIV] 25. 89 μm - the brightest AGN mid-infrared line - out to z 2. Pointed observations of strongly lensed or hyper-luminous galaxies previously detected by large area surveys such as those by Herschel and by SPT can provide key information on the galaxy-AGN co-evolution out to higher redshifts. Finally, as third step of the work, I present predictions for number counts and redshift distributions of galaxies detectable in continuum and in emission lines with the Mid-infrared (MIR) Instrument (SMI) proposed for SPICA. I have considered 24 MIR emission fine-structure lines, four Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) bands (at 6. 2, 7. 7, 8. 6 and 11. 3 μm) and two silicate bands (in emission and in absorption) at 9. 7 μm and 18. 0 μm. Six of these lines are primarily associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), the others primarily with star formation. Altogether, they allow us to study the interplay between star formation and super-massive black hole growth. A survey with the SMI spectrometers of 1 hour integration per field-of-view (FoV) over an area of 1 deg^ 2 will yield 5 σ detections of 140 AGN lines, produced by 110 AGNs, and of 5. 2 x 10 ^ 4 star-forming galaxies, 1. 6 x 10 ^ 4 of which will be detected in at least two lines. The combination of a shallow (20. 0 deg^ 2, 1. 4 x 10 ^(- 1) h integration per FoV) and a deep survey (6. 9 x 10 ^(- 3) deg^ 2, 635 h integration time), with the SMI camera, for a total of 1000 h, will accurately determine the MIR number counts of galaxies and of AGNs over five orders of magnitude in flux density, reaching values more than one order of magnitude fainter than the Spitzer 24 μm surveys. This will allow us to resolve almost completely the extragalactic background and to determine the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) function down to SFRs more than 100 times fainter than reached by the Herschel Observatory. These spectroscopic observations will allow us to probe all phases of the interstellar medium (ionized, atomic and molecular). Measurements of these lines will provide redshifts and key insight on physical conditions of dust obscured regions and on the energy sources controlling their temperature and pressure. This information is critically important for investigating the complex physics ruling the dust-enshrouded active star-forming phase of galaxy evolution and the relationship with nuclear activity. Observations of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies will be of special interest, because strong lensing allows us to measure the gas/dust distribution in galaxies up to high-z and to gain information on sources too faint to be detected with current instrument sensitivities, thus testing models for galaxy formation and dark matter...|$|E
