5000|$|Intergovernmental organisations and {{non-governmental}} organisations (NGOs) have persistently neglected <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights {{over the past}} 50 years. While all human rights {{are said to be}} [...] "equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights is less advanced than that for civil and political rights. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights <b>and</b> there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights at a national or international level. <b>Economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the possibilities for}} the justiciability of <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights in the Constitution of Bangladesh. <b>Economic</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights {{are part of the}} “fundamental principles of state policy” which are recognized in Part II of the Bangladeshi Constitution. Article 8 (2) of the Constitution explicitly states that those principles are judicially unenforceable. At the international level, human rights were formally split into two different covenants in 1966 : the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on <b>Economic,</b> Social <b>and</b> <b>Cultural</b> Rights (ICESCR). The latter, unlike the former, contained no enforcement mechanism. This differential treatment of the <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights reflected the traditional assumption that <b>economic</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights were not capable of judicial enforcement. Those assumptions were later reflected in the Bangladeshi Constitution. This thesis critiques the main objections to the justiciability of <b>economic</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights in the light of contemporary developments in the international human rights regime, regional human rights systems and different domestic jurisdictions. It is posited that <b>economic</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights have evolved so that their justiciability is now generally accepted. Indeed, the ICESCR (to which Bangladesh is a party) now casts an obligation on States Parties to make them justiciable in their domestic jurisdictions. The thesis {{examines the}} substantive constitutional provisions and the relevant case law, and argues that there is in fact enough scope to judicially enforce <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights contained in the Constitution of Bangladesh, despite the bar of article 8 (2). In this respect, comparative case law in India will also be examined, as India has similar constitutional provisions. Such new interpretations of the Bangladeshi Constitution, if adopted by Bangladesh’s courts, will act as guidelines for the development of judicial protections for <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights at the municipal level in Bangladesh. Such a reformulation of constitutional law will also facilitate the fulfillment of Bangladesh’s obligations under the ICESCR, and the enjoyment of <b>economic,</b> social <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> rights by its people...|$|R
5|$|Free {{from their}} loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began {{competing}} {{with each other}} for territorial control and political power. By 2160BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E

5|$|Ernuszt's {{accounts}} of his activity as royal treasurer have been preserved. The accounts cover {{the period between}} 1 February 1494 and 31 December 1495.

The accounts contain a detailed record of the one-florin tax assessed in Hungary proper, Transylvania and Slavonia in 1494 and 1495 which was to be paid by each peasant household. They do not contain data for the fourteen southern counties in Hungary proper, because the ispán (or head) of Temes County, who was responsible for the defence of the southern border, was entitled to spend the royal income from the one-florin tax assessed in this region.

Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> sources of women's oppression.
