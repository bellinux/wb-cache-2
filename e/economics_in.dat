5|$|Born Else Ochsner in Esbjerg, Denmark, Christensen {{developed}} her anarcho-syndicalist sympathies {{while living}} in Copenhagen.

5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in <b>economics</b> <b>in</b> 1956.
