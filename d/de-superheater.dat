The proposed approach employs GA search for determination of the optimal PI controller parameters for a previously identified nonlinear <b>de-superheater</b> of a 4 X 325 MW thermal power plant.

40|$|Using {{computer}} simulation modeling this study investigates {{the performance of}} a CO 2 trans-critical system with heat recovery from the <b>de-superheater.</b> The influence of sub-cooling (or further cooling) in the condenser/gas cooler on system performance is investigated. Following the suggested control strategy in this study, the extra operating energy demand required to recover the needed heating energy from the analyzed CO 2 system is smaller than what a typical heat pump would require for the same load. This is the case for almost all ambient temperatures over a full season. When taking the simultaneous heating and cooling loads into account, the CO 2 trans-critical system has lower annual energy usage in an average size supermarket in Sweden when compared to a conventional R 404 A refrigeration system with separate heat pump for heating needs. CO 2 trans-critical systems are efficient solutions for simultaneous cooling and heating needs in supermarkets in relatively cold climates.

40|$|In this master thesis project, {{conventional}} supermarket refrigeration systems using R 404 A {{are compared}} with refrigeration system solutions using natural refrigerants such as {{carbon dioxide and}} ammonia. This systems analysis considers {{the behavior of those}} systems in floating condensing and heat recovery mode. System heating and cooling COP have been calculated by using computer simulation with the calculation software EES (Engineering Equation Solver). The impact of important parameters such as sub-cooling, external superheating and compressor discharge was also determined through the computer models. The estimation of the system annual energy consumptions shows that systems using natural refrigerant can compete with systems using artificial refrigerant by using heat recovery system such as heat pump cascade, heat pump cascade for sub-cooling, fixed pressure system and <b>de-superheater.</b> If the indirect emission of systems using natural refrigerant and artificial refrigerant is approximately similar, the direct emission for carbon dioxide systems and ammonia systems can be estimated to be 10000 times less important than R 404 A systems. Multi-unit refrigeration systems have also been studied in this project; it appears that in theory COP improvement of 10 % is possible if the condensing temperature of each unit is controlled adequatelly. ...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, an inverter-driven {{variable}} speed scroll compressor is tested on a <b>de-superheater</b> test stand {{to determine its}} performance in areas of low-lift and low compressor speed. The goal is to adapt this test stand {{so that it could}} be used to test a reciprocating compressor in this region. A control program is written to maintain a constant saturated suction temperature, suction temperature, and saturated discharge temperature. The program was able to maintain control with errors of ± 0. 2 °C at most points. At each test point, refrigerant mass flow rate, compressor input power, and discharge temperature is monitored. The amount of heat removed by the condenser was within 7 % of the compressor input power and the inverter efficiency was within 5 % of the compressor input power for all test points. The inverter efficiency is lowest at low speed. The isentropic efficiency is found to drop off significantly for low pressure ratios. A similar drop off is not expected for reciprocating compressors, so a model for reciprocating compressors is developed. The model is able to predict refrigerant mass flow rate and compressor input power as a function of shaft speed as well as suction and discharge pressures and temperatures. The model is able to accurately predict the mass flow rate with an RMS error within 0. 5 % and for the power model, the RMS errors are within 3. 6 %. The mass flow model is found to perform well when extrapolated into lower speed ranges with RMS errors remaining below 0. 5 %. by Ryan Alexander Willingham. Thesis (S. M.)
