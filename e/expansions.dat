5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken into}} account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal <b>expansions,</b> of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal <b>expansions,</b> so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 <b>expansions</b> into base-2 <b>expansions,</b> one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the <b>expansion</b> {{properties}} of slates, this paper tests multiple groups of data, including free <b>expansion</b> ratio, <b>expansion</b> force and <b>expansion</b> strain for the different stratification slates in Chongqing. We found that {{with the increase of}} time, the axial <b>expansion</b> ratio and swelling pressure of different stratification slates begin to increase rapidly in the initial period,until gradually moving to a maximum value. In addition, slates stratification in different directions has different <b>expansion</b> properties, the perpendicular to stratification direction has greater <b>expansion</b> ratio, is about 2. 5 times more than the <b>expansion</b> ratio of parallel to the bedding. In the constrained conditions, axial <b>expansion</b> ratio of the slates is much larger than that without constraints. Different stratification of <b>expansion</b> pressure and the <b>expansion</b> strain of the slates is linear in the volume remains unchanged.

50|$|Lateral {{compensation}} is likewise {{associated with a}} redirection of flow by 90Â° within single-plane or multi-plane piping systems. Usually, lateral <b>expansion</b> joints are installed in existing right-angle redirections in the system. The movement of a lateral <b>expansion</b> joint always consists of the desired lateral movement and a slight unavoidable axial movement {{that comes from the}} <b>expansion</b> joint itself. Simple lateral <b>expansion</b> joints for lateral movements in one plane only permit a far larger <b>expansion</b> absorption than axial <b>expansion</b> joints.

Moreover, we argue that firm portfolio complexity also slows down further <b>expansion.</b> Using longitudinal data on the <b>expansion</b> path of 91 German companies, we show that added product scope of <b>expansion</b> and degree of internationalization characterizing <b>expansion</b> in one period as well as level of product and international diversity {{have a significant impact on}} slowing down rate of <b>expansion</b> in the subsequent period.
