In order to facilitate the joint <b>decoding,</b> we first propose a construction of dynamic dictionary using a trie and show an efficient way to trace the dictionary during <b>decoding.</b> Then we propose a joint <b>decoding</b> scheme of polar codes taking into account both information from the channel and the source.

5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding.

This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion.
