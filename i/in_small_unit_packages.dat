50|$|At {{each end}} of the shell, a sheet of {{sufficient}} thickness usually made of stainless steel is provided, with holes for the tubes to be inserted and rolled. The inlet end of each tube is also bellmouthed for streamlined entry of water. This is to avoid eddies at the inlet of each tube giving rise to erosion, and to reduce flow friction. Some makers also recommend plastic inserts at the entry of tubes to avoid eddies eroding the inlet end. <b>In</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>units</b> some manufacturers use ferrules to seal the tube ends instead of rolling. To take care of length wise expansion of tubes some designs have expansion joint between the shell and the tube sheet allowing the latter to move longitudinally. <b>In</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>units</b> some sag is given to the tubes to take care of tube expansion with both end water boxes fixed rigidly to the shell.|$|R

50|$|The MNF insurgents {{dispersed}} <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>units,</b> {{merged with}} the local population and continued to carry out armed attacks against the security forces in the district.

50|$|Such {{encounters}} normally occur {{by chance}} <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> operations, typically when two moving forces collide unexpectedly.

50|$|By mid-1943, the ration was {{the most}} {{successful}} field ration in use in North Africa. In that same year, the 10-in-1 ration was developed to replace it, as it offered a wider menu and greater flexibility <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> issue. Extensive procurement of the 5-in-1 ended the same year. However, use of 5-in-1 stocks continued throughout the war, and the ration was still in distribution when hostilities ended.|$|R

50|$|Another source {{explains}} that mounted infantry were foot soldiers provided with increased mobility, whilst mounted riflemen were horsemen trained {{to fight on}} foot in both offensive and defensive actions.

Mounted infantry were picked soldiers often organised <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>units</b> as adjuncts to an infantry brigade, or to an independent force of cavalry.|$|R
