5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Shaver Road, US131 widens {{into a full}} freeway which passes the Gourdneck State Game Area as it enters the Kalamazoo metropolitan area. US131 meets I-94 southwest of Kalamazoo {{and picks up the}} Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94) designation for a couple of miles. This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit36 and follows US131's business loop along Stadium <b>Drive</b> <b>into</b> downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of Western Michigan University. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US131 passes the northern end of Bus. US131, a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US131. North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern Allegan County.|$|E
5|$|After {{putting an}} end to the {{internal}} strife, Basil II launched a counter-campaign against the Arabs in 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. Basil won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south. Although {{he did not have the}} force to <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire — including the larger city of Antioch which was the seat of its eponymous Patriarch.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive {{of the second half}}. The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Razer's next {{appearance}} {{came in a}} Robot Wars Christmas special {{called the}} Southern Annihilator. Six robots fought {{at the same time}} until one was eliminated, either through immobilisation or judges' decision. The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary shed a tyre, lose grip, and <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons go to {{the local}} movie theater to see a film. Bart and Lisa see Space Mutants VI, while Homer, Marge, and Maggie see The Stockholm Affair. As the film starts, Homer acts loud and obnoxious, {{embarrassing}} Marge. When he gives away the film's ending, Marge berates him and the audience heckles Homer, embarrassing them both. During the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer will not accept it, by dropping Marge and the children off at home and goes off on a long <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> the night, finally stopping at a redneck bar called Beer 'N' Brawl, where he grabs a beer while listening to an attractive waitress named Lurleen Lumpkin performing on stage. She sings a song that follows Homer's current state with every detail, and once she finishes, Homer introduces himself to her.|$|E

5|$|After {{discussions with}} Whiting during the Friday night drivers' briefing, {{the height of}} the apex at turn sixteen was {{increased}} and the wall around that area was moved back. A new apex kerb at turn eighteen was built to stop dirt and stones from accumulating on the circuit, and the track was extensively cleaned. Drivers were told they could <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> the pit lane from the racing line without incurring a penalty. Bridgestone had reported heavy tyre graining during the Friday practice sessions; their Motorsport Tyre Development director Hirohide Hamashima said drivers would face a challenge of looking after their tyres if track conditions had not changed before the race. Kubica was quickest in the final practice session; his late lap of 1:37.354 was 0.048 seconds quicker than Hamilton's in second. Alonso was third-quickest and Webber was fourth. Rosberg, who was fifth, slowed at turn fifteen during the session's closing stages; he narrowly avoided a collision with Alonso. The incident was subject to a stewards' investigation; the stewards decided not to penalise Rosberg. Massa, Button, Hülkenberg, Schumacher and Sutil completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vettel was sixteenth; the result of running onto the grass.|$|E
5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the yellow}} flag period, some cars elected to make pit stops, and Ricardo González spun the No. 43 RGR Sport Ligier. The No. 7 Audi rejoined the race after repairs to its floor which was damaged {{when the car}} drove over a kerb and its ducts {{required}} cleaning after rubber picked up from the circuit caused the vehicle to overheat. The entry rejoined in 15th place overall. The race restarted 12 minutes later with Davidson leading the field, ahead of the No. 8 Audi. Kobayashi immediately got ahead of Dumas to move into third position. Manor's No. 31 entry driven by Richard Bradley overtook the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports car of Chris Cumming at Eau Rouge for fourth place in LMP2. Nathanaël Berthon's No. 26 vehicle had its left-rear tyre punctured following contact with Abu Dhabi Proton's No. 88 Porsche at La Source, while Andy Priaulx in the No. 67 Ford passed Dempsey-Proton's No. 77 car for fifth place in LMGTE Pro. Berthon went off the track at the Bus Stop chicane while attempting to <b>drive</b> <b>into</b> the pit lane.|$|E
