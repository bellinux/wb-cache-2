5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced to switch to digital <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paint in 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E
5|$|Barbera took art {{classes at}} the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired {{to work in the}} <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paint {{department}} of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades, and Tom and Jerry. This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio.|$|E
5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E

5|$|The first formal {{school in}} the Kingdom of Imerina was {{established}} and run from 1800 to 1804 by two Antemoro ombiasy, Andriamahazonoro and Ratsilikaina, who taught the future King Radama I and four or five other children to read using sorabe, trained them to manufacture <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paper, and educated them {{in the art of}} astrology and divination. Andriamahazonoro was among the party of three who served as the first ambassadors to Britain and Mauritius; he died in 1838 from tangena poison administered in a trial by ordeal during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I.|$|E
5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the <b>ink,</b> <b>and</b> the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{staff at}} the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox {{three to four months}} later.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the same}} group that set up and {{maintained}} the in-house digital <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paint systems for Hanna Barbera {{as well as the}} Avid and Pro Tools systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. Real Adventures maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Miyazaki took a {{group of}} artists and animators to the ancient forests of Yakushima and the {{mountains}} of Shirakami-Sanchi, taking photographs and making sketches. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive film by Studio Ghibli at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and <b>ink,</b> <b>and</b> with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

5|$|The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a {{profound}} {{new interest in}} the animation and musical film genres. The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> paint and compositing techniques. The Little Mermaid was {{the first of a series}} of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The Wanamaker's Men's Store {{occupied}} {{the first seven}} floors of the skyscraper until 1952 when the Philadelphia National Bank moved into the building. Over the years PNB became CoreStates, First Union Corp, Wachovia and finally Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia in 2008, is One Broad Street's main tenant, occupying about half the building. Other tenants include various law firms, advertising firm Nitrogen US, public relations firm Tonic Life Communications, consulting company Electronic <b>Ink,</b> <b>and</b> the advertising agency Red Tettemer O'Connell + Partners. Past tenants have included Sylvania Electric Products, law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, and advertising and public relations firm Earle Palmer Brown.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable <b>Ink</b> <b>and</b> an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall <b>ink,</b> <b>and</b> the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, two detectives {{arrive at}} the {{apartment}} after Ed goes out, telling Scully that Ed's neighbor is missing and blood was found in her apartment with an unusual chemical substance in it. Scully researches the material on Ed's laptop and tries to call Mulder, but hangs up before Mulder {{has a chance to}} answer. When Ed arrives, Scully tells him that they found blood in his neighbor's apartment and that it was likely his. She thinks that the chemical came from the tattoo <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> wants them both to head to the hospital to be tested. Ed tells Scully about the voice he has been hearing from his tattoo.|$|E
