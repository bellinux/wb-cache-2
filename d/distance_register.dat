40|$|Abstract. High-performance and {{low-power}} VLIW DSP processors {{are increasingly}} deployed on embedded devices to process video and mul-timedia applications. For reducing power and cost in designs of VLIW DSP processors, distributed register files and multi-bank register archi-tectures are being adopted {{to eliminate the}} amount of read/write ports in register files. This presents new challenges for devising compiler op-timization schemes for such architectures. In our research work, we ad-dress the compiler optimization issues for PAC architecture, which is a 5 -way issue DSP processor with distributed register files. We show how to support an important class of compiler optimization problems, known as copy propagations, for such architecture. We illustrate that a naive deployment of copy propagations in embedded VLIW DSP processors with distributed register files might result in performance anomaly. In our proposed scheme, we derive a communication cost model by clus-ter <b>distance,</b> <b>register</b> port pressures, and the movement type of register sets. This cost model is used to guide the data flow analysis for sup-porting copy propagations over PAC architecture. Experimental results show that our schemes are effective to prevent performance anomaly with copy propagations over embedded VLIW DSP processors with dis-tributed files. ...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{waves are}} {{commonly}} used for vibration-based nondestructive testing for infrastructure. Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) {{has been used to}} detect subsurface properties for geologic inspections. Recently, efforts were made to scale down these subsurface detection approaches to see how they perform on small-scale structures such as concrete slabs and pavements. Additional efforts have been made to replace the traditional surface-mounted transducers with non-contact acoustic transducers. Though some success has been achieved, most of these new approaches are inefficient because they require point-to-point measurements or off-line signal analysis. This article introduces a Mobile Acoustic Subsurface Sensing system as MASS, which is an improved surface wave based implementation for measuring the subsurface profile of roadways. The compact MASS system is a 3 -wheeled cart outfitted with an electromagnetic impact source, <b>distance</b> <b>register,</b> non-contact acoustic sensors and data acquisition/ processing equipment. The key advantage of the MASS system is the capability to collect measurements continuously at walking speed in an automatic way. The fast scan and real-time analysis advantages are based upon the non-contact acoustic sensing and fast air-coupled surface wave analysis program. This integration of hardware and software makes the MASS system an efficient mobile prototype for the field test...|$|E
40|$|Quercus rugosa and Q. laurina are {{species that}} {{presents}} a wide geographical distribution range in temperate forests of Mexico. Oak canopies contain a considerable portion of arthropod diversity and the arthropods fauna fulfill {{a wide variety}} of ecological roles. We examined the effect of oak species and seasonal changes on some community structure parameters (diversity, composition, similarity, biomass, rare species, and density of arthropod fauna) of canopy arthropods. In total, 40 oak canopies were fogged during rainy and dry season. A total of 614 identified arthropod morphospecies were recognized belonging to 22 orders associated with tree canopies. A separation of host tree species during both seasons, suggesting a different community structure on host plants species was demonstrated by the principal component analyses (PCA), therefore, differences between oak species results in phenotypes that structure the composition of the arthropod community. Q. laurina registered the highest densities, diversity index and number of rare species in comparison with Q. rugosa. While arthropod biomass showed an inverse pattern. Trees more close to one another (spatial <b>distance)</b> <b>register</b> a more similar canopy arthropod fauna. This study suggests that the trees of Q. laurina could act as a center of biodiversity by the accumulation of arthropod fauna with a considerable number of rare species, which presents wide ecological roles or is involved in critical processes that maintain forest ecosystems...|$|E

To clock the patrol vehicle's speed (for instance, when the speed is matched with the violator's vehicle), both switches are operated simultaneously. Most often, however, the TIME toggle is activated when the violator's vehicle passes an identifiable landmark (such as a signpost), and the DISTANCE toggle is activated when the patrol vehicle passes the same landmark. When the violator passes a second landmark, the timer is stopped, and when the patrol vehicle passes that landmark, the distance measurement stops. These two values are then compared by the digital computer, which displays the average speed over that distance.|$|R

The CRachieved by bimanual manipulation method was also recorded. Four points were recorded in fourtransparent sheets; also, the vertical (Y) and horizontal (X) axis were measured for each point. Then the horizontal, anterior- posterior and straight distances of each point to point that achievedby bimanual manipulation were calculated.

The aim of the project is that of creating and organizing software tools for self-learning of foreign languages, and adapting commercially available audiovideo materials.

The study included 120 dental students (60 males and 60 females) at School of Dentistry of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. First, interalar width was measured with a caliper on every subject.
