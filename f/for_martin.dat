5|$|Challinor {{signed with}} Southern League Premier Division club Brackley Town in July 2010, {{after he had}} been set to sign for Corby Town of the Conference North, with whom he had been on trial.

5|$|Ellen {{was born}} on 24 October 1856 in Walworth, London, at the Bricklayer's Arms public house run by her father, George Elliot. In adult life, {{she worked as a}} needlewoman and in a jute {{processing}} factory. In 1883, she had an illegitimate daughter, also called Ellen, who died in Poplar workhouse in December 1885. Within a year of the death of her daughter, she began working <b>for</b> <b>Martin.</b> In March 1888, Ellen and William left Martin's employ and moved to a furnished room at 3 Swaton Road, Bow, where they lived together until their marriage on Easter Monday, 2 April 1888, at Bromley Parish Church. Martin later said he had dismissed William because of unpaid debts.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{was born}} in New Orleans, Louisiana; his parents were leaders in the African American community. Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations. He was expelled by the university, despite it being historically black, because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation. Ford {{was a member of}} the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Luther King, Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People's Campaign. He was arrested 73 times for participating in protests during the civil rights movement. In 1973, he won a draft evasion trial on basis of conscientious objection. Ford worked as a car salesman and later became a full-time legislator. Ford is a lifelong bachelor.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot <b>for</b> <b>Martin.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game, {{but in his}} second season, his playing time {{increased}} significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage. Nevertheless, the Canadian's tenure with the Suns did not last. Nelson had just taken a job as assistant {{general manager of the}} Dallas Mavericks under his father, Don Nelson, and convinced him to acquire the under-utilised Nash. Following the 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first-round draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix teammate Shawn Marion).|$|E
5|$|It {{was here}} that Hitler first became exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger {{exploited}} the climate of virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived. Georg Ritter von Schönerer became {{a major influence on}} Hitler. He also developed an admiration <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Luther. Hitler read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews. He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel was}} adapted as the 1993 movie Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg. After {{acquiring}} the rights in 1983, Spielberg {{felt he was}} not ready emotionally or professionally to tackle the project, and he offered the rights to several other directors. After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Scorsese, he decided to trade him Cape Fear {{for the opportunity to}} do the Schindler biography. In the film, the character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of Stern, Bankier, and Pemper. Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler in the film, which won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} cast credits are <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Faust, Frank H. Crane, William Russell and Violet Heming. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser {{productions}} are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released {{a list of}} the important personalities in their films. The list included G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Bowers lists this as the first known credit of William Russell, formerly of the Biograph Company. Russell would {{become one of the most}} important actors of the company until his final departure in 1913. It is not the earliest known appearance by Russell, as he is shown in a film still of A Thanksgiving Surprise.|$|E
5|$|The series {{received}} 14 nominations <b>for</b> <b>Martín</b> Fierro Awards and won eight, {{including the}} Golden Award.

Daniel Hendler and Luciano Cáceres were nominated for best lead actor in a daily serial, which Hendler won. Paola Barrientos was the best supporting actress in a daily serial, with Mirta Busnelli also nominated. Isabel Macedo and Nancy Dupláa were nominated as best lead actress in a daily serial, and Macedo (not Dupláa, as expected by the cast) won.

5|$|MD 704 was {{expanded}} to a divided highway from the District of Columbia boundary to Addison Road in Seat Pleasant in 1962. The segment of divided highway at the US 50 interchange was extended west to Ardwick Ardmore Road in Glenarden in 1969. MD 704's modern cloverleaf interchange with MD 202 {{was completed in}} 1971, the same year the former highway {{was expanded}} to a divided highway from Seat Pleasant to {{just north of the}} latter highway. The divided highway was extended southwest through Glenarden from Ardwick Ardmore Road to Glenarden Parkway in 1972 and to MD 202 in 1973. MD 704 was renamed <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Luther King, Jr., in 1987. The highway's interchange with US 50 was rebuilt in 1991 in conjunction with the overhaul of the US 50Capital Beltway interchange immediately to the west; two of the interchange's loop ramps with westbound MD 704 were removed. The MD 704 divided highway was extended east from the US 50 interchange to Forbes Boulevard in 1997 and Lottsford Vista Road in 1999. MD 704 and MD 450 were relocated at their junction to make MD 704 part of the eastwest axis of a more orthogonal intersection in 2000. This project was part of the expansion of the final segment of MD 704 and the adjacent portion of MD 450 to a divided highway.|$|E
5|$|Merson came {{in place}} of John Jensen in Arsenal's {{starting}} XI, while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced the suspended Simone, and Christian Panucci was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini. Graham deployed a 4–1–4–1 formation, with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward. Watched by a crowd of 23,953, Milan eased to a 2–0 win {{and in the process}} ended Arsenal's 15-match unbeaten run in Europe. The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but scuffed his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when he tapped the ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal. Dixon, who required treatment early in the second half, was substituted <b>for</b> <b>Martin</b> Keown right away as he struggled to play on.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 season {{would be}} almost as {{successful}} <b>for</b> <b>Martin.</b> He once again qualified for the Brier, winning the Alberta provincial championship, and then once again went 13–0 in the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier. He knocked off Glenn Howard 7–6 followed by Jeff Stoughton in the final by a 7–4 result. A week later, at the 2009 Canada Cup of Curling, Martin won his third title, defeating fellow Edmonton rink Randy Ferbey in the final. At the 2009 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, Martin won 10 straight games until he met Scotland {{in the final round}} robin game. Martin lost to Scotland and then lost to them again in the 1–2 page playoff game. Martin rebounded with a tight semifinal victory over Switzerland, but had to face Scotland in a third matchup in the final. The game was tied going into the last end with Martin having the last rock advantage. Before his first rock, Martin was lying one in a complicated setup. After spending about six minutes trying to decide which shot to try, he went against the wishes of his teammates and threw away his shot, forcing Scotland's David Murdoch to make a double-tap to sit shot. Murdoch made his shot, leaving Martin with a short-raise double, which he missed, losing the championship to Scotland, 7–6.|$|E
