40|$|Federalism is a {{normative}} political philosophy that recommends {{the use of}} federal principles, i. e. combining joint action and self-government (King 1982). Federal political systems is a descriptive catchall term for all political organizations that combine what Daniel Elazar called shared rule and self-rule. Federal political systems, thus broadly construed, include federations, confederations, unions, federacies, associated states, condominiums, leagues, and cross-border <b>functional</b> <b>authorities</b> (Elazar 1987). Federations are very distinct federal political systems (Watts 1998; Watts 1987). In a genuinely democratic federation there is a compound sovereign state, in which at least two governmental units, the federal and the regional, enjoy constitutionally separate competencies- although they may also have concurrent powers. Both the federal and the regional governments are empowered to deal directly with their citizens, and the relevant citizens directly elect (at least some components of) the federal and regional governments. In a federation the federal government usually cannot unilaterally alter the horizontal division of powers: constitutional change affecting competencies requires the consent of both levels of government. Therefore federation automatically implies...|$|R

Management theorists advise that <b>functional</b> <b>authority</b> for staff positions should be extremely limited in scope: it should cover only a tiny aspect of the line managers' job, it should relate only to areas in which line managers have no expertise, and it should be granted only where company-wide uniformity is required.

40|$|Decentralization {{has become}} fashionable in {{governmental}} {{development of the}} third world. Theoretically, it is the shift of sovereign responsibilities that includes the planning, financing and management of certain public functions to field units of government agencies, subordinate units or levels of government, semi-autonomous public authorities or corporations, or area-wide regional or <b>functional</b> <b>authorities.</b> Unfortunately, Bangladesh became dysfunctional due to rampant political corruption and successive political crises since its independence. Every regime has formed a local government commission under different names, without giving much real effort to decentralising their powers to the local level. Accordingly, every regime has accused their predecessors of uncontrolled distortion. The post-liberation experience of the local government (LG) of Bangladesh suggests that the national government uses the local government bodies to strengthen its own power base {{in the name of}} decentralization. The present research asks whether the policy and the formation of different structures can achieve decentralisation. It engages in a number of theoretical, methodological and empirical debates on rural local government institutions. The history of LG in Bangladesh can be characterised as a British-invented and Pakistani-installed centrally controlled local hierarchical system. Thus, because of extreme political corruption and violence in every sphere of Bangladesh, the radical potential of civil society organisations is being appropriated and they are being used to fill gaps in service delivery, allowing the state to withdraw, which is justified by 'roll-back' neoliberalism. However, this thesis argues that the restoration of law and order and assurance of transparency are prerequisites of efficient local government. Again, endorsing the traditional informal institutions can reduce the pressure on government indifferent affairs like dispute resolution, social awareness, health and safety and so on. In addition, delegating responsibility for service provision to other quarters like NGOs and civil society can help to address the development concerns of the people, as well as capacity-building in local level institutions...|$|R

Although local courts recognize foreign arbitral awards, enforcement is often weak and disputes can take a lengthy time to resolve. While the basic legislation of a market-oriented economy is in place, determining property ownership remains a significant challenge. These legal uncertainties, in addition to poor implementation of laws and contract enforcement, and an underdeveloped judiciary, hinder foreign investment and economic growth.
