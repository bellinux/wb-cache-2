500|$|After a {{lodgement}} extension {{was granted}} by the FTA, HART submitted its recovery plan in April 2017 which concluded that completion of the original 21 station route was the only viable option. [...] An alternative [...] "Plan B" [...] to build only 14 stations within the already funded $6.5billion budget, was ruled out because of lower ridership, legal risks, insufficient contingency and other reasons. [...] The new project cost was $8.165billion with media reports indicating that after <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> are included it could be over $10billion.

50|$|For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is {{assessed}} as {{the first}} month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge,</b> 11/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed as the second month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed as that month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge.</b> Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed {{as the first}} month’s portion of a 24-month precomputed loan.|$|R
50|$|The Rule of 78s {{deals with}} precomputed loans, which are loans whose <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is {{calculated}} before the loan is made. <b>Finance</b> <b>charge,</b> carrying charges, interest costs, {{or whatever the}} cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal.|$|R
25|$|Usually, if a {{cardholder}} is late {{paying the}} balance, <b>finance</b> <b>charges</b> will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. <b>Finance</b> <b>charges</b> incurred {{depend on the}} grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period {{if there is any}} outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} ending 31 March 2016, Wincanton {{reported}} revenue of £1,147.4m (2015: £1,107.4m), which represents {{a year on}} year increase of 3.6% (4.4% excluding WRM from both years).Underlying operating profit grew by 2.4% to £50.9m (2015: £49.7m), providing an underlying operating margin of 4.4% marginally down from 4.5% in the prior year. Excluding the profits of the disposed Records Management business, underlying operating profit was £48.7m, up 5.4% from £46.2m in 2015, with margins consistent at 4.3%. Net financing costs were £15.6m (2015: £18.3m), £2.7m lower year on year. <b>Financing</b> <b>charges</b> consist of interest payable on loans and finance leases of £9.9m (2015: £11.0m) and £5.7m of non-cash items (2015: £7.3m) in relation to pension <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> and the unwinding of discounts on provisions.|$|E

5000|$|The TILA {{introduced}} the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation mandated for all consumer lenders. Certain misleading interest rate calculations used previously, mainly on auto loans, were barred. For {{more than a}} decade, consumer loans were reported by APR in an economically meaningful way. Then in the 1980s the auto manufacturers began to exploit a loophole in TILA and its administration. Neither the Act nor its administrators adequately differentiated between [...] "amount financed" [...] and [...] "finance charges," [...] two terms that appear on the TILA required disclosure statements. By [...] "bundling" [...] {{the price of the}} car and its <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> (which come from the auto maker's captive finance company), auto makers were able to shift money between the two categories, even to eliminating the financing charge entirely. Thus [...] "zero percent APR" [...] financing was born.|$|E

50|$|The {{charter airline}} {{business}} was highly seasonal, {{with most of}} the annual commercial activity taking place over {{a relatively short period of}} barely four months between the end of May and the beginning of September. As Air Europe was operating a fleet of brand-new aircraft that incurred high <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> unlike the older, second-hand jets operated by Dan-Air and many other rival airlines, it could not afford to kerb its fleet utilisation over the winter months. Dan-Air, by contrast for example took half of its operational Comet fleet out of service at the end of the 1976 summer season and put the aircraft into storage at Dan-Air Engineering's main base at Lasham Airfield the following winter season and saw reduced use of other aircraft in the winter. Dan-Air was able to do this as these predominantly older, second-hand aircraft had much lower acquisition costs and were already largely or fully depreciated at the time they entered its fleet.|$|E
5000|$|After {{getting into}} {{financial}} difficulty, Harold {{reached an agreement}} with Molson Brewery in November 1980, {{which at the time}} owned the Montreal Canadiens, for the company to cover his debt <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> on a loan of $8.8 million for 10 years in exchange for an option to purchase a 19.9% block of shares in MLGL from HEBL and a right of first refusal on the rest of HEBL's shares. [...] The NHL did not learn of the deal until the late 1980s. In 1982, he offered to sell the company for $50 million, with the arena alone reportedly valued at $11 million, though a stockholders' report the following year placed the value of MLGL at $23.5 million. When Harold transferred ownership of his personal real estate holdings, which were valued at $2.52 million, to HEBL in January 1989, he acquired 4 newly issued common shares in the company plus a promise of a further $896,472 rather than cash. Mary Elizabeth sold her stake in HEBL to her father for $15.5 million in January 1989, after originally having a deal to sell the stake to Don Giffin, while Harold Jr. sold his back to HEBL for $21 million in June of the same year. Harold secured a loan from Molson for the full amount of his buyout of Mary Elizabeth, using the 34 acquired shares in HEBL as security. Harold Jr.'s shares were subsequently retired. Bill sued his father for $170 million over HEBL's acquisition of Harold Jr.'s stake, claiming that he and partner Michael Cohl had acquired a right of first refusal to purchase the shares for $20 million that February. Shortly thereafter, HEBL issued Harold 32 common shares and $125,216 in exchange for ownership of his 350,200 personally held MLGL shares and $125,000. Two more new common shares would be granted to Harold to repay the $911,000 debt HEBL owed him from his two transactions with the company. This gave Harold, who feared that Bill was positioning himself to take over the holding company, control of HEBL. Harold did not want his bickering children to inherit MLGL because he feared they would destroy it.|$|E

40|$|The {{payday loan}} {{industry}} is a highly debated provider of alternative financial services (AFS). The varied regulations implemented across states which include <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> regulation, loan term regulation, loan amount regulation, and bans attempt to shift consumers away from this industry to mainstream credit options that increase consumer welfare in the long-run. Using the Current Population Survey Unbanked/Underbanked Supplement from 2009 and 2011, I analyze the effectiveness of each type of legislation that exists across states in these years. Looking at payday loan use, alternative financial service use to cash checks, and alternative financial service use {{to take out a}} money order within the year preceding the survey, I find that <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> regulations are most effective in shifting consumers away from payday loans and maximum loan term and fee regulations are most effective in shifting consumers away from AFS for money orders. Looking at demand side effects, I find that <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> regulations are effective because they reduce the probability that a consumer finds payday loans more comfortable, more convenient, or easier to get than bank loans...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem at}} hand is to {{investigate}} the near-term commercial feasibility {{of a wide range}} of automotive emission control technologies. The central issues can best be explained in terms of the emission control characteristics of each technology and their costs. Governmentally established emission control standards may be viewed as constraints on the use of a given vehicle and engine design. Either the technology meets the standard in use or it will not be sold. Emission control technologies that show promise of near-term manufacturability will be identified. Then, without presuming what future emission standards will be, the emission characteristics of example vehicle-engine combinations will be listed. Technologies that are acceptable, given a specified emission standard, can then be identified by a process of elimination. The approach to identifying the relevant costs associated with a given technology is not as clear cut. One would like to think that the most basic question governing the adoption of a given feasible technology is, "Will it be purchased by the public?" The second part of this paper will discuss the impact of pollution control technology on the economic decisions facing the new car customer. The cost considered by the rational new car consumer involves more than first cost. Other important factors include maintenance, operating expenses, resale value, and <b>financing</b> <b>charges.</b> Since resale value and <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> are highly time dependent, it is possible that a new car purchaser's decision on which technology to buy may depend on how long he plans to keep the car. A cost annualization procedure will thus be developed which considers these factors...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{estimates}} for subcritical, supercritical and ultrasupercritical pulverized coal (PC) plants are presented for representative US bituminous coals and compared with IGCC technologies. The {{basis of the}} designs are discussed, including {{the difference between the}} US and European definitions of efficiency and calculation methods. The build up of the various components of the Total Capital Requirement (TCR) are shown and the effects of different assumptions regarding the additional Owners costs (OC) on the Cost of Electricity (COE) for each technology are addressed. The results show that the Total Plant Cost (TPC) for IGCC is slightly higher than PC when designed for 90 % equivalent availability and at the current state of development IGCC probably requires more staff than PC. There are also additional cost elements and higher perceived risk factors for IGCC that can affect the project development schedule and <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> and increase the Owners Costs {{to a greater extent than}} for PC.

40|$|Contractor’s {{claims for}} loss and {{expenses}} {{have long been}} a contentious issue on many building contract. Claims are usually resolved during the final account process, but where negotiations fail, they frequently become disputes, with the parties adopting legal route to resolve their differences. Claims to recover prolongation cost arise {{in a number of}} contexts and it is importance for the claimant to understand the principles upon which such claims might be evaluated. In valuing the loss and expenses claim by prolongation cost, it is fundamental to prove delay and actual related cost losses arise in an action of damages and failure to prove will not entitle to a claim for damages. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine loss and expense claims that is related to prolongation cost by head of loss claims. The head of loss claims include site overheads, head office overhead, loss of profits, interest and <b>financing</b> <b>charges,</b> loss of productivity and cost of preparing the claim. The loss should be measured at the point in time in which the delay event arose, rather than costs incurred at the end of contract. In valuing prolongation costs, the decision in Costain v Haswell therefore provides a useful reminder of the importance of distinguishing costs generated by time and by volume. This study was carried out mainly through documentary analysis of law journals. The study also helps in adding to the knowledge base of the literature on prolongation costs and construction contracts...|$|E

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for construction contracts to be delayed {{for one reason or}} another.

In some circumstances, contractor requires more working capital and longer duration to accomplish the project is both increased and had to deployed {{over a longer period of}} time. As a result, when the project is prolonged, the contractor has to necessarily sustain cost of his working capital to ensure the contract can be fulfilled over the additional period of delay. Under the general principle of common law, financial loss in the form of interest charges is not recoverable without any express contractual or statutory provisions except claim under special damages. Since there are no express provision under the contract, can the additional interest/ <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> incurred recoverable under ‘loss and/or expense’ provision? Hence, this research is conducted to reducing the uncertainty and difficulties in the event of recovery of interest/finance charges in the event the project is prolonged and additional working capital is required to sustain the project. This study classified as doctrinal research is an essentially a library-based study. It was found that interest which contractor has suffered during the period between the loss and/or expense being incurred and the making of an application for reimbursement is recoverable. It is also important to serve a notice to the contract administrator to inform the disruption of the regular progress of the work under loss and/or expense clause in the successful recovery of interest/financing charges...|$|E
40|$|The soaring cost of {{construction}} of housing {{that has occurred}} over {{the last ten years}} has made it virtually impossible for many families to buy adequate housing. There are four basic contributing factors to the cost of housing: 1) land prices, 2) labor costs, 3) <b>financing</b> <b>charges,</b> and 4) the cost of materials. The subject of this thesis deals with perhaps the most controversial cost contributor: labor costs. This thesis is an analysis of the effects of organized construction labor {{on the development of the}} industry, labor's effect on the final cost of the product, and labor's production performance within each of the technological levels {{of construction}} (i. e., conventional, prefabricated, industrialized). The study is broken down into three parts. The first part is a background on building trade unions. A short history of the labor movement, a description of the organizational structure, and labor policies are discussed. The second part deals with labor's role in the building industry. It describes conventional construction, prefabricated construction, and totally industrialized construction both in the United States and Europe. Each method is analyzed in depth with emphasis being placed upon cost breakdowns and levels of production. The third and concluding part discusses labor's position in the future of housing, and how it will have to adapt to changes within the industry as more automated and industrialized methods of construction are introduced in an attempt to effectively lower costs and successfully solve the housing crisis. Finally, the roles of the Federal Government and the architectural profession are discussed as additional ways of reducing labor costs in housing construction...|$|E
40|$|Claims for {{additional}} preliminaries cost due to project prolongation {{is actually a}} part of loss and/or expense claim. The principle governing this claim was established in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) which provides that the party who suffers direct and reasonably foreseeable costs entitled to damages. This principle has been adopted {{in most of the}} standard forms of contract in Malaysia. As required by the contractual provisions such as in the PWD 203 A (Rev. 2010 / 1), PAM Contract 2006, CIDB Form 2000 and IEM Form 1989, the contractor?s entitlement to loss and/or expense is limited to selected delaying events. In addition, the submission of claim must be made in specific time period as provided in the contract. There are cases when everything else was in order, the contractor was denied a claim due to his own failure to abide by the procedural requirement for submission of claim. The heads of claim under the loss and/or expense generally can be grouped under seven categories i. e. additional expenditure, interest and <b>financing</b> <b>charges,</b> loss of productivity, inflationary cost increase of materials and labour, site overheads or preliminaries, offsite or head office overheads and loss of profit. The objective of this research is to determine the preliminaries items that are considered and recommended for payment by contract administrators in claims {{for additional}} prolongation costs in the Malaysian construction industry. As a general guide, a possible list of claimable preliminaries items established from this study may be useful to contractors in their submission of loss and/or expense claims due to project prolongation in the future. It is also beneficial to contract administrators to learn how others evaluate the claims and thus, able to improve themselves on the way loss and/or expense being evaluated as compared to the settled law in this regard...|$|E

First, consumers carrying more high interest balance prefer {{to accept the}} PR offer even with an increased PR, but the probability of choosing the FFL offer declines. Second, {{the total number of}} credit cards holds by consumer gives an impact on the choice in an opposite manner. The more cards the consumers have, the lower the probability of choosing the FFL offer. However, the probability of choosing the PR offer increases if consumers have more cards.

Usually, consumers with good credit records have more cards with higher credit limits because credit card companies send them credit card offers based on their credit records. Therefore, consumers with good credit records tend to choose PR offers {{to take full advantage of}} BT offers. Finally, our finding is confirmed by a <b>finance</b> <b>charge.</b> Consumers who need to pay a higher <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> prefer the FFL offer but decrease probability of choosing the PR offer.
