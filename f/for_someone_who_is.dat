NME Ben Patashnik applauded the song's suggestive nature; [...] "'So Happy I Could Die' perfectly evokes {{the feeling of being}} alone in a crowded room with its icy beats, suggesting Gaga takes refuge in masturbation as the only way to retain control." [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was declared as the twenty-seventh best Lady Gaga song by Rolling Stone, who concluded: [...] "Gaga exults in the pleasures of club-hopping, drinking and bi-curiosity." [...] Under the Radar columnist Nick Hyman avouched that [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was an uninspiring track, while Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that Gaga's vocals were the worst out of any of her songs. [...] "It's a bit of a disappointment, too, because <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> so painfully deliberate in crafting their unique visual image, it’s a let down to see that some of that quality control couldn’t be applied to the song selection that will ultimately define their legacy." ...|$|E

[...] Caryn Ganz, while writing for Yahoo! Music, criticized [...] "Born This Way", stating that the song was [...] "overworked, overwrought, noisy, cheesy, and very, very derivative." [...] She specifically noted the similarities to songs like [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] (2010), [...] "Waterfalls" [...] (1995), and three of Madonna's songs: [...] "Express Yourself", [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998), and [...] "Vogue". Megan Friedman from Time and Marissa Moss from The Huffington Post summarized their reaction as [...] "mixed", due to the similarities they found with [...] "Express Yourself". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph noted that the imitative nature of the song would affect perceptions of Gaga's artistry, since [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] " [...] a reworking of Madonna's 'Express Yourself' with a touch of 'Vogue', which is a bit too much Madonna <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> trying to establish her own identity as the, er, new Madonna." [...] The song has also attracted some academic attention: Juliet A.

2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf {{was inspired by}} Sackville-West to write {{one of her most}} famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, say Yes or No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E
