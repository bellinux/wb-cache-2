5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a <b>good</b> <b>home</b> and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E

25|$|The 1911 {{election}} set {{a number}} of precedents that would characterize Hayden's later political campaigns. The first was his tradition of never mentioning his opponent's name in public.

He also kept a lookout for candidates with a potential to run against him, occasionally sending letters encouraging the rumored candidates to run.

Between January 2004 and the start of the tour to Sri Lanka in November, the West Indies had won just five of their previous 62Tests and were expected to lose the three match series against a team with a <b>good</b> <b>home</b> record.
