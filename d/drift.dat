5|$|In natural populations, genetic <b>drift</b> {{and natural}} {{selection}} {{do not act}} in isolation; both forces are always at play, together with mutation and migration.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{extensive}} radar measurements from the Jicamarca Observatory during low solar flux periods {{to study the}} quiet time variability and altitudinal dependence of equatorial daytime vertical and zonal plasma <b>drifts.</b> The daytime vertical <b>drifts</b> are upward and have largest values during September-October. The day-to-day variability of these <b>drifts</b> does not change with height between 150 and 600 km, but the bimonthly variability is much larger in the F region than below about 200 km. These <b>drifts</b> vary linearly with height generally increasing {{in the morning and}} decreasing in the afternoon. The zonal <b>drifts</b> are westward during the day and have largest values during July-October. The 150 km region zonal <b>drifts</b> have much larger day-to-day, but much smaller bimonthly variability than the F region <b>drifts.</b> The daytime zonal <b>drifts</b> strongly increase with height up to about 300 km from March through October, and more weakly at higher altitudes. The December solstice zonal <b>drifts</b> have generally weaker altitudinal dependence, except perhaps below 200 km.

5|$|Genetic <b>drift</b> (also {{known as}} allelic <b>drift</b> or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic <b>drift</b> may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic <b>drift</b> ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic <b>drift</b> is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic <b>drift</b> is substantially weakened.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure <b>drift</b> – unlike the long <b>drift</b> wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for <b>drift</b> measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the <b>drift</b> line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E
5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} is very small, <b>drift</b> can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic <b>drift</b> as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic <b>drift</b> have no effect.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic <b>drift</b> is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over {{the relative importance of}} natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic <b>drift.</b> Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic <b>drift</b> plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic <b>drift</b> acting on neutral mutations.|$|E

50|$|Ocular <b>drifts</b> {{were first}} {{found to be}} caused by an {{instability}} of the ocular motor system. However, more recent findings have shown that there are actually a number of suggested hypotheses as to why ocular <b>drifts</b> occur. First, ocular <b>drifts</b> can be caused by the uncontrollable random movements driven by neuronal or muscular noise, known as open loop scheme. Second, ocular <b>drifts</b> can occur to counter controlled motor variables, namely a motor control loop. Lastly, ocular <b>drifts</b> can be driven by retinal information, in a retino-motor control loop. When the head is not immobilized, as it usually happens in recordings of minute eye movements, ocular <b>drifts</b> compensate for the natural fixational instability of the head.|$|R
40|$|Nest <b>drifting</b> {{is often}} {{observed}} in honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{and can be}} detrimental to neighbouring colonies because {{it has the potential}} to increase disease transmission. However, the characteristics of <b>drifting</b> behaviour over a honeybee’s lifetime and the influence of parasitism on this phenomenon have been insufficiently investigated. Using optical bee counters, we tracked the <b>drifting</b> behaviour of workers that were either infected with the parasite Nosema ceranae or uninfected. Approximately 10 % of the tracked bees <b>drifted</b> into a foreign colony. The <b>drifting</b> prevalencewas influenced by the colony’s location in space but not by N. ceranae parasitism. However, the number and duration of <b>drifts</b> changed over the lifetime of the bees and the season, and parasitism had an effect on drifters, with Nosema -infected bees performing more but shorter <b>drifts.</b> This phenomenon was more pronounced in old bees (+ 62 and − 15 %for the number and duration of <b>drifts,</b> respectively) and could potentially be explained by the energetic stress induced by the parasite. In conclusion, combining a detailed analysis of <b>drifting</b> behaviour with the actual risk of newly established disease in colonies will benefit our knowledge of bee epidemiology...|$|R

Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and <b>drift</b> to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to <b>drift</b> westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial <b>drift.</b> Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they <b>drift</b> inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
40|$|Many commercially {{important}} fishes {{associate with}} <b>drifting</b> seaweeds in their juvenile stage, however, the ecological significance of <b>drifting</b> seaweeds for juvenile fishes is still unclear. We postulated {{that the following}} two hypotheses may be applicable for juvenile fishes associate with <b>drifting</b> seaweeds, the “concentration of food supply” hypothesis: juvenile fishes are attracted by phytal animals on the <b>drifting</b> seaweeds and the “indicator-log” hypothesis: fish use accumulations of <b>drifting</b> seaweed {{as an indicator of}} productive areas (e. g. frontal areas) for food. We investigated the frontal areas, zooplankton abundance around the <b>drifting</b> seaweed, and the food availability of fish juveniles associated with <b>drifting</b> seaweed accumulations in the East China Sea in 2012 and 2013. A total of 14 <b>drifting</b> seaweed mass and 22 species (n = 408) of fish juveniles were collected. We found that 49. 7 - 99. 7 % of the individual fed on planktonic food and the feeding incidence on phytal animals was less than 50 %. Although <b>drifting</b> seaweeds were aggregated around the frontal areas of surface currents, the zooplankton abundance was not significantly different between these frontal areas and other areas. Our findings indicate that ecological significance of <b>drifting</b> seaweeds as feeding habit is relatively low for juvenile fishes associated with <b>drifting</b> seaweeds. 流れ藻には多くの水産上重要種の稚魚が付随するが，流れ藻の稚魚にとっての生態学的意義は明らかにされていない。筆者らは次の 2 仮説のいずれかが流れ藻付随稚魚に当てはまると考え，“concentration of food supply hypothesis”（流れ藻葉上生物を摂餌するため）と“indicator log hypothesis”（流れ藻をフロント域のような餌豊度の高い海域の目印とするため）を検証するため， 2012 年と 2013 年に東シナ海の流れ藻周辺の海洋環境，フロント域，動物プランクトン豊度，流れ藻付随稚魚の摂餌個体率を調べた。流れ藻は表層流の収束帯に集積されていたが，収束帯のプランクトン豊度は高くなかった。合計 14 個の流れ藻を採集し，合計 22 種（ 408 尾）の稚魚の胃内容物を調査した結果，稚魚の 49. 7 - 99. 7 %の個体はプランクトンを選択的に摂餌していたが，葉上生物の摂餌個体率は高くなかった（ 50 %未満）。以上の結果から流れ藻の稚魚にとっての生態学的意義は摂餌場でないことが示唆された...|$|R

40|$|Multichannel and {{high-resolution}} seismic profiles complemented with swath bathymetry show {{a variety}} of contourite deposits in the northern Weddell Sea resulting from the interaction between bottom currents and the seafloor physiography. Seven types of contourite <b>drifts</b> are identified based on the seismic signature, reflector configuration and geometry of the depositional bodies. Giant elongated–mounded <b>drifts</b> are widespread {{in the area and}} associated with major channelized contour currents that flow at the base of large ridges. Thick basement/tectonic <b>drifts</b> result from the seafloor disruptions of the currents caused by the irregularities of the near-surface basement morphology.
