5|$|Lori, Glenn (Steven Yeun), Carol (Melissa McBride), Daryl (Norman Reedus), and Andrea (Laurie Holden) {{are still}} searching for Carol's daughter, Sophia (Madison Lintz), when they overhear a gunshot. Meanwhile, on the highway, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) {{believes}} that T-Dog (IronE Singleton) has contracted a blood infection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> he received in the previous episode, and both search for antibiotics, but they fail to find any.|$|E
5|$|The bat’s saliva, {{left in the}} victim's {{resulting}} bite wound, has a key {{function in}} feeding <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> The saliva contains several compounds that prolong bleeding, such as anticoagulants that inhibit blood clotting, and compounds that prevent the constriction of blood vessels near the wound.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{ordered that}} if he died <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound,</b> Ibn Muljam had to be {{executed}} in retaliation. Otherwise, if he survived, he would decide on how to treat him. Ali died two days later on 21 Ramadan 40/30 January 661 (or 19 Ramadan 40/28 January 661) {{at the age of}} 62 or 63, and Ibn Muljam was killed in retaliation (Qisas) by Hasan ibn Ali, in accordance to Ali's instruction.|$|E

5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E
5|$|During Napoleon's Invasion of Russia in 1812, Zajączek {{commanded}} the 16th Infantry Division of the V Corps in la Grande Armée. His division performed {{well at the}} battle of Smolensk in August where he was wounded, recuperating till October. He rejoined his unit in the time {{to take part in the}} battle of Tarutino. After Prince Poniatowski, commander of the V Corps, was wounded, from 1 November Zajączek took charge of that formation. He led it {{at the battle of}} Vyazma and battle of Krasnoi until a wound at Berezina claimed his leg, which was amputated by doctor Dominique Jean Larrey. While recuperating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> he was taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army in Wilno (Vilnius).|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion {{spent the}} next two months engaged in minor {{operations}} in Belgium, before once again transferring to the trenches in France during December. During this time, Whittle was re-promoted to the rank of sergeant. With the commencement of the German Spring Offensive of 1918, the 12th Battalion assisted in repulsing the assault in the months of March and April. While engaged in this operation, Whittle was wounded on 19 March and admitted to a field hospital suffering shrapnel wounds to his right hand. Recovering <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound,</b> he returned to the 12th Battalion in April. Later that month, Whittle was charged with conduct to the prejudice of good order and Military Discipline a second time for mutilating his pay book; he was reprimanded by the battalion's commanding officer as a result.|$|E

5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b>|$|E
5|$|When his men {{finally took}} the hill, 15 Germans {{had been killed}} and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> caused partial loss of his hip muscle and {{kept him out of}} combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.|$|E

5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E

25|$|The first {{appearance}} of gore—the realistic mutilation {{of the human}} body—in cinema {{can be traced to}} D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916), which features numerous Guignol-esque touches, including two onscreen decapitations, and a scene in which a spear is slowly driven through a soldier's naked abdomen as blood wells <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> Several of Griffith's subsequent films, and those of his contemporary Cecil B. DeMille, featured similarly realistic carnage.|$|E

25|$|There are {{currently}} no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus. The diagnosis {{is based on}} the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from patients without tetanus. Laboratory identification of C. tetani can be demonstrated only by production of tetanospasmin in mice. Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus if no other diagnosis has been made.|$|E
25|$|Rhisiart and Brut {{are held}} hostage in the castle for three months, when the castle {{receives}} an unexpected visit from a party including Harry Hotspur and the young Prince of Wales, Henry of Monmouth (the future King Henry V of England).

Lieutenant Wood and other officers picked up rifles and fought alongside the privates {{in an attempt to}} put as much firepower into the fight as they could muster. During this fight, Wood was wounded in the neck by a ball and hurried to the rear, where the wound was diagnosed as minor and dressed. Wood was soon sent back into the fight, although the scar <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> remained visible {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
