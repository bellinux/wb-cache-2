25|$|During the 1940s, {{a second}} mass {{migration}} of African Americans {{from the south}} to Philadelphia occurred. While the majority of middle-class African American newcomers first settled in North Philadelphia, the housing shortages in this area that followed the end of World War II caused later arrivals to move instead to the Northwest. This led to a wave of new housing construction. To meet the <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> of the growing numbers of African American families moving into southern Germantown, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority allocated $10.6 million {{for the creation of}} public housing.|$|E
25|$|A {{century after}} Napoleon III's reign, new <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> {{and the rise}} of a new voluntarist Fifth Republic began a new era of Parisian urbanism. The new era {{rejected}} Haussmannian ideas as a whole to embrace those represented by architects such as Le Corbusier in abandoning unbroken street-side facades, limitations of building size and dimension, and even closing the street itself to automobiles with the creation of separated, car-free spaces between the buildings for pedestrians. This new model was quickly brought into question by the 1970s, a period featuring a reemphasis of the Haussmann heritage: a new promotion of the multifunctional street was accompanied by limitations of the building model and, in certain quarters, by an attempt to rediscover the architectural homogeneity of the Second Empire street-block.|$|E
25|$|Historian William Kenneth Boyd {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} West Durham to the mill, as the village began to grow within {{the first few years}} of operation when there were 375 employees in late mid-1890s. This number grew proportionately when the number of employees at the plant rose in the 1900s. Erwin Mills constructed houses for its employees, which at one point included women and children. <b>Housing</b> <b>needs</b> continued to grow in the 20th century and additional houses were built in the area south of the mill that is now the Central Campus of Duke University. E.K Powe, a manager of the mill, even purchased houses directly from Duke located along Yearby Avenue in the 1920s. Today, the neighborhoods to the west and north of the former mill are mainly residential, harboring the former homes of mill workers.|$|E

Also because of this, extensive records of the business ventures and career of Jacques van Marken exist, while only a few sources mention the activities of Matthes. It is unclear, therefore, to what extent Agneta was responsible for ideas. She undoubtedly had operational control of the perfume factory, Maison Neuve.

500|$|Although house {{prices have}} {{traditionally}} been lower {{than the national average}} in Navenby, they have risen quickly in recent years. In 2004, the average house price rose by 8.2% to £163,186, according to the Land Registry, while in 1999 the average was £60,000. The district surrounding Navenby – North Kesteven – remains a relatively inexpensive place to purchase property. Consequently, owner occupation is 77% – which is higher than both the regional and national averages. However, the rising prices of recent years are resulting in housing becoming increasingly [...] "out of reach for those on average incomes".
