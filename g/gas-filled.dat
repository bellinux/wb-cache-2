5|$|Due to its heat {{resistance}} and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium {{is a good}} scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in <b>gas-filled</b> and incandescent lamps. Hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because {{of its ability to}} shed electrons into air.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>gas-filled</b> tube, xenon emits a blue or lavenderish glow when {{excited by}} {{electrical}} discharge. Xenon emits {{a band of}} emission lines that span the visual spectrum, but the most intense lines occur {{in the region of}} blue light, producing the coloration.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein <b>gas-filled</b> dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a <b>gas-filled</b> cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a <b>gas-filled</b> bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
25|$|In addition, many kelp {{species have}} pneumatocysts, or <b>gas-filled</b> bladders, usually {{located at the}} base of fronds near the stipe. These {{structures}} provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.|$|E
25|$|LED {{lights are}} often used in a mode similar to {{conventional}} strobe lights, however they can be programmed with {{a wider variety of}} flash patterns because of their ability to be switched directly by electronics, as opposed to discharging a capacitor through a <b>gas-filled</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|The Union Army Balloon Corps was {{a branch}} of the Union Army during the American Civil War, {{established}} by presidential appointee Thaddeus S. C. Lowe. It was organized as a civilian operation, which employed a group of prominent American aeronauts and seven specially built, <b>gas-filled</b> balloons to perform aerial reconnaissance on the Confederate States Army.|$|E
25|$|CFLs {{have two}} main {{components:}} a magnetic or electronic ballast and a <b>gas-filled</b> tube (also called bulb or burner). Replacement of magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts has removed {{most of the}} flickering and slow starting traditionally associated with fluorescent lighting, and has allowed the development of smaller lamps directly interchangeable with more sizes of incandescent light bulb.|$|E
25|$|Geofoam is {{a product}} created by a {{polymeric}} expansion process of polystyrene resulting in a “foam” consisting of many closed, but <b>gas-filled,</b> cells. The skeletal nature of the cell walls is the unexpanded polymeric material. The resulting product is generally {{in the form of}} large, but extremely light, blocks which are stacked side-by-side providing lightweight fill in numerous applications.|$|E
25|$|Since a {{filament}} {{breaking in}} a <b>gas-filled</b> bulb can form an electric arc, which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current, intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore {{often used as}} fuses built into the light bulb. More nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing.|$|E
25|$|Tubes which {{generate}} {{relatively little}} heat, {{such as the}} 1.4-volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in battery-powered equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. <b>Gas-filled</b> tubes such as thyratrons may also use a shiny metal anode, since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure.|$|E
25|$|Thermostats are {{sometimes}} used to regulate gas ovens. It {{consists of a}} <b>gas-filled</b> bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube. The bulb is normally located {{at the top of}} the oven. The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm. As the thermostat heats up, the gas expands applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); <b>gas-filled</b> tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
25|$|The rockoon (a {{portmanteau}} of rocket and balloon) was a {{solid fuel}} rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a <b>gas-filled</b> balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket {{did not have to}} move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.|$|E
25|$|As in all mercury-based <b>gas-filled</b> tubes, {{mercury is}} slowly adsorbed onto the glass, phosphor, and tube {{electrodes}} throughout {{the life of}} the lamp, until it can no longer function. Loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps. The failure symptoms are similar, except loss of mercury initially causes an extended run-up time to full light output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} uses {{a separate}} spring and damper {{with a rubber}} top mount. The rear suspension of the W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, <b>gas-filled</b> suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.|$|E
25|$|An {{echocardiogram}} can, {{within certain}} limits, produce an accurate {{assessment of the}} direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between {{the left and right}} side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using <b>gas-filled</b> microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.|$|E
25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) <b>gas-filled</b> electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of <b>gas-filled</b> tube), and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E
25|$|Like other insects, the red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} breathes through {{a system of}} <b>gas-filled</b> tubes called tracheae connected to the external environment through spiracles. The terminal tracheal branches (tracheoles) make direct contact with internal organs and tissue. The transport of oxygen to cells (and carbon dioxide out of cells) occurs through diffusion of gases between the tracheoles and the surrounding tissue and is assisted by a discontinuous gas exchange. As with other insects, the direct communication between the tracheal system and tissues {{eliminates the need for}} a circulating fluid network to transport O2. Thus, red imported fire ants and other arthropods can have a modest circulatory system though they have highly expensive metabolic demands.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} view of cephalopod evolution {{holds that}} they {{evolved in the}} Late Cambrian from a monoplacophoran-like ancestor with a curved, tapering shell, which was {{closely related to the}} gastropods (snails). The similarity of the early shelled cephalopod Plectronoceras to some gastropods was used in support of this view. The development of a siphuncle would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become <b>gas-filled</b> (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled along the floor, and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as Knightoconus, which lacked a siphuncle. Neutral or positive buoyancy (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the Plectronocerida and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods.|$|E
25|$|As {{his career}} progressed, Tanaka's films became {{known for their}} imaginative, {{sometimes}} surreal, use of color and poetic imagery within the setting of a harsh, brutal world. In 1973, Tanaka directed the second entry in the Secret Chronicle trilogy, Secret Chronicle: Torture Hell. In contrast to the first entry in the trilogy, a satirical depiction of a 19th-century brothel, Tanaka's film was a serious look at religious-sexual ceremonies at a temple. For this effort, Tanaka won the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Citation in 1973. The last film of this trilogy, Secret Chronicle: She Beast Market (1974) returned to the satirical style of the first film. The cast included the popular poet Sakumi Hagiwara playing the memorable role {{of a man who}} simultaneously commits suicide and wipes out a gang of yakuza when he explodes a <b>gas-filled</b> inflatable sex-doll.|$|E
25|$|The Lexus RC F {{is a high}} {{performance}} version of the RC with the 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8 engine with Atkinson cycle at cruising speeds, eight-speed automatic transmission sending the power to the rear wheels. The RC F is equipped with vertical G-sensor for VDIM, Torque Vectoring Differential (TVD) with three operating modes, Standard, Slalom, or Track, front and rear coil-spring independent suspension, monotube <b>gas-filled</b> shock absorbers and ball-jointed stabilizer bars, three new 19-inch diameter forged aluminum wheels, spindle grille with F-mesh pattern on the lower half, unique front hood which raises {{the peak of the}} vehicle, hood air vent from the LFA, front cooling ducts, front fender ducts in the L shape, exclusive combination meters from LFA (a large centrally mounted tachometer that alters according to drive mode, digital and analog speedometer, differential torque vectoring monitor, G-force meter, oil and water temperature gauges, mileage information and a stopwatch), elliptical cross-section thick grip steering wheel, all-new high back seats, ornamentation and pedals, Brembo four-wheel power assisted disc brakes with anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (BA), 19x9-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels, 255/35R19 front and 275/35R19 rear tires.|$|E
25|$|Oswald Short {{was born}} at Stanton by Dale, Derbyshire, the son of mining {{engineer}} Samuel Short and his second wife Emma Robinson. In 1897, he took an intense interest in ballooning, after his brother Eustace Short had purchased, repaired and flown a second-hand gas balloon. The two brothers formed a partnership to design and manufacture balloons for fairground businesses, and made a joint visit to the 1900 Paris Exposition ('World's Fair'). There, they were inspired by the perfectly spherical balloons made by Édouard Surcouf of Société Astra, and they then modified their own design accordingly. In 1901, the two brothers constructed their first balloon, capacity 33,000 cu.ft, in premises above the laboratory of their brother Horace Short, in Hove, Sussex. In 1902, the balloon made successful flights, {{and in the same}} year Oswald and Eustace moved their enterprise to London. The pair made and sold <b>gas-filled</b> observation balloons, for customers including the government of India. In 1906, they moved their business again, to railway arches at Battersea, and flew balloons from Battersea gas works, including some passenger-carrying flights over London. Via contacts in the War Office and in the Aero Club of Great Britain (later Royal Aero Club), they went on to produce balloons of various designs for many notable people and events, up to and including the First World War.|$|E

500|$|Unlike bony fish, sharks do {{not have}} <b>gas-filled</b> swim {{bladders}} for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone. Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. The liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, {{using it as a}} form of swim bladder. [...] Bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.|$|E
500|$|The holotype of Protomycena is {{a single}} fruit body without any {{associated}} structures, preserved {{in a piece of}} clear light yellow polished amber approximately [...] wide. [...] The pileus is [...] in diameter and has a convex shape, sporting a raised central region (an umbo). [...] The pale flesh appears yellowish in the amber, and is smooth and glossy, changing to striate and slightly translucent towards the margin. The pileus margin is striated and slightly flared. [...] The gills {{on the underside of the}} pileus are broadly attached (...) to the top of the stipe, and distantly spaced—between six and eight gills extend completely from the pileus margin to the stipe. These full-length gills are anastomosed with lamellulae (short gills which do not reach the edge of the stipe from the pileus margin) of varying lengths. [...] The pileus is centered on the curved stipe, which is smooth and cylindrical, measuring [...] thick by [...] long. The stipe lacks a ring and rhizoids. [...] The mushroom is preserved with a small liquid and <b>gas-filled</b> bubble, possibly originating from the mushroom itself, which indicates the amber to be very solid and well-sealed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a <b>gas-filled,</b> lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance." ...|$|E
500|$|Elsebeth Thomsen of the University of Copenhagen {{proposed}} a different hypothesis in 1980. She {{suggested that the}} Black Stone may be a glass fragment or impactite from {{the impact of a}} fragmented meteorite that fell some 6,000 years ago at Wabar, a site in the Rub' al Khali desert 1,100km east of Mecca. The craters at Wabar are notable for the presence of blocks of silica glass, fused by the heat of the impact and impregnated with beads of a nickel-iron alloy from the meteorite (most of which was destroyed in the impact). Some of the glass blocks are made of shiny black glass, with a white or yellow interior and <b>gas-filled</b> hollows, which allow them to float on water. Although scientists did not become aware of the Wabar craters until 1932, they were located near a caravan route from Oman and were very likely known to the inhabitants of the desert. The wider area was certainly well-known; in ancient Arabic poetry, Wabar or Ubar (also known as [...] "Iram of the Pillars") was the site of a fabulous city that was destroyed by fire from the heavens because of the wickedness of its king. If the estimated age of the crater is accurate, it would have been well within the period of human habitation in Arabia and the impact itself may have been witnessed. A recent (2004) scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred only within the last 200–300 years.|$|E

2500|$|Giant squid {{and some}} other large squid species {{maintain}} neutral buoyancy in seawater through an ammonium chloride solution which is found throughout their bodies and is lighter than seawater. [...] This differs from the method of flotation used by most fish, which involves a <b>gas-filled</b> swim bladder. [...] The solution tastes somewhat like salmiakki and makes giant squid unattractive for general human consumption.|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis) {{lives at}} {{the surface of the}} ocean. The <b>gas-filled</b> bladder, or {{pneumatophore}} (sometimes called a [...] "sail"), remains at the surface, while the remainder is submerged. Because the Portuguese man o' war has no means of propulsion, it is moved by a combination of winds, currents, and tides. [...] The sail is equipped with a siphon. In the event of a surface attack, the sail can be deflated, allowing the organism to briefly submerge.|$|E
2500|$|Beckman {{instruments}} {{were also used}} by the Manhattan Project. Scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in <b>gas-filled,</b> electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors. [...] It was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak. [...] Beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment - substituting an input-load resistor for the glass electrode - the pH meter could be adapted to do the job. [...] As a result, Beckman Instruments developed a new product, the micro-ammeter.|$|E
