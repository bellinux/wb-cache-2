5|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> out of Imperial control in the 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|E
5|$|Portland {{has had two}} {{replicas of}} Philadelphia's {{original}} Liberty Bell. The first replica was purchased in 1962 for $8,000. It arrived in Portland in June 1963, with a damaged base and beam since the sculpture <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> off its supports. Repairs were made before the replica was paraded through the city on a flatbed truck, then put into storage until Independence Day. The bell was publicly rung {{for the first time}} during holiday celebrations and installed in City Hall's rotunda on May 5, 1964.|$|E

5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> into recession {{with the end of the}} federation).|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Southampton 4–1 on aggregate to {{lift the}} Anglo-Italian League Cup, Napoli were entered into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup for 1976–77, where they reached the semi-finals, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Anderlecht. The club won their second Coppa Italia trophy in 1975–76, eliminating Milan and Fiorentina en route, before beating rivals Hellas Verona 4–0 in the final. In the Italian league, Napoli were {{still very much a}} consistent top six side for much of the late 1970s. Even into the earliest two seasons of the 1980s, the club were performing respectably with a third-place finish in 1980–81. However, by 1983, they <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> dramatically and were involved in relegation battles.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the USAF {{opened the}} Raptor enhancement, {{development}} and integration (REDI) contract to bidders, with a $16 billion budget. In November 2011, Lockheed Martin's upgrade contract ceiling {{was raised to}} $7.4 billion. Nearly $2 billion was allocated for structural repairs and to achieve fleet availability rate of 70.6% by 2015. However, only 63% was achieved. Some F-35 technology, such as more durable stealth coatings, have been applied to the F-22. By 2012, the update schedule <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> seven years due to instability in requirements and funding. In 2014 the USAF moved to cut upgrade funding.|$|E

5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|While the British {{proclaimed the}} Battle of the Atlantic open on 6 March 1941, {{attempts}} by the German Kriegsmarine to disrupt British trade routes had begun {{before the start of}} the war. The Graf Spee <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> into the Atlantic in August 1939, and had caused significant damage in the south Atlantic, before being eliminated as a threat in Montevideo harbour, in the aftermath of the Battle of the River Plate. Other operations were mounted by Admiral Scheer and Admiral Hipper into British waters in 1940 with various success. Although Coastal Command was tasked with shadowing German surface fleets, Coastal Command had not contributed to any effective engagements fought with German commerce raiders until 1941.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> away from {{effective}} Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming {{various degrees of}} autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled {{the north of the}} country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was {{in the hands of a}} group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Madre de Deus entered Dartmouth harbor on 7 September, {{towering over}} the other ships and the town's small houses as it sailed by. The only vessel {{guarding}} the great ship was Roebuck, as the other vessels <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> off to Portsmouth to sell {{off some of the}} plunder. Nothing like Madre had ever been seen in England - the frame from the beakhead to the stern was 165 feet long. The breadth at the broadest deck, was just over 46 feet and her draft was twenty-six feet at her arrival in Dartmouth. Her several decks; consisted of a main orlop, three main decks, and a forecastle and a spar deck of two floors each. The length of the keel was 100 feet, the main-mast was 121 feet, and its circumference at the partners was just over ten feet. The main-yard was 106 feet long.|$|E
5|$|Oswald Watt drowned at Bilgola Beach, near Newport, New South Wales, on 21May 1921. Cuts and {{bruising}} on {{his body}} indicated that he <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> on rocks, struck his head, and rolled unconscious into relatively shallow water. Survived by his 15-year-old son, he was accorded a military funeral two days later at St Jude's Church, Randwick. Members of the AFC, Royal Air Force, and Australian Aero Club formed a guard of honour at the service, {{one of the largest}} in the suburb's history, which also included representatives of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army. Among the tributes was a floral wreath from an anonymous group of French admirers, and another that was dropped by parachute from a low-flying plane. On 31May, Watt's body was cremated and his ashes interred in the family vault at St Jude's.|$|E

5|$|With {{assistance}} from Kyle Busch, Harvick took over fifth {{place on the}} following lap. Afterward, Edwards became the leader, after passing Truex, Jr. On lap 105, Jamie McMurray passed Truex, Jr. to move into second. David Ragan passed Kahne for the tenth position eleven laps later. Having led 86 of the first 124 laps, Edwards was finally passed on lap 125. Truex, Jr. moved into first position, and by the same lap Almirola <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> to tenth. Marcos Ambrose spun sideways on lap 135, causing the fourth caution of the race. The front runners subsequently made pit stops. At the lap 139 restart, Truex, Jr. was the leader, ahead of Edwards, Harvick, and Johnson. One lap later, Montoya and Joey Logano collided, which resulted in Logano spinning sideways and sustaining major damage. At the lap 143 restart, Edwards was leader, after passing Truex, Jr. before the previous caution. On the following lap, Johnson fell to fifth, as Harvick moved to third. During lap 145, Kyle Busch took third away from Harvick. Two laps later, Truex, Jr. reclaimed the lead from Edwards.|$|E
5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did he want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E
5|$|Ohio is {{commonly}} noted as the Nation's Industrial Capital, dating to {{its roots in}} the Rust Belt and Ohio's present-day intelligence and scientific dominance. Ohio was one of four states in the U.S. to have areas make the Intelligent Community Forum's list of global Smart 21 Communities for 2014, with Columbus, Ohio receiving the honors. The state has 5 of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 rankings, while the Ohio State University was ranked #10 by the same magazine for awarding degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs. The state was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools, while overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked #5 in the country by Education Week. However, by 2016 the state's high school rankings <b>had</b> <b>slipped</b> to #11 according to U.S. News and World Report, and #22 overall in quality by Education Week in 2017. It was second only to Texas in having the most U.S. cities in the top 30 best places for new college graduates, according to BusinessWeek in 2010. The year ending July 2011 saw the state ranked fourth in the nation in job creation behind Texas, California, and New York. By 2016 the state wasn't in the top 10 for job growth, and between 2015-2016, the state saw a decrease in job creation of 38,800. Since February 2010 state was 2.5% below the national average.|$|E
