As a vehicle rounds a corner, three forces act on it: tire forces (the centripetal force), inertial effects (the centrifugal force), and gravity.

The <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> acts horizontally through the vehicle's center of mass away {{from the center of the}} turn.

While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not mechanically lock open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against the interior of the handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions.|$|E
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{hydraulic}} modeling of flows with counter-rotating coaxial layers. Dynamic similarity criteria of such flows were found by the inspection analysis of the Reynolds equations. It {{was found that the}} hydrodynamic similarity criteria for physical modeling of unsteady turbulent circular-longitudinal flows with counter-rotating coaxial layers of viscous incompressible fluid are: Strouhal number - the ratio <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> local and convective inertia, Rossby number characterizes the ratio of the azimuthal and axial velocity, Froude number - the ratio <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> convective <b>inertia</b> to the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> gravity, Euler number - the ratio <b>of</b> pressure <b>forces</b> to the convective <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> Weber number - the ratio <b>of</b> the convective <b>inertia</b> <b>forces</b> to surface tension forces, Reynolds number - the ratio <b>of</b> the convective <b>inertia</b> <b>forces</b> to the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> molecular viscosity, Karman number - the ratio of dispersion velocity vector of fluid particles to the flow velocity. The limit value of the Reynolds number was found at the lower boundary conditions of automodel zone of such flow. It is shown that Weber and Rossby criteria for physical modeling of such flows are not determinative. It was found out that turbulent circular-longitudinal flow with counter-rotating coaxial layers are not modeled using Karman criterion. In this connection, {{there is a need to}} conduct experimental methodological research of turbulent flows with counter-rotating coaxial layers on stands equipped means of three-dimensional laser Doppler anemometry. Integral criteria of dynamic similarity of circular-longitudinal flows was considered - Heeger-Baer number (swirl number) and Abramovich number, characterizing the ratio of the angular momentum and momentum of such flows. In comparison with the swirl number, Heeger-Baer number is more preferable. Abramovich number is equal to the geometric characteristics of the local swirler as similarity criterion of circular-longitudinal incompressible fluid flows, including counter-rotating coaxial layers. Basing on summation of the angular momenta of coaxial counter-rotating layers, integral criterion of dynamic similarity of these flows was obtained. A common system of basic hydrodynamic similarity criteria was defined for physical modeling of unsteady turbulent circular-longitudinal viscous liquid flows with counter-rotating coaxial layers.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{study of}} the construction of an autonomous structure of governance by the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan enables to bypass several conventional arguments. Beyond a “frozen” diplomatic conflict, the state-building dynamic of the Nagorno-Karabakh transforms internal equilibriums, which contributes to modify the conditions of conflict resolution. The continuity of the diplomatic status quo leads to widen the gap between the political agreements negotiated by the protagonists and the actual capacity to implement them on the ground, which opens a favourable structure of opportunity to the emergence of a de facto state. The aim of the autonomous political entity is not to negotiate the division of state powers within the Azerbaijani state, but to exit this state. Conflict resolution does not only depend on external factors, which are combined with internal issues and reinforce the prevalence of the status quo. Thus, the conflict is not “frozen,” {{the situation on the ground}} being quite different today from that of the 1994 ceasefire.

40|$|In a {{previous}} analysis, it was argued that greater {{insight into the}} origin of inertia cannot be obtained {{solely on the basis}} of inertial mass; the participation of space-time must also be taken into account. Special and general relativity were used to show that the origin of inertia is the distortion of time in accelerating systems of reference. Herein, the behavior of light in accelerating coordinates is used to provide further evidence that time distortion is the source of inertia. We consider a sealed vessel that contains a photon gas and resides in a uniform acceleration field. It is shown that radiation pressure exerts a net force on the vessel whenever space-time structure gives rise to a relativistic Doppler-shift that is observable in the co-moving reference frame of the vessel. Then the force is expressed in terms of space-time distortion in the reference frame of an infini-tesimal small vessel residing in a Newtonian acceleration field. Carrying this out leads to an expression in agreement with the previous analysis, in which the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> is derived on the basis of special and general relativity. The resulting expression implies that any entity possessing energy, regardless of embodiment, exhibits inertial properties; and more particularly, that the origin of inertia is the relativistic nature of time. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{dynamics}} of the accelerating bicycle under straight-running and cornering conditions. If the bicycle is cornering at constant acceleration and roll angle, it is shown that for low values of acceleration (and braking), it follows closely a logarithmic spiral shaped trajectory. The studies presented are facilitated by a novel control scheme that centres the machine's trajectory on an arbitrary point in the ground plane; the origin of the inertial reference frame is typical. We study the machine's dynamics at constant speed and then include <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> that represent the relevant acceleration influences. This use of d'Alembert's principle allows one to interpret the stability of the accelerating machine in terms of constant-speed equilibria. The bicycle model employed is based on that originally developed by Whipple, and comprises two road wheels and two laterally-symmetric frame assemblies that are free to rotate relative to each other along an inclined steering axis. For the most part the front frame is treated as being flexible and the bicycle is fitted with force generating road tyres rather than road wheels that are constrained in pure-rolling. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
