500|$|The {{painting}} {{is one of}} Lichtenstein's first non-expressionist works, and marks his initial employment of Ben-Day dots which he used to give it an [...] "industrial" [...] half-tone effect. The {{painting is}} his first use both of a speech balloon and comics as source material. The work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic-bristle <b>dog</b> <b>brush</b> to apply the oil paint onto the canvas. [...] By {{the time of his}} death, Look Mickey was regarded as Lichtenstein's breakthrough work.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>brushes</b> come {{in various}} {{sizes and shapes}} {{can be made from}} metal, plastic and wood. Although there are many types of <b>dog</b> <b>brushes,</b> they are not very popular amongst the {{professional}} dog groomers as most of them prefer using teasels. <b>Dog</b> <b>brushes</b> are perfect for breeds that have long and fragile hair, especially if the coat is getting properly taken care of. Common <b>dog</b> <b>brushes</b> are the bristle brush, wire pin brush, and the slicker brush.|$|R
50|$|The rubber {{grooming}} {{gloves and}} <b>dog</b> <b>brushes</b> {{are intended to}} drag loose hair from the short-coated dogs and {{are some of the}} most popular grooming tools amongst pet owners. They are easy to use, as using them basically means massaging the coat in firm strokes and have the advantage of being suitable for both wet and dry coats.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} brushes that combine the pin and bristle styles. This type of <b>dog</b> <b>brushes</b> are {{maybe the most}} {{convenient}} as they {{have the advantage of}} having two brushes in one. The combination pin/bristle brush has two different sides, one with bristles which can be successfully used for grooming the short hair areas of the coat, and another side, with pins {{that can be used for}} long-coated and double-coated dogs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly the same," [...] {{the youth}} smilingly replied. [...] "No, no, we have {{forgotten}} nothing that was his. I have {{at this moment}} a <b>dog</b> <b>brushing</b> a deer, not far from this, who is come of a hound that very scout sent as a present after his friends, and which was of the stock he always used himself: a truer breed, in nose and foot, {{is not to be}} found in the wide Union." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I started back. Had I been {{stricken}} with blindness? But no; turning my head, I could plainly see {{everything in the}} room. The scene from the window was as distinct as it ever had been. I sprang to my feet, and, as I stood wondering what this strange thing could mean, the <b>dog</b> <b>brushed</b> up against me and licked my hand. Then the idea suddenly flashed into my mind that by some occult influence Ajax had been rendered invisible.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>dogs</b> now <b>brushed</b> {{into the}} cover, with the {{appropriate}} encouragement from the hunters--all was business, bustle, and activity. My cousins were soon too much interested {{in the business of}} the morning to take any further notice of me, unless that I overheard Dickon the horse-jockey whisper to Wilfred the fool--"Look thou, an our French cousin be nat off a' first burst." ...|$|R
50|$|Special brushes {{are made}} for cats and <b>dogs.</b> Two {{different}} <b>brushes</b> can be made specifically for either short haired pets, or long haired pets. For an equine's tougher hair, a curry-comb is used.|$|R
60|$|To my surprise, the doggie came {{promptly}} forward, {{sat down}} on his hind-legs, and looked up into my face. I was touched by this display of ready confidence. A confiding nature {{has always been to}} me powerfully attractive, whether in child, cat, or <b>dog.</b> I <b>brushed</b> the shaggy hair from his face in order to see his eyes. They were moist, and intensely black. So was the point of his nose.|$|R
50|$|The Border Terrier has {{a double}} coat {{consisting}} of a short, dense, soft undercoat and harsh, wiry weather- and dirt-resistant, close-lying outer coat with no curl or wave. This coat usually requires hand-stripping twice a year to remove dead hair. It then takes about eight weeks for the top coat to come back in. For some <b>dogs,</b> weekly <b>brushing</b> will suffice. Most Border Terriers are seen groomed with short hair but longer hair can sometimes be preferred.|$|R
50|$|The sickle-shaped {{tail of the}} Small Greek Domestic Dog {{is usually}} long. The dog holds its tail up high, and has an elegant curve. It is always in motion, showing the dog's joy. The coat of this <b>dog</b> forms a <b>brush</b> under its tail.|$|R
50|$|During 1806 in the UK {{there was}} a sale of setters. A black setter bitch called Peg was sold for 41 guineas while the price for setter <b>dogs</b> called Punch, <b>Brush,</b> Bob, Bell, Bounce and Sam varied from 17 to 32 guineas each. No colours were {{specified}} for the dogs.|$|R
50|$|Grooming is {{something}} to consider when choosing this breed because of the thick double coat. The Labrador Husky probably needs plenty of brushing as any double coated breed would. This dog sheds continuously, but has a major shed twice a year. During the twice yearly shedding time, these <b>dogs</b> should be <b>brushed</b> every day to remove loose hair. Sometimes baths are necessary to fully clean the coat.|$|R
5000|$|Gromit is Wallace's pet dog {{and best}} friend. Gromit is {{generally}} more intelligent, more intuitive, and less naive than Wallace. His birthday is 12 February. Gromit graduated from [...] "Dogwarts University" [...] ("Dogwarts" [...] being a pun on [...] "Hogwarts," [...] the wizard school from the Harry Potter books) {{with a double}} first in Engineering for Dogs. He likes knitting, playing chess, reading the newspaper, tea and cooking. His prized possessions include his alarm clock, <b>dog</b> bone, <b>brush,</b> and a framed photo of himself with Wallace. He is very handy with electronic equipment and an excellent aeroplane pilot. Though this is not mentioned a lot, according to Wallace or any other person he is a beagle. More often than not, he {{is seen as a}} threat to the plans of the various villains he and Wallace have encountered in their adventures.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} popular and cited {{feedback}} came from GameTrailers.com's Rob, whose stick figure persona actually hanged himself as a result of playing Ultimate Duck Hunting, which coined the term [...] "suicide review". Over the course of GameTrailers' review, the late Rob delivers a laundry list of problems with the game. He criticizes the intelligence of the dogs used to retrieve fallen ducks and the repetitive dullness of the training process required to raise said intelligence. He likewise comments on the difficulty of finding anyone online to share the multiplayer mode with by showing a completely empty lobby. At one point, he ridicules the graphics of the allegedly [...] "most realistic duck hunting game ever made" [...] by presenting footage of a <b>dog</b> with <b>brush</b> poking through its body (a common symptom of low production values in videogames).|$|R
50|$|Wade Rouleau: Dash's father, whom Gina {{kicked out}} during Dash's {{childhood}} but who returns {{when he hears}} of Gina's death. Wade is shown to have miraculously survived numerous deadly scrapes in Vietnam, {{and for that reason}} he was recruited by two of his war colleagues to be the FBI's mole in the <b>Dog</b> Soldiers. Dash <b>brushes</b> off Wade's return to the reservation, but agrees to work with him to discover the identity of Gina's murderer; however, before they can meet, Wade is picked up by Nitz and imprisoned on false pretenses in order to keep him away from Dash.|$|R
5000|$|Roomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a {{simplified}} interface (a single button) and lacked {{some of the}} software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt <b>Dog</b> contained sweeping <b>brushes</b> and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space {{that would be required}} for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment. The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010.|$|R
2500|$|Prairie {{dogs are}} chiefly herbivorous, though they eat some insects. They feed {{primarily}} on grasses and small seeds. In the fall, they eat broadleaf forbs. In the winter, lactating and pregnant females supplement their diets with snow for extra water. They also will eat roots, seeds, fruit, and buds. Grasses of various species are eaten. Black-tailed prairie dogs in South Dakota eat western bluegrass, blue grama, buffalo grass, six weeks fescue, and tumblegrass, while Gunnisonâ€™s prairie <b>dogs</b> eat rabbit <b>brush,</b> tumbleweeds, dandelions, saltbush, and cacti {{in addition to}} buffalo grass and blue grama. [...] White-tailed prairie dogs have been observed to kill ground squirrels, a competing herbivore.|$|R
40|$|Malassezia {{species are}} {{commensal}} organisms {{of human and}} animal skin that occasionally act as opportunistic pathogens. The lipid-dependent species are associated with human skin disorders whereas the non-lipid-dependent species (Malassezia pachydermatis) is considered as an opportunistic secondary pathogen affecting the canine skin surface and ear canal. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the possibility of canine malassezia organisms (Pachydermatis species) present on the body sites exposed to contact with the animal using the Culture Method; in another side to identify and isolate different species of Malassezia on the skin of studied individuals. In this study which performed in Tabriz, skin samples were obtained from 40 clinically healthy individuals who owned pet <b>dogs.</b> The Skin <b>Brush</b> Method was used for collecting skin samples. These samples were collected from four body sites including the chest, neck, palm and the interdigital surfaces of the fingers for the microscopic examination and culture. The frequency of malassezia infection was 30 % among pet owners. The isolated species were M. japonica (31 %), M. globosa (18. 8 %) and the species with unknown culture pattern (50 %). The most common site among the studied sites was the chest (with 80 % infection). Not isolating Pachydermatis species from the dog owners can show the low probability of infection transmission resulting from dogs and human beings relations, nevertheless if the malassezia infection exists, the possibility of the infection transmission should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 yr, {{increased}} {{attention has been}} directed toward evaluation of urinary enzymes as markers of nephrotoxicity in dogs because the technique is noninvasive and Considered {{to be more sensitive}} than the more commonly used conventional tests of renal function. Urinary enzymes also have the potential of determining the primary site of renal damage bccause different sections of the nephron have a characteristic complement of enzymes. In <b>dogs,</b> increases in <b>brush</b> border enzymes, including y-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase, have been associated with renal proximal tubular damage, while increases in N-acetyl-P-D-ghcosaminidase have been observed in the early stage of renal papillary necrosis. Urinary enzymes have been particularly uscful in detection of acute renal damage in dogs, specifically tubular damage; however, their corresponding value in providing information about chronic renal damage remains to be established. Although elevation of certain enzymes appears to be a relatively sensitive measure of nephrotoxicity in the dog, there is no current agreement regarding which enzyme assays are the most appropriate for routine use in safety assessment studies. In addition, elevation of a single enzyme is of limited diagnostic value in detection of renal damage because spurious increases in urinary enzymes sometimes occur in normal dogs. Therefore, if one wishes to conduct special assessment of nephrotoxicity in dogs, evaluation of several enzymes at multiple time points is needed to compensate for normal enzyme variation and to identify potential anatomic site selectivity of the toxin.

40|$|The National Union Convention met in Philadelphia in August 1866 {{to create}} a {{political}} party that would back President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction program and to elect a new Congress. Here, the convention is portrayed as a gathering of muzzled dogs, their collars inscribed with state names, who file toward a large doghouse, the "Wigwam. " Except for the unwelcome arrival of Copperheads or Peace Democrats Fernando Wood and C. L. Vallandigham, the meeting was surprisingly harmonious even with the participation of representatives from both North and South. Here two dogs, "Massachusetts" and "South Carolina," side by side, lead the pack toward the Wigwam. Wood and Vallandigham are portrayed as cats, each held by the scruff of its neck by guard dogs Edgar Cowan and J. R. Doolittle. At bottom left stands a <b>dog</b> with a <b>brush</b> and a pail marked "N. Y. Times" tied to its tail. In the background "The Dead Dog of The White House," incumbent Andrew Johnson, lies in {{the road in front}} of the presidential mansion, which flies from its roof an American flag labeled "My Policy. " "My Policy" was Johnson's campaign catchword. The Philadelphia movement ultimately failed, and anti-Johnson Republicans achieved more than a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress.
