5|$|Pterosaur wings {{were formed}} by {{membranes}} {{of skin and}} other tissues. The primary membranes attached to the extremely long fourth finger of <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> and extended {{along the sides of}} the body to the ankles.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that {{are attached to the}} arms don’t have to be the same on <b>each</b> <b>arm,</b> allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|Weapons are {{equipped}} on both {{hands of the}} characters and are used with the circle and cross buttons. Pressing both buttons in succession is necessary to execute combos. The other buttons are used to lock focus onto an enemy, guard, dash, or manually change the camera angle. The number of attacks and blocks is limited by an energy meter for <b>each</b> <b>arm,</b> which decreases after each move but replenishes with time.|$|E
50|$|They were <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> {{with four}} 3"/50 caliber dual-purpose guns and a {{variable}} assortment of secondary armament.|$|R
5000|$|West Coast perspectives; {{theological}} perspectives; single-gender {{armed services}} units’ perspectives; perceived combat “role” for <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> service ...|$|R
5000|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun (1974), between James Bond and Francisco Scaramanga, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with his {{favorite}} pistol ...|$|R
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on <b>each</b> <b>arm,</b> and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son Afonso Henriques succeeded him in {{the county}} and took on the same shield. In 1139, despite being outnumbered, he {{defeated}} an army of Almoravid Moors at the Battle of Ourique and proclaimed himself Afonso I, King of Portugal, {{in front of his}} troops. Following the official recognition by the neighbouring León, Afonso changed his shield in order to reflect his new political status. Sources state he charged the cross with five sets of an unspecified number of silver bezants (most likely large-headed silver nails), one set on the centre and one on <b>each</b> <b>arm,</b> symbolizing Afonso's newly gained right to issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is {{at the apex of}} a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.|$|E
2500|$|In 1813, Lieutenant James Wallis, who {{had been}} senior {{lieutenant}} on Vincejo, escaped to Great Britain. He brought with him a letter dated 14 May 1804, that constituted Wright's official report of the loss. In his report, {{in addition to the}} casualties, Wright described 26 men as being unfit for service, without specifying what that entailed. He described the 17 gun-vessels that had captured him as consisting of six brigs <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with three 18 and 24-pounder guns and having crews of 60 to 80 men, six cutters <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with two 18 and 24-pounder guns and having crews of some 50 to 40 men, and five luggers <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with one carronade or shell-firing howitzer and having a crew of 30 men. Wallis received promotion to Commander and in August 1814 command of [...]|$|R
5000|$|... 3 barrage {{pontoons}} (numbered 1, 2 and 3) made in 1898 at the Galați shipyard in Romania, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> {{with two}} Nordenfelt guns ...|$|R
5|$|TB-3-4AM-34FRN and two I-16s {{under the}} wings, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> {{with a pair}} of 250 kg (550 lb) FAB-250 bombs. Used operationally in World War II with good success.|$|R
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on <b>each</b> <b>arm,</b> it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in {{the lining of the}} coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E
25|$|The current team colours are red, {{black and}} white, {{and they can}} be seen on both the home and road uniforms. The home jersey is dominantly white in colour. There are two black stripes and one red stripe across <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> and across the waist. The road uniform is red in colour with a similar design, except that there are two black stripes and two white stripes across the waist and across <b>each</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} bowed and hastened away, to return {{presently}} with twenty curiously crooked dwarfs, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with a sling and a quiver full of slender, sharp-pointed darts.|$|R
50|$|Robot Dinosaurs: Appear in episode 39 and are {{actually}} robots used by Nedol.They are <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> {{with a weapon}} such as a mace, an ax, or a large flyswatter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{we are in}} for it!" [...] whispered the young major, as he saw the rush of the Pornell students, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with all the snowballs he could carry.|$|R
25|$|The {{lengths of}} <b>each</b> <b>arm,</b> {{as well as}} the loop 'diameter', in a tRNA {{molecule}} vary from species to species.|$|E
25|$|Robert Reisner, a cab driver, {{saw a woman}} {{carrying}} a bundle under <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> near the alley behind the Degnan home at 1:30am. She got into a car driven by a gray-haired man.|$|E
25|$|The Minoan Snake Goddess brandished {{a serpent}} in either hand, perhaps evoking {{her role as}} source of wisdom, rather than her role as Mistress of the Animals (Potnia theron), with a leopard under <b>each</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
60|$|The boys {{felt very}} much like {{soldiers}} as they marched toward the slope, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> {{with a gun and}} half a dozen cartridges, and the tumult which could be heard distinctly, heightened the illusion.|$|R
60|$|Eighteen of Mr. Tangle's learned friends, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with {{a little}} summary of {{eighteen}} hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a pianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places of obscurity.|$|R
50|$|French squads {{are divided}} into a 300-meter fireteam <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with a FAMAS 5.56 mm assault rifle and {{carrying}} an AT4 anti-tank weapon and a 600-meter fireteam with a FN Minimi another FAMAS and a LGI.|$|R
25|$|Usually, <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> of each six-pulse bridge {{consisted}} {{of only one}} mercury-arc valve, but two projects built in the former Soviet Union used two or three mercury-arc valves in series per arm, without parallel connection of anode columns.|$|E
25|$|The Star is an eight-pointed {{star with}} <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> bearing a {{representation}} of a fern frond, with the Order's badge superimposed in the centre. Grand Companions wear a gold star and Knight Companions wear a silver star.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Pierre Dumas {{walked into}} a hotel bedroom on his nightly tour of teams to find {{eventual}} winner Gastone Nencini prone on his bed with a plastic tube running from <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> to a bottle containing hormones. However, the hormone injection was not illegal at the time, and indeed only few were disqualified or sanctioned whenever they were found out to use doping.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{when the}} three brothers, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with a whip, entered the hut a few seconds later, they found a woman {{extended}} on the floor, and Toueno kneeling at her side, whistling loudly into her ears.|$|R
50|$|Guyaton: Appears in episode 30. Powers include disguising {{itself as}} a blimp, a green energy cannon on <b>each</b> hip <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with pincer claw half, and a large pincer claw on the head armed with pink {{electric}} bolts.|$|R
50|$|The ethnic {{violence}} was only halted {{on the night}} of July 24 through the combined efforts of police, the state militia, and as many as 1,000 members of citizen's vigilance committee, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with a hickory pickaxe handle.|$|R
25|$|The {{condemned}} {{person is}} strapped onto a gurney; two intravenous cannulae ("IVs") are inserted, one in <b>each</b> <b>arm.</b> Only one {{is necessary to}} carry out the execution; the other is reserved as a backup in the event the primary line fails. A line leading from the IV line in an adjacent room is attached to the prisoner's IV and secured, so that the line does not snap during the injections.|$|E
25|$|In {{semaphore}} areas, junctions are signalled using {{a series}} of between 2 and 5 stop signal arms on one bracket or gantry, known as splitting signals. <b>Each</b> <b>arm</b> (usually) has its own post ("doll") on the bracket, and <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the dolls usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, {{although there is no}} definite standard. In some cases, the tallest doll applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided – {{a series of}} side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which doll on the following stop signal was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large speed reduction is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which signal arm applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast.|$|E
25|$|The arm {{movements}} of the front crawl provide most of the forward motion. The arms alternate from side to side, so while one arm is pulling and pushing under the water, the other arm is recovering above the water. The move can be separated into four parts: the downsweep, the insweep, the upsweep, and the recovery. Each complete arm movement {{is referred to as}} a stroke; one stroke with <b>each</b> <b>arm</b> forms a stroke cycle.|$|E
60|$|But Burney {{was busy}} and cross, and cooks {{are not as}} patient as mothers; so when the {{children}} appeared, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> with a spoon, and demanded their usual feast, she wouldn't hear of it, and ordered them off.|$|R
60|$|In Dock Square {{men stood}} {{shoulder}} to shoulder, the well-to-do citizen {{by the side}} of the labourer or sailor, <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> after his own fashion, and each ready to defend the lives of those nearest and dearest to him.|$|R
5000|$|Gangut-class battleships - As {{built the}} ships of this class were <b>each</b> <b>armed</b> {{with a single}} Pattern 1914/15 gun on the quarterdeck. After 1920-1922 refits three guns {{were added to the}} roofs of the end turrets of the three {{surviving}} ships.|$|R
