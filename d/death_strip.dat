500|$|With {{the help}} of other artists, {{performance}} artist Ben Wagin founded the Parliament of Trees in the former <b>death</b> <b>strip</b> {{on the east side}} of the Spree River, opposite the Reichstag. 258 names of victims of the Wall are listed on granite slabs. Some listed as [...] "unknown man" [...] or [...] "unknown woman" [...] are merely identified with a date of death. The collection, which was created in 1990, contains people who were later not considered to be victims of the Wall. Black and white painted segments of the Wall stand in the background. The memorial needed to be minimized for the construction of the Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus. In 2005, a further memorial was opened in the basement of the Bundestag building. They used wall segments of the former Parliament of Trees. In 1998, the Republic of Germany and the state of Berlin established the Berlin Wall Memorial on Bernauer Straße and declared it as a national memorial. The memorial harks back to a draft drawn up by the architects Kohlhoff & Kohlhoff. Later, it was extended and today it includes the Berlin Wall Documentation Center, a visiting center, the Chapel of Reconciliation, the Window of Remembrance with portraits of those who lost their lives on the grounds of the Berlin Wall, and a 60-meter-long section of the former border installations which is enclosed by steel walls at both ends.|$|E

50|$|The Berlin Wall {{was more}} than 140 km long. In June 1962, a second, {{parallel}} fence was built some 100 m farther into East German territory. The houses contained between the fences were razed and the inhabitants relocated, thus establishing what later {{became known as the}} <b>death</b> <b>strip.</b> The <b>death</b> <b>strip</b> was covered with raked sand or gravel, rendering footprints easy to notice, easing the detection of trespassers and also enabling officers to see which guards had neglected their task; it offered no cover; and, most importantly, it offered clear fields of fire for the Wall guards. About 45.1 kilometres of the wall are at the centre strips of Berlin, and 112.7 kilometres crossing through the Berlin outer circle. 63.8 km of the frontier were in built, 32 km in wooded and 22.65 km in open terrain and 37.95 km of the boundary lay in or on rivers, lakes and canals. Most of them were dismantled beginning with the wall peckers as souvenirs from 11 November 1989, then dismantling the metal mesh fence along the <b>death</b> <b>strip</b> all the way until 22 December 1989. Observation towers began to be dismantled all the way till April 1990. Dismantling of the wall is shown at the below mentioned section (Demolition.

40|$|Drawing on Giorgio Agamben's {{views on}} homo sacer, {{it is argued}} in this article that Eben Venter's novel Santa Gamka (2009) could be read as an {{exploration}} of the state of sovereign exception - when the law is temporarily suspended for some specific purpose, quite often murderous. The protagonist, Lucky Marais, becomes homo sacer when he is forced into an oven and left there to burn to <b>death,</b> <b>stripped</b> of his judicial status and reduced to "bare life". Still building on Agamben, it is also shown how Lucky, the "escape artist", becomes exemplum, precisely because of his marginality and the complex notions of relationality which he embodies. Santa Gamka is a celebration of one human life amongst many, and thereby of human life as such. In this sense Santa Gamka highlights an important function of literature: to remind us of the unforgettable. [URL]...|$|R

But for this, Florence required public penance {{in addition to a}} heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of <b>death,</b> <b>stripping</b> him of much of his identity and his heritage.

Also trees and flowers were planted. The background of the installation was formed by L-shaped pieces of the wall of the last generation of the wall on which the dates of the construction and the fall of the Berlin Wall were painted together with the number of the death victims from the respective years.

5000|$|If an escapee {{was wounded}} in a {{crossing}} attempt and lay on the <b>death</b> <b>strip,</b> no matter how close they were to the Western wall, Westerners could not intervene for fear of triggering engaging fire from the 'Grepos', the East Berlin border guards.

He was shot and bled to death, in full view of the Western media, on 17 August 1962. Fechter's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places, and provide medical care for possible [...] "would-be escapers". The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989, while the final person to die in an escape attempt was Winfried Freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas-filled balloon crashed on 8 March 1989.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} aspect and {{a problem}} for the East German guards {{was the fact that the}} anterior part of the Wall strip was located on the steep embankment of the former railway tracks at a higher elevation than the adjacent area in the west. Yet in 1988, the East Berlin authorities concluded an agreement with the West to acquire a strip of land at the bottom of the hill to set up a more efficient border.After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the former <b>death</b> <b>strip</b> was designated as a public space and one of several green spaces in the city by local residents. With a contribution of DM 4.5 million from the Allianz environmental fund, the park was built on the eastern half of the former train station. However, the western half, which still belonged to the Bundeseisenbahnvermögen real estate association, remained a trade area and since 2004 has served as the location for a flea market next to the park. Several attempts to attach the western part to the green space have so far failed.|$|E
40|$|The {{documents}} nominated {{here are}} fundamental and unique {{parts of the}} political heritage and the collective memory of Germany, Europe and the world during the post-World War II era. The Berlin Wall was the central monument of the cold war. 'From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent '- the division of Europe which Winston Churchill diagnosed already in 1946 {{is one of the}} most important developments of the second half of the 20 th Century. Hopes for a free, democratic Europe after the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition over Nazi Germany were not fulfilled. On the territories conquered by its army, the Soviet Union established communist dictatorships. The East-West conflict and the cold war started: two irreconcilable systems struggled worldwide for power and influence. And one main arena of this cold war was the divided Germany – and Berlin. The building of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 cemented the political division of Germany, Europe and of the world. The initial barbed wire fence was systematically transformed into a concrete wall surrounded by a <b>death</b> <b>strip,</b> between 15 and more than 150 metres in width, with watch towers, electrified signal fences, chained dogs, anti-vehicle-trenches and armed patrols who had the order shoot to kill [in German: “Schiessbefehl”]...|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{three years}} after the German Reunification (German: Deutsche Wiedervereinigung), the once divided Berlin is still {{undergoing}} a process of recovery from the deep political, social, cultural, and physical divisions of the 20 th century. Such divisions seem to have manifested themselves in every corner of the city throughout the course of history, creating a highly politicized environment, and hotly contested spaces decades after conflict ended. One particular area of controversy lies {{in the center of the}} city, along the former path of the Berlin Wall. This part of the city was heavily destroyed after the Second World War. Despite some unsuccessful reconstruction efforts after the War, the Berlin Wall passed right through the center of the city, wiping out the few buildings that were left standing, leaving the area completely barren and deserted. This area of the city came to be known as the 'death strip' (German: Todesstreifen), characterized by a long wide empty space, a wall on the west, barbed wire on the east, and occasional checkpoints and military units along the way. Over the last twenty three years, the Senate Department for Urban Development and the Environment (German: Berlin Stadtentwicklung) has sought to restore, preserve, rebuild, and develop large parts of the city, including the former <b>death</b> <b>strip.</b> Its goal has been to physically reconnect fragmented parts the city, by creating spaces that serve as meeting points for former East and West Berliners, in order to reintegrate the city's physical landscape and recreate its cultural identity. One of the Senate's key development projects focused on the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin's iconic landmark, and its surrounding public spaces, for the political, cultural, and historic symbolism they represent to the city. This thesis will first examine the conditions under which the Brandenburg Gate has served as a symbol of unity and division in the city throughout its evolving history. Then, it will discuss the Brandenburg Gate and its surrounding spaces as a network of reinvented traditions, with the Gate serving as passageway to the physical and temporal histories to the city-hence, the Brandenburg Gates. by Dima Ayyash.
