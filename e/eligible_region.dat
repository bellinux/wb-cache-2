40|$|Reducing disparities among regions within European {{countries}} is {{the aim of}} European and national structural policies. In particular, a European grant contributes to the German governmental program for equalizing regional unemployment. The goal is to bring {{it down to the}} national average by creating new and/or by safeguarding existing jobs. In the given paper the distribution of available aid among 271 German labor market regions is considered as an econometric decision problem. At first, the dependence of the unemployment rate on the amount of aid is estimated for each <b>eligible</b> <b>region.</b> Using this dependence, the variance of regional unemployment rates is expressed {{as a function of the}} regional subsidies. The optimal aid distribution among regions is obtained by minimizing this variance subject to the total budget constraint and administrative restrictions. The optimal figures computed are compared with statistical data for 2000 - 2002. They show that the regional unemployment in West Germany could be equalized better (with variance 3. 50 against the actual 4. 40) and with a simultaneous decrease in the average unemployment in West Germany from 7. 45 to 7. 28 %. In East Germany all regions are eligible, implying no administrative constraints and a high optimization flexibility. It enables almost perfectly equalize regional indices down to the variance 0. 28 against the actual 9. 76. Under the model assumptions, the actual results of the equalizing policy could be attained by half the budget granted. These underused possibilities explain the low efficiency of active labor market policies reported in empirical studies. To improve their performance, some tools for optimally distributing subsidies and predicting their effects are suggested. " (author's abstract...|$|E

These masks significantly diminish the necessary interactive process to find anomalies in the LPIS only to those blue and red areas. Some reference parcels in the LPIS are originally set as ineligible thanks to the additional ancillary information (such as land use or no subsidy applications within the respective LPIS parcel for 4 years), {{even though they are}} eligible with respect to the land cover (spectral information). Therefore those regions—such as grasslands within woodlands for which no subsidy claims were launched (examples are those blue regions outlined by the green rectangles) or in non-agricultural regions (a recultivated mining region in Figure 2 and a deforested area in Figure 3, outlined by black rectangles), small fields along the roads (outlined by black dashed rectangles)—are extracted as eligible in the resulting masks. Grassland or vegetation within the urban areas (blue regions within red rectangles) are extracted as eligible due to the same reason and also due to the spectral mixing because of 5 m spatial resolution. However urban regions can be removed easily by additional thematic data. An eligible crop (maize) is incorrectly captured as ineligible due to its spectral resemblance to the woodlands (ineligible) when it is grown. The spectral resemblance {{can be seen in the}} false color composite in Figure 2 : reddish regions at the top-left are woodlands whereas those within black ellipses are maize.

40|$|Background: Trachoma is {{the leading}} cause of {{infectious}} eye disease that leads to blindness. Continuous re-infection by the bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis, leads to scarring of the cornea and subsequently to blindness. It is commonly found in the poorest and remotest part of Africa, Asia, Latin America and Mid-east, where hygienic conditions are also poorer. The Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET 2020) was launched by World Health Organization (WHO) with the main aim of eliminating trachoma as a public health problem globally by year 2020. The Alliance funded Sightsavers, as part of the strategy to meet this target, to set up the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP) which was to map all endemic places for intervention through a population-based prevalence survey. There are five main signs of the disease and the number of people affected by each sign explains the magnitude and the intervention needed in that population. WHO recommends the active trachoma survey in children age 1 - 9 years and the blinding signs in adults' age 15 years and above. More researches, that establish quicker means of intervention for the endemic trachoma areas, are needed using the GTMP data in order to meet the year 2020 target. Methods: Baseline data from the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP) was used as a secondary dataset for this research. All <b>eligible</b> <b>regions</b> in Ethiopia were included. The GTMP teams conducted surveys in seven regions. All age groups were included, but for the purpose of planning, the study assessed TF in children age 1 - 9 years and TT in adults age 15 years and above. The prevalence of TF in children and TT in adults are indicators for programme decision making for intervention and establishing the relationship between them would aid in the intervention. The relationship if established could help in planning the extent of intervention needed in a given population. Data on sanitation and hygiene as well as altitude, which were collected as part of GTMP, were assessed to determine if they contributed to relationship between TF and TT. Results: The study included a total of 282, 558 individuals living in 174 evaluation units from seven regions of Ethiopia, among whom 256, 587 gave consent to be examined. This study found a significant relationship between the prevalence of TF in children and the prevalence of TT in adults when analysis is done at the evaluation unit level (correlation rho, 0. 59; p-value < 0. 0001). Hence, 59 % of the prevalence of TT in adults can be explained for by the presence of TF in children. Sub-group analysis showed that the correlation persisted at the regional level. Conclusion: A better understanding of the relationship between the prevalence of TF and the prevalence of TT together with the factors influencing this association using this large dataset may aid in prioritization of districts for intervention and has implications for global activities for the elimination of trachoma...|$|R

We discuss about potential changes in policy prioritisation in the future programming period: the most important challenge concerns potential re-addressing of interventions needed to meet the objectives of the new regional development framework, as in the three-pronged menu of priority themes from the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas. This is particularly relevant in the framework of potential tensions between the rationales of new Structural Funds Regulations and the Lisbon strategies. A cross-cutting reading of policy priorities at the regional level reveals that in many regions certain typologies of investments can not be directly repeated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - The {{predictive}} value of microalbuminuria (MA) {{in children with}} type 1 diabetes has not been defined. We describe {{the natural history of}} MA in a large cohort of children recruited at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Between 1985 and 1996, 514 children (279 male) who developed type 1 diabetes before the age of 16 years (91 % of those <b>eligible</b> from a <b>region</b> where ascertainment of new cases is 95 %) were recruited for a longitudinal study with central annual assessment of HbA(1 c) and albumin excretion (three urine samples). Dropout rates have been 4. 5 years. RESULTS - MA (defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 3. 5 and ≥ 4. 0 mg/mmol in boys and girls, respectively) developed in 63 (12. 8 %) and was persistent in 22 (4. 8 %) of the subjects. The cumulative probability (based on the Kaplan-Meier method) for developing MA was 40 % after 11 years. HbA(1 c), was worse in those who developed MA than in others (mean difference ± SEM: 1. 1 % ± 0. 2, P 11 years), the overall cumulative risks in these groups were similar (38 vs. 29 vs. 39 %, respectively) after 10 years' duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS - Prepubertal duration of diabetes and prepubertal hyperglycemia contribute to the risk of postpubertal MA. The differences in rates of development of MA relating to HbA(1 c), sex, and age at diagnosis relative to puberty may have long-term consequences for the risk of subsequent nephropathy and for cardiovascular risk...|$|R

Out-of-hospital patient delay from symptom onset until emergency department (ED) presentation may reduce the expected benefit of reperfusion therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine {{the impact of a}} community educational intervention to reduce patient delay time on the use of reperfusion therapy for AMI. METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled community-based trial to enhance patient recognition of AMI symptoms and encourage early ED presentation with resultant increased reperfusion therapy rates for AMI. The study took place in 44 hospitals in 20 pair-matched communities in five U. S. geographic <b>regions.</b> <b>Eligible</b> study subjects were non-institutionalized patients without chest injury (aged 3 ̆e or = 30 years) who were admitted to participating hospitals and who received a hospital discharge diagnosis of AMI (ICD 410); n = 4, 885.

The applied intervention was an educational program targeting community organizations and the general public, high-risk patients, and health professionals in target communities. The primary outcome was a change in the proportion of AMI patients receiving early reperfusion therapy (i. e., within one hour of ED arrival or within six hours of symptom onset). Trends in reperfusion therapy rates were determined after adjustment for patient demographics, presenting blood pressure, cardiac history, and insurance status.

Methods: We disseminated an online self-administered questionnaire through a number of international and regional organizations from the different WHO <b>regions.</b> <b>Eligible</b> individuals included persons with disability, caregivers of persons with disability, health professionals, administrators and policy makers. The answer options consisted of a 9 -point Likert scale. Results: Two hundred fifty three stakeholders participated. The majority of participants were health professional (64 %). In terms of outcomes, 'Increasing access' and 'Optimizing utilization' were the top service outcomes rated as critical (i. e., 7, 8 or 9 on the Likert scale) by > 70 % of respondents. 'Fewer hospital admissions', 'Decreased burden of care' and 'Increasing longevity' were the services rated as least critical (57 %, 63 % and 58 % respectively). In terms of services, 'Community based rehabilitation' and 'Home based rehabilitation' were found to be both definitely feasible and acceptable (75 % and 74 % respectively).

40|$|Within neoclassical {{economic}} growth approaches {{there is no}} fully satisfactory explanation for regional asymmetric growth. More recent extensions of the neoclassical model (new endogenous growth theories) recognise the possible influence {{of a set of}} intangible factors, which, nevertheless, do not allow a treatable empirical formalisation. Neo- institutional and evolutionary theories highlight the complex nature of {{economic growth}}, recognising the difficulty of non-linear dynamic modelling; however, both theories highlight the influential role played by innovation and technology diffusion processes. Missing from these theories is any appreciation of the social network characteristics of regions and the interaction between social and economic systems in conditioning the growth and development processes. In the present PhD thesis, we take the institutional network in small towns as the unity for analysis where information, money and support flows among them are studied. We apply a social network analysis framework, which allow us to find numerical indicators for the whole network as for each individual institutional role in it. Applying this framework in two case studies (in Portugal and in the USA) we found a set of interesting differences about the institutional mediation roles. While in the US, the private sector leaded by banks plays the keystone sector role, in Portugal, we still have public institutions as the main players. After the identification of the significant variables and attending to the different results in the two studies, we built a testable cross-section model that, controlling for proximity from urban centre, transportation costs, local factor endowments, amenities and so forth, can be tested using a broader database, to correlate town economic performances with the network identified variables. The deep understanding of the relational structure within these small towns makes it possible to quantify a set of crucial intangible variables that, acknowledged in a regional policy design, will contribute to increase its efficiency. Without a complete understanding of these social network structures, it is possible that current EU criteria used to define <b>regions</b> <b>eligible</b> for assistance may be inadequate. At the present time, the criteria for receipt of regional development funds are based on relative (to EU average) per capita levels and do not explore differences in economic potential or the capacity for regions to develop. Part of this capacity is rooted in the social network structure. Further on-going research will contribute to the deepening of neoclassical growth models, complementing considerations that evolutionary economics uses to explain the complexity of modern socio-economic life.

The same occurred in the US in December 2011 when the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of PCV 13 in the same target age-group with indication {{for the prevention of}} invasive pneumococcal diseases and community acquired pneumonia sustained by the serotypes contained in the vaccine. The Liguria Region, in Italy, implemented in 2013 an active and free of charge immunization strategy with PCV 13 among adults affected by specific risk conditions and the elderly aged ≥ 70 years. Methods An observational study was performed in order to assess the safety and tolerability of PCV 13 among elderly dwelling in the metropolitan area of Genoa, the capital city of Liguria <b>Region.</b> <b>Eligible</b> subjects, who received PCV 13 following the public health immunization campaign at the Local Health Unit 3 of Genoa, provided a written informed consent {{to take part in the}} study. Eight-hundred-seventy-one subjects were enrolled between October 2013 and May 2014 : all were monitored by qualified healthcare personnel for at least 30 min after vaccination at the outpatient clinics, in order to assess any possible sudden reaction. The occurrence of a series of local and systemic solicited reactions and of any unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) was monitored using a self-administered clinical diary and by regular phone contacts up to 14 and 21 d following immunization, respectively. Moreover, a 6 -months follow-up following vaccination was planned in order to monitor Severe Adverse Events (SAEs). Results No sudden reaction occurred in vaccinees at the outpatient clinics. Pain (27. 4 %) was the most frequent reaction reported by subjects at the injection site, while new muscle pain (13. 6 %), fatigue (10. 7 %), and headache (9. 9 %) resulted the most common systemic reactions. Rates of the main reactions reported in this on-field study resulted generally lower than those registered in clinical trials performed in the elderly. The incidence of fever (2. 2 %) following vaccination was low at values superimposable to that reported in previous studies.

40|$|Comparing the {{economic}} development and current situation of the internal markets of the U. S. and the EU, two things are noticeable. On the one hand, the EU is conducting massive regional policy programmes (notably the Structural Funds) to foster economic cohesion among the 27 nations belonging to the Single European Market while in the U. S. with its 50 federal states such policies play a rather subordinate role. At the first glance, {{this seems to be}} consistent with the situation in this two markets because in the U. S. only 2 % of the total population lives in regions with less than 75 % of the US-average GDP per capita while in the EU approximately 31 % of the total population lives in such <b>regions</b> <b>eligible</b> for structural funds support. In other words, regional policies in the U. S. would be redundant. But taking a closer look, on the other hand, reveals that the internal mobility of U. S. citizens is significantly higher than that of EU citizens. According to the neoclassical economic theory migration, besides the free flow of goods, services and capital, {{plays an important role in}} assuring convergence or economic cohesion, respectively. Following this strand of theory no regional policy is needed to achieve convergence among the regions or nations of a common market. Thus, comparing the two internal markets, the question comes up if the lower degree of economic cohesion in the EU has something to do with the lower internal market mobility of EU citizens and a higher degree of structural intervention of the EU regional policy? To answer this question, the paper consists of three parts. First, the theoretical background concerning migration and the potential need for regional policy is presented, to find out if one of them is a better instrument to achieve a balanced economic development within an internal market. In the second part, we discuss the actual situation of internal migration and examine why migration rates are comparatively low in the EU. In the last part, the interrelation between the EU regional policy and (internal) migration are analysed. Besides other things like language, culture or institutions this paper is going to argue that structural funds are inhibiting internal migration, which is one of the key measures in achieving convergence among the nations in the Single European market. It becomes clear, that the European regional policy aiming at economic cohesion among the 27 member states is inconsistent if the structural funds hamper instead of promoting migration...|$|R

Currently, in accordance with the distribution of taxes between the budgets of the order, the share of this tax in the regional budgets is directly dependent on the level and income level received by the population, to carry on activity in a particular area of the country. The article discusses the possibility of impact on the taxation of income of different categories of individuals from the regions. Since the tax on personal income has expressed toms-social orientation, in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation provided for the <b>regions</b> <b>eligible</b> {{for the establishment of a}} number of benefits for certain categories of taxpayers. This article describes the possible impact on the taxation of income of different categories of individuals from the regions by establishing incentives. The issues of granting tariff preferences income owners of private farms on the example of the Moscow region. An important social task of the state related to the support of family and birth rate increase, which is be implemented in the Russian Federation in the framework of the tax on personal income, is exemption from personal income tax funds regional maternal (family) capital. The regional legislation can be traced virtually the same position on the determination of the number of children in the case of birth (adoption) of which the inhabitants of the region there is a right to additional measures of state support and tax benefits. The data on the size of the analysis of the results of the regional maternity capital and the terms of its provision. We describe the benefits that the regions were able to provide 2016 individuals - payers of personal income tax on income from the sale of real estate. We consider the benefits that are currently install or may be establish by laws of subjects of federation in the taxation of payments under the attraction of labor resources. Data on factors deflator amounts established in the regions and affecting the tax-to moves of foreign nationals engaged in labor activities in Russia. The conclusion is that, on the one hand, the list of options for the provision of tax relief on personal income for the region in recent years, and incremental, but, on the other hand, regions have the capacity and increase the size of tax revenue due to the increase the tax burden on foreign nationals working in Russia...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{negotiation}} of the EU {{budget and the}} associated reform of EU Cohesion policy have had major policy implications for Spain, the country in receipt of most Cohesion policy support in the current programming period (2000 - 06). EU enlargement, combined with relatively rapid growth in Spain, impacted on the eligibility of Spanish regions for Cohesion support while also taking {{the country as a}} whole beyond the eligibility threshold for the Cohesion Fund. As a result, based on the original Commission budget proposals of February 2004, Spain was facing a reduced Cohesion policy budget of at least a half (to below € 30 billion). This paper first reviews the budget negotiations from a Spanish (Cohesion policy) perspective, identifying the key negotiating goals and the extent to which they were achieved. It then looks at the outcome of the negotiations for Spain, initially at the national level and then in the regions. It highlights the significant differential impacts of the cutbacks in Cohesion policy allocations at the regional level and the pressures on the Spanish government to modulate the regional impact of the budgetary changes. Having considered the direct funding implications of the new Cohesion policy, the second half of the paper is concerned with the regulatory, institutional and economic impacts of the new policy regime. Many of the reform proposals fit with Spanish priorities, not least the new rationale for Cohesion policy (with its stress on the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas) and the new policy architecture (with all <b>regions</b> <b>eligible</b> for some form of support and with a related shift from a geographic to more of a thematic focus). The retention of the key Structural Funds principles has also been welcomed in Spain, unsurprising given the wealth of experience and expertise built up over three (high-spending) programming cycles. As in most Member States, the main regulatory concern relates to the extent to which a more simplified and devolved approach to Funds' implementation will be achieved in practice. As regards policy and institutional impacts, the paper brings together regional views on the new budgetary and regulatory frameworks and reviews how the new regulations are being implemented in practice. A discussion of the developing National Strategic Reference Framework and the related Operational Programmes makes clear that the strong emphasis on the Lisbon agenda is not viewed as a constraint in Spain; rather, it is felt to fit well with recent Spanish developments and goals. Finally, the paper considers the economic implications of the reductions in Cohesion policy support. On the basis of evaluation studies, it highlights the positive impact the Funds have had in the past and the potentially quite varied regional impacts the reductions in funding may have in the future...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 2002, the euro has enjoyed {{an increasingly important}} role in international monetary relations. This {{is due to the}} fact that the euro is issued by one of the world’s leading economic and trading powers. Moreover, the expectation that the euroarea will enjoy low inflation rates in the long term increases confidence in the European currency. The euro is becoming a competitor to the US dollar as “the international currency”. It might even overtake the American currency – as many economists predict – in case of a weak US macroeconomic policy performance, as well as depending on how the euro establishes itself in international financial markets, and – last but not least – on how many (and how rapidly) new EC Members will join the euro, making the euroarea economy larger than the US one. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the eurozone enlargement from a legal point of view. This enlargement can take place either with the consent of the European Community or unilaterally. In fact, the euro can be adopted by a EC Member State, respecting the Maastricht convergence criteria, or by third States through the execution of international monetary treaties (e. g. San Marino, the Vatican, Monaco). Otherwise, the euro can be adopted “unilaterally” by third (non-European) States by conferring it legal tender status with an internal act. This last solution shall be considered legitimate from an international law point of view. This paper is structured in three sections. The first section is devoted to the enlargement of the European Monetary Union. Particular attention is given to the legal issues arising from the participation of the new EC Member States in the Exchange Rate Mechanism 2 (ERM 2). This analysis is of fundamental importance, because participation in the ERM 2 is necessary to meet the exchange rate stability convergence criterion that non-euro EC Members should comply with in order to adopt the single currency. The second section investigates on what legal grounds the Community can negotiate bilateral monetary agreements, with the goal of a consensual introduction of the euro in the counterpart State. This method has mainly been used with European micro-States. The last section aims at evaluating if, under an international law point of view, third States can legitimately “euroize”. While the position of the European Community on the euroization of non-European countries may be deemed neutral, the Community has actively discouraged the unilateral adoption of the euro by States of the European <b>region</b> <b>eligible</b> for EC membership. In fact, prospective accession countries should not unilaterally confer the euro legal tender status bypassing the convergence process foreseen by the EC Treaty. Eventually, a comparison between the EC policy and the US policy on official euroization/dollarization is offered. It is not the aim of this paper to discuss why countries should decide to adopt a foreign currency, nor to consider the pros and cons of euroization/dollarization...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of the origin}} of life was fundamentally changed by the discovery of catalytic RNA. The fascinating fact that RNA can function as a catalyst in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, thereby creating enantiomeric centers and thus potential building blocks for life-sustaining structures, is of great importance to those who wish to understand biocatalytic processes. Ribozymes are generally identified by in vitro selection. Such an artificial ribozyme was utilized for the work presented in this dissertation; specifically, the Diels-Alderase ribozyme was the focus of the investigation. This ribozyme catalyzes a Diels-Alder reaction between anthracene and maleimide. The work presented herein revolved around modifications of oligonucleotides on different levels. Modification of RNA with organic moieties is indispensable for effective in vitro selection of such ribozymes. This thesis consists of three parts. In the first, new pathways were established for the synthesis of modified guanosine monophosphates (GMPs). The ability of the enzyme T 7 RNA polymerase to incorporate these modified GMPs during transcription priming coined the term initiator nucleotides. The syntheses of a substituted anthracene and aldehyde-modified initiator nucleotides connected with a flexible polyethylene glycol linker were realized in just three synthetic steps. The incorporation of the initiator nucleotides into short RNA transcripts was investigated, as well as their incorporation into an RNA library with a randomized <b>region</b> <b>eligible</b> for in vitro selection. Excellent incorporation rates up to 77 % were obtained for the transcription into the RNA library. The reactivity of thereby modified RNA molecules was subsequently studied in chemical reactions. Whereas the anthracene derivative could be reacted in a Diels-Alder reaction, the aldehyde led to full conversion in the reaction with hydrazides. In the second part of this thesis, the effect of divalent metal ions on the folding and stability of the Diels-Alderase ribozyme was studied in UV thermal denaturation experiments. Low concentrations of Mg 2 + cations led to secondary structure stabilization of up to 85 °C. Thermal denaturation studies of the wild-type ribozyme and comparison to mutants complement other ongoing investigations of the complex interplay of non-standard base pairs and triples in the ribozyme structure. While the wild-type ribozyme exhibited a significant stabilization in the presence of Mg 2 + cations, a comparable stabilization of the mutants could not be observed. In accordance with the findings in other studies, the best interpretation of this effect on stability was that the mutants, despite their ability to form a pseudoknot structure, could not undergo further compaction. In the third part of this thesis, the Diels-Alderase ribozyme, which causes a remarkable acceleration of the Diels-Alder reaction rate, was successfully used as a catalyst for fluorescently labeling oligonucleotides in cis and in trans. Investigations of the substrate specificity of the ribozyme revealed that only fluorescent maleimide dyes with five carbon atoms next to the dye were accepted as substrates. This distinct feature was utilized as a bioorthogonal labeling strategy for the Diels-Alder bioconjugation of anthracene-modified oligonucleotides with equimolar proportions of fluorescent dyes. A new dual orthogonal labeling strategy was achieved by using an iodoacetamide dye for the thiol modification and a maleimide dye for the anthracene modification within the same DNA strand. For the anthracene modification, the Diels-Alderase ribozyme was employed as a catalyst...|$|R
