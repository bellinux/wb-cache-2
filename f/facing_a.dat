40|$|The US Department of Energy has {{formulated}} various sets {{of gasoline}} fuels, called fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE), which are consistent in composition and properties. The analysis of heating and evaporation of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel (paraffin-rich) is studied by replacing the 66 components with 19 components to represent this fuel. The {{reduction in the}} number of components is based on merging components from the same chemical groups and having the same chemical formula, which have very close thermophysical properties; the components with the highest initial compositions are chosen to be the representative components. Modelling of heating and evaporation of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel and various surrogates is carried out based on the effective thermal conductivity/effective diffusivity model (ETC/ED). The model takes into account the effect of finite liquid thermal conductivity, finite liquid mass diffusivity and recirculation inside the droplets due to their non-zero velocities relative to the ambient air. Four surrogates of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> found in the literature are used in the analysis. These surrogates include the five component surrogate chosen for its ability to match the ignition delay time of the <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel (Surr 1), the primary reference fuel surrogate (PRF 84) that matches the research octane number (RON) of <b>FACE</b> <b>A,</b> the one that matches hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (H/C), RON, density and distillation curve with <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> (Surr 2), and the one that matches the RON based on mole fraction linear blending (Surr 3). It is shown that these surrogates cannot predict adequately the time evolution of surface temperatures and radii of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> droplets. New „physical‟ surrogates with 8, 7 and 6 components (Surr 4, Surr 5, and Surr 6) are introduced to match the evaporation characteristics of <b>FACE</b> <b>A.</b> It is found that Surr 5 (7 components surrogate) can predict droplet lifetime and time evolution of surface temperature of <b>a</b> <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> droplet with errors of up to 5 % and 0. 25 %, respectively. Also, the results show that the H/C, molecular weight and RON of the new surrogates are reasonably close to those of <b>FACE</b> <b>A.</b> These results allow us to recommend that <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel can be replaced by the 7 component surrogate that matches H/C, molecular weight, and the RON of <b>FACE</b> <b>A,</b> and adequately predicts the lifetime and surface temperatures of this particular fuel droplet...|$|R

Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed the goal line for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
