25|$|In April 1897, Thomson {{had only}} early {{indications}} that the cathode rays could be deflected electrically (previous investigators such as Heinrich Hertz had thought they could not be). A month after Thomson's announcement of the corpuscle, he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> to a very low pressure. By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass-to-charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates. This became the classic means of measuring the charge and mass of the electron.|$|E

Early in 1896, {{just a few weeks}} after Röntgen published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality X-ray images in journals in Paris and London. Although Pulyui had studied with Röntgen at the University of Strasbourg in the years 1873–75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.|$|E

2500|$|In 1886, Eugen Goldstein {{observed}} rays in gas discharges under {{low pressure}} that traveled {{away from the}} anode and through channels in a perforated cathode, opposite to the direction of negatively charged cathode rays (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged anode rays [...] "Kanalstrahlen"; the standard translation of this term into English is [...] "canal rays". Wilhelm Wien found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (Q/m). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended {{on the nature of}} the gas in the <b>discharge</b> <b>tube.</b> English scientist J.J.

This {{was a result of}} Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique [...] "target" [...] of mica, used for holding samples of fluorescent material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, {{professor of medicine at the}} college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin photographic plates obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen's work.|$|E

Travers later wrote, [...] "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget." [...] The procedure of examining the colors of the light emitted from gas-discharge (or [...] "Geissler" [...] tubes) was well-known at the time, since the colors of light (the [...] "spectral lines") emitted by a gas <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> are, essentially, fingerprints that identify the gases inside.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his classic}} experiment, Thomson {{measured}} the mass-to-charge {{ratio of the}} cathode rays by measuring how much they were deflected by a magnetic field and comparing this with the electric deflection. He used the same apparatus as in his previous experiment, but placed the <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> between the poles of a large electromagnet. He found that the mass-to-charge ratio was over a thousand times {{lower than that of}} a hydrogen ion (H+), suggesting either that the particles were very light and/or very highly charged. [...] Significantly, the rays from every cathode yielded the same mass-to-charge ratio. This is in contrast to anode rays (now known to arise from positive ions emitted by the anode), where the mass-to-charge ratio varies from anode-to-anode. [...] Thomson himself remained critical of what his work established, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech referring to [...] "corpuscles" [...] rather than [...] "electrons".|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the most}} common type of ozone {{generator}} for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the [...] "hot spark" [...] coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a corona <b>discharge</b> <b>tube.</b> They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.|$|E
2500|$|A modern display {{technology}} using {{a variation of}} cathode ray tube is often used in videocassette recorders, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels, [...] and automotive dashboards. Rather than raster scanning, these vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) switch control grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses phosphor-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit {{a broad spectrum of}} greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small.
