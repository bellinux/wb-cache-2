5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
25|$|In the {{passenger}} airline case, capacity {{is regarded as}} fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is {{the exception rather than}} the rule. When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus can be said to have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is <b>excess</b> <b>demand,</b> the seats can be sold at a higher price.|$|E
40|$|Price {{dynamics}} are studied on {{the basis}} of more than 11, 000 transactions from twelve large-scale financial markets experiments. Transaction price changes are strongly correlated with the <b>excess</b> <b>demands</b> that form the core of competitive general equilibrium theory. The evidence for market microstructure theory (which focuses on strategic interaction, appealing to game theory) is more qualified. On the one hand, more predictability is uncovered than expected by chance. In particular, imbalances in the book too often predict subsequent transaction price changes. On the other hand, the nature of the predictability changes in unstructured ways, rendering it essentially useless. Weighted average quotes in the book strongly correlate with <b>excess</b> <b>demands,</b> providing evidence for a link between (competitive) general equilibrium theory and (strategic) market microstructure theory. There is no inconsistency in the findings that transaction price changes correlate with <b>excess</b> <b>demands</b> yet not with information in the book (at least not in structured ways) {{while at the same time}} the book correlates with <b>excess</b> <b>demands.</b> Indeed, the findings can be reconciled because weighted average quotes in the book explain part of the variance of transaction price changes that is unaccounted for by <b>excess</b> <b>demands.</b> Keywords: Price Discovery, Stability Analysis, Walrasian Tatonnement, Perfect Competition, Game Theory, Market Microstructure Theory, Experimental Finance, General Equilibrium Theory, Asset Pricing Theory. 2 Reconciling Competitive And Strategic Approaches To Price Discovery In Financial Markets: The Empirical Evidence Elena Asparouhova, Peter Bossaerts and Charles Plott...|$|R

25|$|Nothing {{improved}} {{when the}} government then tried to go into reverse with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered <b>excess</b> <b>demand.</b> The government apparently lost its sense of direction, retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.|$|E

This is an exchange economy with no money, so cherries are traded for apples and vice versa. If <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> for cherries is zero, then by Walras's law, <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> for apples is also zero. If there is <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> for cherries, {{then there will be}} a surplus (excess supply, or negative <b>excess</b> <b>demand)</b> for apples; and the market value of the <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> for cherries will equal the market value of the excess supply of apples.|$|E

50|$|A result {{known as}} the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem states that the {{aggregate}} <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> function inherits only certain properties of individual's demand functions, and that these (Continuity, Homogeneity of degree zero, Walras' law and boundary behavior when prices are near zero) are the only real restriction one can expect from an aggregate <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> function: any such function can be rationalized as the <b>excess</b> <b>demand</b> of an economy.

30|$|Our {{findings}} in [1] were well motivated by economics. However, {{it appears that}} our results have natural origins in economics.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{a recent}} paper, Dominique (2009) argues {{that for a}} Walrasian economy with m {{consumers}} and n goods, the equilibrium set of prices becomes a fractal attractor due to continuous destructions and creations of <b>excess</b> <b>demands.</b> The paper also posits that the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor is d = ln (n) / ln (n- 1) if there are n copies of sizes (1 /(n- 1)), but that assumption does not hold. This note revisits the problem, demonstrates that the Walrasian economy is indeed self-similar and recomputes the Hausdorff dimensions of both the attractor and that of a time series of a given market. ...|$|R
