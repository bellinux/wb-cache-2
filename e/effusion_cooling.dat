40|$|This thesis {{presents}} CFD {{predictions of}} gas turbine film and <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling.</b> The dearth of detailed experimental adiabatic <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> data {{led to the}} validation of the computational procedures against the experimental adiabatic cooling effectiveness data for a single row of inclined round film cooling holes. This showed that the overall best agreement of the CFD predictions with experimental data was for the realizable k-e turbulence model with enhanced wall function. This was also shown to give good predictions of experimental results for trench outlet film cooling. This film cooling CFD work was extended. to demonstrate trench outlet lip geometries that could further improve the cooling effectiveness. The limitation of the CFD model was at higher blowing rates, M, when the film jet lifted off from the surface, where the CFD did not accurately predict the adiabatic cooling effectiveness close to the hole. For attached jets at lower M the agreement was good. The same CFD procedures were used for all the <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> conjugate heat transfer (CHT) predictions. The hot metal wall <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> experimental data base of Andrews and co-workers (1983 - 1995) was used to validate the CHT <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> predictions. This database was for combustor flat wall cooling with mainly 90 ° injection holes. The overall <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> effectiveness was measured and this required conjugate heat transfer CFD predictions. The adiabatic film cooling effectiveness was also predicted, by using a gas tracer in the cooling air and predicting its concentration at the effusion wall. For each effusion hole configuration, the coolant mass flow rate, G kg/srrr 2 bar, was varied from 0. 1 to 1. 5 and each G required a separate computation. The influence {{of the number of}} holes at a constant X!D of 4. 6 and the hole size at fixed X were investigated. The agreement between the predictions and experimental data was good. Finally, the influence of the effusion coolant jets flow direction to the hot-gas crossflow on <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> performance was investigated. This included 30 ° inclined opposed-flow jets effusion wall, which was predicted to be the best effusion jets flow pattern. The addition of the filleted shape trench outlet to <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> was predicted to improve the cooling performance with reduced coolant mass flow rate, due to the improved adiabatic film cooling.

40|$|<b>Effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> is a {{promising}} approach to cool especially {{the walls of}} lean combustors where the cooling air consumption is to be reduced significantly. Due to the velocity distribution and cooling air pressure drop in a combustor the effectiveness can be further increased by reducing the cooling air momentum. Double skin designs like impingement <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> provide a significant improvement but at the drawback of a complex and expensive manufacturing process. Different advanced cooling concepts offering a similar reduction of the cooling air jet momentum in a single skin design for metal and ceramic walls are characterized under realistic conditions. Lateral trenches as well as effusion holes with 90 ° turns are used. Their total cooling effectiveness is compared to a plain single skin <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> concept.

40|$|The {{desire to}} {{increase}} the efficiency, i. e., reduce the specific fuel consumption and raise the thrust-to-weight ratio, of gas turbines {{has led to an}} increase in pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber and turbine. The operational life of the combustion chamber walls decreases with increased temperature thus an effective method of cooling must be used to protect the wall. <b>Effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> provides a practical solution to this engineering problem. A fundamental understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in effusion flow fields is required to make significant advances in cooling technology. At the same time, designers need a predictive design tool that allows quick turnaround times without the current build and break approach. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) presents the designer with the potential for an effective, fast and relatively accurate method of achieving this. This paper presents a computational study of <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> applications using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. The need to evaluate the predictive capability of the Reynolds Stress Transport (RST) model when applied to Full Coverage Film-Cooling (FCFC) effusion scenarios is highlighted since two-equation Eddy-Viscosity (EV) models fail to predict turbulent anisotropy and therefore the complex flow mechanisms involved in <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> flow fields. An isothermal and non-isothermal numerical study of <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> flow is conducted. In the isothermal case the RST model is shown to be capable of predicting the injection, penetration, downstream decay and lateral mixing of the effusion jets reasonably well. In the non-isothermal case the laterally averaged cooling effectiveness across the plate is slightly under-predicted but still conforms to the general increasing tren...|$|E

40|$|A {{potential}} low coolant {{mass flow}} impingement/effusion {{design for a}} low NOx combustor wall cooling application was predicted, using conjugate heat transfer (CHT) computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The effusion and impingement cooling were also predicted for comparison with their combination. The effusion geometry investigated, with 4306 /m 2 effusion holes in a square array with a hole diameter of D and pitch of X and X/D of 1. 9, had previously been shown experimentally and using CHT/CFD to have the highest adiabatic and overall cooling effectiveness for this number of effusion holes. The effect of adding an X/D of 4. 7 impingement jet wall with a 6. 6 mm impingement gap, Z, and Z/D of 2. 0, on the overall cooling effectiveness was predicted for several coolant mass flow rates, G kg/sm²bar. At low G the internal wall heat transfer dominated the overall cooling effectiveness. The addition of impingement cooling to <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> gave only a small increase in the overall cooling effectiveness at all G at 127 mm downstream of the start of <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling.</b> An overall cooling effectiveness > 0. 7 was predicted for a low G of 0. 30 kg/sm². This represents about 15 % of the combustion air for a typical industrial gas turbine combustor and design changes to reduce this further were suggested based on the predictions of this geometry. The main benefit of the impingement cooling was {{at the start of}} the <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling,</b> where the overall cooling effectiveness was dominated by the internal wall impingement and <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling.</b> The aerodynamic interaction between the impingement jets and the air inlet to the effusion holes deteriorated both the internal effusion hole and impingement gap recirculating flow heat transfer.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of currently available 10 MPa combustion chambers, hot gaspressures of up to 25 MPa are desirable.

40|$|Technologies for porous <b>effusion</b> or {{transpiration}} <b>cooled</b> ceramic {{combustion chambers}} are under investi-gation at DLR since {{a couple of}} years. Research concentrates on applying transpiration cooling to C/C liners as a candidate technology {{to fulfill the requirements}} of future cryogenic (LOX/LH 2) liquid rocket engines, taking advantage of interesting features of C/C liners such as low weight as well as potentially increased reliability and life time of the rocket engine. A fully ceramic combustion chamber including noz-zle is currently foreseen to be testfired in early 2011 (see Figure 1 !). The question when and in which application a ceramic combustion chamber can first be used in a launcher propulsion system becomes now more imminent. The introduction of this new technology in any existing relatively large European launch vehicle like Vega or Ariane without prior successful space flight application is unlikely. A first potential future use of the <b>effusion</b> <b>cooled</b> engine is more likely in a com-pletely new vehicle of smaller size.

40|$|Within an {{interdisciplinary}} research group metal foams are investigated, which {{are meant to}} be used as <b>effusion</b> <b>cooled</b> wall elements in a combustion chamber of an advanced high efficiency gas turbine. Two of the properties of the metal foams which determine the thermodynamic behaviour of the wall elements are permeability and thermal conductivity. These two properties depend highly on the porosity of the metal foam. Changing the porosity of a metal foam along a direction leads to a gradient in the porosity and thermal conductivity. This grading of metal foams enables adjusting material properties accordingly to the position within the wall element. Metal foams with a gradation in one direction are fabricated and local material properties are determined. The local topology is determined via X-ray tomography. The homogenised thermal conductivity is measured using a Transient Plane Source Technique, also known as HotDisk, and the permeability is measured with a pressure drop experiment. The measurements are done at different positions along the gradation. The experiments demonstrate that the topology of metal foams can be varied within the same foam sample and that properties of the foams like permeability and thermal conductance change accordingly. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{preliminary design}} is {{a competitive advantage}} {{in the development of}} an aero-engine. It has the potential of a significant decrease of development costs and time. In the frame work of the DLR programmes EVITA and PEGASUS, the software tool “CoSMA” (Combustor Strength and Modal Analysis) was developed for the thermomechanical design of lean combustors. Due to higher allowable material temperatures in comparison to state-of the art nickel-base alloys, ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) offer the chance for combustors with reduced cooling air consumption and lower NOx emissions. CMCs were implemented into the combustor design tool CoSMA. A combustor geometry and a temperature field in the combustor wall were generated by the combustor design tool “ComDAT” (Combustor pre-Design and Analysis Tool). In a first part, this paper presents the process of the CoSMA tool and the method used for calculating static thermal stresses, eigenfrequencies and failure criteria. In a second part, analytical methods for efficiently preselecting a material and for simple stress estimations in thermomechanically loaded liners are evaluated. Finally, an application example and a comparison to experimental combustor test results are detailed. This work shows the potential of cost-effective preliminary design tools for lean combustors.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Full-coverage or <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> is commonly used in the thermal management of gas turbine combustion systems. The combustor environment is characterised by highly turbulent free-stream conditions and relatively large turbulent length scales. This turbulent flow field is predominantly created by the upstream fuel injector for lean burn systems. In rich burn systems the turbulent flow field is augmented further {{by the addition of}} dilution ports. The available evidence suggests that large energetic eddies interact strongly with the injected coolant fluid and may {{have a significant impact on}} the film- cooling performance. The desire to create compact low-emission combustion systems with improved specific fuel consumption, has given rise to a desire to reduce the quantity of air used in wall cooling, and has led to the need for improved cooling correlations and validated computational methods. In order to establish a greater understanding of <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> under conditions of very high free-stream turbulence, a new laboratory test facility has been created that is capable of simulating representative combustor flow conditions, and that allows for a systematic investigation of cooling performance over a range of free-stream turbulence conditions (up to 25...|$|E

Quantity of air required for this purpose is 1-3% of main flow and blade temperature can be reduced by 200-300 °C.

40|$|To {{increase}} the overall efficiency in aero engines {{as well as}} stationary gas turbines detailed information on flow field properties under realistic operating conditions are required. While conventional probe based technology is readily available and thoroughly tested, most of these techniques are point-wise. To gain insight into complex flow structures spatially and temporally resolved data is needed. Planar optical measurement techniques are capable of providing this type of data in a cost effective manner. The paper describes an image based filtered Rayleigh scattering (FRS) technique that, on frequency scanning a narrow linewidth light source, provides time averaged temperature (or density) fields. FRS uses molecular absorption to attenuate elastically scattered light from surfaces or particles in the flow. The filtered light is collected by a camera sensor at a multitude of light source frequencies allowing the temperature to be inferred from the pixel intensities. The measurement technique is validated on a McKenna type premixed flame and shows a better than 2 % agreement to corresponding single point CARS measurements. The technique is further applied on a pressurized single sector combustor {{in an effort to}} visualize and quantify the cooling film on an <b>effusion</b> <b>cooled</b> combustor liner wall.

Driven by future NO_x emissions requirements and the corresponding emissions goals a NO_x reduction down to 49 % CAEPII C 1 for the ICAO take-off - landing cycle was achieved for the current E 3 EII engine cycle. The required cooling air reduction was obtained by application of optimised impingement <b>effusion</b> <b>cooled</b> tiles for the combustor liner cooling. The focus of {{the research}} and development work was given to the lean module burner which initially was conceived for an application within an axially staged combustor. During the course of the project due to cost and weight reasons the single annular combustor concept was favoured. Therefore the demands on the main burner in respect to operability were tightened which lead to the need for an integrated pilot zone within the lean module burner. An internally staged lean module burner was designed in collaboration with a fuel spray nozzle manufacturer. Within a fully annular combustor rig a prototype burner was successfully tested under simulated engine conditions. The emissions performance as well as the thermal load onto the combustor walls were investigated. Although the goals in respect to NO_x emissions module cost and weight were achieved some deficiencies remain in respect to ignition capability and lean blow out. (orig.)

40|$|This {{research}} work describes the experimental and numerical investigation of flow behaviour in effusively cooled, porous combustion chamber walls {{for use in}} rocket propulsion. The primary goal of the investigation is to develop methods for determining the properties of wall materials, with which the momentum and mass transport at the wall inner surface can be modelled macroscopically using existing laws from the theory of porous media (TPM). Based on these models, the flow of cooling fluid inside the porous chamber walls can be simulated using Navier-Stokes flow solvers, for example those implemented in commercial CFD software. The flow solver FLOTRAN, integrated in the software package ANSYS, {{was used in the}} current work to numerically investigate the behaviour of isothermal flows through material samples. The investigated material samples consist of carbon fibre-reinforced carbon (C/C). Orthotropic material behaviour was determined for the momentum and mass transport properties of the C/C material, considering the variation in material properties depending on the sample orientation (parallel or orthogonal flow). To characterise the influence of the cooling fluid on the momentum and mass transport properties, two different flow media (nitrogen, hydrogen) and diffusion media (pentane, diethyl ether) were tested. As a further measure of the influence on momentum transport, the relationship between the permeability coefficient of the C/C material and fluid pressure for isothermal flow through the material sample was investigated experimentally. The variation of pressure served to validate the Forchheimer model for momentum transport in <b>effusion</b> <b>cooled,</b> porous combustion chamber walls over a large range of pressure and therefore density values, which was the second goal of the current work.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for maintaining lean combustion in future power modules (integrated KEROMIX project) stable at elevated pressures and temperatures {{is to reduce}} the amount of component cooling air in favour of combustion air. An additional difficulty lies in the fact that materials that have been designed for greater temperature resistance and are difficult to process encumber <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling,</b> as do ceramic outer layers and ceramic plates that have to be held. Furthermore, the Lean-Rich Concept for low-NO_x combustion chambers requires that <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> is avoided in the primary zone. The cooling air film is permeable to radiation. Blowing out of cooling air is associated with aerodynamic and thermodynamic losses. For these reasons the proportion of interior cooling, i. e. the cooling effect of the cooling air on its way to the combustion chambers, should be increased. The cooling channels (intermediate gaps) should be examined for untapped cooling potentials. The first choice is baffle cooling because it is the most intensive cooling technique, despite the drawback of its localised effect. If appropriately adapted to pressure loss, surface roughening during or in addition to the manufacturing process can serve to equalise the cooling effect, avoid uncooled areas, and intensify heat transfer. Combined cooling techniques such as impact and <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> are in need of optimisation.

This could establish a homogeneous and protective coolant layer at the engine wall, protecting the areas with high thermal loads and the engine structure from thermal damage. The Institute of Space Propulsion of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed a research test bench to investigate the applicability of transpiration cooling systems to scramjets. This publication addresses the challenges connected with initial operation and summarizes the results of preliminary tests. Further research requirements are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a Large-Eddy Simulation of the flow around a {{perforated}} plate are described. A temperature difference is imposed across the perforated plate, to study the <b>effusion</b> <b>cooling</b> process. A configuration of full-coverage film cooling is considered: a specific methodology allowing to perform the simulation in a periodic computational do-main is presented. The geometry corresponds to classical configurations encountered in gas turbines liners: the hole diameter is 0. 5 mm, {{the thickness of the}} plate 1 mm, and the hole is angled at 30 ◦ respect to the plate. The density ratio is 2. 85 and the blowing ratio is M = 1. The flow obtained in such a periodic domain is described, focusing on informa-tion relevant to the estimation of mass/momentum/energy fluxes through the plate...|$|E

40|$|Time-series {{trends in}} thermal Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from 1993 to 1998 {{provide insight into}} the active {{volcanic}} processes at Bezymianny and Kliuchevskoi, two of the most dangerous volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The AVHRR time series show differences in these volcanoes' pre- and postexplosive trends: Bezymianny exhibited a thermal precursory signal in all recorded explosions between 1993 and 1998, as well as continued postexplosive activity, and Kliuchevskoi showed only short-lived thermal activity and exhibited precursors before the 1994 paroxysmal explosion. These contrasting characteristics reflect different magma types and eruption styles. At Bezymianny, a persistent thermal signal and precursory thermal increases are due to the slow ascent of andesitic magma, whereas the more rapid rise, <b>effusion,</b> and <b>cooling</b> of basaltic magmas at Kliuchevskoi give rise to a discontinuous thermal pattern. Documentation, analysis, and understanding of these characteristics contribute to the understanding of thermal signals and aid the development of monitoring algorithms and early warning techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|The further {{development}} of lean-burn technology for aero-engine applications requires an improved understanding {{of the interaction between}} wall cooling and the combustion processes. Wall cooling leads to combustion extinction and plays {{a significant role in the}} production of pollutants. Experimental investigation of the coupling between aerodynamics and combustion chemistry in the confines of pressurized combustion chamber is achieved by means of a dedicated burner, which burns very close to the wall, and an <b>effusion</b> <b>cooled</b> wall. While particle image velocimetry (PIV) lends itself for the measurement of the flow field, both the flame front as well as the temperature distribution can be estimated by quantitative concentration measurement of the OH radical using planar laser induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF). In this context PLIF on carbon monoxide (CO-PLIF) holds the potential of locating and quantifying areas of flame extinction and is the subject of the present feasibility study. In a first step the two-photon excitation of CO molecules at 230 nm was investigated from the spectroscopic view, in particular with respect to excitation and emission. From the respective excitation/emission spectra obtained in the flame of a calibrated matrix burner, the wavelengths can be detected at which CO is excited. Spectral analysis both reveal interference with other molecules (e. g. C 2) and provide reliable information for a simulation that also includes the influence of the quasi-resonant (2 + 1) ionization of the CO molecule. In a second step planar measurements were performed on this matrix burner using a fuel-rich methane/air flame (phi = 1. 45) as a reference flame with respect to which all other flames (phi = 0. 8 – 1. 3) are calibrated. This allows the influence of the position-dependent differences in the laser light sheet to be adequately considered and resulted in an even CO distribution for the different flames. The respective mean values of the CO concentration show good agreement with the results of equilibrium calculations. The present setup allows planar measurements of mean CO concentrations at a range of about 200 ppm while single pulse measurements are limited to roughly 1000 ppm. As the next step, the CO-PLIF measurement technique is to be applied on a pressurized single-sector combustion chamber...|$|R
