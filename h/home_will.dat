25|$|At the {{railroad}} tracks, Chanie {{turns in the}} direction away from the school and toward where he thinks his <b>home</b> <b>will</b> be. When it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold.

In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities.

Her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson lets himself into her parlour, stays for dinner, and searches her storerooms for honey but leaves a mess behind.
