50|$|He also {{initiated}} {{the process for}} regional preparations for ITU conferences, established and chaired the first interregional group to prepare for an ITU conference (1995) and established the Commonwealth ITU group. In addition he further enhanced the CEPT preparatory process for ITU conferences which he promoted in other regions. This CEPT process, which includes <b>European</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Proposals</b> and co-ordination procedures was initiated by Jean-Louis Blanc (F) David Court (G) and Klaus Olms (D) at the Cardiff (1985) and subsequent meetings of CEPT's Radiocommunications Group, in preparation for ITU Conferences held in 1985, 1987 and 1988.|$|R
40|$|WARC- 92 was {{the last}} of its kind. The "Last Big WARC". The process was very {{difficult}} and some refer to the conference as consensus by exhaustion, clearly demonstrating {{one of the reasons for}} restructuring the ITU. CEPT (Conference europeenne des Administrations des postes et des telecommunications) countries entered this Conference with their ECPs - <b>European</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Proposals</b> - extending thus the potential for frequency harmonization within Europe. The CEPT preparation for, and participation in, WARC- 92 was the most effective yet and built on lessons learned at a number of previous WARC's. This WARC was the first Conference where CEPT was present with its new expanded membership. European countries therefore had to be constantly on the guard to avoid giving the impression that CEPT was an inflexible political block with 32 potential votes. Lastly, the Soviet Union together with its satellites was, for the first time, no longer in evidence, although the Russian Federation was generally supported by other countries from within the new Commonwealth of Independent States. The objective of this article is to point out principal WARC decisions from European point of view...|$|R

50|$|The {{common frog}} (Rana temporaria), {{also known as}} the <b>European</b> <b>common</b> frog, <b>European</b> <b>common</b> brown frog, or European grass frog, is a {{semi-aquatic}} amphibian of the family Ranidae, found throughout much of Europe as far north as Scandinavia and as far east as the Urals, except for most of Iberia, southern Italy, and the southern Balkans. The farthest west it can be found is Ireland, where it has long been thought, erroneously, to be an entirely introduced species. They are also found in Asia, and eastward to Japan.|$|R
