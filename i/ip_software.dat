50|$|The email {{relaying}} {{service was}} called Phonenet, after the telephone-specific channel of the MMDF software developed by Crocker. The CSNET name service allowed manual and automated email address lookup based on various user attributes, such as name, title, or institution. The X.25 tunneling allowed an institution to connect {{directly to the}} ARPANET via a commercial X.25 service (Telenet), by which the institution's TCP/IP traffic would be tunneled to a CSNET computer that acted as a relay between the ARPANET and the commercial X.25 networks. CSNET also developed dialup-on-demand (Dialup <b>IP)</b> <b>software</b> to automatically initiate or disconnect SLIP sessions as needed to remote locations. CSNET was developed on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX-11 systems using BSD Unix, but it grew to support a variety of hardware and operating system platforms.|$|E
50|$|While IP handles actual {{delivery}} of the data, TCP keeps track of 'segments' - the individual units of data transmission that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the network. For example, when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software layer of that server divides the sequence of file octets into segments and forwards them individually to the <b>IP</b> <b>software</b> layer (Internet Layer). The Internet Layer encapsulates each TCP segment into an IP packet by adding a header that includes (among other data) the destination IP address. When the client program on the destination computer receives them, the TCP layer (Transport Layer) re-assembles the individual segments and ensures they are correctly ordered and error-free as it streams them to an application.|$|E
50|$|The Danish {{newspaper}} Dagbladet Information and The Intercept revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed RAMPART-A. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries {{tap into}} fiber optic cables carrying {{the majority of}} the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over <b>IP</b> <b>software</b> like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.|$|E

A new mobile software entity called user shadow is {{introduced to the}} wired network, addressing the roaming needs of the mobile user. With the help of these user shadows, most signaling interaction between mobile devices and wired networks is constrained to the wired links, reducing the dependence on the limited wireless bandwidth. Additionally, the novel concept of <b>software</b> <b>IP</b> mobility is introduced, enabling the mobile software entities (i. e., user shadows) to communicate using their own <b>IP</b> stack. <b>Software</b> <b>IP</b> mobility enhances the current IP mobility approaches while helping in providing with seamless mobility.

Operated eyes were divided into two groups, ie, those operated on using <b>IP</b> <b>software</b> (Group 1, n = 67) and those operated on without <b>IP</b> <b>software</b> (Group 2, n = 61). The two groups were compared in terms of ultrasound energy level, ultrasound energy time, aspiration time, and amount of fluid used during surgery. Results: Operated eyes were further grouped according to soft (grade 1 and 2, n = 37), medium (grade 3, n = 46), and hard (grade 4 and 5, n = 31) nuclear densities. Both the study and the control groups were similar in distribution of nuclear density (P &gt; 0. 05). Cumulative dissipated energy was measured as 14. 06 &plusmn; 9. 92 in Group 1 and 14. 22 &plusmn; 10. 99 in Group 2 (P = 0. 92). Total ultrasound time was 49 seconds in Group 1 and 52 seconds in Group 2 (P = 0. 58). Although the torsional amplitude used was similar (P = 0. 86) when IP was either on (71 %) or off (68. 4 %), aspiration time was found to be 4 minutes 17 seconds in Group 1 (P = 0. 86) and 5 minutes and 17 seconds in Group 2 (P = 0. 007). Total fluid used was measured as 91 cc (P = 0. 86) in Group 1 and 109 cc (P = 0. 02) in Group 2. Conclusion: The new <b>IP</b> <b>software</b> did not cause a difference in ultrasound energy levels. However, the new software was found to be advantageous in regards to fluid use and aspiration time.

Theoretical lessons in comparing "bad" and "good" formulations are best accompanied by giving students hands-on experience of solving them [...] or trying to. Several models that allow a simple empirical comparison of formulations are fixed cost network flow and facility location problems (the aggregated vs. disaggregated formulations); and lot sizing (using the basic formulation without or with other added inequalities), see eg. the recent book by Wolsey [Wol]. 1 Few optimization problems are as fascinating though as the traveling salesman problem [...] ...|$|E
