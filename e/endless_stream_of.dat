25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{indicator of}} the importance Berlioz placed on journalistic integrity and even-handedness were the journals which he both did and did not write for. During {{the middle of the}} 1830s the Gazette was considered an intellectual journal, strongly supporting the progressive arts and Romanticism in general, and opposing anything which it considers as debasing this. Exemplified in its long-standing criticism of Henri Herz, and his seemingly <b>endless</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> variations on opera themes, but to its credit, it also positively reviewed his music on occasion. Its writers included Alexandre Dumas, Honoré de Balzac and George Sand. The Gazette wasn't even unanimous in its praise of Berlioz's music, although it always recognised him as an important and serious composer to be respected. An example of another journal of the same time is the Revue musicale, which thrived on personal attacks, many against Berlioz himself from the pen of critic François-Joseph Fétis. At one point, Robert Schumann was motivated to publish a detailed rebuttal of one of Fétis' attacks on Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique in his own Neue Zeitschrift für Musik journal. Fétis would later contribute to the debasement of the reputation of the Gazette when his journal failed and was absorbed by the Gazette, he found himself on the editorial board.|$|E

The professionalization of philosophers created other problems of this socio-cultural practice. The dying out of philosophy is not only cased by external social and cultural factors, but also by internal factors such as its methods and those concerning its subject-matter. I have explored the above in the context of meta-philosophy. In the process I also investigated the nature, the subject-matter and theories of philosophy of art, aesthetics and theory of art. It is mostly about these explorations of art that the contents of this piece is concerned with. All this is an exercise with words as the verbal means are the traditional instruments of doing philosophy. These tools not only enable the doing of philosophy but also creates limitations and limits to philosophizing. This will remain the case until the discourse develops other (for example visual, auditory, computational, etc) means to develop its many levelled and multi-dimensional practice - and in the process questions and overcomes its anthropo-centered bias...|$|R

40|$|Validation of RTL {{circuits}} {{remains the}} primary bottleneck in improving design turnaround time, and simulation remains the primary methodology for validation. Simulation-based validation {{has suffered from}} a disconnect between the metrics {{used to measure the}} error coverage of a set of simulation vectors, and the vector generation process. This disconnect has resulted in the simulation <b>of</b> virtually <b>endless</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> vectors which achieve enhanced error coverage only infrequently. Another drawback has been that most error coverage metrics proposed have either been too simplistic or too inefficient to compute. Recently, an effective observability-based statement coverage metric was proposed along with a fast companion procedure for evaluating it. The contribution of our work is the development of a vector generation procedure targeting the observability-based statement coverage metric. Our method uses repeated coverage computation to minimize the number of vectors generated. For vector generation, we propose a novel technique to set up constraints based on the chosen coverage metric. Once the system of interacting arithmetic and Boolean constraints has been set up, it can be solved using hybrid linear programming and Boolean satisfiability methods. We present heuristics to control the size of the constraint system that needs to be solved. We present experimental results which show the viability of automatically generating vectors using our approach for industrial RTL circuits. We envision our system being used during the design process, as well as during post-design debugging. ...|$|R

40|$|The Achilles Heel of {{stochastic}} optimization algorithms {{is getting}} trapped on local optima. Novelty Search avoids {{this problem by}} encouraging a search in all interesting directions. That occurs by replacing a performance objective with a re-ward for novel behaviors, as defined by a human-crafted, and often simple, behavioral distance function. While Novelty Search is a major conceptual breakthrough and outperforms traditional stochastic optimization on certain problems, {{it is not clear}} how to apply it to challenging, high-dimensional problems where specifying a useful behavioral distance func-tion is difficult. For example, in the space of images, how do you encourage novelty to produce hawks and heroes instead of endless pixel static? Here we propose a new algorithm, the Innovation Engine, that builds on Novelty Search by re-placing the human-crafted behavioral distance with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that can recognize interesting dif-ferences between phenotypes. The key insight is that DNNs can recognize similarities and differences between pheno-types at an abstract level, wherein novelty means interesting novelty. For example, a novelty pressure in image space does not explore in the low-level pixel space, but instead creates a pressure to create new types of images (e. g. churches, mosques, obelisks, etc.). Here we describe the long-term vision for the Innovation Engine algorithm, which involves many technical challenges that remain to be solved. We then implement a simplified version of the algorithm that enables us to explore some of the algorithm’s key motivations.
