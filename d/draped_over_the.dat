5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E

5|$|McIntyre {{then began}} wrestling as a singles wrestler, {{immediately}} feuding with The Fabulous Moolah, unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 (the referee counted the pin on McIntyre despite her left leg being <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bottom rope {{which should have}} stopped the count). She won the WWF Women's Championship on July 3, 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF's 1986 Australian tour, but Moolah regained the title six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (the only two times the WWF Women's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere). Years later, Moolah called McIntyre the best female wrestler in Canada. In 1987, McIntyre consistently lost matches to Moolah and Sherri Martel. She also competed at the Survivor Series, teaming with Moolah, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels against Martel, Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie. By 1990, however, the women's division in the WWF was again on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
5|$|The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division, {{plus the}} Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments, use the Saltire {{in a variety}} of forms. Combat and {{transport}} vehicles of these Army units may be adorned with a small, (130x80mm approx.), representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle. (On tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq, during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic, the Saltire was seen to be flown from the communications whip antenna of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals, conducted with full military honours, of casualties of these operations in Iraq, (plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan), have also been seen to include the Saltire; the flag being <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> coffin of the deceased on such occasions.|$|E

5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E
25|$|Pelerines, tippets, or lace {{coverings}} <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shoulders, {{were popular}} (one of several devices, along with full upper-arm sleeves and wide necklines, {{to emphasize the}} shoulders and their width).|$|E

25|$|There {{was little}} fault {{movement}} during the Tertiary, but differential compaction created a simple anticline <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> underlying Cretaceous structure. At basement level, Sarir C is less pronounced than structures {{to the south}} and northwest, which have poor sand development, in that Late Cretaceous shales rest on basement without the intervening sandstone reservoir of the Sarir field.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{the flag}} of the United States plays a role in {{military}} funerals, and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pelerine}} (from French [...] "pèlerine" [...] (pilgrim), is a cape-collar {{covering the}} shoulders. Layered muslin pelerines were {{popular in the}} 1830s as an option to <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of the large sleeves fashionable at that period. Along with tippets, they helped emphasise the fashionable width of the sleeves and the shoulderline of the decade.|$|R

25|$|From the 1920s to the 1970s, {{the use of}} what {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the “veil” – this term could mean anything from a face veil to a shawl loosely <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head – declined until only a minority of Muslim women outside the conservative societies of the Arabian peninsula still used it. However, in recent decades there has been an increase in the number of Muslim women wearing new types of head coverings which are known by the generic appellation “ḥijāb”.|$|E
25|$|Modern Gourd Dance regalia {{consists}} of a red and blue blanket <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shoulders. (This accessory represents night and day). Some dancers change the blanket to rest over the heart red {{during the day and}} blue after dark. A skunk berry (Ka-hole) and silver beaded bandolier fastened on the left shoulder is draped across the heart. The red skunk berry bandolier was added as a memorial tribute to a battle fought with Cheyenne warriors. The aftermath left the land covered with red blood and is represented by the red skunk berries. A handkerchief bundle of Indian perfume, gathered from the foothills, is tied {{to the back of the}} bandolier.|$|E
25|$|Muslim women {{generally}} {{wear the}} tudung (hijab or headscarf) over their heads. However, Malay women not wearing any headgear are not reprimanded or penalised. Prominent Malaysian female examples are Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz, International Trade and Industry Minister and Tun Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, wife of former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir bin Mohammad. However, with {{the influx of}} Arabic travellers, foreign Muslim women (Arabs) wearing hijab that leave only their eyes exposed are often spotted in tourist attractions, not the least at the shopping malls. At certain Malaysian {{institutions such as the}} International Islamic University, wearing of the tudung is mandatory; however for non-Muslim students this usually amounts to a loosely worn piece of cloth <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> back of the head.|$|E
