40|$|The Dogger Bank is a {{potential}} transboundary marine protected area (MPA) located in Dutch, German, Danish and UK waters. International and EU legal instruments contain provisions requiring cooperation during the designation and pro- tection/management of the Dogger Bank as an MPA. Many of the cooperation requirements are not specified; therefore, Member States are left with a certain discretion as to the extent and form of {{the implementation of the}} required cooperation. Since this cooperation began taking place, the required standards seem to be being met. However, the exact meaning of the requirement for cooperation included in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is questionable; {{it remains to be seen}} whether the current cooperation complies with this Directive. In order to optimise the current cooperation practice, an increasing role for the European Commission (EC) and the <b>Habitats</b> <b>Committee</b> within the process of the designation and management of the Dogger Bank as an MPA could be strived for. Furthermore, when looking at the relevant legal instru- ments an amendment of Oslo-Paris (OSPAR) Recommendation 2003 / 3 provides an option to further establish a specific legal basis for cooperation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Since 1985, {{woodland}} caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) have been {{designated as a}} threatened species in Alberta. Populations studied since the 1970 s have been stable or declining, with no population increases documented. Resource expansion into previously undeveloped areas and associated increases in access have been implicated as possible causes for the declines. To facilitate development on caribou ranges, while ensuring the integrity and supply of caribou <b>habitat,</b> standing <b>committees</b> have been formed. The primary role of the committees is to act as advisory bodies {{to the government and}} to search for effective and efficient industrial operating guidelines. Recent research has been conducted on the responses of {{woodland caribou}} ecotypes to increased human and predator access. Based on this research, operating guidelines have been refined and implemented through Caribou Protection Plans.

40|$|Throughout the {{preceding}} basin and habitat sections, we detail many specific conservation priorities, such {{that within a}} particular basin or habitat, a reader can assess the most pressing needs and actions. But we also wanted to assess cross-cutting strategies that provide straightforward direction among and across basins and habitats, over the first cycle of Plan implementation. This chapter is dedicated to doing just that. In order to assess priorities among basins and <b>habitats,</b> Technical <b>Committee</b> team members developed the following model (Figure 6. 1). The criteria described below {{can be applied to}} individual species, groups of species, habitats, or ecosystem processes (i. e., an “element”). Tier 1 – Ideal criteria to assess (“what’s most important?”) : • Risk/threat: Immediacy and/or severity of threats to element. • Need: Conservation needs not being adequately addressed by an existing program or funding source • Knowledge: Knowledge gaps or deficiencies necessary to making a conservation decision Tier 2 – Realistic considerations to assess (“what will produce the best results?”) : • Feasibility (cost / benefits analysis) : Degree to which initiating conservation actions will be worth the cost/effort; degree to which actions can mitigate a threat, impact a solution • Benefit: Degree, longevity, and magnitude of conservation benefits (ecological, educational, social, and/or economic) • Funding: Match opportunities • Partnerships: Partnership opportunities, ability to leverage resource...|$|R
40|$|River in the 25 miles between Friant Darn and Freeway 99 {{occurs on}} {{approximately}} 6 {{percent of its}} historic range. It is threatened directly and indirectly by increased urban encroachment such as residential housing, certain recreational uses, sand and gravel extraction, aquiculture, and road construction. The San Joaquin River Committee was formed in 1985 to advocate preservation and restoration of riparian <b>habitat.</b> The <b>Committee</b> works with local school districts to facilitate use of riverbottom riparian forest areas for outdoor environmental education. We recently formed a land trust called the San Joaquin River Parkway and Conservation Trust to preserve land through acquisition in fee and negotiation of conservation easements. Opportunities for increasing riverbottom riparian habitat are presented by lands from which sand and gravel have been extracted. Study Area Natural vegetation in the San Joaquin River bottomlands between Friant Darn and Freeway 99 creates a broad corridor of different vegetation communities. The most critical of these vegetative communities is the riparian community which interfaces water, vegetation and wildlife resources, bisecting or bordering on diverse habitat. Along the 25 miles of the San Joaquin River bottomlands below Friant Darn only about 6 percent of the original riparian habitat may be found (Counties of Madera and Fresno, and City of Fresno 1986). Losses of riparian habitat along the San Joaquin River are attributable to agricultural and urban encroachment, sand and gravel extraction, road construction, snagging, clearing, and riprapping. In 1986 the California Department of Fish and Game mapped the riparian vegetation corridor along the San Joaquin River for Madera and Fresno Counties, and the City of Fresno as they studied the San Joaquin Riverbotto...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{critical}} habitat has {{been subject to}} {{a great deal of}} controversy and numerous lawsuits. Critical habitat {{is an integral part of}} the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that serves not only to protect the species and its habitat but may also help the recovery of the species. Critical habitat has been the subject of a large number of recent lawsuits. These lawsuits arise from conservation groups, forcing the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to designate {{critical habitat}} and from developmental groups, claiming that the economic analyses used by the FWS during the designation of critical habitat are faulty. The economic analyses that are currently being done by the FWS are quantifying the costs of critical habitat to the extent possible while virtually making no effort to quantify the benefits of critical habitat. This potentially biased economic analysis can skew public opinion by presenting an unbalanced result from the analysis. Therefore, this thesis presents a methodology for comprehensively identifying and quantifying, where possible, the costs and benefits of critical <b>habitat.</b> M.

40|$|The Gulf of St. Lawrence aster (SLA; Symphyotrichum laurentianum (Fernald) G. L. Nesom) is {{an annual}} plant species endemic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence region. Owing to the dynamic {{nature of the}} {{environment}} that the SLA inhabits, severe and major threats to both the aster and its <b>habitat</b> exist. The <b>Committee</b> on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada listed the species as threatened in Canada in 2004. This status was assigned based on the species' limited distribution, fluctuating population size, and continued pressures on its habitat. Surveys have revealed that both site and population numbers have been further and drastically reduced on Prince Edward Island. In 2007, only one populated site of 482 individuals remained. It is possible that this species has been extirpated from Prince Edward Island. Recovery of this species on Prince Edward Island is feasible. Promising results related to seeding and the transplantation of greenhouse-grown seedlings at four in situ sites demonstrated that SLA plantlets {{have the potential to}} serve as seed stock to re-establish populations. Over the 2 years of the transplantation experiment, the pooled overall survivorship was 52. 8 %. Specific site manipulations that were tested may also increase the potential survivorship of the transplants and facilitate second-generation germination...|$|R
