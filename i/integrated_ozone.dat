40|$|Methods for ranking {{photochemical}} ozone formation reactivities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are discussed. Photochemical mechanisms for the atmospheric reactions of 118 VOCs were used to calculate their effects on ozone formation under various NO x conditions in model scenarios representing 39 different urban areas. Their effects on ozone were used to derive 18 different ozone reactivity scales, {{one of which is}} the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) scale used in the new California Low Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuel Regulations. These scales are based on 3 different methods for quantifying ozone impacts and on 6 different approaches for dealing with the dependencies of reactivity on NO x. The predictions of the scales are compared, the reasons for their similarities and differences are discussed, and the sensitivities of the scales to NO x and other scenario conditions are examined. Scales based on peak ozone levels were highly dependent on NO x, but those based on <b>integrated</b> <b>ozone</b> were less sensitive to NO x and tended to be similar to the MIR scale. It is concluded that the MIR scale or one based on <b>integrated</b> <b>ozone</b> is appropriate for applications requiring use of a single reactivity scale. Implications Control strategies which encourage use of VOCs which form less ozone per gram emitted may provide a less costly way to achieve ozone reductions. An example of this is to encourage use of alternative fuels for motor vehicles. Practical implementation of such strategies requires some means to quantify ozone formation potentials of VOCs.

40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} from experiments that <b>integrate</b> <b>ozone</b> observations from two ENVISAT-borne instruments with the ozone data assimilation system developed at NASA's Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The data used are ozone total column provided by the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) and stratospheric profiles from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument. The DAO's existing system sequentially assimilates the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/ 2 total and partial ozone column data. Incorporation of SCIAMACHY and MIPAS data is done in two stages. First, the observations are monitored. The monitoring consists of computing the differences between Envisat observations and the ozone system forecast, i. e. observed-minus-forecast (O-F) residuals. The O-F residuals are then analyzed using simple statistical methods to examine the spatial distribution of differences, which are large for SCIAMACHY near the terminator. In the second stage, the MIPAS data will be actively assimilated along with the SBW/ 2 observations; any preliminary results of note will be discussed...|$|R

The TOMS series (1978 [...] present) and GOME (1995 [...] present) are two very important instruments in this context. In this paper, TOMS total ozone and three approaches to derive total ozone from GOME measurements are validated with ground-based Dobson network data. Beyond the operational products of both instruments, e. g. TOMS Version 7 and GOME Data Processor Version 2. 7, total ozone is calculated by <b>integrating</b> FURM <b>ozone</b> profiles and by applying the TOMS algorithm to the GOME spectra. All algorithms show in general good agreement with ground-based measurements. The operational GOME total ozone shows seasonal variations, most likely introduced by difficulties in the derivation of airmass factors, which convert measured slant columns into vertical columns. The TOMS algorithm estimates on average 2 % higher total ozone in the southern hemisphere than in the northern for both instruments as compared to the ground-based data, indicating that the source of the observed hemispheric differences is in the TOMS algorithm. Both instruments show aging effects in 2000, leading to enhanced variability in the ozone column differences with respect to Dobson data.

It is suggested that the background current correction is directly correlated to the mass transport parameter pressure dependence.

40|$|The role of bromine {{compounds}} in the photochemistry {{of the natural}} and perturbed stratosphere has been reexamined using an expanded reaction scheme {{and the results of}} recent laboratory studies of several key reactions. The most important finding is that through the reaction BrO + CIO → Br + Cl + O 2, there is a synergistic effect between bromine and chlorine which results in an efficient catalytic destruction of ozone in the lower stratosphere. One-dimensional photochemical model results indicate that BrO is the major bromine species throughout the stratosphere, followed by BrONO 2, HBr, HOBr and Br. We show from the foregoing that bromine is more efficient than chlorine as a catalyst for destroying ozone, and discuss the implications for stratospheric ozone of possible future growth in the industrial and agricultural use of bromine. Bromine concentrations of 20 pptv (2 × 10 ^− 11), as suggested by recent observations, can decrease the present-day <b>integrated</b> <b>ozone</b> column density by 2. 4 %, and can enhance ozone depletion from steady-state chlorofluoromethane release at 1973 rates by a factor of 1. 1 – 1. 2...|$|E

Combined SAGE I and II trends are slightly positive in this region and peak near 0. 5 %/year at equatorial latitudes. In the lower stratosphere, SBUV trends reflect small decreases in ozone, generally less than - 0. 4 %/year except at high southern latitudes where the trends rearch values of approximately - 1. 5 %/year. SAGE ozone trends exhibit large decreases particularly in the equatorial regions where decreases of 3 - 6 %/year are seen at pressures between 60 and 90 mbar. At higher latitudes, SAGE trends are more comparable to SBUV trends in the lower stratosphere. Total ozone trends from TOMS and SBUV agree within their uncertainties. Near-zero trends are indicated at low latitudes, and larger, negative trends (approximately - 0. 5 %/year) are indicated near the poles. The SAGE column ozone trends depend upon the base level altitude of integration but do not exhibit a strong latitude dependence...|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{variability}} in ozone column at a givenlocation is almost solely caused by dynamical changes connected totropospheric pressure systems. Long-term trends and interannual variabilityof ozone are {{also influenced by}} these dynamical changes. We address twoquestions here, which are still under discussion: What {{is the impact of}} thesedynamical changes on the observed long-term trend of ozone, and what is thequantitative contribution of the physical processes standing behind thedynamical variability to the trends and short-term variability? Theseprocesses are identified as horizontal isentropic transport and the verticaldisplacement of isentropes. We use a multiple regression model to analyze thevariability of the total ozone column and of profile data here. The model for ozone column is based on a newly introduced explanatoryvariable using the equivalent latitude profile at a givenlocation. After transforming the equivalent latitude profile into an ozoneprofile {{with the help of an}} <b>ozone</b> climatology, we <b>integrate</b> the <b>ozone</b> profileby using the pressures at the isentropic levels, thus incorporating the effectof compression and expansion. Ozone column data are taken from high qualitystations of the Dobson spectrometer network. Profile data from ozone sondes is examined by the equivalent latitude profilealone...|$|R
40|$|The 1988 spring Antarctic ozone {{depletion}} was observed by TOMS to be substantially smaller than in recent years. The minimum polar total ozone values declined only 15 percent during September 1988, compared to nearly 50 percent during September 1987. At southern midlatitudes, exceptionally high total ozone values were recorded beginning in July 1988. The total <b>integrated</b> southern hemispheric <b>ozone</b> increased rapidly during the Austral spring, approaching 1980 levels during October. The high midlatitude total ozone values {{were associated with}} {{a substantial increase in}} eddy activity as indicated by the standard deviation in total ozone in the zonal band 30 - 60 deg S. Mechanisms through which the increased midlatitude eddy activity could disrupt the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pronounced {{enhancements}} {{of total}} and tropospheric ozone were observed with the Brewer spectrophotometer and ozonesondes at Watukosek (7. 5 °S, 112. 6 °E), Indonesia in 1994 and in 1997 when extensive forest fires {{were reported in}} Indonesia. The <b>integrated</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> increased from 20 DU to 40 DU in October 1994 and to 55 DU in October 1997. On October 13, 1994, most ozone mixing ratios were more than 50 ppbv throughout the troposphere and exceeded 80 ppbv at some altitudes. On October 22, 1997, the concentrations were more than 50 ppbv throughout the troposphere and exceeded 100 ppbv at several altitudes. The coincidences of the ozone enhancements with the forest fires suggest the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone due to its precursors emitted from the fires for both cases. The years of 1994 and 1997 correspond to El Niño events when convective activity becomes low in Indonesia. Thus, in this region, {{it is likely that}} pronounced enhancements of tropospheric ozone associated with extensive forest fires due to sparse precipitation may take place with a period of a few years coinciding with El Niño events. This is in a marked contrast to the situation in South America and Africa where large-scale biomass burnings occur every year...|$|R
