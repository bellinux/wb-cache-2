According to the results, the correlation between the RMR and Q values is independent of the rock type; basically, the same equation can be used for all (differences between experimental error).

40|$|Background The most {{critical}} physical process {{to be represented}} in the fractured rock in the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> is the response to unloading and dewatering within the “damage zone ” affected by opening up the <b>repository</b> <b>chambers</b> and tunnels, and up to a few tens of metres beyond. Modelling thermal effects, especially thermally-induced stresses up to 100 metres around the <b>repository,</b> is also <b>of</b> critical importance as this will undoubtedly {{have an effect on}} fracture characteristics, new fracturing and the potential for radionuclides to be transported upwards and into the biosphere. The main outcomes of this project will be your PhD contribution to a set of new and/or improved methodologies, codes and protocols for analysing various processes that occur during the lifetime of a nuclear waste repository, or during the site characterisation phase. These methods and tools will be sufficiently flexible and generic to be used in any fractured geological formation that might be investigated as a potential location <b>of</b> a geological <b>repository</b> in the UK.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{a model for}} the {{transport}} of iodine through fractures in granitic rock has been developed by taking into account the variation <b>of</b> parameters with <b>depth</b> in order to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> on <b>repository</b> performance. First, the evolution of groundwater chemistry with depth has been modeled by considering the physical and chemical conditions that vary with depth. Second, iodine-water interactions and iodine-rock interactions under groundwater-chemistry evolution with depth in crystalline rocks have been modeled using PHREEQC, with which the distribution coefficients of iodine have been numerically evaluated as a function <b>of</b> <b>depth.</b> These values and other depth-dependent parameters such as fracture aperture, groundwater velocity, and diffusion coefficients have been used in the iodine transport simulation to observe differences in the iodine concentration in the water from repositories located at 500 and 1000 m depths. The results show that iodine stays within the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> if it is disposed of at a greater depth. The main reason is that the retention effect of matrix diffusion increases and relative contribution of advection along fractures decreases at depth due to the cubic law for the water flow velocity in fractures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a framework built {{to simulate the}} thermal and hydrological processes in a deep borehole <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> spent nuclear fuel. Such simulation requires a fully coupled solver, capable of capturing the processes at the scale of tens of kilometers and millions of years. The MOOSE framework was chosen for this purpose, where the FALCON application, developed at INL, was adopted as baseline. This application had previously been applied for simulation of fluid flow and heat transport in geothermal reservoirs, and therefore provided a valuable reference. Additional features were implemented in FALCON in order to simulate deep borehole repositories. Solver options were adjusted for best performance. Code verification was performed on Rayleigh-Bnard convection in a porous medium. Cross-code validation was performed between the FALCON code and the FEHM code on a single borehole test case, and the thermal results were further compared to analytical and simplified numerical models, confirming the potential existence of a second peak of temperature at the scale of thousands of years. Two configurations for the borehole repository were analyzed. The first one consisted of an infinite array of boreholes, which allows one to significantly simplify the geometry, boundary conditions, and test code features. A parametric study of input parameters such as rock permeability, borehole spacing, and pitch length, was performed to assess thermal behavior <b>of</b> the <b>repository.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the results led {{to the conclusion that}} the water flow in the caprock is driven mostly by thermal expansion of water. The displacement length of the water front was found to be negligible in comparison to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository.</b> The second configuration included a semi-infinite array of boreholes. This representation is a more realistic approximation <b>of</b> an actual <b>repository,</b> since it includes the modeling of the undisturbed rock surrounding the emplacement zone. It was shown that in this configuration convection can originate between the emplacement region and the rock outside the repository. At rock permeability higher than 10 - 16 m 2 this mechanism can lead to an escape length of the water front larger than the burial depth. However, it was shown that the salinity gradient in the underground water can suppress convection and effectively eliminate water escape. by Nazar Lubchenko. Thesis: S.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{was carried out}} in the Nuclear Chemistry Unit of the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) at the European Commission, Joint Research Centre in Karlsruhe, Federal Republic of Germany, from 1 st of July 2004 until 15 th of April 2008 with a grant from the European Commission. The possible release of toxic and radioactive species from spent nuclear fuel in contact with water in a deep geological repository is expected to depend mainly on the rate of dissolution of the UO 2 matrix. At the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository</b> very low oxygen concentrations are expected. Moreover, large amounts of hydrogen are expected to be generated from the corrosion of iron containing canisters and containers. In this reducing groundwater environment UO 2 has very low solubility. However, radiolysis of the ground water will produce reactive radicals and molecular products and can thereby alter the redox conditions. In this work different electrochemical techniques were used to study the corrosion behaviour of UO 2 based materials in aqueous solutions in anoxic and reducing conditions. The possible influence of hydrogen on the corrosion mechanism of UO 2 was investigated. In order to study the importance of the alpha activity level on the corrosion of the matrix, UO 2 electrode samples doped with different concentrations of short-lived alpha emitters were used. In the frame of ACTINET Network of Excellence the collaboration between Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) in Karlsruhe, Germany and The Centre for Studies and Research by Irradiation (CERI) in Orléans, France made possible the use of a cyclotron generated He 2 + beam to simulate high levels of alpha activities. Impedance Spectroscopy, together with potentiostatic polarization and cyclic voltammetry measurements were used on a variety of materials, ranging from depleted UO 2 to 10...|$|R
40|$|Underground {{burial of}} {{radioactive}} wastes in hard rock {{may be an}} effective and safe means of isolating them from the environment and from man. The mechanical safety and stability of such an underground repository depends largely on the virgin state of stress in the rock, groundwater pressures, {{the strengths of the}} rocks, heating by the decay of the radioactive wastes, and the layout of the excavations and the disposition of waste cannisters within them. A large body of pertinent data exists in the literature, and each of these factors has been analysed in the light of this information. The results indicate that there are no fundamental geological nor mechanical reasons why <b>repositories</b> capable <b>of</b> storing radioactive wastes should not be excavated at suitable sites in hard rock. However, specific tests to determine the mechanical and thermal properties of the rocks at a site would be needed to provide the data for the engineering design <b>of</b> a <b>repository.</b> Also, little experience exists of the effects on underground excavations of thermal loads, so that this aspect requires theoretical study and experimental validation. The <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> these potential <b>repositories</b> would lie in the range from 0. 5 km to 2. 0 km below surface, depending upon the strength of the rock. Virgin states of stress have been measured at such depths which would retard the ingress of groundwater and obviate the incidence of faulting.

40|$|Samples of Topopah Spring tuff {{selected}} from vertical drill holes USW G- 1, GU- 3, and G- 4, {{and from the}} horizontal air-drilled hole at Fran Ridge were reacted with J- 13 water at 150 {sup 0 }C. The primary purpose of these experiments was to compare the resulting solution chemistries to estimate the degree of homogeneity that might be expected in thermally affected ground water in a potential nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The second purpose was to relate data obtained from welded devitrified Topopah Spring tuff collected from the potential repository depth to that previously obtained using outcrop samples. The results show very similar aqueous phase chemistries for all samples after reaction for times up to 70 days. The largest difference in final solution concentrations was for silica {{in one of the}} samples from Fran Ridge. All vertical drill core samples gave results for silica that were in agreement to within +- 6 ppM and indicated solubility controlled by cristobalite. The results for reaction at 150 {sup 0 }C are in agreement with those obtained in previous experiments using surface outcrop samples from Fran Ridge. The major difference between the drill core results and the outcrop samples is found in the data for room-temperature rinse solutions. The outcrop samples show relatively large amounts of soluble salts that can be easily removed at room temperature. The data for room-temperature rinsing of drill core samples show no significant quantities of readily soluble salts. This result is particularly significant for the samples from the air-drilled hole at Fran Ridge, since drilling fluid that might have removed soluble salts was not used in the portion of the hole from which the samples were obtained. This result strongly suggests that the presence of soluble salts is a surface evaporation phenomenon, and that such materials are unlikely to be present at the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repository...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dike and sill {{complexes}} that intruded tuffaceous host rocks {{above the}} water table are suggested as natural analogues for thermal-hydrologic-chemical (THC) processes at the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Scoping thermal-hydrologic calculations of temperature and saturation profiles surrounding a 30 - 50 m wide intrusion suggest that boiling conditions could be sustained at distances of tens of meters from the intrusion for several thousand years. This time scale for persistence of boiling {{is similar to that}} expected for the Yucca Mountain repository with moderate heat loading. By studying the hydrothermal alteration of the tuff host rocks surrounding the intrusions, insight and relevant data can be obtained that apply directly to the Yucca Mountain repository and can shed light on the extent and type of alteration that should be expected. Such data are needed to bound and constrain model parameters used in THC simulations of the effect of heat produced by the waste on the host rock and to provide a firm foundation for assessing overall repository performance. One example of a possible natural analogue for the repository is the Paiute Ridge intrusive complex located on the northeastern boundary of the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. The complex consists of dikes and sills intruded into a partially saturated tuffaceous host rock that has stratigraphic sequences that correlate with those found at Yucca Mountain. The intrusions were emplaced at a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> several hundred meters below the surface, similar to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the proposed <b>repository.</b> The tuffaceous host rock surrounding the intrusions is hydrothermally altered to varying extents depending on the distance from the intrusions. The Paiute Ridge intrusive complex thus appears to be an ideal natural analogue of THC coupled processes associated with the Yucca Mountain repository. It could provide much needed physical and chemical data for understanding the influence of heat released from the repository on the tuff host rock and for THC modeling studies <b>of</b> the <b>repository.</b> Many other such intrusive complexes exist at the Nevada Test Site and {{in other parts of the}} world that could provide an extensive data set for understanding and predicting the behavior of the Yucca Mountain repository, for which the Paiute Ridge complex is just one example...|$|R
