The steady state measurement mathematic model of the apparatus is built up in theory and the system amplification coefficient is defined as the ratio of the <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> to the temperature difference of the device, with which the value of the measured source power can be calculated easily with the corresponding temperature difference. In order to obtain an optimal <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> measuring system, the coefficients that can influence the relationship between the amplification coefficient, the temperature difference, and the <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> are analyzed. On the basis of these analyses, a set of experimental device is constructed and a number of experiments are carried on. Compared with the input <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> sample data, the error of the experimental measuring results is less than ± 2 %, and the experimental measuring values are in good agreement with the calculated theoretical ones.

40|$|AbstractExperimental tests {{investigating}} the gigacycle fatigue {{properties of materials}} are commonly performed with ultrasonic testing procedures, which allow for a significant reduction of testing time but induce a significant temperature increment in specimens. In order to evaluate the significance of size effects on the fatigue strength of materials, the Authors recently proposed to adopt Gaussian specimens for gigacycle tests. Fatigue specimens were designed without {{taking into account the}} hysteretic damping and its effects both on the stress distribution and on the <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> dissipation. However, in order to evaluate the temperature increment and the feasibility of ultrasonic fatigue tests with Gaussian specimens, the total dissipated <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> as well as the distribution of the dissipated <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> density along the specimen must be taken into account. The present paper proposes an analytical model validated through a finite element analysis, which permits to evaluate the effects of the hysteretic damping on the stress distribution, on the dissipated <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> density distribution and on the total dissipated <b>heat</b> <b>power</b> in Gaussian specimens...|$|R
25|$|In February 1996, the {{electricity}} and heating {{were transferred to}} a European Gas Turbines (EGT) 4.9MWe Typhoon gas turbine combined <b>heating,</b> <b>power</b> and cooling unit. It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m HVAC system reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, without a second chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine's chimneys caught fire, bringing TV output to a halt. After the fire the turbines were no longer used regularly.|$|E
25|$|Quick-start {{ballasts}} {{use a small}} auto-transformer to {{heat the}} filaments when power is first applied. When an arc strikes, the filament <b>heating</b> <b>power</b> is reduced and the tube will start within half a second. The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector {{in order for them}} to strike. Quick-start ballasts are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch, a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start ballasts are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start ballasts are used only on 240nbsp&V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.|$|E

6000|$|... [75] In his {{recently}} published Lectures on Physical Geography, Professor Haughton calculates, {{that more than}} half the solar heat of the torrid zone is carried to the temperate zones by ocean currents. The Gulf Stream itself carries one-twelfth of the total amount, but it is probable that a very small fraction of this quantity of heat reaches the polar seas owing to the wide area over which the current spreads in the North Atlantic. The corresponding stream of the Indian Ocean in Miocene times would have been fully equal to the Gulf Stream in <b>heating</b> <b>power,</b> while, owing to its being so much more concentrated, a large proportion of its heat may have reached the polar area. But the Arctic Ocean occupies less than one-tenth of the area of the tropical seas; so that, whatever proportion of the heat of the tropical zone was conveyed to it, would, by being concentrated into one-tenth of the surface, produce an enormously increased effect. Taking this into consideration, we can hardly doubt that the opening of a sufficient passage from the Indian Ocean to the Arctic seas would produce the effects above indicated.|$|E

6000|$|Substitutes for Pots and Kettles.--It is {{possible}} to boil water over a slow fire in many kinds of vessels that would be destroyed by {{a greater degree of}} heat. In bark, wooden, skin, and even paper vessels, it is quite possible to boil water. The ruder tribes of the Indian Archipelago use a bamboo to boil their rice: [...] "The green cane resisting the fire sufficiently long for the cooking of one mass of rice." [...] (Crawfurd.) If, however, you have no vessel that you choose to expose to the risk of burning, you must heat stones and drop them into the water it contains; but sandstones, especially are apt to shiver and make grit. The Dacota Indians, and very probably other tribes also, used to boil animals in their own hide. The description runs thus: [...] "They stuck four stakes in the ground, and tied the four corners of the hide up to them, leaving a hollow in the middle; three or four gallons of water, and the meat cut up very fine, were then put in; three or four hot stones, each the size of a 6-lb. cannon-shot, cooked the whole into a good soup." [...] To a fastidious palate, the soot, dirt, and ashes that are usually mixed up with the soup, are objectionable; but these may be avoided by a careful cook, who dusts and wipes the stones before dropping them in. The specific heat of stone is much less than that of water, so that the <b>heating</b> <b>power</b> of a measure of stone is only about one-half of that of an equal measure of equally hot water.|$|E
