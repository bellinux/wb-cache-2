But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E

5|$|Again {{disappointed}} with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed {{for nearly three}} years. In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland {{as part of a}} vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> visited China.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E

After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage {{and the fact that}} they were both in the wrong.

He accepts this, stating that he will find out anyway, and forces her to hide that he is her husband. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father.

25|$|Biglow and Main were {{concerned}} that the book would diminish sales of Crosby's Bells at Evening and Other Verses, which they had published in 1897 and which contained Lowry's biographical sketch of Crosby. They convinced Crosby to write to both Carleton and Knapp, and to threaten to sue Carleton in April 1904. The threatened lawsuit was to obtain information regarding sales of the book, for which she had been promised a royalty of 10 cents per copy, and to seek an injunction preventing further publication. The proposed injunction was {{on the grounds that}} she had been misrepresented by Carleton; she believed that he had described her as living alone in poor health and extreme poverty, when in fact she was receiving $25 a week from Biglow and Main and was living with relatives who cared for her. Crosby indicated she had no desire to be a homeowner, and that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> lived in poverty, it was by her own choice.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{account of}} Revithi's life {{following}} the marathon.

It is not known whether she met Philimon or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> found a job. As Tarasouleas stated, [...] "Stamata Revithi {{was lost in the}} dust of history". Violet Piercy, of the United Kingdom, was the first woman to complete an officially timed marathon race: she clocked a time of 3hours and 40minutes in a British race on 3October 1926.

500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
