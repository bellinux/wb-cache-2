5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E

Caroline is {{spending too much time}} with Mac, in Sue's opinion, and tries to stop her from seeing him. During his coma, Sue steals some of Mac's semen to make herself pregnant. Mac then comes out of his coma, but is suffering <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> loss and cannot remember his new-found love for Caroline. Angela soon leaves the hospital in order to take a career in television. With Angela gone, Guy becomes Caroline's new lodger.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} {{performed}} in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, St. Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his ballet master Antoine Titus to Paris {{to find a}} new ballet for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose Giselle. The Ballet Master then staged the work completely <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E

5|$|He {{was said}} to have been crowned by St Humbert (Bishop Humbert of Elmham) on 25 December 855, at a {{location}} known as Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk) which at that time functioned as the royal capital. Later versions of his life recorded that he was a model king who treated all his subjects with equal justice and who was unbending to flatterers. It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter, so that he could recite it <b>from</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like Bülow, Bache {{performed}} works <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> {{instead of}} from the printed page, {{at a time}} when doing so was a matter of open debate.

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The pitches of the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is today, {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written <b>from</b> <b>memory.</b> As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E
50|$|When a WME is {{retracted}} <b>from</b> working <b>memory,</b> it must {{be removed}} <b>from</b> every alpha <b>memory</b> {{in which it is}} stored.

5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was the 18th overall LP Charles had recorded. According to him, {{the title}} of the album was {{conceived}} by producer Sid Feller and ABC-Paramount's executives and management people. The recording sessions for the album took place at three sessions in mid-February 1962. The first two sessions were set on February 5 and 7 at Capitol Studios in New York, New York, at which one half of the album was recorded and produced. The other half was recorded on February 15 of that same year at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Instead of drawing what he should record <b>from</b> <b>memory</b> and his knowledge of country music, Charles asked Feller, his newly appointed A (Artists and Repertoire) man, to research top country standards through major country music publishers.|$|E
