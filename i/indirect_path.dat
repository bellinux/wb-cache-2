40|$|Abstract—Analysis of the {{persistency}} and birth/death of mul-tipath {{components of}} the channel impulse response is essential for performance evaluation of indoor geolocation algorithms using <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> for ranging. The use of <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> via multipath diversity is particularly important for situations where the direct path gets blocked. In this letter, we propose a statistical model for the spatial behavior of the persistency of multipath components as a mobile moves inside a building. Based on empirical data from a measurement calibrated ray tracing algorithm we show that the persistency in a typical building is modeled by log-logistic distribution rather than commonly assumed exponential distribution and path birth can be modeled as a Poisson distribution. Index Terms—Path persistency, path lifetime, spatial path behavior, TOA-based indoor geolocation. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} QoSMap, a novel {{approach for}} mapping overlay networks with stringent QoS requirements. QoSMap computes high quality overlay paths by utilizing direct underlay paths that fulfill the application’s topology and link-specific QoS requirements. It also improves application dependability by increasing resiliency against QoS failures under dynamic network conditions. The increased resiliency is achieved {{through the use of}} supplemental <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> which have a single intermediate node and which also meet application QoS requirements. For evaluation, we compared QoSMap with a simple QoS approach for overlay mapping. We compared the two approaches for fulfilling varying application requests with strict QoS requirements of latency and packet loss on PlanetLab. We observed that QoSMap yielded high quality overlays. Further, the use of <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> upon the QoS failure of the direct path avoided overlay reconfiguration and resulted in increased dependability and longer lifetime for the application overlays. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of fitness landscapes {{is critical for}} understanding adaptive protein evolution. Previous empirical studies on fitness landscapes were confined to either the neighborhood around the wild type sequence, involving mostly single and double mutants, or a combinatorially complete subgraph involving only two amino acids at each site. In reality, the dimensionality of protein sequence space is higher (20 (L)) {{and there may be}} higher-order interactions among more than two sites. Here we experimentally characterized the fitness landscape of four sites in protein GB 1, containing 20 (4) = 160, 000 variants. We found that while reciprocal sign epistasis blocked many direct paths of adaptation, such evolutionary traps could be circumvented by <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> through genotype space involving gain and subsequent loss of mutations. These <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> alleviate the constraint on adaptive protein evolution, suggesting that the heretofore neglected dimensions of sequence space may change our views on how proteins evolve...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated a {{model of}} connecting greater mindfulness to more occurrences of flow and less sport-specific anxiety and pessimistic sport attributions in competitive cyclists. The research examined direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> from mindfulness to the subjective state of being in flow. <b>Indirect</b> <b>paths</b> examined were through pessimistic sports attributions, sport-specific anxiety and flow conditions. Key findings were that higher levels of mindfulness were associated with more experience of flow, fewer sports-related pessimistic cognitions, and less sport-specific anxiety. Lower levels of sport-specific pessimistic attributions and sport-specific anxiety were associated with a higher frequency of experienced flow conditions. A higher frequency of flow conditions was associated with more occurrence of the subjective state of being in flow. The results support a model connecting mindfulness to flow experience through the meeting of flow conditions and through less experience of pessimism and anxiety. The results have implications for possible interventions focused upon increasing mindfulness to enhance the occurrence of flow...|$|R

40|$|Food webs and {{matrices}} {{are vital}} to understanding feeding relationships and ecology. Adjacency matrices can be employed to present the direct relationships between predators and prey; these binary matrices utilize 0 ’s to denote no direct link and 1 ’s to denote a direct link. We analyzed a variety of published food webs ranging from pine forests in the United States to tussock grasslands in New Zealand. The food webs varied in number of distinguishable taxa present, functional diversity, climates and habitats. Consequently, we expect that our results are not specific to a given system. The published food webs lack flows from organisms to detritus {{despite the fact that}} organisms in these webs consume detritus. This discrepancy leads us to question how the inclusion of flows to detritus influences indirect connectance within large food webs. By including the flows to detritus, the number of <b>indirect</b> <b>paths</b> of length n as well as indirect relationships throughout the systems increased.

Besides, examining indirect effects can lead to a less biased estimation of effects sizes in empirical research (Holbert & Stephenson 2003).
