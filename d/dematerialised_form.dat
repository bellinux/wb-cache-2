40|$|Drawing on {{the work}} of Paul Virilio, this paper {{addresses}} changes in the architectural and legal topography of the urban landscape through an examination of regulatory patterns, which increasingly intensify governance through, and as, ‘control’. Such regulation is ambivalent in that it cuts across many traditionally discrete regimes of power melding them into new forms with new effects; as a consequence it is no longer sufficient {{to think in terms of}} such distinctions as private/public, civil/criminal, and so on. This paper argues that a concern with patterns of enclosure and privatisation in our urban centres must now be placed within the context of changes in architectural practice and technology, which the authors term ‘open architecture’, and the embedding of governance through partnership, which give particular emphasis to the use of dematerialised and diffused modes of control. The paper utilises Virilio’s history and image of the fortress, which he tracks from a material form to a <b>dematerialised</b> <b>form,</b> to envisage these developments and to provide the foundation for an understanding of the importance of the development of practices of surveillance into, what the authors term, ‘total registration’ as a feature and function of governance through ‘control’...|$|E

Out of this total money supply in the economic system, 99. 7 % of the money will be in <b>dematerialised</b> (non physical) <b>form</b> in the accounts of citizens, Governments and companies. Only small portion of money, equalling just 0. 3 % of the total money in the economic system, will be in physical form i. e. currency notes or coins.
