Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place.

50|$|Government Accountability Office {{investigations}} of the Department of Defense (DoD) are typically audits in which the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the United States Congress’ investigative arm, studies how the Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>spends</b> taxpayer dollars.

However, the GAO is still subject to influence from powerful members of Congress. As of March 2016, the DoD was the only government agency to have failed every audit since all government agencies were required to pass such audits by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990.|$|R

While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E

Moore and Vice Presidential candidate Stewart Alexander supported a 50% reduction of the United States Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>spending,</b> and using the other 50% to improve veteran benefits. Alexander proposed that retired veterans with 10–30 years of military service should receive an income of $15–30 thousand annually from the state.|$|E

Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion in <b>defense</b> <b>spending</b> during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland Republican to win election to a third Senate term, and also the only Republican to win the city of Baltimore up to that point.

This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent.

40|$|Over {{the years}} plenty of {{attention}} has been paid to how much the Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>spends</b> annually in the form of reports and studies. However, very little {{attention has been}} given to the area of reprogramming. This paper seeks to answer one main question: what is the nature of Defense Department reprogramming? In answering this question, a specific methodology for describing reprogramming information was developed. The benefits of this study are to highlight the use of reprogramming and provide a baseline of knowledge about an area of research where previously there was none. This study found that the amount of reprogramming increased over 60 percent over the eight year period studied. While the total amount reprogrammed increased, reprogramming as a percentage of total budget authority remained relatively constant. The majority of the increase came from an increase in prior approval reprogramming actions. In general, there was very little congressional resistance to the reprogramming requests and there were definite patterns as to when reprogramming was done throughout the year. Finally, this paper provides specific recommendations for areas of future research. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
