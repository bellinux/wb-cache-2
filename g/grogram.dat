2500|$|While the ration was {{originally}} given neat, or mixed with lime juice, {{the practice of}} watering down the rum began around 1740. To help minimize {{the effect of the}} alcohol on his sailors, Admiral Edward Vernon had the rum ration watered producing a mixture that became known as grog. While many believe the term was coined in honor of the <b>grogram</b> cloak Admiral Vernon wore in rough weather, the term predates his famous order. It probably originates in the West Indies, perhaps of African etymology. The Royal Navy continued to give its sailors a daily rum ration, known as a [...] "tot," [...] until the practice was abolished after 31 July 1970.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can prove}} by <b>Grogram</b> {{that she was}} told that another wife was living," [...] said Sir William. <b>Grogram</b> was an old butler {{who had been in}} the old Earl's service for thirty years.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{week after}} that that Mrs. Stantiloup wrote the {{following}} letter to her friend Lady <b>Grogram,</b> after she had returned home from Buttercup Hall. Lady <b>Grogram</b> was a great friend of hers, and was first cousin to that Mrs. Talbot who had a son at the school. Lady <b>Grogram</b> was an old woman of strong mind but small means, {{who was supposed to}} be potential over those connected with her. Mrs. Stantiloup feared that she could not be efficacious herself, either with Mr. or Mrs. Talbot; but she hoped that she might carry her purpose through Lady <b>Grogram.</b> It may be remembered that she had declared at Buttercup Hall that young Talbot was not to go back to Bowick. But this had been a figure of speech, as has been already explained:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a {{doubt about}} it, I'm told. The queer {{thing is that}} he should have {{declared}} his purpose beforehand to Erle. Gresham says that all that must have been part of his plan,--so as to make men think afterwards that he couldn't have done it. <b>Grogram's</b> idea is that he had planned the murder before he went to the club." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind her, Mr Cradell," [...] said Mrs Lupex; [...] "she's {{not worthy}} {{for you to}} speak to. And as to that poor fellow Eames, if you've any {{friendship}} for him, you'll let him know what she is. My dear, how's Mr Juniper, of <b>Grogram's</b> house, at Salford? I know all about you, and so shall John Eames, too--poor unfortunate fool of a fellow! Telling me of drink and jealousy, indeed!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was always}} fond of billiards: and, in former days, at <b>Grogram's</b> in Greek Street, {{where a few}} jolly lads of my {{acquaintance}} used to meet twice {{a week for a}} game, and a snug pipe and beer, I was generally voted the first man of the club; and could take five from John the marker himself. I had a genius, in fact, for the game; and now that I was placed in that station of life where I could cultivate my talents, I gave them full play, and improved amazingly. I do say that I think myself as good a hand as any chap in England.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, my lord, quite right," [...] said Lord Cashel, [...] "my men of business, Green and <b>Grogram,</b> {{will manage}} all that. They {{know all about}} Fanny's property; they can draw out the settlements, and <b>Grogram</b> can bring them here, and we can execute them: that'll be the {{simplest}} way." ...|$|E
60|$|But of {{a sudden}} my {{attention}} was arrested. Miss Macmanus had said something of the black silks of Antwerp, when Miss <b>Grogram</b> replied that she {{had just returned from}} that city and had there enjoyed a great success. My cousin had again asked something about the black silks, thinking, no doubt, that Miss <b>Grogram</b> had achieved some bargain, but that lady had soon undeceived her.|$|E
6000|$|... "There were a {{great many}} there; among others Sir Gregory <b>Grogram,</b> who apologised to me for having tried to--put an end to my career." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said Miss <b>Grogram,</b> [...] "it {{was at the}} castle. We {{got such}} {{beautiful}} relics of General Chasse! Didn't we, Mrs. Jones?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then Miss <b>Grogram</b> {{just cut}} {{them up with}} her scissors," [...] {{continued}} Aunt Sally, not a whit abashed, [...] "and gave us each a bit, only she took more than half for herself." [...] It {{was clear to me}} that there had been some quarrel, some delicious quarrel, between Aunt Sally and Miss <b>Grogram.</b> Through the whole adventure I had rather respected Aunt Sally. [...] "She took more than half for herself," [...] continued Aunt Sally. [...] "She kept all the--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} wi' ye?" [...] said Bess the matron, {{taking up the}} bundle and {{examining}} it. [...] "Ye'n sweltered yoursen, I reckon, running that fool's race. An' here, they'n gi'en you lots o' good <b>grogram</b> and flannel, as should ha' been gi'en by good rights to them as had the sense to keep away from such foolery. Ye might spare me a bit o' this <b>grogram</b> to make clothes for the lad--ye war ne'er ill-natured, Bess; I ne'er said that on ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{know very}} well they were his!" [...] said Miss <b>Grogram,</b> who was not an {{impartial}} hearer. [...] "Of course they were; whose else's should they be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it true that}} <b>Grogram</b> is to be Chancellor?" [...] Phineas {{asked the}} question, not from any {{particular}} solicitude as to the prospects of Sir Gregory <b>Grogram,</b> but because he was anxious to hear whether Mr. Ratler would speak to him with anything of the cordiality of fellowship respecting the new Government. But Mr. Ratler became at once discreet and close, {{and said that he}} did not think that anything as yet was known as to the Woolsack. Then Phineas retreated again within his shell, with a certainty that nothing would be done for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{write to}} Mr Cummings, then, {{and tell him}} to wait on Messrs. Green and <b>Grogram.</b> Cummings is a very proper man: he was {{recommended}} to me by Guinness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But that's {{nothing to}} what I've got," [...] said Miss <b>Grogram.</b> [...] "In the first place, there's {{a pair of}} slippers,--a {{beautiful}} pair;--they're not made up yet, of course; and then--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, couldn't I!" [...] said Piles. But Mr. Piles did not {{continue}} the conversation, contenting himself with telling his friend <b>Grogram</b> that that red devil Chiltern was as drunk as a lord.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{have got}} a situation. You {{did not know that}} I was a {{shorthand}} clerk and typewriter, did you? I am. I have just left the school, the <b>Grogram</b> School. And now there is an old gentleman who wants an amanuensis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{the prize}} for the first sack-race," [...] said Miss Lydia, taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to Mrs. Irwine before Bessy came up, [...] "an {{excellent}} <b>grogram</b> gown {{and a piece of}} flannel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There they were, and {{she took}} 'em," [...] said the broad-back. Oh, what a look Miss <b>Grogram</b> gave her! [...] "Took them! of course I took them. That is, you took {{them as much as}} I did. They were things that we found lying about." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Edmonstone {{did not say}} no; and Charlotte, {{opening the}} dressing-room door, called to him. He stood {{opposite}} to Amy for some moments, then said, with a smile, 'I was wrong about the <b>grogram.</b> I would not for anything see you look otherwise than you do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are they, Miss Grogram?" [...] {{said the}} elder Miss Macmanus, holding the {{needle-case}} {{in one hand}} and Mrs. Jones's bag in the other. Miss Macmanus was a strong-minded female, and I reverenced my cousin when I saw the decided way in which she intended to put down the greedy arrogance of Miss <b>Grogram.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mamma, {{with the}} hot face and untidy hair, came next. [...] "Well, girls," [...] she said, [...] "as you are all served, I don't see why I'm to be left out. Perhaps, Miss Grogram"--she was an old maid, you see-- [...] "perhaps, Miss <b>Grogram,</b> you could get {{me as much as}} would make a decent-sized reticule." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ay, sir, the clouted shoe hath oft times craft in't, [...] As {{says the}} rustic proverb; and your citizen, [...] In's <b>grogram</b> suit, gold chain, and well-black'd shoes, [...] Bears under his flat cap ofttimes a brain [...] Wiser than burns beneath {{the cap and}} feather, [...] Or seethes within the statesman's velvet nightcap. [...] Read me my Riddle.|$|E
60|$|Sir Marmaduke {{had been}} very kind, {{had given him a}} new suit of <b>grogram,</b> lined with flowered silk, which Lambert thought the richest garment he had ever seen. He was very loyal in his {{thoughts}} to his employer, bearing with the latter's violence and pandering to his fits of ill-humor {{for the sake of the}} home which Sir Marmaduke had provided for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That it's {{capable of}} improvement. I {{do not know}} that we can think {{anything}} else. As for Sir Gregory <b>Grogram</b> and Baron Boultby and the jury, it would be waste of power to execrate them. In political matters it is very hard for a man in office to be purer than his neighbours,--and, when he is so, he becomes troublesome. I have found that out before to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing further, however, {{was said}} between {{them on the}} subject; and the settlements, {{whatever}} was their purport, were drawn out without any visible interference {{on the part of}} Lord Ballindine. But Mr <b>Grogram,</b> the attorney, on his first visit to Grey Abbey on the subject, had no difficulty in learning that Miss Wyndham was determined to have a will of her own in the disposition of her own money.|$|E
60|$|Miss <b>Grogram</b> {{seemed to}} be for a moment silenced. I had been ignored, as I have said, and my {{existence}} forgotten; but now I observed that {{the eyes of the}} culprits were turned towards me,--the eyes, that is, of four of them. Mrs. Jones looked at me from beneath her fan; the two girls glanced at me furtively, and then their eyes fell to the lowest flounces of their frocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} young Talbot is to leave," [...] said Mrs. Stantiloup. [...] "I wrote to Mrs. Talbot {{immediately}} {{when all this}} occurred, and I've heard from her cousin Lady <b>Grogram</b> that the boy is not to go back after the holidays." [...] This happened to be altogether untrue. What she probably meant was, that the boy should not go back if she could prevent his doing so.|$|E
60|$|Thus having furbished up a parson, Dame Baucis next {{they played}} their farce on. Instead of home-spun coifs were seen Good pinners edg'd with colberteen; Her {{petticoat}} transformed apace, Became black satin flounced with lace. Plain Goody {{would no longer}} down, 'Twas Madam, in her <b>grogram</b> gown. Philemon was in great surprise, And hardly could believe his eyes, Amazed to see her look so prim; And she admired as much at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, {{members would}} prefer that their seats should not cost them so much," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Ratler. [...] "But the thing can't be done all at once. That idea of pouncing upon one man and making a victim of him is very disagreeable to me. I should have been sorry to have seen a verdict against Browborough. You must acknowledge {{that there was no}} bitterness {{in the way in which}} <b>Grogram</b> did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to the Reverend Mr. Emilius;--poor dear Lady Eustace's Mr. Emilius? I {{do think}} {{that you ought to}} desire that an end should be put to his enterprising career! I'm sure I do." [...] This was said while the attempt was still being made to trace the {{purchase}} of the bludgeon in Paris. [...] "We've got Sir Gregory <b>Grogram</b> here on purpose to meet you, and you must fraternise with him immediately, to show that you bear no grudge." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{introduced}} to them all, one after the other; but their names did not abide in my memory one moment. I was thinking {{too much of the}} singularity of the adventure, and could not attend to such minutiae. That the red-rosed harpy was Miss <b>Grogram,</b> that I remembered;--that, I may say, I shall never forget. But whether the motherly lady with the somewhat blowsy hair was Mrs. Jones, or Mrs. Green, or Mrs. Walker, I cannot now say. The dumpy female with the broad back was always called Aunt Sally by the young ladies.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the foot was comin' through the passage for the door; he could hear a hand skirt alang the wa', as if the fearsome thing was feelin' for its way. The saughs tossed an' maned thegether, a lang sigh cam' ower the hills, the flame o' the can'le was blawn aboot; an' there stood the corp of Thrawn Janet, wi' her <b>grogram</b> goun an' her black mutch, wi' the heid aye upon the shouther, an' the girn still upon the face o't--leevin', ye wad hae said--deid, as Mr. Soulis weel kenned--upon the {{threshold}} o' the manse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grim enough; but the grimness and {{the jokes}} are always running {{through my mind}} together. I used to spend hours in {{thinking}} what my dear friends would say about it when they found that I had been hung in mistake;--how Sir Gregory <b>Grogram</b> would like it, and whether men would think about it as they went home from The Universe at night. I had various questions to ask and answer for myself,--whether they would pull up my poor body, for instance, from what unhallowed ground is used for gallows corpses, and give it decent burial, placing 'M.P. for Tankerville' after my name on some more or less explicit tablet." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Gregory <b>Grogram</b> replied. It {{seemed to}} him that the {{evidence}} was as he had left it. It would be for the jury to decide, under such directions as his lordship might be pleased to give them, how far that evidence brought the guilt home to the prisoner. He would use no rhetoric in pushing the case against the prisoner; but he must submit to them that his learned friend had not shown that acquaintance with human nature which the gentleman undoubtedly possessed in arguing that there had lacked time for the conception and execution of the crime. Then, at considerable length, he strove to show that Mr. Chaffanbrass had been unjustly severe upon Lord Fawn.|$|E
