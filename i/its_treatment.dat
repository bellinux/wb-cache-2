40|$|The State {{control over}} private forests in {{different}} countries varies greatly in method and degree. In present days {{there is a general}} tendency towards stricter state control over private forests. Forestry possesses two characteristics, that is the social welfare and long-rotation, therefore the state control is necessary. Reasons of having the state control are well explained by the following words 2 ̆ 2 property has its duty as well as its right, public-interests goes before individual-interest or the social welfare is promoted etc 2 ̆ 2. Private ownership of estate and <b>its</b> <b>treatments</b> may be grouped under three types : (1) entire freedom of ownership and entire freedom of <b>its</b> <b>treatments.</b> (2) complete release from all private ownership, at least productive goods and organisations. (3) maintenance of private ownership, with state control and guidance on <b>its</b> <b>treatments.</b> In our country private forests are almost all mismanaged, so the new forest law (Jun. 1951) requires the suitable cutting, which is based on the principle of sustained yield management.

MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid.

Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes.

40|$|Open Access JournalThis journal issue contain Proceedings of the Joint Annual Scientific Meeting 2011 BACKGROUND: Notwithstanding cancer {{survival}} rates {{are higher than}} before {{as a result of}} advances in cancer screening and breakthroughs in cancer treatment, childhood cancer survivors are at risk of adverse physical and psychosocial effects of the cancer treatment, severely affecting their quality of life. Whilst much of the attention has focused on the physiological care of childhood cancer survivors, the consequences of cancer and <b>its</b> <b>treatments</b> on psychosocial well-being remain relatively underexplored. AIMS: The aim {{of the study was to}} shed light on the impact of cancer and <b>its</b> <b>treatments</b> on the psychosocial well-being and quality of life of Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed. A total of 137 childhood cancer survivors (9 - 16 -year olds) who had their medical follow-up at the out-patient clinic were invited to participate in the study. Participants were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children, short form of the State Anxiety Scale for Children, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, Coping Behaviour Checklist for Chinese Children and Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory. RESULTS: This study showed that a significant number of childhood cancer survivors in Hong Kong were potentially at risk of depression, or at least presented some depressive symptoms. The study also indicated that greater symptomatology of depression in childhood cancer survivors was associated with higher state anxiety, lower self-esteem, and poor quality of life. CONCLUSION: This study has addressed a gap in the literature by examining the impact of cancer and <b>its</b> <b>treatments</b> on the psychosocial well-being of Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivors. The study reveals that cancer and <b>its</b> <b>treatments</b> have tremendous impact on the psychosocial well-being, in particular the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors. It is essential for health care professionals to develop and evaluate appropriate interventions with the aims at promoting psychosocial wellbeing and quality of life for childhood cancer. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
