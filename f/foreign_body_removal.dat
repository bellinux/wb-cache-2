40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Foreign</b> <b>body</b> in {{the lower}} urinary tract has a low incidence. Here we discuss {{a case of a}} safety pin within the bulbar urethra {{inserted}} by a young boy for sexual gratification, which was successfully removed under cysto-urethroscopic guidance. CASE REPORT: Herein we present a case of a 14 -year-old boy who presented with complaints of perineal pain and dysuria. On evaluation in detail and from clinical history, we came to know that he had inserted a safety pin within the urethra. Urine analysis revealed microscopic haematuria and few pus cells. X-ray of the pelvis and computerised tomography helped in confirming the presence of the safety pin within the urethra. CONCLUSIONS: The method of extraction of a <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> per urethra depends on {{the size and shape of}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>body.</b> Cysto-urethroscopic <b>removal</b> is successful depending on the physical characteristics of the <b>foreign</b> <b>body.</b> It has the advantage of minimising urothelial trauma and also helps in assessing any previous mucosal injury or thickening.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} visual outcome following pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and intraocular <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> (IOFB) <b>removal</b> {{through the}} sclerocorneal tunnel combined with simultaneous cataract extraction and sulcus-fixated intraocular lens (IOL) implantation {{as a single}} procedure in penetrating ocular trauma with IOFB and traumatic cataract. Materials and Methods: Eighteen cases of penetrating ocular trauma with retained IOFB and traumatic cataract who underwent PPV, IOFB <b>body</b> <b>removal</b> and cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL) implantation in the same sitting, between June &#x 2032; 04 and December &#x 2032; 05 were retrospectively analyzed. All the <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> were removed through the sclerocorneal tunnel. Result: All the 18 patients were young males, with an average follow-up period of 12 months. In 12 cases the <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> was intravitreal and in six cases it was intraretinal but extramacular. Thirteen cases had a best corrected visual acuity ranging from 20 / 20 to 20 / 60 at their last follow-up. Five cases developed retinal detachment due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) changes postoperatively and were subsequently managed by surgery. Conclusion: Primary IOL implantation with combined cataract and vitreo-retinal surgery is a safe option reducing the need for two separate surgeries in selected patients with retained IOFB and traumatic cataract.

30|$|AS-OCT {{facilitates}} non-invasive rapid imaging of ocular tissue {{at various}} depths, thereby providing accurate assessment of <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> characteristics.

40|$|Background/Aims: We {{analyzed}} the clinical characteristics {{of patients who}} underwent endoscopic <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> <b>removal</b> and the risk factors of complications. Patients and Methods: The medical records of 415 patients treated from January 2000 to August 2011 for suspected foreign bodies were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics, endoscopic findings, clinical outcomes, and risk factors of complications were analyzed. Results: Foreign bodies were detected endoscopically in 315 patients. Fish bone fragment (36. 9 %) and coins (15. 3 %) were {{the most common type}} of foreign bodies in adults and children, respectively. Complications associated with endoscopic procedure occurred in 26 patients (8. 3 %); 20 of the patients were treated conservatively and the other six patients underwent surgical treatment. Perforation (14 %) was the most common complication. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with complication after endoscopic <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> <b>removal</b> were long duration from ingestion to endoscopy (P = 0. 009) and existence of initial mucosal injury (P = 0. 018).
