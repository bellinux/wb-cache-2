The Bureau of Labor Statistics {{reported}} that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> months of 2008, 1.9million jobs were lost. By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6million jobs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{beginning}} {{during the}} events of , the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, {{the events of}} Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 (as well as the latter title's two updates). The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth, Raiden, attempting to change {{the aftermath of the}} events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat {{at the hands of the}} evil emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn. While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E

5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Crosby {{was listed}} first {{overall in the}} NHL Central Scouting Bureau and International Scouting Services' {{respective}} rankings of prospects. He had also won the Mike Bossy Trophy as the QMJHL's best prospect. Crosby went on to be selected first overall in the draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 30, 2005. Due to the labour stoppage that suspended the entire 2004–05 NHL season, positioning for the 2005 draft was conducted via a weighted lottery based on each team's playoff appearances and draft lottery victories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> years. This lottery system led to the draft being popularly {{referred to as the}} Sidney Crosby Lottery or the Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Woodfull established his partnership with Ponsford, and in 1926–27 Shield season, {{they put on}} a record-breaking 375-run opening stand, setting up a world record first-class team score of 1107. Woodfull averaged 69.00 for the season, and both he and Ponsford averaged over 125 the following summer, overwhelming opposition bowlers and helping Victoria win the Sheffield Shield easily. Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928–29 home Ashes series following a spate of retirements. Woodfull carried his bat in a record-breaking first Test defeat. Although England easily won 4–1, Woodfull stood firm to score three centuries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> Tests, and added his best first-class score for 275 not out in a tour match against the Englishmen. The following season, Woodfull's campaign was truncated by a hand injury.|$|E

5|$|Visual {{effects for}} Deadpool were {{produced}} by Digital Domain (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, Weta Digital, Rodeo FX, and Luma Pictures.

Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed with this, noting that Miller held off on working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots {{that would not be}} used. Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots.

She then claimed two catches to {{complete}} the eighth and ninth wickets—those of tail-enders Amita Sharma and Nooshin Al Khadeer—as Australia won by 86 runs. Ebsary went on to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> matches of the series. She was promoted to the No. 4 position in the next match, but failed to capitalise on her opportunity, making a duck. She bowled five overs without taking a wicket in a 54-run win. She then made 32 from 43 balls as an opener, hitting six boundaries in the fourth ODI at Manuka Oval in Canberra, helping to set up a 118-run win. In the final match, she took 1/13 from four overs, taking the wicket of leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj and was not required to bat in a seven-wicket win. She ended her debut series with 37 runs at 18.50 and two wickets at 34.50 at an economy rate of 3.83. Australia took the series 5–0 in a dominant display; all their wins were by at least seven wickets or 54 runs.|$|E

Celtic eased to a 4–0 win in the return match in Scotland, but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in the next qualifying round, losing 6–1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw. Despite this, Celtic were given a reprieve when {{it was discovered that}} Legia had fielded an ineligible player in the second leg, Bartosz Bereszynski coming on as a substitute <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> minutes. UEFA punished the Polish club by awarding the game a 3–0 to Celtic, levelling the aggregate score at 4–4 and seeing the Scottish champions progress on away goals. Despite this astonishing piece of luck, Celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in the final qualifier against Maribor, losing 2–1 on aggregate to drop down to the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|On 26 July Wilton {{had ordered}} Lieutenant Colonel Peter Jeffreys {{to prepare a}} {{counter-attack}} by 1 DLI to recover some of the ground lost to the Chinese the night before, but after preparatory fire failed to clear the Chinese from the objective the assault was cancelled. The Chinese subsequently made another attempt against the US Marines on Hill 119 {{on the night of}} 26/27 July, but it lacked the weight of those of the previous nights and was easily repelled. In a final attempt to capture Boulder City at 21:30 a Chinese platoon had advanced on the wire at Hill 119, defended by Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. Just after midnight another Chinese platoon-sized assault was also halted by the Marines. At 00:45 a Chinese platoon probed the US Marines on Hill 111, yet after an hour and twenty minutes it was also checked. Meanwhile, despite the clashes nearby on Hill 111 the Australians suffered no more casualties. The Armistice Agreement was subsequently signed at 10:00 on 27 July. Sporadic fighting continued, and the New Zealand gunners fired several counter-battery tasks, engaging several Chinese guns. The Commonwealth Divisional Artillery fired 1,300 rounds during the day; by evening the front was largely silent. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> hours of the war the Chinese fired 44,000 artillery rounds into the US Eighth Army positions, although none against the 1st Commonwealth Division. There were no further attacks and the ceasefire came into effect at 22:00 the same day. The following day some soldiers from both sides moved forward into no man's land to exchange greetings, although relatively few Australians did so and the Marines were under orders not to fraternise or communicate with the Chinese.|$|E
