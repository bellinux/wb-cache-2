One channel through which fluctuations in real {{rates of return}} on savings can impact on the economy is via their influence on the purchases of durable goods by consumers.

First, we report that subjects can combine multisensory information over time to improve judgments about whether a <b>fluctuating</b> <b>rate</b> is high or low. Importantly, the improvement we observed was frequently close to, or better than, the statistically optimal prediction. Second, we found that subjects showed a clear multisensory enhancement both when the inputs in each modality were redundant and when they provided independent evidence about the rate. This latter finding suggests a model where event rates are estimated separately for each modality and fused at a later stage. Finally, because a similar multisensory enhancement was observed in both humans and rats, we conclude that the ability to optimally exploit sequentially presented multisensory information is not restricted to a particular species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The new stress {{term in the}} time-average {{momentum}} equation of the modified generalised Newtonian fluid model of Cruz and Pinho (2003) is modeled for improved predictions of turbulent viscoelastic flows. The modified generalised Newtonian model was introduced by Pinho (2003) to mimic viscoelastic effects of fluids exhibiting drag reduction in turbulent pipe flow. The new stress quantifies the cross-correlation between the fluctuating viscosity and the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>rate</b> of strain and had been neglected in the k-ε low Reynolds number model originally developed by Cruz and Pinho (2003). The inclusion of this model for the new stress improves the predictions of turbulent kinetic energy (k+) in drag reducing pipe flow {{at the cost of}} a negligible deterioration in the prediction quality of other quantities for some of other fluids tested and for which the literature provides data. The original model of Cruz and Pinho (2003) has also been modified to correct for a mistake and this was shown to improve the predictions for all fluids except for the solution of 0. 125 %PAA used to calibrate the model. s...|$|E

It had been believed that in vivo cortical neurons are Poisson spike generators [5 – 7].

40|$|Dynamical {{disorder}} motivates <b>fluctuating</b> <b>rate</b> coefficients in phenomenological, mass-action rate equations. The reaction {{order in}} these rate equations is the fixed exponent controlling {{the dependence of}} the rate {{on the number of}} species. Here we clarify the relationship between these notions of (dis) order in irreversible decay, n A→ B, n= 1, 2, 3, [...] ., by extending a theoretical measure of fluctuations in the rate coefficient. The measure, J_n-L_n^ 2 ≥ 0, is the magnitude of the inequality between J_n, the time-integrated square of the rate coefficient multiplied by the time interval of interest, and L_n^ 2, the square of the time-integrated rate coefficient. Applying the inequality to empirical models for non-exponential relaxation, we demonstrate that it quantifies the cumulative deviation in a rate coefficient from a constant, and so the degree of dynamical disorder. The equality is a bound satisfied by traditional kinetics where a single rate constant is sufficient. For these models, we show how increasing the reaction order can increase or decrease dynamical disorder and how, in either case, the inequality J_n-L_n^ 2 ≥ 0 can indicate the ability to deduce the reaction order in dynamically disordered kinetics.

40|$|The time {{histogram}} is {{a fundamental}} tool for representing the inhomogeneous density of event occurrences such as neuronal firings. The shape of a histogram critically depends {{on the size of}} the bins that partition the time axis. In most neurophysiological studies, however, researchers have arbitrarily selected the bin size when analyzing fluctuations in neuronal activity. A rigorous method for selecting the appropriate bin size was recently derived so that the mean integrated squared error between the time histogram and the unknown underlying rate is minimized (Shimazaki & Shinomoto, 2007). This derivation assumes that spikes are independently drawn from a given rate. However, in practice, biological neurons express non-Poissonian features in their firing patterns, such that the spike occurrence depends on the preceding spikes, which inevitably deteriorate the optimization. In this letter, we revise the method for selecting the bin size by considering the possible non-Poissonian features. Improvement in the goodness of fit of the time histogram is assessed and confirmed by numerically simulated non-Poissonian spike trains derived from the given <b>fluctuating</b> <b>rate.</b> For some experimental data, the revised algorithm transforms the shape of the time histogram from the Poissonian optimization method...|$|E
