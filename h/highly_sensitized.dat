40|$|Loss of the G 1 /S {{checkpoint}} {{is recognized}} as a mandatory step {{in the development of}} cancer. Nevertheless, both in vivo and in vitro experiments have indicated that this condition <b>highly</b> <b>sensitizes</b> cells to apoptosis, e. g., primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack the complete retinoblastoma suppressor gene family (TKO MEFs) massively die under mitogen-deprived conditions. The prevailing hypothesis therefore is that the increased proliferative capacity of cells that have lost the G 1 /S checkpoint becomes apparent by suppression of apoptosis. However, this view was recently challenged by the finding that suppression of apoptotic cell death in TKO MEFs did not allow unconstrained proliferation; instead, cells became arrested in G 2. This mechanism, which is dependent on p 53, provides yet another barrier to oncogenic transformation. Thus, progression to malignancy of Rb-deficient lesions by alleviation of G 2 arrest may offer an alternative explanation for the synergism between loss of Rb and p 53 in tumorigenesis...|$|R

40|$|In many cell systems, {{pharmacological}} glutathione (GSH) depletion {{with the}} GSH neosynthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) leads to cell death and <b>highly</b> <b>sensitizes</b> tumor cells to apoptosis induced by standard chemotherapeutic agents.

In this article we investigate the response to BSO of lymphocytes freshly isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors. After ensuring that standard separation procedures do not alter per se lymphocytes redox equilibrium nor Bcl- 2 levels in the first 24 h of culture, we show that BSO treatment promotes the upregulation of Bcl- 2, with a mechanism involving the increased radical production consequent to GSH depletion.

Recently, peripheral processes have gained attention as mechanisms of hyperalgesia, and prostaglandins are among <b>highly</b> <b>sensitizing</b> agents. To date, perioperative administration {{of a single}} local dose of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has shown inconclusive efficacy. Rather than a single bolus, the current study evaluates the postoperative analgesic effect of diclofenac continuous intrawound infusion after elective cesarean delivery. METHODS: Ninety-two parturients were randomly allocated to receive a 48 -h continuous intrawound infusion with 240 ml containing 300 mg diclofenac, 0. 2 % ropivacaine, or saline. In the ropivacaine and saline groups, patients also received 75 mg intravenous diclofenac every 12 h for 48 h. Postoperative evaluation included intravenous morphine consumption by patient-controlled analgesia and visual analog pain scores. Punctate mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding the wound and presence of residual pain after 1 and 6 months were also assessed. RESULTS: Continuous diclofenac infusion significantly reduced postoperative morphine consumption (18 mg; 95 % confidence interval, 12. 7 - 22. 2) in comparison with saline infusion and systemic diclofenac (38 mg; 95 % confidence interval, 28. 8 - 43. 7) (P= 0. 0009) without unique adverse effects. Postoperative analgesia produced by local diclofenac infusion was as effective as local ropivacaine infusion with systemic diclofenac. CONCLUSIONS: After elective cesarean delivery, continuous intrawound infusion of diclofenac demonstrates a greater opioid-sparing effect and better postoperative analgesia than the same dose administered as an intermittent intravenous bolus...|$|R

Conjugates between HSA and HHPA, at two different molar ratios, were synthesized under physiological conditions. The conjugates were digested with trypsin and Pronase E to obtain specific peptides and amino acids, which were separated by liquid chromatography (LC). Fractions containing modified peptides were detected through quantification of hydrolysable HHPA using LC coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Modified residues in albumin were identified by sequence analyses using nanoelectrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 36 HHPA adducts were found in the HSA - HHPA conjugate with 10 times molar excess of added HHPA. In the conjugate with a molar ratio of 1 : 0. 1 of added HHPA, seven HHPA adducts were found bound to Lys(137) (domain IB), Lys(190), Lys(199) and Lys(212) (domain IIA), Lys(351) (domain IIB), and Lys(432) and Lys(436) (domain IIIA).

However, the precise time-frame in which acute rejection is fundamentally triggered by preformed donor-specific memory T cells rather than by denovo activated na ï ve T cells is still to be established. Here, preformed donor-specific alloreactive T-cell re- sponses were evaluated using the IFN- γ ELISPOT assay in a large consecutive cohort of kidney transplant patients (n = 90), to assess the main clinical variables associated with cel- lular sensitization and its predominant time-frame impact on allograft outcome, and was fur- ther validated in an independent new set of kidney transplant recipients (n = 67). We found that most <b>highly</b> T-cell <b>sensitized</b> patients were elderly patients with particularly poor HLA class-I matching, without any clinically recognizable sensitizing events. While one-year inci- dence {{of all types of}} biopsy-proven acute rejection did not differ between T-cell alloreactive and non-alloreactive patients, Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis indicated the first two months after transplantation as the highest risk time period for acute cellular re- jection associated with baseline T-cell sensitization.

Multivariate analysis confirmed preformed T-cell sensitization as an independent predictor of early acute cellular rejection.

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{presence of}} fragrance compounds in consumer products {{has resulted in}} a high frequency of contact allergy to fragrances in the population. For prevention purposes and according to EU regulations, cosmetics must be labeled when containing the most prominent fragrance allergens in concentrations exceeding 0. 001 % in “stay-on” products and 0. 01 % in “rinse-off” products. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} most common fragrance terpenes oxidize upon contact with air, forming hydroperoxides which are strong skin sensitizers. Thus, cosmetics may contain allergens in form of oxidation products formed by air exposure of the fragrance terpenes. In this thesis allergenic oxidation products from fragrance terpenes have been investigated. The studies have included development of analytical methods and chemical analyses for detection of hydroperoxides in complex mixtures. Furthermore, structure-activity relationships (SARs) were investigated based on studies of oxidation products and sensitizing potencies from autoxidation of the monoterpenes a-terpinene and citronellol. Monoterpene hydroperoxides are generally difficult to determine as they have weak chromophores, exhibit low thermostability, and fragment in a similar way as parent compounds and other oxidation products in mass spectrometry. For the first time, analytical methods for detection of the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitizing</b> hydroperoxides in complex mixtures are now available utilizing mass spectrometry in combination with either liquid chromatography or gas chromatography. Low detection limits were achieved using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, while a high peak capacity useful for separation of hydroperoxide isomers was obtained with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The methods presented are sensitive enough for detection of hydroperoxides at concentrations that people may come in contact with. Thus, the analytical methods open up the possibility of investigating the clinical relevance of products in the patients’ environment through chemical analysis. Fragrance compounds in essential oils are often stated to be protected from autoxidation due to the presence of natural antioxidants. This study showed that hydroperoxides were present in the investigated essential oils already upon arrival from the supplier and that the hydroperoxide concentrations steadily increased with time and air exposure. The hydroperoxides were formed to the same extent in the essential oils compared to what is seen at air exposure of the corresponding fragrance terpenes. Thus, no significant protection against autoxidation by antioxidant activity could be observed. Neither was the rate of autoxidation substantially affected by the experimental conditions; stirring and intensity of daylight did not have any considerable effects. Autoxidation studies of -terpinene and citronellol were performed to gain knowledge regarding oxidation products and sensitizing potencies, and the results were compared to previously studied fragrance terpenes. It was shown that minor structural differences have a major impact on the dominant oxidation pathway and the stability of the oxidation products. For both compounds the sensitizing potency (as examined by the murine local lymph node assay) after air exposure was largely enhanced, around ten-fold. This shows the importance of testing with oxidized material in clinical studies and not only with the pure terpenes. In the risk assessment of fragrance chemicals, the possibility of autoxidation should be considered. To summarize, the studies in this thesis have contributed to a method toolbox of complementary analytical methods with focus on mass spectrometry for detection and quantification of fragrance hydroperoxides. In addition, fragrance terpenes as constituents of essential oils form hydroperoxides, showing that the essential oils are not natural protectors for the formation of oxidation products but rather stabilize the hydroperoxides formed. Furthermore, this thesis shows that minor structural differences between fragrance terpenes can have a major impact on the dominant autoxidation pathway and oxidation products formed. Increased understanding of how fragrance terpenes can be activated to skin sensitizers by autoxidation is necessary to obtain valid SARs for this type of compounds. In the risk assessment, their susceptibility to autoxidation as well as the sensitizing potency of formed oxidation products should be considered...|$|R

50|$|In 2009 {{several more}} key {{innovations}} were yielding results {{at a single}} center KPD program, the Methodist Transplant Institute, in San Antonio led by Dr. Adam Bingaman. Prior to Dr. Bingaman's work, KPD {{was built on the}} notion that the results of a cross match test to determine donor-recipient compatibility are generally predictable and to ensure the prediction is accurate, a cross match test must be completed prior to the swap. In 5% - 10% of the cases, these cross match tests result in an unexpected positive cross match (bad) which causes a swap to fail. These swap failures are costly in terms of wasted time and testing but they are also demoralizing for the patients and donors involved in the cancelled swap. The Methodist program implemented the first donor blood cryo-preservation allowing the rapid cross matching of pairs in a swap without requiring fresh blood from donors. This approach accelerates the matching process, reduces swap failure rates and provides the ability to speculatively cross match potential donors for <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients, leading to shorter wait times and more transplants for <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients. Although the merits of using cryo-preserved donor blood for cross matching were clear, it proved difficult for multi-center KPD programs to implement cryo-preservation due to the complexity of the multi-center environment. The only U.S. multi-center KPD program that successfully implemented cryo-preservation was the National Kidney Registry but only after establishing a central lab and investing three years in software development. The second important innovation implemented in San Antonio was the re-engineering of the donor/patient intake process to educate and enroll compatible pairs in KPD so that the compatible recipient can get a better matched donor kidney. The development of cryo-preservation based cross matching and the systematic enrollment of compatible pairs has helped make San Antonio one of the leading KPD centers in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|The dye {{solar cell}}, {{is a novel}} photoelectrochemical solar cell {{presenting}} unique advantages, {{as the use of}} low cost materials and the potential simplicity of manufacturing. However, a liquid electrolyte is actually required for the transport of the photogenerated positive charges. A major breakthrough is the replacing of the liquid electrolyte by a solid-state hole conducting material – the aim of this work. First, the metal/TiO 2 junction was investigated, with either silver or gold as rectifying contact. Sensitization was demonstrated, as action spectra were measured using different dyes. The evaporated metal could not enter the pores of the nanocrystalline TiO 2 to contact all the dye molecules, hence only low photovoltaic performances were obtained. Furthermore, these metal/TiO 2 junctions showed a high sensitivity to humidity and to forward bias polarization. The use of an electrically conducting polymer, poly(bithiophene), was studied in a metal/polymer junction and in TiO 2 /polymer devices with flat and nanocrystalline TiO 2 electrodes. The photoelectric characterizations indicated that electrochemically reduced poly(bithiophene) was able to inject electrons into TiO 2, i. e. sensitizing TiO 2, and it acted as a hole conducting layer. Short-circuit current densities of 2 - 3 mA/cm 2 were measured at an irradiation of 1. 2 W/cm 2. The open-circuit voltages were in the 250 - 350 mV range, depending on the light intensity and temperature. The use of a transparent hole conducting material, CuI, which is a wide bandgap p-type semiconductor, was demonstrated in a nanocrystalline junction made of <b>highly</b> porous <b>sensitized</b> TiO 2 and solution-cast CuI. A short-circuit current of 1 mA/cm 2 was achieved under one sun simulated light; the open-circuit voltage was 600 mV and the light-to-power conversion efficiency was 0. 3 %. The peak quantum efficiencies of 8 % in the UV, and 3 % in the visible, showed that the nanocrystalline junction was working inefficiently, probably due to the poor electrical contact between the TiO 2 nanocrystallites and the CuI crystals. Furthermore, the sensitizer was not tuned to inject holes into the valence band of CuI. As conclusion, a controlled-capillary pore based sensitized device is suggested. In this concept, all the internal surface of the TiO 2 electrode coated with sensitizer is contacted with the transparent hole conducting layer, hence improving the photovoltaic properties of the device...|$|R

Humoral and cellular immune responses both participate in controlling the development of chronic MHV-induced demyelination. A subset of the CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induced by immunization of BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice with JHMV is specific for the viral nucleocapsid protein. This CTL population recognizes an epitope located within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids in association with the Ld class I molecule (S. A. Stohlman, S. Kyuwa, M. Cohen, C. Bergmann, J. P. Polo, J. Yeh, R. Anthony, and J. G. Keck, Virology 189 : 217 - 224, 1992). Using a panel of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing truncated forms of the nucleocapsid protein and a series of overlapping synthetic peptides, we mapped the response to 15 amino acids.

In 2002, researchers found that the nickel released by 1 and 2 Euro coins was far in excess of those standards. This {{is believed to be}} the result of a galvanic reaction. Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. In August 2015, the American Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel: [...] "Estimates suggest that contact dermatitis, which includes nickel sensitization, accounts for approximately $1.918 billion and affects nearly 72.29 million people." ...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{liver kidney}} {{transplantation}} (CLKT) {{has been used}} on many occasions and {{proved to be a}} successful event for both liver and kidney in <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients. Our aim was to review the immunological and other laboratory results of a CLKT in a <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patient. CLKT was used to treat a <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized,</b> 42 -year-old female. She was suffering from end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and renal disease due to diabetic nephropathy. Cross-matching, panel reactive assay (PRA) and routine laboratory tests for liver and renal function were carried out before and after the CLKT. Prior to the CLKT, the patient was <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> with human leukocytes antigens (anti-HLA) class I antibodies (> 90 %). Patient was offered CLKT from a deceased donor. She had donor-specific antibodies, class I and II. Both T and B CDC cross-matches (XM) were positive pre-transplant and eight hours post-transplant. Both cross-match and PRA results became completely negative six days post CKLT. Almost 30 months post CLKT, her renal function is normal and negative for class I and II PRA. Liver graft appears to be protective for renal graft when they are combined even in <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients. CLKT is very useful in overcoming sensitization in addition to treating end-stage liver and renal diseases...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho foram estudadas as propriedades dosimétricas de aluminatos de cálcio e lítio sintetizados pela técnica sol-gel e codopados/dopados com os terras-raras európio e térbio. No aluminato de cálcio as caracterizações morfológicas apresentaram fase predominante do Ca 12 Al 14 O 33 com grãos variando entre 150 - 270 &# 956;m, sistema poroso de 200 - 290 nm. As incorporações dos dopantes foram observadas com a formação dos compostos de CaEuAl 3 O 7 e CaTbAl 3 O 7 para as calcinações em 1100 °C e apresentaram os melhores resultados luminescentes. A caracterização luminescente revelou alta intensidade LOE para a amostra codopada com 0, 8 mol% de Eu,Tb e baixa intensidade TL-UV que não pode ser correlacionado com a LOE na faixa de doses estudadas (irradiações-? de 0, 08 - 16 Gy). Foram reportados três picos na TL-VIS, 92, 216 e 310 °C para o aluminato puro e 92, 135 e 216 °C para o codopado. Usando a técnica de LOE, a mínima dose detectável (MDD) obtida foi de 16 mGy com a amostra codopada e o menor fading foi de 5 % do pico de 216 °C para TL-Vis do puro. Pelos estudos de Tm-Tstop e deconvoluções (CGCD) foi possível ajustar as curvas TL-VIS com 6 picos de cinética de ordem geral e 4 componentes CW-LOE com 2. ª ordem. Pela LM-LOE foram obtidos elevados valores de seções de choque de fotoionização, o que justificou a alta sensibilidade óptica deste material. No aluminato de lítio (calcinação a 900 °C) a caracterização morfológica revelou grãos com dispersão de 25 - 70 µm, fase predominando de &# 947;- LiAlO 2. Após a incorporação dos dopantes de Tb houve a formação dos compostos Al 2 Tb 4 O 9 e TbAlO 3 e de estruturas longitudinais de ~ 500 nm nas superfícies dos grãos. As amostras apresentaram um sistema luminescente altamente complexo, com sobreposição de 6 picos na TL-VIS do aluminato puro (65, 100, 140, 203, 304 e 370 °C), 7 picos na TL-VIS do dopado (70, 100, 140, 184, 211, 295 e 340 °C). A MDD obtida foi de 5 mGy pela técnica LOE e de 2, 2 mGy do pico de 211 °C da TL-VIS do aluminato de lítio dopado com Tb. O menor fading obtido foi 1, 5 % do pico de 140 °C do aluminato puro na TL-VIS. Pelos estudos de Tm-Tstop e CGCD, as curvas TL-VIS foram ajustadas utilizando 9 picos e as de TL-UV com 8 e 7 picos para as amostras pura e dopada, respectivamente. Neste aluminato também foram observados fenômenos inéditos de ganho de luminescência de até 2 vezes a intensidade LOE inicial oriundos das transferências energéticas mediante estimulação térmica e óptica pós irradiação. Um modelo fenomenológico de bandas simplificado utilizando duas armadilhas profundas de competição está sendo proposto neste trabalho. O aluminato de lítio dopado apresentou elevada intensidade LOE e estabilidade térmica mesmo após 300 °C de tratamento térmico, entretanto, demonstrou alta sensibilidade à exposição óptica. As curvas de LM-LOE foram ajustadas com 4 componentes de elevadas seções de choque de fotoionização o que confere com a alta sensibilidade óptica reportada. In {{this work}} dosimetric proprieties of calcium and lithium aluminates synthetized by solgel {{technique}} and codoped/doped with rare earth europium and terbium were studied. Morphological characterization showed Ca 12 Al 14 O 33 (C 12 A 7) as a predominant phase, with grains size distribution between 150 - 270 &# 956;m and a porous system between 200 - 290 nm {{for the sample}} calcined at 1100 °C. This calcination revealed the greatest luminescence results. The dopant incorporation phases, observed by XRD patterns, matches to CaEuAl 3 O 7 and CaTbAl 3 O 7 compounds. Luminescence characterization showed intense OSL signal when the samples were codoped with the concentration of 0, 8 mol% of Eu,Tb. However, due to low TL-UV intensity, OSL signal could not be correlated with TL-UV glow curve of this aluminate. TL-VIS detection showed peaks at, 92, 216 and 310 °C for pure calcium aluminate and at 92, 135 and 216 °C for the codoped one. The lowest minimum detectable dose (MDD) obtained was 16 mGy in OSL detection from codoped calcium aluminate and the lowest fading was 5 % from aluminate for 216 °C TL peak in VIS region. By Tm-Tstop studies and CGCD deconvolution TL-VIS glow curve could be fitted using 6 peaks, with general order kinetic, and CW-OSL decay curve was fitted with 4 components of second order. LMOSL experiments resulted in high photo-ionization cross-sections, which explains the optical response of this sample. For lithium aluminate, morphological characterization showed grains size dispersion between 25 - 70 &# 956;m, with predominant phase of &# 947;-LiAlO 2 for pure sample, as well Al 2 Tb 4 O 9 and TbAlO 3 for Tb to doped one. Furthermore, SEM images showed long and longitudinal structures (500 nm) emerging from grain surface after Tb doping process. Luminescence characterization showed intense OSL, TL-UV and TL-VIS signals for sample doped with 0, 2 mol% and calcined at 900 °C, which comprehends a complex luminescence system, with overlapping of 6 peaks in TL-VIS for pure aluminate (65, 100, 140, 203, 304 and 370 °C), 7 peaks for TL-VIS of doped one (70, 100, 140, 184, 211, 295 and 340 °C). The MDD obtained was 5 mGy for OSL and 2, 2 mGy for 211 °C for TL-VIS peak, both for 0, 2 mol% of Tb. The lowest fading was 1, 5 % for pure lithium aluminate of the 140 °C TL-VIS peak. By Tm-Tstop studies and CGCD deconvolution, TL-VIS glow curves were fitted using 9 peaks and for TLUV region, 8 and 7 peaks for pure and doped samples, respectively. Strictly, lithium aluminate revealed several energetic transfers evolving two possible depth trap explain by a simplified model of luminescence bands. The energetic transfer increments the final luminescence of the sample up to 2 times the initial OSL signal. Besides, even after 300 °C of thermal treatment, OSL signal keep its intense luminescence. However, the samples are <b>highly</b> <b>sensitize</b> by optical stimulation. In LM-OSL deconvolution, 4 components with elevated photo-ionization cross-sections were determined and fitted the experimental curve, which explains the highly optical sensitization...|$|R
40|$|Background/Purpose: Renal {{transplant}} {{candidates who}} are <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) tend to wait longer to find a matched donor and have poor outcomes. Most organ-sharing programs prioritize <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients in the allocation scoring system. The HLA sensitization status is traditionally evaluated by the panel-reactive antibody (PRA) assay. However, this assay is method dependent and does not consider the ethnic differences in HLA frequencies. A calculated PRA (cPRA), based on a population's HLA frequency and patients' unacceptable antigens (UAs), correctly estimates the percentage of donors suitable for candidates. The Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center does not prioritize sensitized patients. We propose that the incorporation of the cPRA and UAs into the renal allocation program will improve the local kidney allocation policy. Methods: We established a cPRA calculator using 6146 Taiwanese HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ phenotypes. We performed simulated allocation based {{on the concept of}} acceptable mismatch for 76 candidates with cPRA values exceeding 80 %. Results: We analyzed 138 waitlisted renal transplant candidates at our hospital, and we determined that the concordance rate of the cPRA and PRA for <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> (%PRA >  80 %) candidates was 92. 5 %, which decreased to 20 % for those with %PRA <  80 %. We matched 76 <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients based on acceptable mismatch with the HLA phenotypes of 93 cadaver donors. Forty-six patients (61 %) found at least one suitable donor. Conclusion: The application of the cPRA and acceptable mismatch can benefit <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients and reduce positive lymphocyte cytotoxicity crossmatch.

As the percentage of the waiting list becomes increasingly populated with <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patients, there is a growing demand for effective strategies to manage these patients. Over the past 20 years, desensitization therapies have been modified and developed, and are mainly utilized at transplant centers that have developed expertise. In addition, recognition that the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patient population is disadvantaged on the transplant waiting list has led to recent changes in national kidney allocation policy. Furthermore, creative strategies, such as enrollment of sensitized patients into paired kidney exchange programs, have been developed to find compatible matches for these patients. The goal {{of this article is to}} address some of the specific challenges related to transplanting the <b>highly</b> <b>sensitized</b> patient at a high-volume transplant center with experience in desensitization and to review established and emerging solutions to help this patient population.
