25|$|During hectic {{early summer}} 1936 {{negotiations}} with Mola, Baleztena and the fellow Navarrese pushed for almost unconditional Carlist {{access to the}} rebellion. Opposing cautious policy of Fal, they pursued a superseding strategy which bordered sabotage and is sometimes considered an internal coup within Carlism. As a result, the Requeté were committed to insurgency with no guarantees on part of the military. The Navarrese formed their own wartime body temporarily headed by Baleztena, Navarrese War Council, which implemented an independent political line and was only with difficulty acknowledged by the official Carlist wartime executive. Though Baleztena is not considered leader of the group, {{as head of the}} most important Carlist province <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> the balance against the falcondistas.|$|E

50|$|William {{returns to}} the tournament to face Adhemar in the final match, but Adhemar cheats with an {{illegally}} sharpened lance, piercing William's shoulder and seriously injuring him. Entering the final pass, William is losing by two lances and must unhorse Adhemar to win. He demands to be stripped of his armour while Chaucer buys time by performing the introduction of William that he omitted earlier. Finally <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> against Adhemar, {{with his father and}} Jocelyn in attendance. Bellowing his true name as <b>he</b> <b>tilts,</b> <b>he</b> knocks Adhemar to the ground with a crushing blow. In the ensuing celebration, as Jocelyn and William embrace, Chaucer remarks that he should write this whole story down.|$|R

50|$|Every day, {{hundreds}} of devotees offer liquor to the deity. The devotees {{hand over the}} liquor bottles to the priest, who pours the liquor in a saucer. He then offers prayers, and takes the saucer near the deity's lips, which have a slit. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> the plate a bit, and the liquor starts disappearing. About one-third of the bottle is returned to the devotee as prasad.|$|R

25|$|Flushed with victory, {{the knight}} kneels and renders thanks to heaven. Seeing the moon, {{he takes it}} for his Dulcinea and tries to get to her.

So, spear in hand, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> at the wings of the windmill, which he mistakes for a giant. Alas, the knight is caught by one of the wings and flung into the air. He falls unconscious at Sancho's feet.|$|R

50|$|J.D.'s most {{prominently}} featured quirk is his habit of daydreaming. When this happens, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> {{his head back}} and to his left, blankly looking upwards. The sequences played out in his daydreams are of surreal scenarios and situations that have just been mentioned or wondered about, often in an exaggerated manner. Many of these are followed by a comment from him which, although in keeping with his daydream, sounds strange and is often highly unrelated to the initial topic, very often earning him odd looks from nearby characters in the scene.|$|R

50|$|In {{the morning}} they're found. The police believe Alma {{committed}} suicide {{because she felt}} guilty for killing Monique and that Gloria found her and had a stroke. The doctors tell Orson that his mother, though completely paralyzed physically, still has the same mental capacity. Orson feels relief {{that the fact that}} he was an accomplice in Monique’s burial will remain secret and with his mother. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> her head so that she can see him walk out of her life for the last time. On leaving the hospital he imagines his future life with Bree.|$|R

40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Eadweard Muybridge, pioneer of early action photography, 1872 - 1878. The portrait, taken fifteen years after Muybridge had successfully taken the famous photographic action series of Leland Stanford's horse, depicts the artist {{seated in a}} chair with his hands folded in his lap. He wears a suit and gazes to the left. His long white hair and beard are in disarray, his intense eyes set deep into his head and veiled in shadow. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> {{his head to the}} side, making him look partially infirm or deranged. A note on the picture file card reads: "(Griffin?) "...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, kiddo. If you're {{as thick}} as that I'll have to put you wise," [...] {{answered}} Thesel, good-humoredly, as <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> back his cigarette to blow smoke at the ceiling. [...] "Dick is through with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|It amused Bartley to hear Kinney bragging already of a {{town that}} he had never seen. He winked a good-natured disdain over the rim of the goblet which <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> on his lips. [...] "And give up my chances here?" [...] he said, as he set the goblet down.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Merton. 'Then let us talk {{as between}} man and man.' <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> his chair backwards, and crossed his legs. 'By the way, as I have no Aaron and Hur to help me to hold up my hands, may I drop them? The attitude, though reassuring, is fatiguing.' ...|$|E
5000|$|On-stage Strummer wires {{himself up}} into an inhuman dynamo of sweaty, {{trembling}} flesh, fearful {{enough to have}} one wondering when the ambulance brigade will rush to his rescue with a straight-jacket. While <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> his bullet head at acute angles, his agonising face screwed into an open wound, he wields his Telecaster like a chain saw. His magnetism is totally original - more like an Olympic strong man imploding all his energy into a final record-breaking lift than anything seen on a rock'n'roll stage before. Off-stage, he's the Clash member with the lowest profile. —Caroline Coon ...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> the elevator, and rose. But, {{as he was}} volplaning, this {{cut down}} the speed, and from a height of ten feet above a field the machine {{dropped to the ground}} with a flat plop. Something gave way--but Carl sat safe, with the machine canted to one side.|$|E
60|$|His {{proceedings}} when {{he entered}} it were but a poor compliment to his host. Not until he had poked and pried into every corner did he close the door.

60|$|At {{this point}} Miss Haldin got up abruptly. I was glad. He did not evidently expect {{anything}} so decisive and, at first, throwing his head back, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> up his dark glasses with bland curiosity.

500|$|The male {{bog turtle}} is {{territorial}} and will attack other males if they venture within [...] of his position. An aggressive male will crawl toward an intruder with his neck extended. As he approaches his foe, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> his carapace by withdrawing {{his head and}} raising his hind limbs. If the other male does not retreat, a fight of pushing and biting can follow. The bouts typically last just a few minutes, with the larger and older male usually winning. The female is also aggressive when threatened. She will defend the area around her nest, usually up to a radius of , from encroaching females, but when a juvenile approaches, she ignores it, and when a male appears she surrenders her area (except during mating season).|$|R
