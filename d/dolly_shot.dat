500|$|Flying Padre was {{followed}} by The Seafarers (1953), Kubrick's first color film, which was shot for the Seafarers International Union in June 1953. It has shots of ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, sideways-shooting <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> to establish {{the life of the}} seafarer's community; this shot is an early demonstration of a technique which would become a signature of his. The montage of speaker and audience echoes scenes from Eisenstein's Strike (1925) and [...] (1928). Day of the Fight, Flying Padre and The Seafarers constitute Kubrick's only surviving documentary works, although some historians believe he made others.|$|E
500|$|Charness {{singled out}} the film's famous title number and states, [...] "it's a very kinetic moment, for {{though there is}} no {{technically}} accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song." [...] Donen's Royal Wedding and Give A Girl A Break continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film Invitation to Dance.|$|E

50|$|In particular, the two {{directors}} Harald Reinl (5 movies) and Alfred Vohrer (14 movies) {{made their}} mark. While Reinl preferred long <b>dolly</b> <b>shots</b> /pans and exterior shots, Vohrer's films {{are known for}} their slight overacting and their distinct zoom and editing styles.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{actually}} believe my {{work with the}} Akeley {{was the father of}} all <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> for until I made follow shots with that camera, our cameras never moved. With the introduction of camera movement, cameramen had the opportunity of improving their art. Mobility of the camera has done much for cinematography".|$|R
50|$|Types of reframing can include: pan, tilt, zoom, crane or boom <b>shot,</b> <b>dolly</b> or {{trucking}} <b>shot,</b> handheld shot, tracking shot, and steadycam shot.|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} about the klassical rules in feature films and a current market {{research}} of chosen examples. The author will discuss the thesis that the modern film isn’t made from klassical standards because the viewers eye doesn’t receive typical stimulus any more. It needs stronger stimulus so the film producers make use of new effects like <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> computer animated figures, rapidity and other elements...|$|R
50|$|In December 1981, {{the funeral}} for Allan Dwan, legendary {{director}} {{of more than}} 400 silent and talking films (including Robin Hood, Heidi, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Sands of Iwo Jima) and inventor of the <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> and the overhead tracking shot, was held at St. Cyril's.|$|E
50|$|A Steadicam {{essentially}} {{combines the}} stabilized steady footage {{of a conventional}} tripod mount with the fluid motion of a <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> and the flexibility of hand-held camera work. While smoothly following the operator's broad movements, the Steadicam's arm absorbs jerks, bumps, and shakes, while its almost frictionless gimbal gives precise control of the camera and framing.|$|E
5000|$|A shot {{in which}} the camera moves toward or away from its subject while filming. Traditionally dolly shots are filmed from a camera dolly but the same motion may also be {{performed}} with a Steadicam, gimbal, etc. A <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> is generally {{described in terms of}} [...] "dollying in" [...] or [...] "dollying out". Trucking in and out is also a common synonym.|$|E
50|$|It was {{expensive}} for a kids' show, {{but most of}} the budget (about $9,000 per episode) went into aircraft, vehicles, fuel, and sets. This meant that some standard production methods had to be abandoned, giving the series a more realistic look. For instance, in some shots, pilot Bill Fergusson actually did taxi the 310B rather than the more common (but time-consuming and costly) method of simulating movement by towing or <b>dolly</b> <b>shots.</b> Plymouth provided several 1951 woodie station wagons for the series.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the seminal}} {{products}} of the French New Wave (Nouvelle Vague), Jules and Jim is an inventive encyclopedia {{of the language of}} cinema: Truffaut incorporated newsreel footage, photographic stills, freeze frames, panning <b>shots,</b> wipes, masking, <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> and voiceover narration (by Michel Subor). Truffaut's cinematographer was Raoul Coutard, a frequent collaborator with Jean-Luc Godard, who employed the latest lightweight cameras to create an extremely fluid film style. For example, some of the postwar scenes were shot using cameras mounted on bicycles.|$|R
5000|$|A lightweight, highly-mobile camera {{transportation}} and stabilization device developed by inventor / cinematographer Garrett Brown which permits hand-held filming {{with an image}} steadiness comparable to tracking or <b>dolly</b> <b>shots.</b> The device involves 1.) a vest redistributing {{the weight of the}} camera to the hips of the cameraman and, 2.) a spring-loaded arm working to minimize the effects of camera movement. A video tap simultaneously frees the camera operator from the eyepiece, who is then free to travel through any walkable terrain while filming.|$|R
5000|$|The film's {{budget was}} low, {{approximately}} $150,000. Bava {{was forced to}} improvise numerous times during the production {{in order to get}} the technical results he wanted. Cameron Mitchell noted that in order to film an impressive <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> through the fashion house, Bava simply placed the camera on a child's red wagon. Similarly, Bava completed several crane shots by utilizing a [...] "makeshift seesaw contraption." ...|$|E

50|$|A jib {{is useful}} for getting high shots, or shots which need to move a great {{distance}} horizontally or vertically, without the expense and safety issues of putting a camera operator on a crane for a crane shot or laying track for a camera dolly. A jib can even be mounted on a dolly for shots in which the camera moves over obstacles such as furniture, when a normal <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> could not be used.|$|E
5000|$|Mizoguchi used many long {{takes in}} the film, often lasting up to six minutes. He also used many <b>dolly</b> <b>shots</b> for {{dramatic}} effects {{and in order to}} enhance the emotional state of the characters. He utilized both the foreground and the background in many shots. Derek Malcolm said that [...] "If Mizoguchi was the poet of women, he was also the poet of houses, rooms, landscape and urban vistas. His period detail and sumptuous camera style lent his stories a fantastic naturalism, heightened by an almost musical editing style." ...|$|R
40|$|Thomas Boyer {{breaks down}} {{the concept of the}} time-image and uses it to explore the films of Yasujiro Ozu, {{specifically}} focusing on Early Summer (1948). Boyer argues against what he sees as a misrepresentation of Ozu’s style as Zen, insisting on the importance of not only Ozu’s “still life” images, but also his thematic concerns, the ambiguity of his central character Noriko, and the use of <b>dolly</b> <b>shots</b> to create flowing sequences. Boyer explains that these elements add to the complexity of Ozu’s representation of time, providing compelling, specific evidence from the film to support a nuanced analysis of Ozu’s style...|$|R
500|$|Film {{historian}} Steven H. Scheuer graded {{the film}} {{one and a}} half stars, writing [...] "Wife is terrorized by unexplainable happenings. Or is it inexplicable? Both describe the film". VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever by Jim Craddock also gave the film {{one and a half}} stars, and TV Guide gave it two. Webber herself did not like the film, stating that [...] "it didn't impress me" [...] and she [...] "wanted to throw up" [...] after watching it. However, Nicol took a more positive stance, saying: [...] "I liked it; it had some nice <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> a good atmosphere. So I was happy with that; it was a nice change from the films I'd been doing".|$|R
5000|$|In cinematography, the dolly grip is a {{dedicated}} technician trained {{to operate the}} camera dolly. This technician places, levels, and moves the dolly track, then pushes and pulls the dolly and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders. If the dolly has a moveable vertical axis, such as a hydraulic arm, then the dolly grip also operates the [...] "boom". If both axes are used simultaneously, this type of <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> {{is known as a}} compound move.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 Gala shot a {{video for}} the song [...] "Taste Of Me" [...] choreographed by Benoit Swan, Artistic Director of New York’s avant guard dance company Cedar Lake, and {{directed}} by New York-based French director Alexandre Moors (Kanye West’s [...] "Runaway", Blue Caprice). Gala's video features the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre trained [...] "Abdur-Rahim Jackson". The [...] "Taste Of Me" [...] video appears as a one single lateral <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> that follows five dancers including Gala interacting in an organic dance that constantly moves forward.|$|E
5000|$|When filming Rope (1948), Alfred Hitchcock {{intended}} for the film to {{have the effect of}} one long continuous take, but the cameras available could hold no more than 1000 feet of 35 mm film. As a result, each take used up to a whole roll of film and lasts up to 10 minutes. Many takes end with a <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> to a featureless surface (such as the back of a character's jacket), with the following take beginning at the same point by zooming out. The entire film consists of only 11 shots.|$|E
5000|$|The DVD {{includes}} a [...] "director's dialogue" [...] between Soderbergh and playwright/director Neil LaBute, recorded in 1998. LaBute's presence leads to conversational tangents {{unrelated to the}} film, {{although most of the}} tangents are related {{to the question of what}} it means to be a director, and are intended, as Soderbergh summarizes at the end, to [...] "demystify" [...] the process of making a film. LaBute's presence prompts Soderbergh to talk about reverse zooms, <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> how actors have varying expectations of their director, the difference between stealing from a film you admire and paying tribute to it, shooting out of sequence, how the role of a director changes as their success (and their budgets) grow, and other filmmaking topics.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} first coined by Henri Chomette. The {{goal of the}} {{movement}} {{was to create a}} cinema that focused on the pure elements of film like motion, visual composition, and rhythm. It was begun by European filmmakers René Clair, Fernand Léger, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling and others. They sought to accomplish their goal by minimizing story and plot, focusing instead on visual concerns by using close-ups, <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> montage, lens distortions, and other cinematic techniques. Films like Ballet Mécanique, Symphony Diagonale, and The Symphony of a Great City projected rhythm and motion in the title of the films and the works themselves. In addition to close-ups, other filmmaking techniques were used to create rhythm and visual interest. They include fast and slow motion, trick shots, stop-action cinematography and dynamic cutting.|$|R
2500|$|Buñuel {{preferred}} {{scenes that}} could simply be pieced together end-to-end in the editing room, resulting in long, mobile, wide shots which followed {{the action of}} the scene. [...] Filmmaker Patricia Gruben has attributed this procedure to a long-standing strategy on Buñuel's part intended to thwart external interference: [...] "he would make the whole scene in long four-minute <b>dolly</b> <b>shots</b> so the producers couldn't cut it". [...] Examples are especially present in his French films. For example, at the ski resort's restaurant in Belle de jour, Séverin, Pierre, and Henri converse at a table. Buñuel cuts away from their conversation to two young women, who walk down a few steps and proceed through the restaurant, passing behind Séverin, Pierre, and Henri, at which point the camera stops and the young women walk out of frame. Henri then comments on the women and the conversation at the table progresses from there.|$|R
50|$|There are {{shots of}} ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting. The film {{was shot in}} color, and was {{supervised}} by the staff of The Seafarers Log, the union magazine. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, sideways-shooting <b>dolly</b> <b>shot</b> to establish {{the life of the}} seafarer's community; this shot is an early demonstration of a signature technique that Kubrick would use in his feature films. Another such shot involves a group of seafarers walking across screen from a shaded area to a sunlit space as they approach the SIU Union hall.|$|E

50|$|CAPS {{was capable}} of {{a high level of}} image quality using {{significantly}} slower computer systems than are available today. The final frames were rendered at a 2K digital film resolution (2048 pixels across at a 1.66 aspect ratio), and the artwork was scanned so that it always held 100% resolution in the final output, no matter how complex the camera motion in the shot. Using the Pixar image computer, images were stored at 48-bits per pixel. The compositing system allowed complex multi-layered shots that was used almost immediately in The Rescuers Down Under to create a 400-layer opening <b>dolly</b> <b>shot.</b> The DALS system made use of one of the first large-scale, custom RAID systems in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|The {{final cut}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{consists}} of two continuous sixty-second <b>dolly</b> <b>shots</b> taken from a technocrane, stitched together [...] later in post-production. (The stitching appears during {{the moment when the}} muffler rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, 606takes were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one to roll off the trailer {{at the end of the}} advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.|$|R
2500|$|Godard became {{interested}} in 3D because [...] "it is still an area {{where there are no}} rules" [...] and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, [...] "reveal something cultural", such as what it [...] "mean about the times it emerged from" [...] and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, <b>dolly</b> <b>shots,</b> close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were [...] "rules" [...] about technique, stating [...] "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." [...] His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something [...] "beyond the frame." [...] Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that [...] "when you want something to be understood, you say it at least twice." ...|$|R
