2500|$|In the 1960s, in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada, {{there were}} many reports of UFO {{sightings}} and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields. For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada, and the Department of National Defence sent two investigators, who concluded that it was artificially made but couldn't make definite conclusions on who made them or how. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully [...] "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or [...] up from a swamp and then fly away. When he went to investigate the location where he thought the saucer had landed, he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a <b>down</b> <b>draught,</b> a willy-willy (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the [...] "saucer" [...] was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.|$|E

50|$|A capuchon is {{a raised}} lip {{at the front}} of a ship's funnel or railway steam {{locomotive}} chimney. It is intended to prevent <b>down</b> <b>draughts</b> when in motion and encourage smoke to rise. Sometimes capuchons were made of plate steel bolted or welded in place, others were {{an integral part of the}} chimney casting. The name derives from their resemblance to a type of ceremonial hat.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the 4G32 was introduced, and it {{displaces}} 1.6 L (1,597 cc). It is an eight-valve SOHC {{design with}} an aluminium head and iron block.

40|$|During {{cold winter}} days {{it is likely}} that people in {{buildings}} with older windows or high glass facades experience thermal discomfort due to cold air down draughts. Earlier work has been aimed at finding analytical methods to predict the speed of the airflow in a room and in practice heating appliances are often placed beneath the windows to reduce the draught along the floor. In a study from 2012 Mohammad Parchami developed a method for estimating the required heating power to counteract the downdraught with such heating appliances. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to evaluate the usefulness of Parchami’s method and also to examine the potential of adapting the depth of the inward window sill as a means of decreasing the <b>down</b> <b>draught.</b> The result suggested that Parchami’s method is in need of certain modifications and further CFD-simulations can be a useful tool to make the method more acceptable to the building profession. Further, it was also shown that an adapted sill depth could considerably reduce the airflow speed in the room and the result indicated that there is an “effective sill depth” at which the airflow speed from the downdraught reaches a minimum. It is likely that this effective sill depth in large part depends on the boundary layer thickness at the window, in which case the constructors are given the alternative to determine the window sill depth by an easy estimation of the boundary layer thickness...|$|E

50|$|The firebox {{door was}} also of novel design. As the {{backplate}} sloped so steeply, {{the door was}} top-hinged and opened inwards, rather than outwards.

60|$|In {{the vast}} ballroom over the medley of entwined {{revolving}} couples, punkahs had been fixed, to clear and freshen the languid air, and these huge fans, moving with incredible slowness, drove a faint refreshing <b>draught</b> <b>down</b> {{over the sea}} of white shirt-fronts and bare necks, and freed the scent from innumerable flowers.|$|R
60|$|Also, {{they brought}} mealies and other corn; and oh! the delight with which those poor people, who {{for months and}} months had existed upon nothing but flesh-meat, ate of this farinaceous food. Never shall I forget seeing Marie and the {{surviving}} children partake of their first meal of porridge, and washing the sticky stuff <b>down</b> with <b>draughts</b> of fresh, sugared milk, for with the oxen I had succeeded in obtaining two good cows. It is enough to say that this change of diet soon completely re-established their health, and made Marie more beautiful than she had ever been before.|$|R

Esther watched him and Merri, fascinated. Poor old Lucienne was quietly weeping behind her apron.|$|R
6000|$|WHEN THE four yeomen had {{traveled}} {{for a long}} time toward Sherwood again, high noontide being past, they began to wax hungry.

Indeed, the king did more, for coming forward he seized Brother John by the hand, and insisted upon rubbing his ugly black nose against that of this revered guest. This, it appeared, was the Mazitu method of embracing, an honour which Brother John {{did not seem}} at all to appreciate. Then {{followed}} long speeches, washed <b>down</b> with <b>draughts</b> of thick native beer. Bausi explained that his evil proceedings were entirely due to the wickedness of the deceased Imbozwi and his disciples, under whose tyranny the land had groaned for long, since the people believed them to speak [...] "with the voice of 'Heaven Above.'" ...|$|R
60|$|IN MERRY ENGLAND in {{the time}} of old, when good King Henry the Second ruled the land, there lived within the green glades of Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham Town, a famous outlaw whose name was Robin Hood. No archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill and cunning as his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore merry men that roamed with him through the {{greenwood}} shades. Right merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering neither care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or bouts of cudgel play, living upon the King's venison, washed <b>down</b> with <b>draughts</b> of ale of October brewing.|$|R
60|$|Phillotson, horrified, ran downstairs, {{striking}} himself sharply {{against the}} newel in his haste.

Phillotson seized it in his arms, and bringing Sue into the hall seated her on a chair, where he gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set <b>down</b> in the <b>draught</b> on the bottom stair.|$|R
60|$|Klara smothered {{a desperate}} cry of terror.

He did not look again on Klara, but having put the mug down, he passed his hand once or twice across his forehead as if to chase away some of those horrible thoughts which were still lurking in his brain.|$|R

On the table was his belated breakfast, and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me, Kemp, to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal. And his table manners were irritating. Three doors opened into the little room, one going upstairs and one down, but they were all shut. I could not get out of the room while he was there; I could scarcely move because of his alertness, and there was a <b>draught</b> <b>down</b> my back. Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time.|$|R

By now, however, meat had been served, and as I was hungry, having had little breakfast that morning, I stayed to eat.

50|$|Rising normal {{water level}} to the design value of 68 m was {{hindered}} first by incomplete reservoir banks protection, then being opposed by Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Mari El Republic. Now the station is operating at 63 m water level, with an actual installed power of 820 MW and an average annual production of 2100 GWh. Also lowered level poses difficulties to navigation on the Volga river between Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets, with allowed <b>draught</b> <b>down</b> to 3 m, whereas it is 4 m on {{other parts of the}} Volga. Water quality in reservoir degrades because shallow waters comprise 33% of its area instead of the designed 19%. The water level problem is still being discussed.|$|R
60|$|By {{good luck}} I had slipped several {{biscuits}} {{into my pocket}} before I left the farm-house. These I now devoured, and washed them <b>down</b> with a <b>draught</b> from that wretched stream which had been the cause of all my misfortunes. Then I felt about for a comfortable seat among the rocks, and, having discovered a place where I could get a support for my back, I stretched out my legs and settled myself down to wait. I was wretchedly damp and cold, but I tried to cheer myself with the reflection that modern science prescribed open windows and walks in all weather for my disease. Gradually, lulled by the monotonous gurgle of the stream, and by the absolute darkness, I sank into an uneasy slumber.|$|R
