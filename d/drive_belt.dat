5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
25|$|Vibraphones {{usually have}} an {{electric}} motor and pulley assembly mounted on {{one side or the}} other to drive the disks in the resonators. The early vibraphones used motors that were intended to power record player turntables, and had limited or no speed adjustment capabilities. Whatever speed adjustments were possible were made by moving the <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> among a small number of pulleys (usually three) of varying diameters.|$|E

2500|$|A unique {{feature of}} vibraphone {{resonators}} is {{a shaft of}} rotating discs, commonly called fans, across the top. [...] When the fans are open (vertical) the resonators have full function. [...] When the fans are closed (horizontal) the resonators are partially occluded, reducing the resonance of the fundamental pitch. [...] A <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> connects the shafts to an electric motor (see below) beneath the playing surface, and rotation of the fans creates what many people call a [...] "vibrato" [...] effect; however in actuality it is a tremolo, i.e. periodic modulation of amplitude, not pitch.|$|E

2500|$|The motor is {{attached}} to the frame at one end. [...] The hinges for the damper bar are attached at each end, and the spring assembly and the pedal are usually attached in the middle. [...] Two banks of resonator tubes are laid into grooves in the frame so that they straddle the damper bar. [...] The resonators are not firmly fastened to the frame. [...] The ends of the shafts that gang the disks are attached to the drive of the motor via a <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> similar to an O-ring.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist {{grip on the}} handlebars which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the <b>drive</b> <b>belt,</b> applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for steering linkage shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the twist grip or gear linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|E

[...] The Stage 1 Kit retailed for around $500 USD, and included higher-flow fuel injectors and a recalibration to the ECU to increase the Horsepower by 31hp to 236hp and 205lb·ft. of torque, up from the stock 205hp and 200lb·ft. [...] The Stage 2 Kit retailed for around $750 and opens up {{the middle of the}} power curve to more power than the Stage 1 Kit alone. [...] In addition to everything that the Stage 1 Kit comes with, the Stage 2 Kit includes a smaller <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> and pulley for the supercharger, bringing the engine up to 241hp and 218lb·ft. of torque. [...] GM did release a Stage 1 to Stage 2 Upgrade kit that retailed for $400. [...] This Upgrade Kit is for a Red Line [...] with the Stage 1 kit already installed. [...] This Upgrade Kit adds the Stage 2 elements and increases the horsepower from 236hp to 241hp.|$|E

40|$|Belts are {{components}} of the mechanical systems of rotation commonly used for mechanical power transmission and changes in rotational speeds in the shafts. Various failures of the <b>drive</b> <b>belts</b> (foot shear, tooth wear, hollowed teeth, back cracks) are common in rotating machines and can cause economic losses. To increase efficiency, reliability and safety of the machines the use of new fault diagnosis techniques of belts, identification and classification is required.
