She knows how to enroll in American educational institutions. She can open bank accounts and transfer money. She <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> work here. She could have been very useful to them simply for her understanding of the U.S." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, {{the sons}} of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were doing, so he asked Joseph {{to go down there}} and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up {{receiving}} came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, come!" [...] {{cried the}} President. [...] "With a fair field, who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> may happen? I must add that I {{consider}} it handsome behaviour on your Highness's part; {{and if the}} worst comes to the worst I shall die {{by one of the}} most gallant gentlemen in Europe." ...|$|R
5000|$|Diana Steenbergen from IGN {{rated the}} episode with 9.5/10 {{saying that it}} was another {{whirlwind}} episode. [...] "episode was chock full of surprises, including a couple head-spinning shockers at the end. Just when you thought you <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were going to go down, Klaus pulls out a Plan B that no one saw coming." ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{personal}} {{loss was}} immediately followed, on 15 May, by {{the resignation of}} Admiral Fisher after continuing disagreements with Churchill and in frustration at the disappointing developments in Gallipoli. Aged 74, Fisher's behaviour had grown increasingly erratic and, in frequent letters to Lloyd George, he gave vent to his frustrations with the First Lord of the Admiralty; [...] "Fisher writes to me every day or two to let me <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are going. He {{has a great deal}} of trouble with his chief, who is always wanting to do something big and striking." [...] Adverse events, press hostility, Tory opposition and personal sorrows assailed Asquith, and his position was further weakened by his Liberal colleagues. Cassar considers that Lloyd George displayed a distinct lack of loyalty, and Koss writes of the contemporary rumours that Churchill had [...] "been up to his old game of intriguing all round" [...] and reports a claim that Churchill [...] "unquestionably inspired" [...] the Repington Letter, in collusion with Sir John French. Lacking cohesion internally, and attacked from without, Asquith determined that his government could not continue and he wrote to the King, [...] "I have come decidedly to the conclusion that the [...] must be reconstituted on a broad and non-party basis." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have done right and wisely in letting Bland <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> stand. It was only my {{interest}} in your future that warranted what I said." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} implementers (who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> really worked) {{have moved}} on and left insufficient documentation of the internal workings of the software. Many small implementation details were only understood through the oral traditions of the design team, {{and many of these}} details eventually are irretrievably lost, although some can be rediscovered through the diligent (and expensive) application of software archaeology.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, well! {{one never}} <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> will turn out. I did {{think you were}} wasting your time in reading, and reading, and reading. I didn’t see what good so much book-learning would do you; but if it got you made an officer, {{there is no doubt}} that you were right and I was wrong. But you see, lad, I was never taught any better.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, it’s a nice question. One doesn’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> those <b>things</b> {{are taken}} till after one has done them. Then one’s enlightened.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Kit frowned. [...] "Not altogether, but we'll {{let that}} go. If I am {{to be of}} use, you had better state the trouble plainly. I must <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean {{something}} like that. Now you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are, you must choose your line. I can't judge how far your duty {{to your parents}} binds you; you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he {{observed}} pleasantly, [...] "I am {{out of place}} here. Drop me a line and let me <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> {{are going to the}} Hotel Capitol at Washington." ...|$|E
60|$|HAROLD. Hang you, John! Haven't you {{any human}} sympathy? Don't you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> these <b>things</b> come about? It's like a spark in a straw-yard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} been here three weeks ago, but you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> these <b>things</b> get put off." [...] He coughed again behind his large red hand.|$|R
60|$|All rose respectfully when a {{young man}} in white {{surplice}} and colored hood came in. He had a strong, clean-cut face, and carried himself well, but his manner was quietly reverent. Harding felt that these people from the Old Country <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> should be done, and he had a curious sense of kinship with them. It {{was as if he were}} taking part in something familiar; though this was the first Anglican service he had attended.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Gillian, I {{know you}} can be {{discreet}} when you are warned, and perhaps it is best that you should <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> stand. Do you remember anything about it, Hal?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> {{are going}} up there," [...] mused Dick. [...] "It will be too bad if Josiah Crabtree succeeds in marrying Mrs. Stanhope while we are away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right. I {{choose to}} know about these things; for though my father did make such a con-found-ed will, that's no reason I shouldn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How you blurt it out, Phyl,' said Reginald. 'You do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> those <b>things</b> are managed. Mind, I {{found it}} out all myself. Just say, Marianne. Am not I right?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go out to}} {{the barn}} and see what Wash Bones has to say," [...] {{suggested}} Dave. [...] "He has probably been watching the storm and <b>knows</b> just <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are on the road." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{exhibit is}} the perfect {{workshop}} for young inventors and all the children who always want to <b>know</b> just <b>how</b> <b>things</b> work. Kids can generate electricity, design airplanes and learn all about the fun of engineering.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{look him}} up; ferret him out; tell {{him a bit}} of my mind. I'll thank you to pass the bottle. D---- me doctor; I mean to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are going on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To know what?" [...] {{questioned}} I. [...] "To <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> {{have been}} going on earth and below it: [...] It is clear he must know some day." [...] I thereon asked them why.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must be careful," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "how we stir {{out until}} we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> stand. The {{first thing to}} do is to find out whether the {{regiment}} is still in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you want}} his assistance. It is only natural. You always {{tell me to}} get him to assist you. He spoke most kindly, saying {{that he would like to}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the <b>things</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought I'd let you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the <b>thing's</b> gone," [...] he said. [...] "There's an unholy row there. They've chucked Miller. Saunderson's in by five votes. I'm off back again. Miller's up speaking, tearing mad." ...|$|R
5000|$|In over 60 {{years in}} {{official}} Washington, David Finley mastered the Capital’s twin {{arts of the}} political process and social life. Quiet and soft-spoken with old fashioned Southern courtesy, he had a core of iron and was brilliantly successful in persuading others for the public good. As J. Carter Brown, one of Finley’s successors at the National Gallery of Art and the Commission of Fine Arts and himself an expert in the field, once put it, “If anyone ever <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> get done in Washington, it was David Finley.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Du Lhut, you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> {{should be}} ordered," [...] said the seigneur. [...] "What should you advise my friend to do, {{since he is}} so set upon getting to the English Provinces before the winter comes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't laugh, John," [...] said Lillie, pouting. [...] "You don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> look in fashionable circles. The Follingsbees are in {{the very}} highest circle. They have lived in Paris, and been invited by the Emperor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew it {{from the}} first--I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> turn out for such people as you!" [...] cried the old woman, gazing fondly at Sherringham. [...] "But you don't mean to say you're not coming to-morrow night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be {{sure they}} will--especially after all we did for them on the Lakes," [...] put in Sam. [...] "But let me tell you, I am curious to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> this <b>thing</b> is going to end." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY (with {{the utmost}} goodhumor). My dear Howard, not a bit. Of course you're right: you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> these <b>things</b> {{ought to be}} done. I'll do exactly what you tell me, and confirm {{everything}} you say.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes. You've {{lived in}} cities some, an' <b>know</b> <b>how</b> citified <b>things</b> go. Con-twist it, Ethel, there's {{things in the}} bunch that neither I ner Nick Thorne ever hearn tell of, much less knowin' what they're used for." ...|$|R
