5000|$|The prime {{minister}} can also submit {{a vote of}} confidence of their cabinet to the Sejm. A vote of confidence in the cabinet can be granted by at least half of all of the Sejm's deputies. Similarly, if the council of ministers loses its majority support within the Sejm, the cabinet can be forced to resign in a constructive vote of no confidence. The motion must be approved by at least 46 deputies, and then passed by a majority vote. In such an event, a new {{prime minister}} must be simultaneously appointed. [...] Additionally, the premier must submit the resignation of their cabinet at the first sitting of a newly elected parliament, as well as after a vote of no confidence has been successfully passed against the council of ministers or upon their own <b>individual</b> <b>resignation.</b> In the event of the prime minister's resignation or death, the president can either accept or refuse the cabinet's resignation of office.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 November 1987, Premier Bjelke-Petersen visited Campbell at Government House {{to discuss}} a {{restructuring}} of his ministry. It was Bjelke-Petersen's wish to dissolve his entire ministry and be recommissioned as Premier with a new distribution of ministerial portfolios, however Campbell's advice was for the Premier to seek the <b>individual</b> <b>resignations</b> of those ministers he wanted removed from the ministry. After having approached five ministers about resigning from their offices and being refused by each one, the Premier returned to Campbell on 24 November and requested the termination of the commissions {{of three of the}} five ministers, to which Campbell agreed.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} LCL {{branches}} remained with the LM, {{and there were}} mass resignations from the LCL on the whole. Eastick was relatively unconcerned: the LCL had a massive membership of over 30,000 and the LM's split did little to dent it—Eastick admitted 200 <b>individual</b> <b>resignations.</b> In the meantime, the LCL tried to introduce a requirement for members to make [...] "pledge" [...] {{that they were not}} aligned with [...] "an outside political body". This prompted a second wave of resignations, notably from sections of the Young Liberal Movement. Despite its leader's show of confidence, many in the LCL were concerned that the expulsion of LM elements had apparently backfired; it also prompted some disillusioned parliamentarians to suggest that rural and urban elements in the LCL could not coexist.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} other office of public authority, the office of Prime Minister is {{incompatible}} {{with any other}} office, except that of deputy or senator and is also incompatible with a professional position in a commercial organization. The term of a Prime Minister ends with the <b>individual's</b> <b>resignation,</b> dismissal following a motion of no confidence, loss of electoral rights (following a conviction), incompatibility with the office, death or expiration of the term of the legislature. The Prime Minister, together with the minister tasked with the particular field of government, can sign resolutions and ordinances to take effect as executive orders the moment they are published in the Monitorul Oficial,the official gazette of the Romanian state. Such ordinances must {{be sent to the}} appropriate chamber of Parliament where they are discussed in an urgent manner and they are then sent to the official gazette. In case the noticed chamber does not discuss or approve said ordinance after 30 days of its arrival, the ordinance is officially adopted and published in the Monitor. An emergency ordinance cannot modify a constitutional law, concern the functioning of the fundamental institutions, rights or liberties.|$|R
40|$|From 1990 to present, 14 liver pathologists and 2 {{clinical}} hepatologists from 9 {{countries have}} met annually to hold thematic 2. 5 -day meetings centered on case-based discussion. The goal of these meetings {{has been to}} identify gaps in knowledge in our field and fuel scholarly effort to address these gaps. The founding principles were worldwide representation, good representation of women, compatibility of participants, commitment to stable membership and regular attendance, mutual education and friendship, and free exchange of ideas. A summary report of the 2. 5 -day meeting constituted an enduring document that captured {{the free flow of}} ideas discussed. These ideas were open to all participants for the pursuit of scholarship back at their home institutions. However, any idea borne out of an Elves meeting merits open invitation for other Elves to participate in, using established standards for meaningful coauthorship. Over 26 consecutive meetings (1990 - 2015), themes covered the breadth of liver pathology. With retirement of 2 <b>individuals,</b> <b>resignation</b> of 3, and death of 1, six new members were nominated and voted into membership. Over these same 26 years, active members published 2025 articles indexed in PubMEd Central under the topic “liver;” 3 % of these articles represented collaborations between members. This international group represents a successful model in a subspecialty of anatomic pathology for open exchange of ideas, mutual education, and generation of topics worthy of scholarly investigation. We conclude that a self-selected group of subspecialty pathologists can meet successfully over 26 years, maintain a high state of engagement through each annual meeting, self-renew as a result of retirement or resignation, and provide a creative stimulus for highly productive academic careers...|$|R
40|$|The thesis "The Wölfling Case. Resignation of Leopold Ferdinand of Tuscany {{from the}} Archduke's Position and His Life as an Ordinary Citizen" {{discusses}} the events {{associated with the}} departure of Archduke Leopold Ferdinand (1868 - 1935) from the Habsburg-Lorraine House. The thesis deals with the Imperial Austrian Family Statute, <b>individual</b> cases of <b>resignation</b> {{to the rank of}} Archduke, as well as the issue of violation of family norms in the Habsburg-Lorraine family. The focus is on events surrounding the escape of Archduke Leopold Ferdinand from the court and his subsequent resignation from the Archduke rank. Attention is paid to the cause of this, as well as the dramatic negotiations surrounding his final resignation from the imperial court and family. The thesis also charts the career of the former Archduke (since 1903 Leopold Wölfling) in the position of an ordinary citizen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Government {{ministers in}} Parliamentary democracies are career politi-cians for whom public service is an {{important}} source of motivation. The length of their tenure is controlled by the Prime Minister. We test a simple Principal-Agent model of parliamentary government in which the Prime Minister evaluates her ministers according to information available to her that is related to their perfor-mance. We study the effects of individual and collective ministerial performance on the length of time a minister serves in British government over the period 1945 - 97. We use the number of resignation calls for a minister as an individual performance indicator and the cumulative number of such calls as an indicator of government performance. A minister’s hazard rate increases sharply after the first <b>individual</b> call for <b>resignation</b> and is decreasing in the cumulative number of resignation calls. These results are consistent with the Principal-Agent model and with the use of relative performance evaluation by the Prime Minister. JEL classification: D 72...|$|R

40|$|In the UK stroke is {{the third}} {{most common cause of}} death for women and the {{incidence}} in African Caribbean women is higher than the general population. Stroke burden has major consequences for the physical, mental and social health of African Caribbean women. In order to adjust to life after stroke individuals affected employ a range of strategies which may include personal, religious (church) or spiritual support (i. e. prayer), <b>individual</b> motivation, or <b>resignation</b> to life with a disability. This study explored these areas through the coping mechanisms that African Caribbean women utilised post stroke in the context of stroke recovery and lifestyle modification efforts needed to promote healthy living post stroke. A qualitative approach using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was adopted. Eight women were recruited into the study. Semi structured in-depth interviews were audio recorded and were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a four-stage framework: familiarisation, sense making, developing themes and data refinement and analysis. Three main themes on coping emerged: the need to follow medical rules to manage stroke, strength and determination, and the use of religion and faith to cope with life after stroke. These findings illustrate both a tension between religious beliefs and the medical approach to stroke and highlight the potential benefits that religion and the church can play in stroke recovery. Implications for practice include acknowledgement and inclusion of religion and church based health promotion in post stroke recovery...|$|R
