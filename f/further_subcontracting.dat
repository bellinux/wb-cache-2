5000|$|The M7 Motorway was {{privately funded}} through an {{innovative}} construction contract method {{known as a}} [...] "deed" [...] to facilitate the expedition of the tendering phase; several deeds were drawn up based on the contractors proposals. The deed was for the full design, construction, operation and maintenance of the motorway including more than 40 km of continuously reinforced concrete (CRCP) and asphalt roads, upgrading of local roads, the longest free-flowing (no toll booths) toll road {{in the world at}} the time. More than 90 bridges (of four different types) and the largest shared path network in the southern hemisphere. The design, construct, operate and maintain contract worth at least A$2.0 billion was awarded to WSO (Western Sydney Orbital Pty Ltd) by the Roads & Traffic Authority. The design and construct portion of the contract valued at A$1.8 billion was awarded to a joint venture between ABI Group and Leighton Contractors (ALJV) with design work undertaken by a further joint venture by Maunsell Australia and SMEC (Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation) with <b>further</b> <b>subcontracting</b> to other designers (Arup) and independent verification by Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM). The motorway was opened to traffic in 2005. WSO (commonly known as Westlink) operate the motorway with maintenance subcontracted to Westlink Services and tolling to ROAM. With its opening, Metroad 7 between Liverpool and Beecroft was transferred from Cumberland Highway to Westlink M7. Westlink M7 was the first Sydney motorway to be marked with an alphanumeric shield rather than the hexagonal Metroad shield.|$|E

5000|$|Again, as in (C) above, the {{architect}} and contractor {{work together in}} a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. Again, the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. This time, {{the architect}} leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the contractor might defer to the architect. The architect might bear more risk {{than they do in}} the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor, as outlined in their agreement.An alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project, and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor, who enters into <b>further</b> <b>subcontracts</b> with the trades. This is a difference in form, rather than in substance, because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract. It is the [...] "flip side of the coin" [...] of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect.|$|R
50|$|Location is an {{important}} concept {{in the manner of}} how the Enhanced 9-1-1 system works. Location determination depends upon the Automatic Location Information (ALI) database which is maintained on behalf of local governments by contracted private third parties generally the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC). Often, the contracted 3rd party <b>further</b> <b>subcontracts</b> the actual ALI database management to companies such as Intrado, Bandwidth and TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. The ALI database also feeds the Master Street Address Guide database which is used to route the call to the appropriate PSAP and when the call arrives, the ALI database is queried to determine the location of the caller.The 9-1-1 call arrives at the appropriate PSAP after it is routed across the Public switched telephone network (PSTN) to a special, often dedicated facility, called a Class 4 telephone switch or Tandem Office. The Tandem Office uses a technology referred to as Selective Routing to query the SRDB (Selective Routing Database) and MSAG (Master Street Address Guide) using the originating telephone number as a search key to match the origination of the call to the network location or Emergency Service Number (ESN) of the appropriate PSAP. When the call is delivered to the PSAP, a second query is made to the Automatic Location Information (ALI), again using the originating telephone number as a search key. The ALI record associated with the query is then returned to the PSAP where the Customer-premises equipment (CPE) correlates that information with the call taker receiving the call and displays the information on their computer screen.|$|R

40|$|Debate exists {{about whether}} the {{expansion}} of state-funded universal Pre-K will positively or negatively affect the supply of child care for low-income working families. Limited anecdotal evidence suggests that Pre-K expansion may have unintentional negative effects. Some argue that as Pre-K expands, funds are diverted away from family child care and into center-based programs that are engaged in Pre-K partnerships. Theoretically, such a shift {{would result in a}} decrease in family child care and an increase in center-based care. Alternatively, some suggest that the supply of higher cost center-based care could decline as school-based Pre-K expands. Under such a scenario, the supply of family child care would increase and the supply of child care centers would decrease. This research brief is designed to address this question about the impact of Pre-K expansion on the supply of care. This is done by examining two counties—one that employs a universal Pre-K model that allows centers to participate in state Pre-K, and one county that serves as a comparison. Ohio’s Pre-K Programs Based on data from the National Institute of Early Education Research (NIEER), two statefunded Pre-K programs in Ohio existed during the 2007 - 2008 school year: The Early Childhood Education (ECE) program provides education to 3 - to 4 -year-olds living in low-income families (defined as those living below 200 % of the Federal Poverty Level [FPL]). Participating school districts received funds directly and could subcontract with Head Start programs or private child care centers. The ECE program offered school-day, school year education services to a total number of 6, 092 children at a cost of $ 4, 656 per child. The Early Learning Initiative (ELI) provided free education to 3 - 4 year old children living in low-income families (defined as those living below 185 % of the FPL). Public schools, Head Start programs, as well as private and faithbased child care centers, were eligible to participate in this state-funded program. These agencies could then <b>further</b> <b>subcontract</b> with like agencies or family child care providers. ELI provided full-day, full-year academic services to children living in families with working parents...|$|R

40|$|Subcontracting is {{a choice}} {{strategy}} under which consumers choose an alternative based mainly on recommendations regarding the best alternative(s) and/or critical evaluative criteria. Previously, this strategy has been listed as an alternative means of making important and risky choices with extensive search effort. This study tried to delineate <b>further</b> the <b>subcontracting</b> strategies used as alternatives to own-based choice strategies. Three types of subcontracting were {{the focus of this}} research: decision, dimension, and recommendations-form-standard subcontracting. ^ It was argued that the use of various subcontracting strategies could be influenced by cultural variables (e. g. individualism/collectivism) as well as by task variables (e. g. perceived uncertainty and time pressure). It was hypothesized that both cultural and task variables could influence (1) the likelihood of subcontracting in general, (2) which of the three strategies would be more or less likely to be used, and (3) to whom decisions/dimensions were more or less likely to be subcontracted. ^ Two sets of survey data were collected: one from American students and the other from Korean students. The two data sets represented consumers with individualistic and collectivistic cultural backgrounds. Their cultural characteristics were examined in terms of individualism, self-monitoring, and susceptibility of interpersonal influence. ^ The data revealed that collectivistic Korean students were subcontracting to out-group members (e. g. salespersons and advertisements) to a lesser extent than their individualistic American counterparts. Cross-cultural differences in the use of different types of subcontracting were also found. Implications, limitations, and extensions of these and other major findings were discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} nearly fifty-four years since Ghana nursed {{the dream of}} rapid social and {{economic}} development through science, technology and innovation. Ghana is yet to experience technological transformation {{to the level of}} other countries with which she was at par {{at the time of her}} independence. Gaps in understanding still remain in the Ghanaian experience in the development of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy. As such, a radical reform of the systems to help in the restructuring and transforming the economy is still lacking. In 2010 the government of Ghana developed an STI policy. The aim of this policy is to address all sectors of the economy in order to achieve growth and economic transformation. Analytically, the thesis takes a critical perspective to situate Ghana’s socio-economic and political history in the discourses of the dependency theory framework and to examine how the STI policy at the higher education level in Ghana was formulated and how this had privileged different interests and what the implications are for the country. Mindful of the gaps and historic policy flows, the study took advantage of the researcher’s insider position as an education expert and experience as the government policy developer. With this position and experience, the researcher orientation from the perspectives of policy-makers in Ghana was qualitative research methodology that focused on a case study approach, documentary analysis linked to a critical discourse analysis, observations, semi-structured and informal interviews and the use of a research diary to collect field data. The field data collected for the empirical analysis were documentary data, interview transcripts, interview notes, observation data and field notes. In a constructivist analysis, the interpretive paradigm approach, the notion of triangulation and reflexivity helped not only to privilege the multiple perspectives but to also illuminate the complexity and differences among the participants and other data sources to improve the quality of the data analysis. The research found that in Ghana’s trajectory to modernity through education, the country was marginalised in technology by the advanced capitalist nations to produce low-skilled personnel to be exploited by corporations. <b>Further,</b> the government <b>subcontracted</b> the World Bank and UNCTAD to produce the 2010 STI policy to the neglect of its established institutions. This makes it difficult for the country to pursue an independent reflationary STI policy. Moreover, the documentary analysis of the policy revealed that the government of Ghana had focused mostly on basic education to the detriment of higher education and STI policy to further marginalise the country in technology to produce a low-skilled Ghana to be exploited by corporations. The implication is Ghana to restructure the content of education to build a solid foundation for the development of the STI policy in the country. The study, therefore, provides a solid critique of the country’s economic policy and international commitments that perpetuate a dependent model of development to the neglect of STI policy in Ghana. In the wake of the new STI policy development paradigms, the study suggests the need for a shift in paradigm from poor interactive learning space to rich interactive learning space, an interactionist model approach underpinned by a rich interactive learning space as an analytical tool and a guide for STI policy formation in Ghana...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{extensive}} democratization and decentralization reforms, Indonesia is still experiencing {{high levels of}} violence. Since {{the fall of the}} New Order authoritarian regime (1966 - 1998), violence has been privatized and subcontracted to civilian militia groups attached to political parties, social organizations, and political/financial mafia bosses. The thesis is concerned with analyzing the puzzling dualism of successful transition in view of conventional democracy theory and the persistence of violence. In order to do this, variables in the conventional transition theory to democracy is juxtaposed to relevant arguments in the discussion on violence in Indonesia: Under what circumstances can decentralization of administration impact on the levels of violence? In view of theories on local elites such as bossism and local despotism when can local democratic institutions enhance the dependency on violence by local elites? The thesis is divided into three sections. Firstly, it is argued that one has to view violence in Indonesia in view of selective reading of historical trajectories. Violence must be interpreted in relation to (1) changing continuities of local elite relations from the colonial period, and (2) mobilization and organization of crime and violence since the colonial period through mobilization for the battle for independence, the 1965 - 66 massacres, and the way the New Order regime incorporated and institutionalized these forces into the state apparatus. Secondly, the thesis demonstrates how the current mobilization of violence groups takes place against a backdrop of a kind of institutional democracy in which dominant actors have been able to monopolize the instruments of democracy. Dependency on elected positions to get access to resources has increased the stakes for competitions at the local level. The situation has not, however, led to a kind of Indonesian variety of local bossism which has been the fear amongst many observers. The system of rule in Indonesia is much more fragmented, a point that affects the way the specific manner in which violence is used, and violence groups mobilized and incorporated into a predatory system based on money politics. Violence is <b>further</b> privatized and <b>subcontracted</b> to civilian militias by dominant actors as a means to intimidate opponents as well as displaying symbolic power of mass support and entourage. Thirdly, the thesis demonstrates how the mobilization of civilians into paramilitary groups draws on extensive social forces and a tradition of creating, mobilizing, and incorporating crime as part of politics. It is argued that violence groups, whether as official parts of the structures of political parties, or as affiliated civilian militias (which seems to become increasingly more common) form part of social forces deriving their organizational strength from a long history of civilian violence groups mobilized in relation to various power centers. While these were fostered under the auspices of one patron, Suharto, during the New Order, they are today re-establishing themselves in relation to a fragmented and elusive system of dominance. The thesis has thus demonstrated that democratic reform as it has been interpreted and implemented along the recipe of generalized conventional transition theory and a type of decentralization informed by the neo-liberal agenda of the World Bank, evades these problematic concepts of local elite rule, and the accompanying mobilization of society into a well organized system of violence groups. In view of historical experience, these trajectories may strengthen despotic rule and eventually lead to an escalation of conflict and violence at the local level...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} conducted {{in this thesis}} studies the business risks considered as critical by construction contractors in the public housing construction industry in Hong Kong and the risk management methods adopted by these contractors. There is an inherent weakness in the public housing construction procurement in which price has been the overriding factor in the award of contracts and {{this has led to}} poor quality. A quantitative research method was adopted. The data for analysis included share price of listed construction contractors and other listed companies in Hong Kong. In addition, annual turnover of listed construction contractors from its company reports and available public housing projects to be tendered versus the number of prospective contractors were analysed. A main survey and a supplementary survey were also conducted after a qualitative initial study was launched to find out themes for the questions in the main survey. It is suggested that business risks of construction industry in Hong Kong are high when compared with non-construction business. As a consequence, risk premium from stocks of listed construction contractors should be higher than stocks of non- construction business. It is further suggested that risk premium of stocks of listed public housing construction contractors should be lower than other listed non- residential public buildings construction contractors due to adoption of subcontracting as risk management in the public housing construction industry. All these were being verified using share price, number of available public housing construction projects and company reports. The main survey was conducted to find out the perceptions of the public housing construction contractors on the business risks of its business due to: (a) its client, the Hong Kong Housing Authority, (b) statutory requirements, (c) penalty from poor performance and its ramifications, (d) suppliers and (e) staffing. The main survey also sought public housing construction contractors’ perception on the relative effectiveness of risk management proposals and quality improvement proposals. The supplementary survey looked at reasons for subcontracting in the Hong Kong construction industry. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out initially, which reduced the 47 -item main survey questionnaire to 40 items with 8 factors and the 22 -item supplementary survey to 20 items with 3 factors. In the main survey, for each of the factor identified, t-test of the mean on each of the item and of the summated items under each factor indicated the perceived business risks of public housing construction were: (a) critical due to "client" (the Hong Kong Housing Authority) - 7 critical items out of 9 items; (b) not critical due to "statutory requirements" -none of the 5 items is critical; (c) critical due to "poor performance ramifications" - all 2 items are critical; (d) critical due to "suppliers" - all 4 items are critical; (e) not critical due to "staff' -none of the 4 items is critical. For effectiveness of risk management measures to mitigate business risks due to suppliers and staffing, t-test of the mean was carried out. Risk management methods to mitigate business risks from: (a) "suppliers" were not perceived as effective - 1 effective item out of 3 items; (b) "staffing" were perceived as effective - 5 effective items out of 7 items. For effectiveness of quality improvement proposals, t-test of the mean indicated there were 3 effective items out of 6 items. Overall the quality improvement proposals were perceived as effective. For the supplementary survey to find out reasons for subcontracting in the Hong Kong construction industry, from the subcontractors' point of view, the business practice of main contractors was perceived as critical to the operation of subcontractors (all 7 items). On the other hand, relevant reason for <b>further</b> (secondary) <b>subcontracting</b> from subcontractors was due to lack of expertise (1 item out of 5 items). For quality improvement proposals, 6 items (workers registration, strengthen supervision by contractors on subcontractors, strengthen supervision by client, registry of subcontractor, award contract based on quality and treat subcontractor as business partners) were perceived as effective. Regression was carried out for the main survey and it was found that various statutory requirements were not significant predictors for the extent of pecuniary fines due to violations of statutory requirements. However site safety obligations were found to be a significant predictor to predict the period of suspension from tendering which would be considered as critically affecting the business of the contractor. For the supplementary survey, the regression was centred on relevant reasons for subcontracting (as independent variables) and extent of subcontracting (as dependent variable). The tests indicated that subcontracting to reduce risk of over expansion and price could be significant factors to predict the extent of subcontracting. To supplement what has been proposed as a possible solution (partnering) in improving the adversarial relationship amongst contracting parties in the construction industry, a case study was carried out to see how a local non-government organisation managed an underground transit system construction project by using "partnering". The case study indicated partnering could be useful to improve the inter-organisation co-operation in the construction industry. From the main survey, supplementary survey and the subsequent analysis as well as the case study, the most significant implication of this research is the need to have equitable terms in the contract between clients and its construction contractors. In the competitive public housing construction industry in Hong Kong, award of contract by price alone to the lowest bidder would not induce quality performance from construction contractors. To cater for fluctuating workload and risk of over- expansion, subcontracting is a form of risk management practiced by construction contractors. Subcontracting cannot be stamped out and to induce quality performance from construction contractors and subcontractors, what is essential between clients and construction contractors (equitable terms) is equally applicable between construction contractors and its subcontractors...|$|R
