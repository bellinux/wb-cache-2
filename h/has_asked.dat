Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward Paulie, but when she learns he <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> another girl to the upcoming prom, she angrily confronts him. Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her that she broke his heart.|$|E
5|$|Don't Forget the Bacon! is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Pat Hutchins. It was published by Bodley Head in 1976. The story is about a little boy who tries to memorise a list of groceries his mother <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> him to buy. The book {{has been used as a}} teaching tool to instruct children about early learning concepts.|$|E

5|$|In the flashbacks, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) {{struggles with}} his ex-girlfriend Susan Lloyd (Tamara Taylor), who <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> Michael to sign away his {{paternal}} rights to their son, Walt. Though Michael initially resists, suing {{in order to}} keep his custody, he eventually relents as Susan persuades him to doubt his own motivations and whether he is pursuing his own desires or Walt's best interests.|$|E
5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships. Unless the person <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – {{this would be an}} ethically unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 1915, {{police detective}} Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is {{summoned to the}} siege of a {{decrepit}} manor house in Boston. The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> specifically for Walters to {{come and talk to}} him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with no option but to investigate. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham Asylum, where he stays for six years.|$|E

Mayer AG recalled that the man who bought the ammunition <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for two packages of Kal. 38 Spez ammunition, with each package containing 50 rounds each. The customer <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for ammunition with extra heavy lead bullets, and <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> if the rounds would fit in his Italian Winchester rifles. He had mentioned that he was obtaining the ammunition for someone else.|$|R
5|$|According to Rajmala, {{the temple}} of Chandranath {{received}} considerable endowments from the Twipra Kingdom {{in the time of}} king Dhanya Manikya, who once attempted to remove the lingam from the temple to his kingdom. Poets from across the ages – from Jayadeva (circa 1200AD) to Nabinchandra Sen (1847–1909) – were said to be devoted to the temple. Chandranath is within the jurisdiction of Gobardhan Math, which was founded, according to legends, by Padmacharya, a disciple of Shankaracharya and founder of Vana and Aranya sects of the Dashanami Sampradaya. An International Vedic Conference was held from 15 to 17 February 2007 at Sitakunda Shrine (Tirtha) Estate in Sitakunda Chandranath Dham, {{on the occasion of the}} great Shiva Chaturdarshi (a Hindu festival in worship of Lord Shiva). These temples have been subject to repeated attack and violation by Muslims, and Bangladesh Hindu Bouddha Christian Oikya Parishad <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> for the pilgrims to be protected.|$|E
5|$|Controversy has {{continued}} {{in recent years}} with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for}} the new Bath Bus Station. This was part of the Southgate redevelopment begun in 2007 in which the central 1960s shopping precinct, bus station, and multi-story carpark were demolished and replaced with a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also says that Bath must do more to attract world-class architecture to any new developments.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{college at}} the age of 18 Hsing discovers that 4-Hiroshi Canaval, the teacher of Navigation, <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> her to be placed {{directly}} into the second-year navigation course. Hsing shows an aptitude for the subject, and in her third year chooses to make it her profession. Luis chooses to become a doctor, and their academic separation leads to Hsing and Luis slowly drawing apart from one another. Hsing finds herself attracted to Hiroshi, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Three days after their wedding Hiroshi tells Hsing that the focus of his life's work is not simply navigation, as is generally believed, but concealing a secret {{from the rest of the}} ship. A few years earlier an unexpected gravitational effect led to the ship experiencing a vast acceleration, putting it 40 years ahead of schedule; it is expected to arrive at Hsin Ti Chiu in five years.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s {{some parts of}} Bath were unsympathetically redeveloped, {{resulting}} {{in the loss of}} some 18th- and 19th century buildings. This process was largely halted by a popular campaign which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson's The Sack of Bath. Controversy has revived periodically, most recently with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for a}} new bus station. This is part of the Southgate redevelopment in which an ill-favoured 1960s shopping precinct, bus station and multi-story car park were demolished and replaced by a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of this and other changes, notably plans for abandoned industrial land along the Avon, the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also demands Bath do more to attract world-class architecture in new developments.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E
