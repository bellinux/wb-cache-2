40|$|Seismic stratigraphic {{studies and}} {{scientific}} drilling of the Antarctic continental margin have yielded {{clues to the}} evolution of Cenozoic climates, depositional paleoenvironments and paleoceanographic conditions. This paper draws on studies of the former Antarctic Offshore Stratigraphy Project and others to review the geomorphic and lithostratigraphic offshore features that give insights into the long-duration (m. y.) and short-term (k. y.) changes that document the great variability of Cenozoic Antarctic paleoenvironments. The lithologic <b>drilling</b> <b>record</b> documents non-glacial (pre-early Eocene) to full-glacial (late Pliocene to Holocene) times, and documents times of cyclic ice-sheet fluctuations at k. y. scales (early Miocene to Pliocene and Holocene). Times of significant change in types and/or amounts of glaciation are also seen in the offshore lithologic record (early Oligocene, mid-Miocene, early Pliocene). Seismic data illustrate large-scale geomorphic features that point to massive sediment erosion and dispersal by ice sheets and paleoceanographic processes (e. g. cross-shelf troughs, slope-fans, rise-drifts). The commonality of these features to East and West Antarctica since late Eocene time points to a continent that has been intermittently covered, partially to completely, by glaciers and ice sheets. The greatest advances in our understanding of paleoenvironments and the processes that control them have been achieved from scientific drilling, and future progress depends on a continuation of such drilling. ...|$|E

Prior to excavation, geological condition are studied in order to avoid any potential excessive water ingress or tunnel collapse that may cause fatality. In addition, the prediction aids to upsurge the production and safety of the construction. Techniques on the prediction of ground condition ahead of tunnel face have significantly advanced over the years, there; Tunnel Seismic Prediction (TSP) and probe drilling method. In this study, probe drilling method data is chosen to study the ground condition and rock strength. This paper aims to predict the strength of rock based on the probe <b>drilling</b> <b>record</b> by using statistical method. Parameter studied taken from this probe drilling data is drilling speed. Based on this parameter, k-means clustering is used to cluster the drilling speeds that are possible to occur in relation to the ground condition. The changes of drilling properties observed during the probe drilling provide some indication on the strength of the ground, the presence large of cavities, type of rock and the presence of groundwater.

40|$|A {{circular}} Bouguer gravity anomaly with {{a minimum}} of - 4. 0 mGal and halfamplitude width of 2 km was recognized at Lake Iso-Naakkima (62 ° 11 'N, 27 ° 09 'E), southeastern Finland. The gravity low is associated with subdued aeromagnetic signature and notable airborne and ground electromagnetic anomalies that indicate low bedrock resistivity. The <b>drilling</b> <b>record</b> beneath the recent (Quaternary) glacial sediments, 25 - 40 m thick, reveals a 100 m thick sequence of unmetamorphosed shale, siltstone, quartz sandstone, kaolinitic clay and conglomeratic sandstone that rest on a weathered mica gneiss basement. The upward fining sequence is characterized by red colour, high kaolinite content, and tilted, distorted and brecciated beds. According to the geophysical modelling the diameter of the whole basin is 3 km and that of the sedimentary rocks 2 km, and the depth is 160 m. Shock lamellas in quartz clasts of the basal conglomeratic sandstone, almost omnipresent kink banding in micas of the rocks beneath the basin floor and the occurrence of polymictic dike breccia in the underlying mica gneiss suggest shock metamorphism. It was concluded that the basin originated by a meteorite impact. However, the impact-generated rocks were subsequently eroded before the sedimentation and only minor marks of shock metamorphism were preserved. Lateritic weathering took place prior to deposition of the sediments. Quartz sandstone and siltstone are interpreted as fluvial deposits and the thinly laminated shales as transgressi ve lacustrine or lagoonal deposits. The microfossil assemblage in the shale includes sphaeromorphs of acritarchs from Late Riphean (Neoproterozoic). Postdepositional subsidence of the Iso-Naakkima basin, shown by tilted sediments, preserved the sequence from further erosion...|$|E
40|$|The seismic compressional and {{shear wave}} {{velocities}} have been measured up to 2 kbar confining pressure {{for a large}} collection of basalts and a few gabbros and serpentinized peridotites recovered on DSDP Leg 37. The mean compressiorial velocity for 79 basalts is 5. 94 km/sec. These results and the <b>drilling</b> <b>record</b> explain the low velocity upper crustal layer 2 a sometimes outlined by seismic refrac-tion measurements. In these areas, there is an upper layer of highly fractured low density volcanic material, flow breccia, drained pillows, and perhaps lava tubes with extensive voids and some inter-calated sediments. The results also explain why the refraction velocities for layer 2 are in general so much lower (5. 0 km/sec) and more variable than the velocities of little-weathered sea-floor basalts measured in the laboratory (6. 0 km/sec). The refraction velocity depends {{on the amount of}} fracturing, voids, and sediment and not on a downward change in general rock composition or metamorphic grade. Poisson's ratio for little-weathered basalts is found to decrease systematically with decreasing velocity. The relation predicts a Poisson's ratio of 0. 28 for a layer 2 refraction compressional veloci-ty of 5. 0 km/sec and 0. 24 for a layer 2 a velocity of 2. 8 km/sec in good agreement with the values observed. Poisson's ratio from refraction measurements should distinguish between low velocity fractured basalt and similar velocity sediments since the latter should have high Poisson's ratios. One hole penetrated a complex section of gabbros, serpentinized peridotites, and breccias. The gabbros have a mean velocity of 7. 21 km/sec, appropriate to the upper part of crustal layer 3 (i. e., 3 a) if a small amount of fracturing or low velocity material is present. If the ultramafics in the section were little serpentinized before being brought to near the surface, such a complex {{at the base of the}} crust would explain the basal layer (3 b) that has sometimes been observed by refraction measurements with velocities between those of oceanic layer 3 and the mantle...|$|E

40|$|Seismic data {{acquired}} {{over the}} eastern shelf and {{margin of the}} South Orkney microcontinent, Antarctica, have shown a high-amplitude reflection lying at a sub-bottom two-way traveltime (TWT) of 0. 5 - 0. 8 s. There appear to be two causes for the reflection which apply {{in different parts of}} the shelf. The more widespread cause of the reflection is a break-up unconformity associated with the opening of Jane Basin to the east. This is clearly seen where reflections in the underlying sequence are discordant. In contrast, in Eotvos Basin and the southeastern part of Bouguer Basin, the high-amplitude reflection in places cuts across bedding and is interpreted to be caused by silica diagenesis. A post-cruise analysis of core samples from Site 696 in Eotvos Basin by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the presence of a silica diagenetic front at 520 - 530 mbsf. The position of the unconformity at this site is uncertain, but probably coincides with a change of detrital input near 548 mbsf. Fluctuations of physical properties related to the depth of the diagenetic front are difficult to separate from those related to the variation of detrital composition over the same depth interval. Correlation of the <b>drilling</b> <b>record</b> with the seismic record is difficult but with a synthetic seismogram it is demonstrated that diagenesis is the probable cause of the high-amplitude reflection. In Bouguer Basin at Site 695 the depth of the high-amplitude reflection was not reached by drilling; however, the reflection is probably also caused by silica diagenesis because of the biogenic silica-rich composition of the sediments cored. The estimated temperatures and ages of the sediments at the depths of the high-amplitude reflections at Sites 695 and 696 compare favorably with similar data from other diagenetic fronts of the world. The high-amplitude reflection in Bouguer Basin is commonly of inverse polarity, possibly caused either by interference between reflections from several closely-spaced reflecting layers, such as chert horizons, or by free gas trapped near the diagenetic front...|$|E

5000|$|A {{magnitude}} 6.3 earthquake {{occurred in}} Yogyakarta at ~06:00 local time 27 May 2006, approximately 250 kilometres Southwest of Sidoarjo. It {{has been suggested}} that a small (20 barrel) mud loss occurred in the Banjar Panji-1 well seven minutes after the Yogyakarta earthquake (consistent with the time taken for the earthquake seismic waves to reach the Lusi location), though there is no clear reports of these losses in the drilling data, and it has also been alternatively reported that these losses occurred one hour before the earthquake. The well suffered a complete loss of circulation at 12:50pm local time on the 26th May 2006, which was between 1.5-4.75 hours after three large aftershocks. A loss of circulation happens when drilling mud—necessary for maintenance of wellbore stability—that is pumped down a shaft does not return to the surface but is lost into some opening or a fault system. This mud loss problem was finally stopped when loss circulation material was pumped into the well, a standard practice in drilling an oil and gas well. A day later the well suffered a ‘kick’, an influx of formation fluid into the well bore. The kick was reported by Lapindo Brantas drilling engineers as having been killed within three hours, though alternative interpretations of <b>drilling</b> <b>records,</b> specifically ongoing fluctuations in downhole drillpipe pressure, indicate that the kick continued for at least 24 hours. Early the next day, on 29 May 2006, steam, water and mud began erupting up to 200 meters above the well, a phenomenon that is now known as the Lusi mud volcano. Dense drilling mud and cement were pumped down the Banjar Panji-1 well at various times in the 48 hours after the mud flow started, in an attempt to kill the surface mud eruption. Lapindo Brantas daily <b>drilling</b> <b>records</b> state that [...] "bubbles intensity reduced and elapse time between each bubble is longer" [...] after pumping dense drilling mud down the well, indicating direct communication between Banjar Panji-1 and the Sidoarjo mudflow.

30|$|Water is {{essential}} to the existence of man and all living things. Groundwater occurs almost everywhere beneath the earth surface not only in a single widespread aquifer, but also in thousands of local aquifer systems and compartments that have similar characters. Man’s activities such as food production, nutrition are dependent on water availability in adequate quantities and good quality. Rural communities in Ghana, which form about 56.0 % of the total population, rely mostly on groundwater as the main source of drinking water (Ghana Statistical Service 2002). Groundwater accounts for more than 95 % extraction through drilled wells for hand pumps or mechanized piped systems in Ghana (Washnews 2009). However, the occurrence of metals such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and arsenic (As) in the groundwater reserves in certain areas of the country is a challenge limiting the extent to which this resource can be exploited. <b>Drilling</b> <b>records</b> have shown that on the average, 20 % of wells drilled for domestic water supplies contain high levels of manganese and iron, above the Ghana Standards Board permissible limits of 0 – 0.1  mg/l (manganese) and 0.3  mg/l (iron) in six regions in Ghana namely Ashanti, Western, Central, Eastern, Volta, and Greater Accra (CWSA 2009).|$|R

Porous reservoirs combined with trapping mechanisms, such as updip pinch-outs of strata, enveloping by impermeable strata, diagenetic caps, drape folds, and facies architecture, make the study areas attractive for exploration drilling. Some of the exploration targets were viewed as prospective in the past as at Vera and Unity in western Saskatchewan.

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{sequences of}} the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) shelf contain records {{that have the}} potential to reveal the environmental and ice sheet evolution from pre-glacial to glacial times for a very dynamic sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The currently observed massive loss of continental ice in this region may be a precursor to a partial or full collapse of the WAIS. Deciphering paleoclimate and paleo-ice sheet records from the shelf sediments is therefore a major scientific objective for studying processes of past warm times that can be considered as analogues to the present and future WAIS behavior. In previous work, the seismic stratigraphic model of the shelf was based solely on long-distance jump correlation with seismic records from the Ross Sea shelf. New MeBo 70 seabed drill cores collected in early 2017 from the ASE shelf contain unconsolidated to highly consolidated sediments spanning time periods from the Holocene to Cretaceous.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} recent {{results of}} an investigation on failure mode and wear of rock-bits used to drill geothermal wells located {{in the area of}} Larderello (Italy). A new wear mechanism, conceived from <b>drilling</b> <b>records</b> and dull bit evaluation analysis, has been identified and a particular configuration of rock-bit has been developed and tested in order to reduce drilling costs. The role of high Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) on rock-bit performances seems not yet very well understood: so far, only drillability and formation abrasiveness are generally considered to account for poor drilling performances. In this paper, the detrimental effects of high BHT on sealing and reservoir system of Friction Bearing Rock-bits (FBR) have been investigated, and a new bearing wear pattern for FBR's run in high BHT holes has been identified and further verified via laboratory inspections on dull bits. A novel interpretation of flat worn cutting structure has been derived from the above wear pattern, suggesting the design of a particular bit configuration. Test bits, designed {{in the light of the}} above criteria, have been prepared and field tested successfully. The paper reports the results of these tests, which yielded a new rock-bit application, today considered as a standad practice in Italian geothermal fields. This application suggests that the correct evaluation of rock-bit wear can help to improve the overall drilling performances and to minimize drilling problems through a better interpretation of the relationships amongst rock-bits, formation properties and downhole temperature...|$|R
