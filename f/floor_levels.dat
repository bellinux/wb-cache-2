5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{there are}} three plant <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> and five basement parking levels, with 236 car parking spaces. Construction on the southern car park started in January 1998 and finished in May 2000, and involved {{the construction of the}} deepest wall that had ever been built in Perth. The complex also includes a 10-storey podium building fronting Sherwood Court.|$|E
25|$|The firehouse is {{a three-story}} building, three bays wide by four deep, on a half-acre (2,000 m²) lot in {{downtown}} Tivoli. It is faced in brick laid in English bond with contrasting stone {{courses at the}} <b>floor</b> <b>levels.</b> The hipped slate roof is pierced by a dormer with gabled parapet top, four chimneys and a round turreted tower rising from the southwest corner. The roofline's cornice is broken in front by the dormer.|$|E
50|$|The building's main tenant was Canterbury Television and {{the company}} held the naming rights. CTV {{occupied}} the ground and first <b>floors,</b> <b>Levels</b> 1 & 2. The second <b>floor,</b> <b>Level</b> 3, was not tenanted during the quake. King's Education, an English {{as a second language}} school occupied the third <b>floor,</b> <b>Level</b> 4. The Clinic, a medical clinic, was on the fourth <b>floor,</b> <b>Level</b> 5; and the not-for-profit agency Relationship Services was on the fifth <b>floor,</b> <b>Level</b> 6. A nursing school was also located in the building.|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} construction, {{buildings}} were made where possible of smooth, pale, stone. Columns, pillars and windows fell {{at the same}} base level, and if plastering was done at all, it was kept extremely simple. The sanctuary kept a simple style of proportion of 1:2 at both elevation and <b>floor</b> <b>levels.</b> To maintain the appearance of ecclesiastical buildings, Cistercian sites were constructed in a pure, rational style; and may be counted among the most beautiful relics of the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the {{building}} consist of holes and trenches for {{the placement of the}} pillars and walls that once stood there. Various <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> were discernible, and it was possible to determine that the hof was initially erected in the 3rd century C.E. on the site of an unusually large longhouse, and then rebuilt six times without appreciable changes, the last version of the building dating to the early Viking Age. The building material was in all cases wood, which was also sunk into the ground.|$|E
25|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, the Hofburg was {{transformed}} and renovated in the Baroque style under Empress Maria Theresa (1717–1780). The reconstruction project lasted from 1754 to 1776 and occurred in two phases, {{interrupted by the}} Seven Years' War (1754–1763). The first phase began with the submission of plans in 1754 by Johann Martin Gumpp the Younger, who was commissioned to create new offices in the south wing (along Hofgasse), add a large central staircase, standardize the <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> and room heights, and remove narrow stairs and unnecessary walls to produce comfortable rooms with uniform flooring and evenly-spaced windows.|$|E
30|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>level</b> {{refers to}} the {{absolute}} <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> of an occupant in a building, irrespective of his/her distance to the fire (which would be measured by the hazard proximity factor mentioned above). The current state of research concludes that perceived risk increases with <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> in high-rise buildings. In {{the case of a}} full building evacuation, the <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> in a high-rise building {{was a significant predictor of}} perceived risk during the evacuation from the WTC on September 11, 2001 (the higher the floor, the more perceived risk) in one study but not in another (Sherman et al. 2011; Kuligowski and Mileti 2009). Although future studies should investigate whether the absolute <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> or the position relative to the fire origin (hazard proximity) is more relevant.|$|R

Original transverse structural walls survive at the first <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> {{as well as the}} external walls fronting Ann Street. The southwest section has a higher <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> and the hotel rooms in this section each have bathroom en suite. The northwest end of the first <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> also has hotel rooms with bathroom en suites, and the central corridor opens through to the first <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> of Ruddle's Building adjacent.|$|R
25|$|The story follows an International Peacekeeping Force's White Lightning {{team leader}} Matt Coda, as he {{attempts}} to stop a scientist Dr. Kim from conducting unethical genetic engineering research. As the game progresses, the eponymous Kileak is revealed to be an ancient extraterrestrial creature that is the common ancestor of all life on Earth. The player controls an armored SJ 107 assault suit through the series of <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> within a South Pole observation base. Each floor is connected by an elevator, which the player must find {{in order to proceed}} to the level below. The suit is equipped with various weapons, some of which require the suits battery power to operate.|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} {{wall thickness}} at basement level in many bergfrieds usually decreases significantly {{on the inside}} of the tower at the level of the upper floors. On the resulting wall ledges, wooden ceilings were laid that served to partition the various <b>floor</b> <b>levels.</b> The lowest floor and the uppermost floor are often covered by a stone vault. Occasionally, narrow stairways were incorporated into the masonry to allow a single person to climb the tower. More often, however, the floors were connected by wooden stairs or ladders. Some bergfrieds had limited living space, and even small fireplaces may be found in the upper floors. These heated rooms were usually used by the watchmen.|$|E
25|$|The Medical Treatment and Care Building {{included}} a basement level that was exposed (above grade) {{on the east}} and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade {{on the north side}} of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used slip joint technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including ceiling tiles, telephone equipment, and elevator doors) was described as excessive at the basement and first <b>floor</b> <b>levels,</b> with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building was leaning to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed, with ticket {{barriers}} {{on the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> and the platforms on the second <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b> The platforms are approximately 85 m long, able to handle four-car local trains.|$|R
50|$|At {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> the {{building}} has four engaged Doric columns above the granite plinth and flanking the three entrance doorways. Over these is an entablature that has balustraded balconies to the first <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
50|$|The two lateral {{parts of}} the {{building}} extend symmetrically from the central body. They are on two levels, with seven arches at ground <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> and many windows (similar {{to those of the}} central body) at first <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
25|$|The building’s {{interior}} is distributed across three floors: a basement floor, {{which includes the}} kitchen, pantry and service areas; a ground floor including all the living rooms, dining rooms, atriums and library; and a first-floor which corresponds to the private quarters. Visitors entering the Villa through the main entrance from the street, that is relatively dark, will gain their first impression of the building’s structure and {{its relationship with the}} garden, from the impressive two-storey central hall. Looking in front, through the vast exterior window, they will see the central parterre and park. Looking to the right, they will see the vast salon which extends via the window to the lateral parterre. The Villa’s private quarters can be sensed rather than seen, via the first floor gallery around the central atrium. To the left, with a slight difference of <b>floor</b> <b>levels,</b> there is an elegant dining room that overlooks the garden and a billiards room, on the other side, that looks over the street. Beyond them we see a wrought iron gate designed by Edgar Brandt, which separates this social zone from the Villa’s private quarters on the first floor and also the library and service areas on the ground floor.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Dark Forces was {{commonly}} called a [...] "Doom clone," [...] {{but the game}} makes significant expansions upon the gameplay features present in Doom. New gameplay mechanisms that were not common {{at the time of}} release include the ability to look up and down, duck, jump, and swim. The use of multiple <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> is another technical advance in the first-person shooter genre. To produce these new features, the developers wrote a game engine from scratch. The Jedi game engine can create gameplay and graphical elements such as fully 3D objects, atmospheric effects such as fog and haze, animated textures and shading. Stinnett indicated that the developers wanted these elements to be part of an [...] "active environment," [...] and features were included to create this: [...] "ships come and go at the flight decks, rivers sweep along, platforms and conveyor belts move and much of the machinery functions." ...|$|E
500|$|On the hotel's {{top floor}} was the roof-garden, {{enclosed}} {{on all sides}} by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale-green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric. On the roof on the 34th Street side was the grand promenade, , on solid footing high in the air, with a band stand, fountains, and trellises of columns. The roof garden restaurant occupied a space , and was roofed in. The ceiling was [...] high. At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers, with spiral stairways within, {{leading up to the}} copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were [...] above the sidewalk. The palm gardens, used as cafes, rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terracotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, the <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> {{features}} {{three separate}} private club lounges for access from court-side seat holders and floor seat concert goers. Lexus Lounge and Woodforest Club {{are on the}} west side of the <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> and the Platinum Lounge is located on the east side of the <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b> [...] All feature upscale amenities including multiple flat screen televisions, private bar, restrooms, and plush seating. The Lexus Lounge has its own pool tables and all three court-side lounges feature numerous private court-side suites.|$|R

2500|$|In 1808–09 Soane {{constructed}} {{his drawing}} office and [...] "museum" [...] {{on the site}} of the former stable block at the back, using primarily top lighting. In 1812 he rebuilt the front part of the site, adding a projecting Portland Stone facade to the basement, ground and first <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> and the centre bay of the second floor. Originally this formed three open loggias, but Soane glazed the arches during his lifetime. Once he had moved into No. 13, Soane rented out his former home at No. 12 (on his death it was left to the nation along with No. 13, the intention being that the rental income would fund the running of the Museum).|$|E
2500|$|The {{tower is}} in {{perpendicular}} style, in three exterior visual stages separated by stringing. On different levels it has three interior floors {{consisting of the}} vestry and its loft at the bottom, then a clock chamber whose floor is roughly level with the nave ceiling, and a bell chamber on the top floor. The bottom and middle <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> are indistinguishable from the outside, because the diagonal buttresses run up the bottom two stages {{and half of the}} top stage, and there is exterior stringing halfway up the bottom floor but not between the bottom and middle floors. However, stringing on the exterior identifies the floor level of the bell stage. The interior chambers of the tower appear tiny because of the space taken by the spiral staircase inside its south wall. The church's ribbed west door, in a [...] "segmental-pointed" [...] arch with [...] "broad chamfer" [...] is in the lower exterior stage. The three-light window above is included in the exterior second stage with the spiral staircase windows and the blue clock faces. The three-light window is hidden in the interior, being inaccessible in the vestry loft. The third stage has double, uncusped, round-headed bell-openings on all four sides, and an embattled parapet. The tower is floodlit at night.|$|E
2500|$|Site {{preparation}} {{began in}} late 2013 with the clearing {{of the site}} and demolition of an existing parking garage, with foundation work beginning in June 2014, when California-based Tutor Perini was awarded the US$255 million contract as the main contractor. As of January 2015 the construction {{was said to be}} ahead of schedule. The continuous concrete pour for the approximately 14,000 cubic yard (...) raft slab required hundreds of cement trucks operating for over 24 hours from numerous factories. The approximately [...] pour took place over a weekend in late March 2015 {{and was one of the}} largest continuous pours in Florida history. The project received a US$340 million construction loan from Wells Fargo in 2015, with construction well underway. By October 2015, construction was up to the top of the 19-story pedestal. In January 2016, the building received a temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) for the lower 11 floors of the parking garage. Users of the existing buildings had been using off-site parking in the interim. Over [...] of the project was structurally completed, and the building was still on schedule for completion in late 2017. During the first half of 2016 a height increase to [...] was approved; this may affect the floor count, which was at least 81 actual floors at the [...] level. Other than the Renaissance Center in Detroit and Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta, both hotels, it would be the only building over [...] to stick to a total floor-to-floor height of no more than [...] Hotels, parking garages, and condos generally have much less floor-to-floor height than high-rise office towers. However, very few towers of any kind over 50 floors keep to an overall height under [...] per floor, due to increased ceiling heights or the need for mechanical <b>floor</b> <b>levels,</b> rooftop HVAC, housing for the tops of elevator shafts, spire details, or other infrastructure. It is unclear whether the floor count will remain at 82, or increase to 85 due to the height increase. DeSimone Consulting Engineers is serving as structural engineer on the project. The firm has designed numerous supertall towers and skyscrapers worldwide, and frequently works with top architects and developers on marquee projects globally.|$|E
