50|$|The {{most common}} {{adverse effects of}} Captopril, skin rash and loss of taste, {{are the same as}} caused by mercapto-containing penicillamine. Therefore, a group of {{researchers}} aimed at finding potent, selective ACE inhibitors that wouldn’t contain a mercapto (SH) function and would have a weaker chelating function. They returned to work with carboxyl compounds and started working with substituted N-carboxymethyl-dipeptides as a general structure (R-CHCOOH-A1-A2). According to previous research they assumed that cyclic imino acids would result in good potency if substituted on the carboxyl terminus of the dipeptide. Therefore, substituting A2 with proline gave good results. They also noted that according to the enzyme’s specificity imino acids in the position next to the carboxyl terminus would not give a potent compound. Also noticeable is that by substituting R and A1 groups with hydrophobic and basic residues would give a potent compound. By substituting -NH in the general structure resulted in loss of potency which is consistent to the enzyme’s need for a -NH in corresponding position on the substrates. The results were 2 active inhibitors: <b>Enalaprilat</b> and Lisinopril. These compounds both have phenylalanine in R position which occupies the S1 groove in the enzyme. The result was thus these two new, potent tripeptide analogues with zinc-coordinating carboxyl group: <b>Enalaprilat</b> and Lisinopril.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the effects of <b>enalaprilat</b> on reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity. Background. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decrease mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. Their efficacy appears to be related importantly to antiadrenergic effects, the mechanism for which has not been determined. Because baroreflexes tonically inhibit sympathetic outflow, and baroreflexes are blunted in heart failure, we hypothesized that these agents reduce sympathetic activity by augmenting baroreflexes. Methods. We assessed baroreflex control sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in patients with congestive heart failure and in control subjects before and after <b>enalaprilat</b> (0. 02 mg/kg body weight intravenously). Arterial baroreflexes were perturbed by bolus administration of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Cardiopulmonary baroreflexes were perturbed by lower body negative pressure and head-down tilt. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded by microneurography. Results. <b>Enalaprilat</b> decreased systolic blood pressure in patients with heart failure and control subjects. Sympathetic nerve activity increased in control subjects but decreased in patients with heart failure after <b>enalaprilat</b> despite reductions in central venous pressure in this group. Baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was unchanged by <b>enalaprilat</b> in control subjects. In patients with heart failure, both arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was enhanced by <b>enalaprilat.</b> Baroreflex control of heart rate was unchanged by <b>enalaprilat</b> in either group. Conclusions. <b>Enalaprilat</b> augments both arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of sympathetic activity in heart failure. These augmented inhibitory influences are associated with a reduction in sympathetic outflow and may contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure...|$|E
30|$|<b>Enalaprilat</b> is an {{intravenous}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor {{that reduces}} peripheral arterial vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin II. Its final antihypertensive effect is {{highly dependent on}} the patient’s volume status and plasma renin activity [39]. Hence, in normo- or hypervolemic patients without increased angiotensin II levels, <b>enalaprilat</b> will not cause major hypotension. Conversely, in hypovolemic subjects with high angiotensin II levels, the antihypertensive effect can be significant [39]. <b>Enalaprilat</b> may be considered in severe hypertension associated with heart failure. Because of its unpredictable effects, long half-life, and risk of excessive hypotensive response (especially in hypovolemic hyperreninemic patients), it is not considered as a first-line agent {{for the treatment of}} acute hypertension. <b>Enalaprilat</b> is contraindicated in pregnancy [40].|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enalapril (10 mg orally) and its active metabolite, <b>enalaprilat</b> (10 mg intravenously) {{were studied}} in nine young healthy volunteers aged 22 - 30 years and nine sex matched elderly subjects aged 65 - 73 years. After both drugs, a biexponential curve was fitted {{to the decline}} in plasma <b>enalaprilat</b> concentration.

The relationship between plasma <b>enalaprilat</b> concentrations and percentage ACE inhibition, using the Hill equation, showed no difference in the sensitivity to ACE inhibition between the young and the elderly group.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} the influence of intracoronary <b>enalaprilat</b> on coronary microvascular function and peri-procedural outcome measures in patients with stable angina undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundIntracoronary angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors {{have been shown to}} relieve myocardial ischemia in stable patients and to improve epicardial flow in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Yet, it is still unclear whether these effects are mediated by a modulation of the coronary microcirculation. MethodsWe randomly assigned 40 patients to receive either an intracoronary bolus of <b>enalaprilat</b> (50 μg) or placebo before elective PCI. The index of microvascular resistance was measured at baseline, 10 minutes after study drug administration, and after PCI. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was measured as a marker of myocardial injury. ResultsInfusion of <b>enalaprilat</b> resulted in a significant reduction in index of microvascular resistance (27 ± 11 at baseline vs. 19 ± 9 after drug vs. 15 ± 8 after PCI), whereas a significant post-procedural increase in index of microvascular resistance levels was observed in the placebo group (24 ± 15 at baseline vs. 24 ± 15 after drug vs. 33 ± 19 after PCI). Index of microvascular resistance levels after PCI were significantly lower in the <b>enalaprilat</b> group (p < 0. 001). Patients pre-treated with <b>enalaprilat</b> also showed lower peak values (mean: 21. 7 ng/ml, range: 8. 2 to 34. 8 ng/ml vs. mean: 32. 3 ng/ml, range: 12. 6 to 65. 2 ng/ml, p = 0. 048) and peri-procedural increases of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (mean: 9. 9 ng/ml, range: 2. 7 to 19. 0 ng/ml vs. mean: 26. 6 ng/ml, range: 6. 3 to 60. 5 ng/ml, p = 0. 025).

40|$|Functional {{recordings}} of smooth muscle tension and biochemical experiments on membrane fractions {{were performed to}} characterize angiotensin II (AII) formation in human isolated bladder smooth muscle. A novel human chymase inhibitor CH 5450 (Z-Ile-Glu-Pro-Phe-CO 2 Me) and a recently developed human chymase substrate Pro 11 -,D-Ala 12) -angiotensin I, claimed to be resistant to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and carboxypeptidase, were used. Angiotensin I (AI) (0. 3 [*]μM) induced a contractile response amounting to 58 ± 5 % (n= 12) of the initial K+ (124 [*]mM) -induced contractions. This response was reduced to 36 ± 3 % (n= 8) by the ACE-inhibitor <b>enalaprilat</b> (10 [*]μM), while pretreatment with soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI 200 [*]μg ml− 1) or CH 5450 (10 [*]μM) had no effect. However, the combination of <b>enalaprilat</b> and STI reduced the AI-induced contractions to 19 ± 5 % (n= 6), and the combination of <b>enalaprilat</b> and CH 5450 caused an almost complete inhibition of the AI-induced contractions to 1 ± 1 % (n= 6). The substrate (Pro 11 -,D-Ala 12) -AI (3 [*]μM) produced contractions which amounted to 57 ± 4 % (n= 13) of the initial K+ (124 [*]mM) contractions. These contractions were not affected by <b>enalaprilat</b> (10 [*]μM). On the other hand, STI (200 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) and CH 5450 (10 [*]μM) added separately, depressed the (Pro 11 -,D-Ala 12) -AI-induced contractions to 34 ± 5 % (n= 6) and 24 ± 4 % (n= 6), respectively. The combination of <b>enalaprilat</b> and STI or <b>enalaprilat</b> and CH 5450 did not produce any further inhibition.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to establish the effect of intravenous administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg), potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, on hemodynamic parametrs after intravenous administration of propranolol (0. 3 mg/kg) and <b>enalaprilat</b> (0. 5 mg/kg) in rabbits. The following parameters were estimated: mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Blood pressure was measured directly in the carotid artery, heart rate was counted according to ECG, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were calculated using the method of human # J albumin dilution. For statistical analysis, the average change in the examined parametres was calculated. Indomethacin significantly increased mean arterial pressure without altering other hemodynamic parameters. Combined intravenous administration of indomethacin with <b>enalaprilat</b> or propranolol abolished hypotensive effect of both drugs. Indomethacin magnified the effect of propranolol on total peripheral resistance and abolished the effect of <b>enalaprilat</b> on this parameter. Co-administration of indomethacin with propranolol or <b>enalaprilat</b> did not influence significantly heart rate and cardiac output in comparison with the effect of both antihypertensive drugs alone.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate beta-adrenergic contractility in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) through nitric oxide (NO) myocardial signaling. BACKGROUNDThe ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin, an agonist of NO synthase (NOS). Nitric oxide inhibits beta-adrenergic myocardial contractility in patients with heart failure. METHODSThe study patients were given the angiotensin- 1 (AT- 1) receptor antagonist losartan for one week. The hemodynamic responses to intravenous dobutamine were determined before and during intracoronary infusion of <b>enalaprilat</b> (0. 2 mg/min) with and without the NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 5 mg/min). RESULTSIn patients with DCM (n = 8), dobutamine increased the peak rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dt) by 49 ± 8 % (p < 0. 001) and ventricular elastance (Ees) by 53 ± 16 % (p < 0. 03). Co-infusion with <b>enalaprilat</b> decreased +dP/dt to 26 ± 12 % and Eesto − 2 ± 17 % above baseline (p < 0. 05), and this anti-adrenergic effect was reversed by L-NMMA co-infusion (p < 0. 05 vs. <b>enalaprilat).</b> In addition, intracoronary <b>enalaprilat</b> reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), but not left ventricular end-diastolic volume, consistent with increased left ventricular distensibility. Infusion with L-NMMA before <b>enalaprilat</b> in patients with DCM (n = 5) prevented the reduction in +dP/dt, Eesand LVEDP. In patients with normal left ventricular function (n = 5), <b>enalaprilat</b> did not inhibit contractility or reduce LVEDP during dobutamine infusion. CONCLUSIONSEnalaprilat attenuates beta-adrenergic contractility and enhances left ventricular distensibility in patients with DCM, but not in subjects with normal left ventricular function. This response is NO modulated and occurs {{in the presence of}} angiotensin receptor blockade. These findings may have important clinical and pharmacologic implications for the use of ACE inhibitors, AT- 1 receptor antagonists and their combination in the treatment of heart failure...|$|E

The frequency of target blood pressure (BP) achievement, BP and heart rate dynamics, as well as safety of treatment were evaluated in groups during 6 hours. Results. The frequency of target BP achievement in the urapidil treatment group was higher than this in <b>enalaprilat</b> group (96. 7 vs 73. 3 %; p< 0. 001), for the first hour systolic BP (SBP) in the urapidil group reduced from 210. 5 ± 13. 6 to 157. 8 ± 8. 3 mmHg (p< 0. 05), and diastolic BP (DBP) - from 115. 7 ± 8. 5 to 86. 9 ± 9. 1 mmHg (p< 0. 05).

Thereafter, two interventions were performed: fluid infusion (normal saline, 32 mL/kg over 30 min) and <b>enalaprilat</b> infusion (0. 02 mg kg- 1 min- 1 for 60 min) in randomized groups. The following groups were studied: controls (fluid infusion, N = 4), E 1 (<b>enalaprilat</b> infusion followed by fluid infusion, N = 5) and E 2 (fluid infusion followed by <b>enalaprilat</b> infusion, N = 5). All animals were observed for a 120 min after bacterial infusion. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output (CO), portal vein blood flow (PVBF), systemic and regional oxygen-derived variables, and lactate levels were measured. Rapid and progressive reductions in CO and PVBF were induced by the infusion of live bacteria, while minor changes were observed in mean arterial pressure. Systemic and regional territories showed a significant increase in oxygen extraction and lactate levels. Widening venous-arterial and portal-arterial pCO 2 gradients were also detected. Fluid replacement promoted transient benefits in CO and PVBF. <b>Enalaprilat</b> after fluid resuscitation did not affect systemic or regional hemodynamic variables.

40|$|Systemic and {{coronary}} hemodynamic, metabolic and humoral {{effects of}} a new intravenous angiotensin-convert-ing enzyme inhibitor, <b>enalaprilat,</b> were evaluated in 14 patients with chronic heart failure. Onset of hemodynamic action occurred within 15 minutes and persisted for 6 hours. At the time of peak effect, {{there was a significant}} reduction in mean arterial pressure (− 21 %) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (− 33 %). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 32 % and stroke volume index increased by 20 %. These systemic hemodynamic changes indicate improved left ventricular function. There was a substantial sustained reduction in rate-pressure product initially without a change in coronary sinus blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption. There was also reduced myocardial oxygen extraction and augmented coronary sinus oxygen saturation at 30 minutes and 1 hour. In three patients, abnormal myocardial lactate extraction, present before enalapri-lat, changed to uptake after <b>enalaprilat,</b> indicating amelioration of myocardial ischemia that was not clinically manifest. Systemic catecholamine levels and myocardial catecholamine balance did not change. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma aldosterone decreased. These findings suggest that <b>enalaprilat</b> produces inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and consequent beneficial systemic hemodynamic changes in heart failure. In some patients with heart failure, silent myocardial ischemia at rest can occur and can be alleviated with <b>enalaprilat.</b> Decreased myocardial oxygen extraction, increased coronary sinus oxygen saturation and lack of expected decrease in coronary sinus blood flow despite reduced rate-pressure product suggest transient coronary vasodilation by <b>enalaprilat...</b>|$|E

Over the first 8 [*]h of infusion, both <b>enalaprilat</b> and MDL 100, 240 had significant antihypertensive effects, accompanied by similar regional vasodilatations. However, the blood pressure lowering effect of MDL 100, 240 (− 54 [*]±[*] 9 [*]mmHg) was {{greater than that of}} <b>enalaprilat</b> (− 38 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mmHg), because the former caused a significantly greater reduction in cardiac index. Between 8 – 24 [*]h after the onset of infusion, there was a reduction in the effect of <b>enalaprilat</b> on blood pressure, because cardiac index rose, with no further increase in total peripheral conductance. In contrast, the antihypertensive effect of MDL 100, 240 persisted, in spite of a recovery in cardiac index, because there was further vasodilatation, particularly in the mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. There were no apparent haemodynamic changes associated with the injection of Hoe[*] 140, and over the following 8 [*]h, the difference between the haemodynamic effects of <b>enalaprilat</b> and MDL 100, 240 persisted; there was little evidence of suppression of the effects of either drug. These results are more consistent with the antihypertensive effects of <b>enalaprilat</b> or MDL 100, 240 in transgenic ((mRen- 2) 27) rats being due to suppression of angiotensin II production, than due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. The additional effects of MDL 100, 240 may be accounted for by inhibition of the degradation of natriuretic peptides reducing cardiac output, initially, and decreasing vascular tone, subsequently. Alternatively, the additional increase in vascular conductance following treatment with MDL 100, 240 may represent an autoregulatory response to the reduced pressure...|$|E

To differentiate blood pressure and renal effects in the initial antiproteinuric response, the placebo-controlled acute effects of the ACE inhibitor <b>enalaprilat</b> (10 mg i. v.) on blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and proteinuria were {{compared with those of}} nitroprusside in nine patients with non-diabetic proteinuria. In addition, we studied whether an exogenous angiotensin II infusion reverse the initial enalaprilat-induced antiproteinuric response. <b>Enalaprilat</b> and nitroprusside reduced MAP by - 11. 3 +/- 2. 4 % and - 14. 1 +/- 2. 3 %, respectively, whereas only <b>enalaprilat</b> showed renal hemodynamic effects, reflected by an increase in ERPF of 18. 4 +/- 5. 4 % and a decrease in FF of - 17. 1 +/- 2. 6 %. Despite the contrasting renal hemodynamic profiles, <b>enalaprilat</b> (- 10. 6 +/- 4. 8 %) and nitroprusside (- 12. 8 +/- 5. 1 %) equally decreased proteinuria.

40|$|Arterial plasma kinins {{and mean}} {{arterial}} pressure were measured in intact and bilaterally nephrectomized rats infused with vehicle or bradykinin to study the role of 1) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and other peptidases and 2) the kidney (a kininase-rich organ) in the metabolism of kinins in vivo. Before the infusion, rats were pretreated with vehicle, <b>enalaprilat</b> (an ACE inhibitor), or a cocktail of kininase inhibitors containing 1) <b>enalaprilat,</b> 2) DL- 2 -mercaptomethyl- 3 -guanidinoethyl-thiopropanoic acid (MGTA), a carboxypeptidase N inhib-itor, 3) phosphoramidon, a neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 inhibitor, and 4) bestatin, an aminopeptidase B inhibitor. In the rats with vehicle (n= 8), the cocktail did not significantly increase endogenous kinins (from 31 ± 6 to 41 ± 9 pg/ml, p= 0. 94). In the rats infused with bradykinin (peptidase substrate), plasma kinins increased threefold in the group pretreated with the vehicle, 21 -fold in the <b>enalaprilat</b> group, and 22 -fold in the cocktail group. These increases were doubled by nephrectomy but were not affected by ureteral ligation. In the groups pretreated with the cocktail or <b>enalaprilat,</b> the hypotensive effect of bradykinin was correlated with plasma kinin concentration (r= 0. 75, p< 0. 001).

40|$|We studied {{effects of}} <b>enalaprilat</b> and L- 158, 809, an {{angiotensin}} II type- 1 receptor antagonist, on left ventricular (LV) diastolic relaxation in 11 normal control dogs and 16 LV hypertrophied (LVH) dogs with perinephritic hypertension. At baseline, LV systolic and end-diastolic pressures and end-systolic elastance were {{increased in the}} LVH group (all P < 0. 01 vs. the control group). LV relaxation time constant was also prolonged (P < 0. 01), suggesting impaired LV diastolic relaxation in this model of LVH. Before and after the administration of <b>enalaprilat</b> (0. 25 mg/kg) and L- 158, 809 (0. 30 mg/kg), LV relaxation was assessed {{over a wide range}} of LV loading conditions during vena caval occlusion. LV relaxation time constant was insensitive to load reduction in the control group, which was not affected by <b>enalaprilat</b> or L- 158, 809. In contrast, LV unloading caused a significant prolongation of the relaxation time constant in the LVH group. This load-sensitive LV relaxation abnormality was significantly improved by <b>enalaprilat</b> or L- 158, 809. These results support the concept that angiotensin II is involved in the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction in pressure-overloaded LVH and also suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type- 1 receptor antagonists are potentially beneficial in the treatment of the hypertrophied heart...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} the effect of low dose aspirin on cardiorenal and neurohumoral function and on the acute hemodynamic response to <b>enalaprilat</b> in a canine model of heart failure. Background. Low dose aspirin is frequently prescribed for patients with systolic dysfunction who also benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Although high doses of potent cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors cause fluid retention and vasoconstriction and antagonize the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the effects of low dose aspirin in heart failure are unknown. Methods. A model of heart failure was produced in 11 mongrel dogs by rapid ventricular pacing (250 beats/min for 12 to 14 days). Five dogs received 325 mg aspirin/day for the final 4 days of pacing before the acute experiment; six control dogs received no aspirin. Cardiorenal and neurohumoral function was measured during chloralose anesthesia. Hemodynamic and renal responses to <b>enalaprilat</b> were assessed. Results. Both groups demonstrated severe heart failure with decreased cardiac output; increased atrial pressures and systemic resistance; activation of plasma renin activity, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic factor; and sodium retention. Low dose aspirin had no detrimental effect on cardiorenal or neurohumoral function. Mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased to a similar degree with <b>enalaprilat</b> in both groups. There {{was no difference between}} the groups with respect to renal response to <b>enalaprilat.</b> Conclusions. The present study demonstrates that low dose aspirin has no adverse effect on hemodynamic, neurohumoral or renal function in heart failure. Furthermore, aspirin has no adverse effect on the acute response to <b>enalaprilat.</b> These findings suggest that there is no contraindication to concomitant treatment with low dose aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in humans with heart failure...|$|E
