5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Jet Belt" [...] used a small {{turbofan}} engine which was mounted vertically, with its air intake downward. Intake air {{was divided into}} two flows. One flow went into the combustion chamber, the other flow bypassed the engine, then mixed with the hot turbine gases, cooling them and protecting the pilot from the high temperatures generated. In {{the upper part of}} the engine the exhaust was divided and entered two pipes which led to <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The construction of the nozzles made it possible to move the jet to any side. Kerosene fuel was stored in tanks beside the engine. Control of the turbojet pack was similar to the rocket pack, but the pilot could not tilt the entire engine. Maneuvering was by deflecting the nozzles. By inclining levers, the pilot could move the jets of both nozzles forward, back, or sideways. The pilot rotated left/right by turning the left handle. The right handle governed the engine thrust. The jet engine was started with the aid of a powder cartridge. While testing this starter, a mobile starter on a special cart was used. There were instruments to control the power of the engine, and a portable radio to connect and transmit telemetry data to ground-based engineers. On top of the pack was a standard auxiliary landing parachute; it was effective only when opened at altitudes above [...] This engine was later the basis for the propulsion units of Tomahawk and other cruise missiles.|$|E

Slot <b>Jet</b> Reattachment (SJR) <b>nozzle</b> is an extension of hics. the Radial Jet Reattachment (RJR) concept used to provide high heat and mass transfer while allowing for the control of flow exerted force on the reattachment surface.

The drying characteristics of the SJR nozzle, using air, with four exit angles on a paper sample were studied for three Reynolds numbers, three temperatures and two dry basis initial moisture contents (DBMC). A correlation to predict drying rate and moisture content was also developed. A comparison of the average drying rates showed that the + 45 [] and + 20 [] SJR nozzles performed better than the [] and the - 1 [] SJR nozzles respectively.
