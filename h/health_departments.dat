5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E

25|$|Drinking {{water quality}} is {{monitored}} by the public <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> of municipalities and counties (Landkreise).

25|$|Public Health Emergency Preparedness {{initiatives}} are {{managed by the}} CDC via the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Funds aim to support communities in preparing for public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. Also managed by the CDC, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) consists of bulk quantities of medicines and supplies for use during such emergencies. Antiviral stockpiles prepare for shortages of antiviral medications in cases of public health emergencies. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, guidelines for SNS use by local <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning. For example, local <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance {{on the use of}} the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.|$|E

25|$|Guidelines {{regarding}} viral diagnoses {{and treatments}} change frequently and limit quality care.

Furthermore, in local <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> (LHDs) {{with access to}} antivirals, guidelines may be unclear, causing delays in treatment. With time-sensitive therapies, delays could lead to lack of treatment.|$|E

50|$|With the City of Detroit's {{declaration}} of bankruptcy in December 2013, these minimal services were also removed from the Detroit <b>Health</b> <b>Department.</b> During this year Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) transferred this grant to IPH due to the observation that the Detroit <b>Health</b> <b>Department</b> {{would no longer be}} able to manage this program because all of its public health services were being phased out, and tuberculosis services were also transferred to IPH. On December 13, 2013 Birth and Death Records, one of the largest and oldest operations within the Detroit <b>Health</b> <b>Department,</b> was permanently closed and this service was transferred over to the Wayne County Clerk's Office. With the outsourcing of nearly all of its services, the Detroit <b>Health</b> <b>Department</b> became the first U.S. major city to convert its <b>health</b> <b>department</b> to a private institute.|$|R

25|$|As a {{successor}} to the HSEES program, ATSDR launched the National Toxic Substance Incidents Program (NTSIP) in 2009. One aspect of NTSIP is a national database of information related to chemical spills. NTSIP also has Assessment of Chemical Exposure teams to assist state and local <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> {{in the aftermath of}} toxic spills. These teams interview people who were exposed to the hazardous substances and collect samples to test the level of contamination in the environment and in people.|$|E
25|$|A {{major focus}} of the work ATSDR does {{involves}} interacting with communities. ATSDR often establishes partnerships with state and local <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> to assist them with their public health duties. In 2008, ATSDR had cooperative agreements with 29 states and one tribal government, providing technical assistance to help those partners address local environmental health concerns. ATSDR also creates community assistance panels to solicit feedback and community health concerns from local residents when the agency works at sites to evaluate health effects resulting from exposure to toxic substances.|$|E

25|$|By {{understanding}} {{psychological factors}} that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) {{to take advantage of}} the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in public <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> working on large-scale behavior change and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct research.|$|E
25|$|ATSDR has a {{computational}} toxicology laboratory that conducts research and modeling {{on the effects}} of toxic substances on human health. The agency's toxicology work involves pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship methods, and benchmark dose modeling, as well as establishing minimal risk levels for human exposure to hazardous substances. One model developed by the toxicology laboratory showed that children were much more susceptible than adults to chemical exposure from inhalation and oral exposure. In the aftermath of chemical spills and emergencies, the laboratory also conducts research for state and local <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> on the health effects of the chemicals involved.|$|E
25|$|Anti-smoking groups, {{particularly}} cancer charities, {{along with}} many government <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> have attempted to counter the advertising of tobacco by creating their own advertisements to highlight {{the negative effects of}} smoking. The earliest commercials mainly focused on aiding smoking cessation, the increased risk of lung cancer and the problems associated with passive smoking. However, they have become increasingly hard-hitting over the years, with some campaigns now centered around decreased physical attractiveness and the risk of erectile dysfunction. These are more targeted towards younger smokers than previous campaigns. The British government spent £31 million in 2003 as part of their anti-smoking campaign.|$|E

25|$|As public health/health {{protection}} practitioners, epidemiologists work in {{a number}} of different settings. Some epidemiologists work 'in the field'; i.e., in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service, and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as state and local <b>health</b> <b>departments,</b> various Ministries of Health, Doctors without Borders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Protection Agency, the World Health Organization (WHO), or the Public Health Agency of Canada.
