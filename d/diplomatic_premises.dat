It presents a range of cases of violation or abuse of the inviolability of mission premises in the past as well as at the present time and at the end it tries to find out to what extent the current regulation of this institution in international law corresponds to the actual state practice.

40|$|The new U. S. Model {{income tax}} treaty {{contains}} an unusual addition: mechanisms for {{the parties to}} unilaterally override the negotiated treaty rates in specified circumstances. Previewed last year in proposed form—a first for the Treasury—these new mechanisms work as kill-switches, partially terminating the treaty as to one or both treaty partners. The idea is to forestall a more problematic outcome, such as an enduring breach {{of one of the}} parties’ expectations, or the opposite, a complete termination of all the treaty terms {{in the face of such}} a breach. Yet embedding a kill-switch in a treaty creates distinct legal, procedural, and political pressures in the tax-treaty relationship that implicate treaty negotiation, ratification, interpretation, and dispute resolution. Kill-switches also communicate a defensive tenor in the tax treaty relationships among many countries. This article analyzes the new kill-switch provisions and concludes that their introduction in the U. S. Model reflects the steady deterioration of tax treaties from essentially <b>diplomatic</b> documents <b>premised</b> on the good faith of the parties to detailed contracts drafted in anticipation of the opposite...|$|R

25|$|The {{primary mission}} of the MSG is to provide security, {{particularly}} the protection of classified information and equipment vital {{to the national security}} of the United States at American diplomatic posts. This is accomplished under the guidance and operational control of a civilian federal agent of the Diplomatic Security Service, known as the Regional Security Officer (RSO) who is the senior U.S. law enforcement representative and security attaché at U.S. diplomatic posts around the world. In addition, MSGs provide security for visiting American dignitaries and frequently assist the RSO in supervising host country or locally employed security forces that provide additional security for the exterior of embassies. The MSGs fall under operational control of the RSO and are administratively controlled by the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group. The secondary mission of Marine Security Guards is to provide protection for U.S. citizens and U.S. Government property located within designated U.S. <b>Diplomatic</b> and Consular <b>premises</b> during exigent circumstances, which require immediate aid or action.|$|R
40|$|How does {{international}} law require States acting outside their own territories to treat refugees and other persons fleeing harm in their countries? 1 This question has assumed increasing contemporary relevance {{in light of}} heightened externalised border controls, such as attempts by States to interdict migrant boats {{on the high seas}} in the Mediterranean (see, for instance Moreno-Lax 2012). However, the issue also arises in other contemporary scenarios, such as where persons seek protection in <b>diplomatic</b> or consular <b>premises,</b> where one State militarily occupies the territory of another, and where a State sets up a system for the extraterritorial processing of asylum claims. This short analysis addresses the non-refoulement aspect of this extraterritoriality problem, i. e. protection against enforced removal to a territory where the person fears harm by a State acting outside its own territory. Inspired by the human rights focus of the volume overall, the chapter draws on current research by the author in order to examine this ever-topical concern against recent advances in the field of international human rights law. It not only confirms the view that the non-refoulement rule in human rights law applies extraterritorially, but also concludes that the resulting procedural implications should be taken seriously both for human rights law and for refugee la...|$|R
50|$|The early 1980s {{experienced}} {{a wave of}} terrorist attacks on <b>diplomatic</b> <b>premises.</b> In the Middle East, the United States of America was intended.

The attack involved the use of a suicide bomber who drove a truck filled with 20, 000 pounds of explosives {{to the front of the}} Embassy. On December 12, 1983, another attack was targeted towards the United States in Kuwait City, which caused five deaths. Beirut {{experienced a}} second attack on September 20, 1984. This time a truck bomb killed 24 people, including two Americans and injured an additional 21.

50|$|The law {{has only}} been used once, for the Cambodian embassy in London, which had been {{occupied}} by squatters. The embassy had {{been used by the}} Government of Cambodia before it was overthrown by Pol Pot in 1975. Whilst that government was recognised by Britain, no diplomatic mission was established before Cambodia was invaded by Vietnam in 1978, and the building came into the care of the British Foreign Office. The squatters moved in whilst the embassy was vacant in 1976, and in 1988 they would have gained title to the building following twelve years of continuous occupation. Hence an order was made, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises (Cambodia) Order 1988, to de-recognise the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>premises</b> so that legal action could be taken to remove the squatters.|$|E

40|$|The Dissertation {{entitled}} "The Status of the Diplomatic Mission of a State in the 1961 Vienna Convention Perspective and the Progress of Diplomatic Law ", aims {{to identify}} and analyze the inviolability of the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>premises</b> in the receiving state {{as stated in the}} 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the jurisdiction of sovereign state, and the status of diplomatic missions in applying extraterritorial jurisdiction to take measures that are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 41 paragraph (3) of the Vienna Convention and the progress of diplomatic law after the 1961 Vienna Convention setting up. Some theories are used to analyze the issues raised in this dissertation such as: the extraterritorial/ exterritoriality jurisdiction theory, the functional necessity theory, the sovereignty theory, the perfect equality of state theory, the territorial jurisdiction theory and the reciprocity theory. This prescriptive legal research focused on law enforcement and it was aimed explaining to determine the truth of law. The study based on the provisions of international law, particularly in the diplomatic law, namely the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other laws (das-Sollen), as well as the application (das-Sein). The status of inviolability of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>premises</b> in the receiving state has not been absolute anymore. The progress of diplomatic law has shown that the situation can changes the status of inviolability. The protection of the citizens of the sending state who are involved in criminal act in the receiving state can be done based on the rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In the event of the receiving state has failed to implement international obligations to give mandatory access on consular notification and when the failure has caused harm to the citizens, the sending state is entitled to bring the case to international court. The granting of diplomatic asylum in spite of being contrary to the Convention of Diplomatic Relations has evolved into customary international law...|$|E
