But the long range (up to 3 km) measurements are not still completely investigated in operating condition.

40|$|In 1903 a large rockslide, {{known as}} the Frank Slide, dropped some thirty million cubic meters of rock into the Crowsnest valley, burying part {{of the town of}} Frank, and killing {{approximately}} 70 people. A five million cubic meter portion of the mountain peak was left standing by the 1903 slide, and is considered unstable. In response to the hazard posed by this large unstable rock mass, the Alberta Government commissioned the development and installation of a real-time monitoring system for the mountain. The system is comprised of various subsystems with different purposes. Two subsystems will be discussed here. The first is a real-time deformation monitoring system based on the Global Positioning System (GPS). The second is a robotic <b>electronic</b> <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> (EDM) system. The GPS monitoring system designed for Turtle Mountain is a real-time system that uses low-cost hardware, carefully implemented, to achieve high accuracy results.

The EDM system supplements the GPS system by taking measurements on areas of the mountain where GPS measurements are impossible, such as the various cliff faces left by the original slide.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calibration procedure adapted {{to a range}} camera intended for space applications. The range camera, which is based upon an auto-synchronized triangulation scheme, can measure objects from about 0. 5 m to 100 m. The field of view is 30 ° × 30 °. Objects situated at distances beyond 10 m can be measured {{with the help of}} cooperative targets. Such a large volume of measurement presents significant challenges to a precise calibration. A two- step methodology is proposed. In the first step, the close-range volume (from 0. 5 m to 1. 5 m) is calibrated using an array of targets positioned at known locations in the eld of view of the range camera. A large number of targets are evenly spaced in that eld of view because this is the region of highest precision.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{document}} the development of an accurate, affordable, reliable machine to perform the relatively long distance measurements routinely made by land surveyors. Prior to the development of the technology, surveyors used a variety of contact instruments for measurement: ropes, rods, poles, chains and steel tapes. The difficulty of obtaining results on long measurements by contact devices led innovators of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries to develop alternate non-contact methods of measuring: subtense bar, stadia wires and triangulation, all of which came with their own inadequacies.

40|$|As {{discussed}} in {{the first chapter of}} this book, there are many different methods to measure a part using optical technology. Chapter 2 discussed the use of machine vision to measure macroscopic features such as length and position, which was extended to the use of interferometry as a linear measurement tool in chapter 3, and laser or other trackers to find the relation of key points on large parts in chapter 4. This chapter looks at measuring large parts to optical tolerances in the sub-micron range using interferometry, ranging, and optical tools {{discussed in}} the previous chapters. The purpose of this chapter is not to discuss specific metrology tools (such as interferometers or gauges), but to describe a systems engineering approach to testing large parts. Issues such as material warpage and temperature drifts that may be insignificant when measuring a part to micron levels under a microscope, as will be discussed in later chapters, can prove to be very important when making the same measurement over a larger part. In this chapter, we will define a set of guiding principles for successfully overcoming these challenges and illustrate the application of these principles with real world examples. While these examples are drawn from specific large optical testing applications, they inform the problems associated with testing any large part to optical tolerances. Manufacturing today relies on micrometer level part performance. Fields such as energy and transportation are demanding higher tolerances to provide increased efficiencies and fuel savings. By looking at how the optics industry approaches sub-micrometer metrology, one can {{gain a better understanding of}} the metrology challenges for any larger part specified to micrometer tolerances. Testing large parts, whether optical components or precision structures, to optical tolerances is just like testing small parts, only harder. Identical with what one does for small parts, a metrologist tests large parts and optics in particular to quantify their mechanical properties (such as dimensions, mass, etc); their optical prescription or design (i. e. radius of curvature, conic constant, vertex location, size); and their full part shape. And, just as with small parts, a metrologist accomplishes these tests using <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> such as tape measures, inside micrometers, coordinate <b>measuring</b> machines, <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> interferometers; angle <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> such as theodolites, autocollimators; and surface <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> including interferometers, stylus profilers, interference microscopes, photogrammetric cameras, or other tools. However, while the methodology may be similar, it is more difficult to test a large object for the simple reason that most metrologists do not have the necessary intuition. The skills used to test small parts or optics in a laboratory do not extrapolate to testing large parts in an industrial setting any more than a backyard gardener might successfully operate a farm. But first, what is a large part? A simple definition might be the part's size or diameter. For optics and diffuse surface parts alike, the driving constraint is ability to illuminate the part's surface. For reflective convex mirrors, large is typically anything greater than 1 meter. But, for refractive optics, flats or convex mirrors, large is typically greater than 0. 5 meter. While a size definition is simple, it may be less than universal. A more nuanced definition might be that a large part is any component which cannot be easily tested in a standard laboratory environment, on a standard vibration isolated table using standard laboratory infrastructure. A micro-switch or a precision lens might be easily measured to nanometer levels under a microscope in a lab, but a power turbine spline or a larger telescope mirror will not fit under that microscope and may not even fit on the table...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Demand form micro-coordinate {{measuring}} machines (micro-CMMs) within industry is increasing {{due to the}} need for accurate measurement of the geometry of small-scale objects. Optical micro-CMMs have the advantage over traditional stylus-based CMMs of being non-contact instruments, and have the ability to acquire large amounts of data, with high resolution, in {{a relatively short period of}} time. The focus variation (FV) technique is typically used in the field of surface topography measurement, but has the potential to be implemented as a sensor technology for optical micro-CMMs. Exploring the possibility of the FV technique as an optical micro-CMM requires that the <b>instrument</b> and <b>measuring</b> procedure can be performance verified. Consequently, a prototype FV based optical micro-CMM should have a verification route that is traceable to the definition of the metre. The ISO 10360 specification standard for acceptance testing and verification of CMMs has several parts, all specific to different groups of instruments and configurations. Each section of ISO 10360 identifies methods and artefacts best suited for the acceptance testing and verification of each group and configuration. ISO/DIS 10360 - 8. 2 (due for ISO/FDIS publication in 2013), is a verification standard written for CMMs with optical distance sensors. There are four main parts to the acceptance and re-verification tests: length measurement error, probing form error measurement, probing size error measurement and flat form error measurement. The probing form and size error tests require a calibrated reference sphere that has a diameter of at least 10 mm. FV instruments are potentially covered by this standard but the recommended minimum size of the calibration sphere is too large to fully fit within one field of view of a typical FV <b>instrument</b> [...] Optical <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> similar in operation to FV systems, such as confocal microscopes and coherent scanning interferometers are, therefore, also currently excluded from the application of this standard by default, unless the user, and the instrument manufacturer, can potentially agree to use a smaller calibrated reference sphere for the assessment of the probing size and form error. A prototype FV based optical micro-CMM should, therefore, be verified with calibrated reference spheres of similar size to objects for which the technique has been designed to measure. The research reported here considers the use of 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm diameter reference spheres as suitable components for a reference artefact, with the surfaces of the spheres roughened using bespoke micro-roughening techniques. The research presents a novel verification artefact composed of multiple small-scale spheres, specifically designed to evaluate probing size error, probe form error, and dimensional accuracy of a prototype FV based optical micro-CMM, compliant to ISO/DIS 10360 - 8. The results suggest that the artefacts and procedures detailed in ISO/DIS 10360 - 8 can, and should, be applied to optical micro-CMMs...|$|R

40|$|Precision {{electric}} meters are {{indispensable to}} the development of technology in this age. The first electric <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments,</b> however, were physically impossible to transport, and were functionally inadequate for use in a laboratory. The <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> of today have evolved into sturdy, easy-to-use instruments with higher performance, adopting new active components which have appeared one after another. Expanding in functionality, <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> that have adopted such new technology have enabled even more precise measurement. The users have also expanded from research organizations and educational facilities, to the manufacturers of electrical equipment and electronic parts. The <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> manufacturers were able to supply more convenient <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> to the user, and conversely, the user, the manufacturers of electrical equipment and electronic parts, needed more easy-to-use and highly precise <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> in order to respond to a rapidly increasing demand. Consequently, cheap and high quality electronic parts were supplied to the market, and the <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> manufacturers were also able to develop new <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> using those parts. In fact, {{it can be said that}} they have been mutually complementary. It should not be forgotten that the demand fo...|$|R
40|$|<b>Distance</b> <b>measures</b> play an {{important}} role in cluster analysis. There is no single <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> that best fits for all types of the clustering problems. So, it is important to find set of <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> for different clustering techniques on datasets that yields optimal results. In this paper, an attempt has been made to evaluate ten different <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> on eight clustering techniques. The quality of the <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> has been computed on basis of three factors: accuracy, inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances. The performance of clustering algorithms on different <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> has been evaluated on three artificial and six real life datasets. The experimental results reveal that the performance and quality of different <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> vary with the nature of data as well as clustering techniques. Hence choice of <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> must be done on basis of dataset and clustering technique...|$|R
