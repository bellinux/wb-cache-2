25|$|This section <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> {{to collect}} the texts of all liturgical {{versions}} of the Nicene Creed, and provides only three, the Greek, the Latin, and the Armenian, of special interest. Others are mentioned separately, but without the texts. All ancient liturgical versions, even the Greek, differ {{at least to some}} small extent from the text adopted by the First Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople. The Creed was originally written in Greek, owing to the location of the two councils.|$|E
25|$|Farming plays a {{key role}} in the economy of Fintona. Much of the farming is cattle based {{involved}} meat and milk production, with some sheep rearing, particularly on higher ground. There are also some pig farms in the area. The land and climate does not lend itself to arable farming, but some maize is grown. This does not ripen and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> for human consumption, but is used to boost the protein of cattle feed. On higher ground near the summit of Murley Mountain, there are also peat bogs.|$|E
25|$|Coffee may be brewed {{by several}} methods. It may be boiled, steeped, or pressurized. Brewing coffee by boiling was the {{earliest}} method, and Turkish coffee {{is an example}} of this method. It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a bríki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> for drinking) settling {{at the bottom of the}} cup.|$|E

25|$|In the Azuchi-Momoyama period {{not only}} sukiya style but the {{contrasting}} shoin-zukuri of residences {{of the warrior}} class developed. While sukiya was a small space, simple and austere, shoin-zukuri style was that of large, magnificent reception areas, the setting for the pomp and ceremony of the feudal lords. As an example, in a shoin, the flower arrangement in the tokonoma {{is indicative of the}} relative wealth of the host, the guest however sits with their back to it as it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> for their enjoyment. Whereas, in a tearoom, the guest sits facing the tokonoma and enjoys its beauty.|$|E
25|$|Walker's {{campaign}} has inspired two films, {{both of which}} take considerable liberties with his story: Burn! (1969) directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, starring Marlon Brando, and Walker (1987) directed by Alex Cox, starring Ed Harris. Walker's name {{is used for the}} main character in Burn!, though the character <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to represent the historical William Walker and is portrayed as British. On the other hand, Alex Cox's Walker incorporates into its surrealist narrative many of the signposts of William Walker's life and exploits, including his original excursions into northern Mexico to his trial and acquittal on breaking the neutrality act to the triumph of his assault on Nicaragua and his execution.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the concern}} of some Torah {{scholars}} that misunderstanding these passages as literal descriptions of God's image might lead to blasphemy or idolatry, there was great opposition to studying this topic without the proper initiation. Jewish biblical commentaries emphasize that the imagery of the merkabah <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to be taken literally; rather the chariot and its accompanying angels are analogies for the various ways that God reveals himself in this world. Hasidic philosophy and kabbalah discuss at length what each aspect of this vision represents in this world, and how the vision {{does not imply that}} God is made up of these forms.|$|E

25|$|According to Jewish teachings, hell is {{not entirely}} physical; rather, it can be {{compared}} to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of God, one is said to be in Gehinnom. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of teshuva (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the Torah.|$|E
25|$|Panspermia is a {{hypothesis}} proposing that microscopic life forms that can survive {{the effects of}} space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and small Solar System bodies that harbor life. Some organisms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. Under certain ideal impact circumstances (into a body of water, for example), and ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, {{it is possible that}} the surviving organisms could become active and begin to colonize their new environment. Panspermia <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to address how life began, just the method that may cause its distribution in the Universe.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} {{haemostasis}} evaluating method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which {{need to be}} considered when interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive for the effect of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel), and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for coagulation factor deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> to replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.|$|E
