50|$|Of all {{the common}} nuclear fuels, Pu-239 has the {{smallest}} critical mass.A spherical untamped critical mass is about 11 kg (24.2 lbs), 10.2 cm (4") in diameter. Using appropriate triggers, neutron reflectors, <b>implosion</b> <b>geometry</b> and tampers, this critical mass {{can be reduced}} by more than twofold. This optimization usually requires a large nuclear development organization supported by a sovereign nation.|$|E
40|$|Thermal and nonthermal x-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} implosion of compact tungsten wire arrays in 5 -MA Saturn discharges is reported. The timing of multiple implosions and the thermal x-ray spectra (1 to 10 keV) agree with 2 D radiation-hydrocode simulations. Nonthermal x-ray emission (10 to 100 keV) correlates with pinch spots distributed along the z-axis. The similarities of the measured nonthermal spectrum, yield, and pinch-spot emission {{with those of}} 0. 8 -MA, single- exploded-wire discharges on Gamble-II suggest a common nonthermal- production mechanism. Nonthermal x-ray yields are lower than expected from current scaling of Gamble II results, suggesting that implosion geometries are not as efficient as single-wire geometries for nonthermal x-ray production. The instabilities, azimuthal asymmetries, and inferred multiple implosions that accompany the <b>implosion</b> <b>geometry</b> lead to larger, more irregular pinch spots, a likely reason for reduced nonthermal efficiency. A model for nonthermal-electron acceleration across magnetic fields in highly- collisional, high-atomic-number plasmas combined with 1 D hydrocode simulations of Saturn compact loads predicts weak nonthermal x-ray emission...|$|E
40|$|DT neutron yield (Y{sub n}), ion {{temperature}} (T{sub i}) and down-scatter ratio (dsr) determined from measured neutron spectra are essential metrics for diagnosing {{the performance of}} Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) implosions at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). A suite of neutron-Time-Of-Flight (nTOF) spectrometers and a Magnetic Recoil Spectrometer (MRS) have been implemented in different locations around the NIF target chamber, providing good implosion coverage and the redundancy required for reliable measurements of Yn, Ti and dsr. From the measured dsr value, an areal density ({rho}R) is determined from the relationship {rho}R{sub tot} (g/cm{sup 2 }) = (20. 4 {+-} 0. 6) x dsr{sub 10 - 12 MeV}. The proportionality constant is determined considering <b>implosion</b> <b>geometry,</b> neutron attenuation and energy range used for the dsr measurement. To ensure high accuracy in the measurements, a series of commissioning experiments using exploding pushers {{have been used for}} in situ calibration. The spectrometers are now performing to the required accuracy, as indicated by the good agreement between the different measurements over several commissioning shots. In addition, recent data obtained with the MRS and nTOFs indicate that the implosion performance of cryogenically layered DT implosions, characterized by the experimental Ignition Threshold Factor (ITFx) which is a function of dsr (or fuel {rho}R) and Y{sub n}, has improved almost two orders of magnitude since the first shot in September, 2010...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of the Gurney equation, {{implosion}} forms (cylindrical and spherical) {{must take into account}} the shape of the control volume of the detonating shell of explosives and the distribution of momentum and energy within the detonation product gases. For cylindrical <b>implosions,</b> the <b>geometry</b> involved is simplified to include the inner and outer radii of the explosive charge, Ri and Ro.|$|R
50|$|The Little Boy gun type {{atomic bomb}} dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 {{was made of}} highly enriched uranium with a large tamper. The nominal spherical {{critical}} mass for an untampered 235U nuclear weapon is 56 kg, a sphere 17.32 cm (6.8") in diameter. The material must be 85% or more of 235U and is known as weapons grade uranium, though for a crude, inefficient weapon 20% is sufficient (called weapon(s)-usable). Even lower enrichment can be used, but then the required critical mass rapidly increases. Use of a large tamper, <b>implosion</b> <b>geometries,</b> trigger tubes, polonium triggers, tritium enhancement, and neutron reflectors can enable a more compact, economical weapon using one-fourth or less of the nominal critical mass, though this would likely only be possible {{in a country that}} already had extensive experience in engineering nuclear weapons. Most modern nuclear weapon designs use plutonium as the fissile component of the primary stage, however HEU is often used in the secondary stage.|$|R
40|$|Thermal and nonthermal x-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} implosion of compact tungsten wire arrays, driven by 5 MA from the Saturn accelerator, are measured and compared with LLNL Radiation-Hydro-Code (RHC) and SNL Hydro-Code (HC) numerical models. Multiple implosions, due to sequential compressions and expansions of the plasma, are inferred from the measured multiple x-radiation bursts. Timing {{of the multiple}} implosions and the thermal x-ray spectra measured between 1 and 10 keV {{are consistent with the}} RHC simulations. The magnitude of the nonthermal x-ray emission measured from 10 to 100 keV ranges from 0. 02 to 0. 08 % of the total energy radiated and is correlated with bright-spot emission along the z-axis, as observed in earlier Gamble- 11 single exploding-wire experiments. The similarities of the measured nonthermal spectrum and bright-spot emission with those measured at 0. 8 MA on Gamble-II suggest a common production mechanism for this process. A model of electron acceleration across magnetic fields in highly-collisional, high-atomic-number plasmas is developed, which shows the existence of a critical electric field, E{sub c}, below which strong nonthermal electron creation (and the associated nonthermal x rays) do not occur. HC simulations show that significant nonthermal electrons are not expected in this experiment (as observed) because the calculated electric fields are at least one to two orders-of-magnitude below E{sub c}. These negative nonthermal results are confirmed by RHC simulations using a nonthermal model based on a Fokker-Plank analysis. Lastly, the lower production efficiency and the larger, more irregular pinch spots formed in this experiment relative to those measured on Gamble II suggest that <b>implosion</b> <b>geometries</b> are not as efficient as single exploding-wire geometries for warm x-ray production...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a strong ultrarelativistic shock moving through a star whose envelope has a polytrope-like density profile. When the shock {{is close to}} the star’s outer boundary, its behavior follows the self-similar solution given by Sari (2005) for <b>implosions</b> in planar <b>geometry.</b> Here we outline this solution and find the asymptotic solution as the shock reaches the star’s edge. We then show that the motion after the shock breaks out of the star is described by a self-similar solution remarkably like the solution for the motion inside the star. In particular, the characteristic Lorentz factor, pressure, and density vary with time according to the same power laws {{both before and after the}} shock breaks out of the star. After emergence from the star, however, the self-similar solution’s characteristic position corresponds to a point behind the leading edge of the flow rather than at the shock front, and the relevant range of values for the similarity variable changes. Our numerical integrations agree well with the analytic results both before and after the shock reaches the star’s edge. Subject headings: hydrodynamics — shock waves — stars: general 1...|$|R
