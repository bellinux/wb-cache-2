5|$|After 1242 {{most of the}} {{territory}} between the Danube and the Black Sea {{was included in the}} area <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mongols. Although the Byzantine Empire reestablished control over the Danube Delta in the 1260s, it fell again under the direct rule of the Golden Horde sometime before 1337. By the end of the 13thcentury, flourishing communities of Genoese merchants had settled in the towns of Vicina, Chilia and Licostomo.|$|E
5|$|After the {{convention}} many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him {{as head of}} the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment of a state women's college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in that body.|$|E
5|$|Among other pursuits, amateur dramatics {{flourish}} (even though Brasenose was an all-male college). Overall, {{the intake}} and careers of undergraduates remained <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Church (up to half), {{drawn from a}} range of backgrounds. The college remained largely independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's academic record remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, although one of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E

5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E

5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The coordination chemistry of V5+ is <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E
5|$|Det norske Arbeiderforbund was {{supported}} by people from individual factories, but the mainly philanthropic activists {{were associated with the}} Liberal Party. However, the strike at Akers Mekaniske had been a failure, as the laborers had returned to work by on 26 Augustwith a 10% pay cut. It soon faced competition from more worker-dominated trade unions, coordinated through the Fagforeningenes Centralkomite. On the political side, a Labour Party was formed in 1887, and from it the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions followed in 1899. The historical role of Det norske Arbeiderforbund, as it turned out, was to mark the transition between two kinds of trade unionism; the one <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bourgeois Liberal Party and the one <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> socialist Labour Party. The organization became defunct around 1890. The publication Arbeideren was continued, and beginning in 1906, Arbeideren was the party organ of the newly founded Labour Democrats, a non-socialist labour and social reform party associated with the Liberal Party.|$|E
