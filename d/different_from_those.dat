5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol are quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> in extracellular fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|The goalkeeper is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{other people}} on their team; they possess certain {{privileges}} and are subject to <b>different</b> restrictions <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of field players.

5|$|After {{taking over}} the {{administration}} of the country in 1945, the Communist Party changed the administrative model to that of the Soviet Union (regions and raions) in 1950, but changed it back in 1968. Nevertheless, the county borders set then were quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> present during the interbellum, as only 39 counties were formed from the 56 remaining after the war.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E

5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone life-saving ring {{that appeared to}} have come from Fitzgerald. It bore markings <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are dramatically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for {{up to ten}} years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E

5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of bony fish and {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet {{is about half}} the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The genes {{often found}} mutated in PanNETs are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> in exocrine {{pancreatic}} cancer. For example, KRAS mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary MEN1 gene mutations {{give rise to}} MEN1 syndrome, in which primary tumors occur in two or more endocrine glands. About 40â€“70% of people born with a MEN1 mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently mutated include DAXX, mTOR and ATRX.|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients {{has changed over the}} centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|Water megamasers and kilomasers {{are found}} {{primarily}} associated with active galactic nuclei, while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers {{are found in}} star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers {{do not seem to}} be very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant.|$|E
5|$|All of the minigames in Brain Age 2 are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of the {{original}} Brain Age. Brain Age 2 contains six minigames: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Serial Subtraction, Symbol Match, Math Recall, Number Memory, and High Number. The game's Training mode includes the following activities: Sign Finder, Piano Player, Word Blend, Word Scramble, Change Maker, Calendar Count, Memory Sprint, Math Recall, Clock Spin, and Block Count. During their training, the player can collect stamps by completing minigames, and only one stamp can be collected per day. When a certain numbers of stamps are collected, new minigames and features are unlocked.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued {{to be held at}} the Ruthin branch, so there was no problem in segregating the records.|$|E

Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>those</b> of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
