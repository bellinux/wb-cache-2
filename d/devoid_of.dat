This fusional interpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of individual autonomy and manifested the precedence of Fraternity on individual will.|$|R

5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly swollen at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
50|$|In the {{relatively}} small Netherlands there is a limited amound of long-distance routes within the country. In 1994, the Interliner-network started with express buses on connections <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> rail transport. Due to high fares, a dense rail network and other reasons, the Interliner network fell apart into several different systems. In 2014, only {{a limited amount of}} expressbuses exist as regular public transport.|$|R
40|$|Sumatriptan {{and other}} {{selective}} serotonin agonists represent {{a major breakthrough}} in acute migraine treatment. These drugs are very efficacious and generally <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> important side effects, but they are expensive and therefore have to be compared with other, more conventional drugs with established or assumed efficacy. We summarize the pharmacologic characteristics of Sumatriptan and give recommendations about its use in clinical practice. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Colonies of B. conops {{occur in}} locally dense but widely {{scattered}} populations, with large areas <b>of</b> Cerrado <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> B. conops. According to Brandão et al. (2001), this distribution pattern {{may be explained}} by the limited dispersal mode of ergatoid queens and by the type of nest foundation (fission of established colonies). Such nest distribution may be characteristic of all Blepharidatta species and probably explains why ant species of this genus are considered rare.|$|R
5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He points out, however, that this {{classification}} is a simplification, as some works by their nature {{can be of}} a later or earlier period.

The effect of seminal {{envelope of}} groundnut seed {{on the development}} of pathogenic fungi has been studied in lab conditions.

By NRFQM I mean an interpretation of QM that considers an involved on- tology of non-individuals as explained in the text.

40|$|THE {{incorporation}} of labelled precursors into amphibian embryos {{is limited by}} the presence of a coat which covers the embryo and which renders the embryo impermeable to a large number of substances. One of them is uridine. However, we found that embryonic cells the coat of which has been disintegrated by placing them in a medium totally <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> calcium incorporate tritiated uridine very rapidly, while the control embryos do not. Using this procedure, {{we have been able to}} follow the {{incorporation of}} this substance into dissociated embryonic cells at different stages of development. © 1960 Nature Publishing Group.

A first follow-up study of 7 extremely metal-poor candidates within the Sculptor dwarf galaxy with X-shooter on ESO/VLT has further confirmed the new metallicity calibration for the Ca IT triplet at low metallicities and provides abundances for many other elements in these stars. We will discuss {{the results of this study}} and show a comparison with the Galactic extremely metal-poor stars...|$|R

Elliptical galaxies are largely <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E

50|$|In the {{ligand binding}} site of XEEL and hIntL-1, the exocyclic vicinal diol of the {{carbohydrate}} ligand directly coordinates to the calcium ion. There are large {{variations in the}} ligand binding site residues among intelectin homologs suggesting that the intelectin family may have broad ligand specificities and biological functions. As there is no intelectin numbering conventions in different organisms, one should not assume functional homology based on the intelectin number. For example, hIntL-1 has glutamic acid residues in the ligand binding site to coordinate a calcium ion, while zebrafish intelectin-1 are <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> these acidic residues. Interestingly, zebrafish intelectin-2 ligand binding site residues {{are similar to those}} present in hIntL-1.|$|R
40|$|Two {{children}} aged 9 and 8 years respectively presenting {{upper and lower}} respiratory tract infections from early childhood are presented. In both, nasal mucociliary transport was impaired (greater than 30 min) and electron microscopic examination showed cilia <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> the inner dynein arms. This ciliary defect {{is one of those}} recognized as a cause of the Immotile Cilia Syndrome but is very rare, having been described only once in a boy affected with Kartagener's syndrome, which in turn has been reclassified in the Immotile Cilia Syndrome. Therefore the absence of inner dynein arms observed by us in the respiratory cilia of these two children clearly indicated that similarly to many other genetic disorders the immotile cilia syndrome may be determined by many defects in the axonemal structure...|$|R
40|$|Removal of gastric content, {{followed}} by administration of activated charcoal and cathartics, is often recommended and performed in routine in acute toxic ingestions, excepted for several well known contraindications. Although {{its influence on}} clinical outcome has never been clearly demonstrated, early administration of activated charcoal is able to reduce the biodisponibility of many toxins. As it is almost <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> side effects, a wide use may however be recommended. Conversely, induction of emesis and gastric lavage have both questionable effectiveness and are sometimes responsible for severe complications. A less systematic and more rational use of these techniques is thus recommended.

40|$|Controlled ovarian {{stimulation}} {{has become an}} integral part of infertility treatment. Specifi c gonadotropin based protocols become the main strat-e gies for controlled stimulation. To avoid the potentially detrimental effect of premature LH surge on oocytes and/or endometrium development, the GnRH analogs have been incorporated into controlled {{ovarian stimulation}} strategies. With the availability of recombinant gonadotropins (i. e. recom-binant FSH <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> LH activity) it is necessary to establish pre cise role of LH in the folliculogenesis and endometrium development. The benefi t of exogenous LH may vary with the GnRH-agonists and an tag o-nists regiment used.

Bauny thus quoted the Nicomachean Ethics, III, 1, alleging that a voluntary action needed knowledge of what was good or evil in it. Pascal replied, also quoting Aristotle (he seemingly was the only one to use this argument in this debate), that Aristotle spoke only of knowledge of the actual circumstances of the act, but not at all of the capacity to discriminate between good and evil [...] - [...] since Aristotle stated that one who was <b>devoided</b> <b>of</b> that capacity was not excused at all, but rather considered a vicious man.|$|R
