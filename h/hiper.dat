25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>HiPER,</b> the driver laser system is similar to {{existing}} systems like NIF, but considerably smaller and less powerful.|$|E
25|$|Other {{planned and}} {{proposed}} fusion reactors include DEMO, Wendelstein 7-X, NIF, <b>HiPER,</b> and MAST, {{as well as}} CFETR (China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor), a 200MW tokamak.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 <b>HiPER</b> {{completed}} a preliminary study outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction. The report received positive reviews from the EC in July 2007, and moved onto a preparatory design phase in early 2008 with detailed designs for construction beginning in 2011 or 2012.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS is {{the first}} North American car to {{incorporate}} a front suspension design, marketed as <b>HiPer</b> Strut, designed to improve ride and handling and reduces torque steer. The Buick LaCrosse CXS includes a system marketed as Real Time Damping that adjusts the damping forces of the shocks and struts for improved ride and handling.|$|E
25|$|<b>HiPER</b> {{proposes to}} build a {{demonstrator}} diode-pump system producing 10kJ at 1Hz or 1kJ at 10Hz depending on a design choice yet to be made. The best high-repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller; Mercury at Livermore is about 70J, HALNA in Japan at ~20J, and LUCIA in France at ~100J. HiPER's demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 500 times as powerful as any of these.|$|E
25|$|Although Petawatt was {{instrumental}} in advancing the practical basis for the concept of fast ignition fusion, {{by the time it}} was operational as a proof-of-concept device, the decision to move ahead with NIF had already been taken. Further work on the fast ignition approach continues, and will potentially reach a level of development far in advance of NIF at <b>HiPER,</b> an experimental system under development in the European Union.|$|E
25|$|To make a {{practical}} commercial power generator, the high-gain of a device like <b>HiPER</b> {{would have to}} be combined with a high-repetition rate laser and a target chamber capable of extracting the power. Additional areas of research for post-HiPER devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production, protecting the device from the neutron flux generated by the fusion reactions, and the production of tritium from this flux to produce more fuel for the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{is already}} a fairly well-understood problem, and <b>HiPER</b> is {{primarily}} interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process. It {{is not clear how}} quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load; while this is known for matter under normal pressures, it's not for the ultra-dense conditions of the compressed fuel. To work efficiently, the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible, to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature (energy per unit volume) as high as possible.|$|E
25|$|In parallel, the <b>HiPER</b> project also {{proposes to}} build smaller laser systems with higher {{repetition}} rates. The high-powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes {{as long as}} a day. Additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054nm in vaco) couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing {{a considerable amount of}} energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier, which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. <b>HiPER</b> will use frequency tripling on the drivers.|$|E
25|$|When the {{amplification}} {{process is}} complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying {{at one end}} of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1mm in diameter in the case of <b>HiPER,</b> lies at the center of the chamber.|$|E
2500|$|The High Power laser Energy Research {{facility}} (<b>HiPER),</b> is {{a proposed}} experimental laser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device undergoing preliminary design for possible {{construction in the}} European Union. <b>HiPER</b> is the first experiment designed specifically to study the [...] "fast ignition" [...] approach to generating nuclear fusion, which uses much smaller lasers than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude. This offers a total [...] "fusion gain" [...] that {{is much higher than}} devices like the National Ignition Facility (NIF), and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical {{research}} {{since the}} design of <b>HiPER</b> in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition as a route to practical ICF. A new approach known as shock ignition has been proposed {{to address some of}} these problems. A similar ICF experimental setup in Japan was known as [...] "HIPER", but this is no longer operational.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{efficiency}} {{of this approach}} is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4MJ of infrared power to create ignition that releases about 20MJ of energy. This corresponds to a [...] "fusion gain" [...] —the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power— of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current <b>HiPER</b> design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30MJ, a gain of about 100. Considering a variety of losses, the actual gain is predicted to be around 72. Not only does this outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, <b>HiPER</b> is expected to be about an order of magnitude less expensive than conventional devices like NIF.|$|E
2500|$|... "Fast ignition" [...] was {{developed}} in the late nineties, and was part of a push by the Laboratory for Laser Energetics for building the Omega EP system. This system was finished in 2008. Fast ignition showed such dramatic power savings that ICF appears to be a useful technique for energy production. There are even proposals to build an experimental facility dedicated to the fast ignition approach, known as <b>HiPER.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>HiPER</b> {{differs from}} most ICF devices {{in that it}} also {{includes}} {{a second set of}} lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem <b>HiPER</b> uses a technique known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays. This [...] "stretches" [...] the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5kJ each to generate a total of 200kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3kJ to generate a total of 70kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research. Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light. As of 2007, the baseline design is based on doubling into the green.|$|E
2500|$|The fast {{ignition}} approach {{attempts to}} avoid these problems. Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel. This is far more efficient than the shock wave, which becomes less important. In <b>HiPER,</b> the compression provided by the driver is [...] "good", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200kJ and produces densities of about 300g/cm3. That's about one-third that of NIF, and {{about the same as}} generated by the earlier NOVA laser of the 1980s. For comparison, lead is about 11g/cm3, so this still represents a considerable amount of compression, notably when one considers the target's interior contained light D-T fuel around 0.1g/cm3.|$|E
2500|$|From there, {{the laser}} light is fed {{into a very}} long spatial filter {{to clean up the}} {{resulting}} pulse. The filter is essentially a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away, where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any [...] "stray" [...] light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam. The beam then widens out until a second lens returns it to a straight beam again. It is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in ICF laser devices. In the case of <b>HiPER,</b> the filters take up about 50% of the overall length. The beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40cm × 40cm.|$|E
2500|$|How to get {{the laser}} light onto that spot is also a matter for further research. One {{approach}} uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense [...] "core", essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside. This approach will be tested on the OMEGA-EP system in the US. Another approach, tested successfully on the GEKKO XII laser in Japan, uses a small gold cone that cuts through a small area of the target shell; on heating no plasma is created in this area, leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone. <b>HiPER</b> is currently planning on using the gold cone approach, but will likely study the burning solution as well.|$|E
2500|$|Inertial (laser) {{confinement}} {{is being}} developed at the United States National Ignition Facility (NIF) based at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, the French Laser Mégajoule, and the planned European Union High Power laser Energy Research (<b>HiPER)</b> facility. NIF reached initial operational status in 2010 {{and has been in}} the process of increasing the power and energy of its [...] "shots", with fusion ignition tests to follow. A three-year goal announced in 2009 to produce net energy from fusion by 2012 was missed; in September 2013, however, the facility announced a significant milestone from an August 2013 test that produced more energy from the fusion reaction than had been provided to the fuel pellet. This was reported as the first time this had been accomplished in fusion power research. The facility reported that their next step involved improving the system to prevent the hohlraum from either breaking up asymmetrically or too soon.|$|E
2500|$|The driver {{consists}} {{of a number of}} [...] "beamlines" [...] containing [...] amplifiers {{at one end of the}} building. Just prior to firing, the glass is [...] "pumped" [...] to a high-energy state with a series of xenon flash tubes, causing a population inversion of the neodymium (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a fibre optic, is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power. When this process is complete, a Pockels cell [...] "switches" [...] the light out of the cavity. One problem for the <b>HiPER</b> project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.|$|E
2500|$|Wide Area Persistent Surveillance (also Wide Area Motion Imaging) {{is a form}} of {{airborne}} surveillance system that collects pattern-of-life data by recording motion images of an area larger than a city – [...] in sub-meter resolution. This video allows for anyone within the field of regard to be tracked – [...] both live and retroactively, for forensic analysis. The use of sophisticated tracking algorithms applied to the WAMI dataset also enables mass automated geo-location tracking of every vehicle and pedestrian. WAMI sensors are typically mounted on manned airplanes, drones, blimps and aerostats. WAMI is currently in use on the souther border of the USA and has been deployed in Baltimore, Dayton Ohio as well as in Los Angeles, specifically targeting Compton. [...] Wide Area Persistent Surveillance systems such as ARGUS WAMI are capable of live viewing and recording a 68< square mile area with enough detail to view pedestrians and vehicles and generate chronographs These WAMI cameras, such as Gorgon Stare, Angelfire, <b>Hiper</b> Stare, Hawkeye and ARGUS, create airborne video so detailed that pedestrians can be followed across the city through forensic analysis. This allows investigators to rewind and playback the movements of anyone within this 68 square mile area for hours, days or even months at a time depending on the airframe the WAMI sensors are mounted on. JLENS, a surveillance aerostat scheduled for deployment over the east coast of the USA, {{is a form of}} WAMI that uses sophisticated radar imaging along with electro-optical WAMI sensors to enable mass geo-location tracking of ground vehicles.|$|E

50|$|R&D {{continued}} on inertial fusion {{energy in the}} European Union and in Japan. The High Power laser Energy Research facility (<b>HiPER)</b> is a proposed experimental fusion device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the European Union to continue the development of laser-driven inertial confinement approach. <b>HiPER</b> is the first experiment designed specifically to study the fast ignition approach to generating nuclear fusion. Using much smaller lasers than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude would offer a much higher Q with a reduction in construction costs of about ten times. Theoretical research since the design of <b>HiPER</b> in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition but a new approach known as shock ignition has been proposed {{to address some of}} these problems. Japan developed the KOYO-F fusion reactor design and laser inertial fusion test (LIFT) experimental reactor. In April 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Mike Cassidy, former Google vice-president and director of Project Loon with Googlex, started a clean energy startup, Apollo Fusion, to develop a hybrid fusion-fission reactor technology.|$|E

50|$|For a true {{industrial}} demonstration, further work is required. In particular, {{the laser}} systems {{need to be}} able to run at high operating frequencies, perhaps one to ten times a second. Most of the laser systems mentioned in this article have trouble operating even as much as once a day. Parts of the <b>HiPER</b> budget are dedicated to research in this direction as well. Because they convert electricity into laser light with much higher efficiency, diode lasers also run cooler, which in turn allows them to be operated at much higher frequencies. <b>HiPER</b> is currently studying devices that operate at 1 MJ at 1 Hz, or alternately 100 kJ at 10 Hz.|$|E
50|$|With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of fast ignition and similar approaches, {{things have changed}} dramatically. In this approach gains of 100 are predicted in the first experimental device, <b>HiPER.</b> Given a gain of about 100 and a laser efficiency of about 1%, <b>HiPER</b> produces {{about the same amount}} of fusion energy as electrical energy was needed to create it. It also appears that an order of magnitude improvement in laser efficiency may be possible through the use of newer designs that replace the flash lamps with laser diodes that are tuned to produce most of their energy in a frequency range that is strongly absorbed. Initial experimental devices offer efficiencies of about 10%, and it is suggested that 20% is a real possibility with some additional development.|$|E
