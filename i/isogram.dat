[...] Originally the poem was attributed to {{the founder of the}} Shingon Esoteric sect of Buddhism in Japan, Kūkai, but more modern research has found the date of composition to be later in the Heian Period. The first record of its existence dates from 1079. It is famous because it is simultaneously a perfect pangram and <b>isogram,</b> containing each character of the Japanese syllabary exactly once. Because of this, it is also used as an ordering for the syllabary, {{in the same way as}} the A, B, C, D... sequence of the Latin alphabet.|$|E

The longest Dutch <b>isogram</b> is [...] "Exvakbondsjuryzwijgplicht" [...] (former union jury oath of secrecy) with 24 letters. The Dutch alphabet consists of 27 letters (a-z and ĳ).|$|E
5000|$|An <b>isogram</b> (also {{known as}} a [...] "nonpattern word") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter. It is also used by some to mean a word or phrase in which each letter appears {{the same number of}} times, not {{necessarily}} just once. Conveniently, the word itself is an <b>isogram</b> in both senses of the word, making it autological.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{hundreds}} of eleven-letter <b>isograms,</b> over one thousand ten-letter <b>isograms</b> and thousands of such nine-letter words. [...] <b>Isograms</b> are useful {{in the game of}} Hangman and could make a particularly difficult puzzle on the game show Wheel of Fortune.|$|R

5000|$|Isograms can {{be useful}} as keys in ciphers, since <b>isogram</b> {{sequences}} of the same length make for simple one-to-one mapping between the symbols.

50|$|The Iroha (いろは) is a Japanese poem, {{probably}} {{written in}} the Heian era (794-1179).

3000|$|Given {{the course}} {{between the two}} end-points of the {{measured}} sequence for positioning (named EE-course), IESIL theoretically is to approximate the ideal operation of equidistance-segmenting the EE-course. This is realized by the <b>isograms</b> corresponding to the real-time samplings, which are collected with equal-time intervals. Therewith, the basic scheme is as follows. Firstly, in the [...] "hunting window" [...] estimated with INS's parameters, the measurements-corresponded <b>isograms</b> are extracted; secondly, searching the intersection line with Minimum Standard Deviation (MSD) about the lengths of its line segments, which are divided out by the <b>isograms.</b> And then the accurate location and attitude information can be obtained inversely. All the processes are considered in the regular grid form for convenience of digital processing, and this also fits the storage mode of most MMF source data. The concrete steps are as follows.|$|R

30|$|The {{scenario}} of i-ICP [13] is by transforming recursively the temporary trajectory, which is connected by the projected {{points on the}} corresponding <b>isograms,</b> to approximate the real one. Its brief procedures contain large matrix transformation, singular value decomposition, orthogonal matrix calculation, and so on. These complex operations {{as well as the}} distortion of <b>isograms</b> sometimes lead to the embarrassment of solution loss. i-ICP is complicated and is not desirable for UMN under the demanding of immediate positioning, and the rasterized storage of MMF maps with large grid spacing may add the difficulties more.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{aesthetic}} delights available to logologists is contemplating isograms: words, names, and other verbal entitites in which each of the alphabetic letters used appears the same specified number of times. PSEUDOMYTHICAL, for instance, is a solo <b>isogram,</b> using each of 14 different letters once; HAPPENCHANCE is a pair <b>isogram,</b> using each of 6 different letters twice; and SESTETTES is a trio <b>isogram,</b> using each of 3 different letters three times. In a cryptographic context, solo isograms are known as nonpattern terms; in a pangrammatic setting, as partial pangrams. Beyond trio isograms lie hitherto unexplored higher orders [...] tetrad, pentrad, and hexad isograms. Short isograms are plentiful, long ones a rarity, making {{the search for the}} latter a logological challenge and their discovery unusually rewarding: the numerical balance they display is an unexcelled form of verbal beauty...|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to topographic maps, {{there are a}} variety of diagrams that employ contour lines to represent continuous information both continuously and discontinuously (e.g., isotherm maps). An important future direction for research would be to examine how students learn to understand different kinds of <b>isograms,</b> and how experience with the diagrams in the form of speech and gestures influences learning. Beyond topographic maps specifically, and <b>isograms</b> more generally, conceptually focused speech and highlighting gestures might be useful to teach disciplinary diagrams across the STEM disciplines. As contour lines are employed to represent a wide range of content, such as three-dimensional mathematical functions and chemical state-change boundaries, it is critical to understand how these educational tools can be applied to potentially increase the effectiveness and efficiency of diagram education.|$|R

The pattern indicated with the <b>isogram</b> was a complicated pattern, and the pattern indicated by the trend surface analysis was a simple pattern. Therefore, the diffusing performance of low-volume sprayer could be evaluated easily with the simple pattern by the trend surface analysis...|$|E

30|$|Topographic {{maps are}} members of the class of {{diagrams}} called <b>isograms</b> (Brooks, 1916). Another example is a weather map where the continuous dimension of temperature is categorically displayed as regions where the temperature falls within specific values, and contour lines are drawn at the boundaries of those regions so that a contour connects points that have equivalent temperature values (Talman, 1910). In this case, the form of the iso-temperature contours preserves aspects of the spatial structure of the temperature distribution over the region, just as elevation contours preserve aspects of the spatial structure of the terrain. Yet another example is weather maps showing high and low pressure systems with contours to categorically indicate specific barometric pressure values. In general, all types of <b>isograms,</b> which encode one dimension categorically by segmenting continuous values arbitrarily, and visually preserve and continuously present other properties, are complex and can be difficult to learn and use (Hegarty, Canham, & Fabrikant, 2010; Taylor, Renshaw, & Choi, 2004).|$|R

Thereupon, performance comparison can focus on some special aspects.
