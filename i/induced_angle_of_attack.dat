40|$|A {{numerical}} {{optimization algorithm}} {{based on the}} steepest decent along the variation of the optimization function is implemented for maximizing the thrust and/or propulsive efficiency of a single flapping airfoil. Unsteady, low speed laminar flows are computed using a Navier-Stokes solver on moving overset grids. The flapping motion of the airfoil is described by a combined sinusoidal plunge and pitching motion. Optimization parameters are taken to be the amplitudes of the plunge and pitching motions, and the phase shift between them. Computations are performed in parallel in a work station cluster. The numerical simulations show that high thrust values may be obtained {{at the expense of}} reduced efficiency. For high efficiency in thrust generation, the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> of the airfoil is reduced and large scale vortex formations at the leading edge are prevented. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the numerical simulation of a generic lateral vortex, that {{is generated by}} a rapidly deflected NACA 0021 airfoil. We use the SST k-Ï‰ URANS approach and a hybrid RANS-LES method based on the SST model, where a zonal RANS-LES interface is located little downstream of the airfoil trailing edge.

Both a lateral offset between the two fins and the upstream fin angle of attack modify the forces upon the trailing fin through the same phenomenon, by altering the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> upon the downstream fin. The force and moment coefficients on the downstream fin were found to correlate well with its total angle of attack as the data, in most cases, collapsed to a single curve in all three components when plotted against total angle of attack.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the air forces on biplane cellule. The {{first part of the}} report {{deals with the}} {{two-dimensional}} problem neglecting viscosity. The variation of the section, chord, gap, stagger, and decalage are investigated, a great number of examples are calculated, and all numerical results are given in tables. For the biplane without stagger it is found that the loss of lift in consequence of the mutual influence of the two wing sections is only half as much if the lift is produced by the curvature of the section as it is when the lift is produced by the inclination of the chord to the direction of motion. The second part deals with the influence of the lateral dimensions. It is found that the loss of lift due to induction is almost unchanged, whether the biplane is staggered or not. In the third part conclusions from previous investigations are drawn, viscosity and experimental experience are brought in, and the method is simplified for practical application. Simple formulas give the drag, lift, and moment. In order {{to make use of the}} simple formulas more convenient, tables for the dynamical pressure, <b>induced</b> drag, and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> are added so that practically no computation is needed for the application of the results...|$|R

40|$|A medium {{fidelity}} tool {{has been}} developed for the computation of a wing's maximum lift coefficient in low speed while adhering to conceptual aircraft details. This tool {{is part of the}} Initiator which is a conceptual/preliminary aircraft design tool developed by the FPP group. The methodology comprises out of a synergy between empirical relationships and low order aerodynamic analysis in terms of potential flow theory. The tool's empiricism originates from Datcom's semi-empirical Critical Section Method (CSM) and the Pressure Difference Rule (PDR). To complement deficiencies, routines have been implemented regarding <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> flap lift effectiveness, chord extension, and multi-element lift curve slope. For rapid convergence, the Newton-Rapson root finding method is coupled with a Kreisselmeier- Steinhauser function to efficiently find the critical stalling conditions which are defined within both the CSM and PDR. The proposed tool is validated against several experimental test cases: A Fokker F 27 straight wing model in clean configuration; two 45 degrees swept-back reference wings in clean configuration; and two Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) â€™s 28 degrees swept-back wing having a variable span deployed single-slotted Fowler flap. The validation demonstrated that the maximum lift coefficient could be predicted within a 11 % error margin while requiring a computational expense of mere seconds. Erroneous stall angle results were found on swept-back wings due to the negligence of spanwise boundary layer flow effects on wing stall. Configurations with high flap deflection angles showed deficiencies due to the inability to account for the combined viscous effects which prevail in high-lift flow within a conceptual approach.

40|$|The {{perpendicular}} {{interaction of}} a streamwise vortex with an infinite span helicopter blade was modeled experimentally in incompressible flow. Three-component velocity and turbulence measurements were made using a sub-miniature four sensor hot-wire probe. Vortex core parameters (radius, peak tangential velocity, circulation, and centerline axial velocity deficit) were determined as functions of blade-vortex separation, streamwise position, blade angle of attack, vortex strength, and vortex size. The downstream {{development of the}} flow shows that {{the interaction of the}} vortex with the blade wake is the primary cause of the changes in the core parameters. The blade sheds negative vorticity into its wake {{as a result of the}} <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> generated by the passing vortex. Instability in the vortex core due to its interaction with this negative vorticity region appears to be the catalyst for the magnification of the size and intensity of the turbulent flowfield downstream of the interaction. In general, the core radius increases while peak tangential velocity decreases with the effect being greater for smaller separations. These effects are largely independent of blade angle of attack; and if these parameters are normalized on their undisturbed values, then the effects of the vortex strength appear much weaker. Two theoretical models were developed to aid in extending the results to other flow conditions. An empirical model was developed for core parameter prediction which has some rudimentary physical basis, implying usefulness beyond a simple curve fit. An inviscid flow model was also created to estimate the vorticity shed by the interaction blade, and to predict the early stages of its incorporation into the interacting vortex...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{beginning}} of manned flight, engineers have been inspired by nature in many ways. Birds have been flying in formation for as long as man remember and military aircraft followed suit. In the light of rising fuel prices, crowded airspace and stringent environmental regulations, formation flight could just be another leap forward in commercial aviation as well. This study aims to provide an insight in the implications and prerequisites of close formation flight in commercial aviation. In this research, a wake vortex model for the Boeing 747 commercial jet is developed. The optimum separation between aircraft in a formation is determined. The location of the sweet spot and the drag reduction that are determined with the wake vortex model, are in good agreement with previous research. The location of the sweet spot can however differ from off-line predictions due to e. g. wind and simplifications in the model. It is found that the classic autopilot of the B- 747 is not suitable for formation flight. A new autopilot is therefore developed and evaluated. The new autopilot is based on a multiple loop architecture and is developed for a linearized model of the B- 747 in cruise condition. It is shown that both in the linearized and the nonlinear model, the controller design complies with regulations and the aircraft successfully tracks the sweet spot under the influence of wake vortex effects. To circumvent the problem of an uncertain sweet spot location, the autopilot is extended with extremum seeking capability. By estimation and maximization of the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the aircraft automatically finds and tracks the location in which maximum drag reduction is achieved. For applications in commercial aviation, a number of practical issues is finally considered. Different strategies for sweet spot approach, formation flight in a turbulent atmosphere and multiple aircraft formations are considered and it is investigated how passenger comfort is affected. A considerable mean thrust reduction is achieved with the new autopilot set to extremum seeking, without causing disturbances to the passengers.

40|$|The high {{efficiency}} of open rotor propulsion {{has led to}} a comeback of propeller propulsion systems in recent years. The main issue preventing wide application of the technology is its high noise level. One of the main contributors to this noise is the pressure fluctuations generated during the interaction between a propeller tip vortex and a downstream surface. The goal of this research project is to create {{a better understanding of the}} vortex- surface interaction, which would allow for more effective noise mitigation strategies to be developed. An experimental approach was adopted to quantify the effect of a number of governing parameters on the pressure fluctuations over the surface induced by the vortex. Furthermore, an attempt was made to develop a conceptual model describing the vortex-surface interaction in order to study the relative contributions of the sub-phenomena of the interaction. The accuracy of the conceptual model was assessed using the data obtained from the experimental campaign. From the results it was clear that the low pressure vortex core was the primary mechanism that generated fluctuations over the surface. The vortex path was clearly visible and dominant over a large part of the chord. In the slipstream region the wake generated the largest pressure fluctuations. The effect of the wake was contained at the leading edge, up to 4 % of the wing chord. Large discrepancies between the unsteady pressure, both in magnitude and in spatial distribution, were observed. Three contributing factors to the discrepancies were identified, namely the overestimation of the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> effect, the use of the Lamb-Oseen vortex model and the method of determining the vortex core radius. These discrepancies implied that the conceptual model could not be used for its intended purposes. The results of this study show that the advance ratio and incidence angle are the most critical parameters governing the vortex-surface interaction. Although the former is difficult to incorporate into noise mitigation strategies, the latter can be used as a parameter in the initial design phase. Interestingly, the geometry of the airfoil seems to have limited effect on both the magnitude and distribution of the interaction. Although the conceptual model discussed in this report is not accurate, the development of such a simplified model would still contribute a lot to the body of knowledge. It could be used to evaluate the relative contributions of the different vortex-surface interaction sub-phenomena, or to perform a 'parameter sweep' to investigate the effect of the governing parameters on the unsteady pressure distribution and magnitude.

40|$|MVL- 15 is {{the most}} recent version of the Modified Vortex-Lattice (MVL) code {{developed}} within the Aerodynamics Systems Analysis Branch (ASAB) at NASA LaRC. The term "modified" refers to the primary modification of the core vortex-lattice methodology: inclusion of viscous aerodynamics tables that {{are linked to the}} linear solution via iterative processes. The inclusion of the viscous aerodynamics inherently converts the MVL- 15 from a purely analytic linearized method to a semi-empirical blend which retains the rapid execution speed of the linearized method while empirically characterizing the section aerodynamics at all spanwise lattice points. The modification provides a means to assess non-linear effects on lift that occur at angles of attack near stall, and provides a means to determine the drag associated with the application of design strategies for lift augmentation {{such as the use of}} flaps or blowing. The MVL- 15 code is applicable to the analyses of aircraft aerodynamics during cruise, but it is most advantageously applied to the analysis of aircraft operating in various high-lift configurations. The MVL methodology has been previously conceived and implemented; the initial concept version was delivered to the ASAB in 2001 (van Dam, C.), subsequently revised (Gelhausen, P. and Ozoroski, T. 2002 / AVID Inc., Gelhausen, P., and Roberts, M. 2004), and then overhauled (Ozoroski, T., Hahn, A. 2008). The latest version, MVL- 15 has been refined to provide analysis transparency and enhanced to meet the analysis requirements of the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project. Each revision has been implemented with reasonable success. Separate applications of the methodology are in use, including a similar in-house capability, developed by Olson, E. that is tailored for structural and acoustics analyses. A central premise of the methodology is that viscous aerodynamic data can be associated with analytic inviscid aerodynamic results at each spanwise wing section, thereby providing a pathway to map viscous data to the inviscid results. However, a number of factors can sidetrack the analysis consistency during various stages of this process. For example, it should be expected that the final airplane lift curve and drag polar results depend strongly on the geometry and aerodynamics of the airfoil section; however, flap deflections and flap chord extensions change the local reference geometry of the input airfoil, the airplane wing, the tabulated non-dimensional viscous aerodynamics, and the spanwise links between the linear and the viscous aerodynamics. These changes also affect the bound circulation and therefore, calculation and integration of the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and induced drag. MVL- 15 is configured to ensure these types of challenges are properly addressed. This report is a comprehensive manual describing the theory, use, and validation of the MVL- 15 analysis tool. Section 3 summarizes theoretical, procedural, and characteristic features of MVL- 15, and includes a list of the files required to setup, execute, and summarize an analysis. Section 4, Section 5, Section 6, and Section 7 combine to comprise the User's Guide portions of this report. The MVL- 15 input and output files are described in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively; the descriptions are supplemented with example files and information about the file formats, parameter definitions, and typical parameter values.

When it comes to moving a piston engine airplane through the air, there is no alternative to the propeller. Most commercial airliners are now driven by propeller in the form of turbofan engines and turboprop engines. Propellers are the most efficient means of aircraft propulsion. By imparting a small pressure change over a large area, propellers achieve much higher efficiency than jet engines. In the past, propellers were highly efficient at cruise speeds up to approximately Mach 0. 6. However, above this speed, large compressibility losses on the blading caused the efficiency to fall rapidly. The increase emphasis on fuel conservation has stimulated developments on propeller powered aircraft. Nowadays, advanced design concepts make possible the design of high efficiency Propeller capable of Mach 0. 8 crusing. Currently, popular numerical methods in used include the vortex lattice methods, the lifting line surface methods, are expected to provide extremely reliable predictions. The literature of propeller aerodynamics is scattered and in some respects is inconsistent and incomplete. Of basic importance for the theory and design of propellers is the treatment of propellers with load distribution for best efficiency developed by Theodorsen in a series of NACA reports and finally presented in his book published in 1948, but now long out of print. This work is a milestone in the development of the theory of propellers, but parts of it are obscure, it is not without errors, and the application to the design of an efficient propeller needs clarification. The consequence of these difficulties has been a general neglect, both in theoretical studies and in practical propeller design, of the underlying theory developed by Theodorsen. It has been shown that the ideal distribution of circulation first computed by Goldstein need not be limited to the condition of light loading as assumed by Goldstein. Nonetheless propeller design methods in current use are limited by the light loading assumption and fail to take advantage of the more general possibilities. Quite remarkable is the lack in the aeronautical literature of a complete and accurate tabulation of the Goldstein circulation function, which is essential for the design of a propeller with minimum energy loss. In general, it is a very difficult problem to compute rigorously the velocity induced by the vortex system. Theodorsen, employing an electrical analog, expanded Goldsteinâ€™s very limited tables, but his results are also limited and not very accurate. The theory of aircraft propellers, following the original development of finite wing theory, has nearly always proceeded as a lifting line analysis. That is, blade elements may be considered to act as two-dimensional foils upon which the forces are the same as would be found in a uniform two-dimensional flow with the same velocity and direction as occurs locally at the blade element. This approach to the design of blade elements is continued in the present study. The lifting line treatment does not restrict the generality of the underlying analysis of the trailing vortex system. The lifting line theory is the best known and most readily applied theory for obtaining the spanwise lift distribution of a wing and the subsequent determination of the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing from two dimensional airfoil data. The characteristics so determined are in fairly close agreement with experimental results for wings with small amounts of sweep and with moderate to high values of aspect ratio. For this reason, this theory has served as the basis for a large part of precent aeronautical knowledge. The hypothesis upon which tho theory is based is that a lifting wing can be replaced by a lifting line and that the incremental vortices ahed along the span trail behind the wing in straight lines in the direction of the free-stream velocity. The strength of these trailing vortices is proportional to the rate of change of the lift along the span. The trailing vertices induce a velocity normal to the direction of the free stream velocity and to the lifting line. The effective angle of attack of each section of the wing is therefore different frcm the geometric angle of attack by the amount of the engle (called the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack)</b> whose tangent is the ratio of the value of the induced velocity at the lifting line to the value of the free stream velocity. The effective angle of attack is thus related to the lift distribution through the <b>induced</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> In addition, the effective angle of attack is related to the section lift coefficient according to two dimensional data for the airfoil sections incorporated in the wing. Both relationships must be simultaneously satisfied in the calculation of the lift distribution of the wing. If the section lift curves are linear, these relationships may be expressed by a single equation which can be solved analytically. In general, however, the section lift curves axe not linear, particularly at high angles of attack, and analytical solutions are not feasible. The method of calculating the sponwise lift distribution using nonlinear section lift data thus becomes one of making successive approximations of the lift distribution until one is found that simultaneously satisfied the aforementioned relationships. Since the theory of propellers with minimum induced loss is founded on considerations of the trailing vortex sheet, it was thought to be necessary to present a more detailed discussion of the dynamics of vortex sheets and the consequences of their instability and roll up than is usually found in treatments of propeller aerodynamics. In this thesis, non-lineer lifting line method is used to predict the performance of a number of propellers. The objective of this thesis is to develop computer codes of vortex lattice method of lifting line analysis. The vortex lattice method approximates a lifting surface and its wake by a discrete vortex lattice system. The propeller is considered to be blades of arbitrary planeform, rotating with a constant angular velocity about a common axis in an unbounded fluid. Interaction between blades is considered. The presence of the hub is ignored. The vortex wake of the propeller is assumed to be a helix of constant pitch and diameter. This assumption is coincident with Goldsteinâ€™s helical vortex model. In both cases, the propeller is considered to be lightly loaded, and to have no slipstream contraction. As it is applied in this study, it is common for the helical vortices in the wakes of propellers, rotors to be represented computationally by a sequence of straight vortex segments. In lifting line analysis, the propeller blade is assumed sufficiently thin to be represented by distribution of horseshoe vortices lying in the mean camber surface of each blade. Steady flow conditions are assumed; the circulation is only a function of location along the radius. The induced flow at any radial location due to the horseshoe vortex is given by the Biot-Savart equation. Non-lineer numerical lifting line method takes into viscous effects and chambering account. Also it can be used for the lifting element that has dihedral angle, sweep angles and both of them. So it can be thought of as a cross-section of vortex lattice method and classical lifting line methods. A Computer program is developed that uses non-lineer numerical lifting line methods in Matlab computer language. To verify program, some applications was made on wing. Some test propeller has been choosen from literatÃ¼re to verify program on the design point. These propellers are selected from the studies of the Adkins (1994), Larrabee (1979) and Bauer (1997). In order to test the computer program around the off-design point of propellers experimental data is required. In this respect, the study of Yaggy (1960) which presents the performance data of a few propellers tested in wind tunnel is considered. One of these propellers has NACA 0009 airfoil sections. The classical theory needs section characteristics in several Reynolds number and angle of attack ranges and this data is taken from Abbott (1945) and Sheldahl (1981). YÃ¼ksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley free-flight tunnel at low-subsonic speed to determine the static stability, control effectiveness, and damping in roll and yaw of a model with a low-aspect-ratio unswept wing and two different fuselage forebodies at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 0 deg to 90 deg. Results were obtained with a fuselage configuration having a long pointed nose and a shorter rounded nose. Although the wing stalled at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 12 deg, maximum lift did not occur until an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 40 deg or 50 deg was obtained. The static longitudinal stability of the model having a short rounded nose was greater than that of the model having a longer pointed nose over the entire angle-of-attack range.
