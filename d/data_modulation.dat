Five constructions are presented, and it is shown how such sequence families {{have the ability to}} transport a larger amount of data as well as enable variable-rate signalling on the reverse link. Canonical family CQ has period N, normalized maximum-correlation parameter theta_max bounded above by A sqrt(N), where 'A' ranges from 1. 8 in the 16 -QAM case to 3. 0 for large M. In a CDMA setting, each user is enabled to transfer 2 m bits of data per period of the spreading sequence which can be increased to 3 m bits of data by halving the size of the sequence family. The technique used to construct CQ is easily extended to produce larger sequence families and an example is provided.
