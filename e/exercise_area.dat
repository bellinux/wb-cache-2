5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and <b>exercise</b> <b>area</b> for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|This list {{contains}} the 62churches {{cared for by}} the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England, covering the counties of Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. The majority are rural village churches, often with declining populations. In one extreme case at Imber in Wiltshire, part of the British Army's training grounds on the Salisbury Plain, the entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an <b>exercise</b> <b>area</b> for American troops preparing for the invasion of Europe during the Second World War. Non-military access to the Church of St Giles has been limited to several open days a year since then. Some of the churches are in major centres of population, such as St Martin's Church in Exeter and the Church of St John the Baptist in Bristol. Many of the churches are built on the sites of earlier places of worship, but the oldest building in the list is the Old Church of St Nicholas at Uphill, Somerset, which is largely roofless but is still occasionally used for services. The most recent is St Mary's Church in South Tidworth, Wiltshire, which was built in 1878. Some of the buildings, such as St Mary's Church in Wilton, Wiltshire, are partially ruined, but many have impressive interiors, often dating back several hundred years. St John the Baptist Church in Inglesham, Wiltshire, has wall paintings and other churches have highly decorated pulpits or reredos. Many still host Anglican services, but others are used by different denominations or have been converted for secular use. St Thomas à Becket Church in Pensford, Somerset, has {{been converted into a}} private house, however the tower remains in the care of the trust. St Paul's Church in Bristol is now used as a performance space and circus skills school, Circomedia, but remains consecrated.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This study explores the design {{requirements}} of the <b>exercise</b> <b>areas</b> of the International Space Station (ISS) in terms of physical and behavioral requirements. The main focus {{of the study is}} to understand the interactions of the crew members with the exercise equipment. Besides, the interior and environmental conditions of the <b>exercise</b> <b>areas</b> in the station as well as interaction of the exercise activities with the other activities are considered. In this study, how well users’ expectations fulfilled by the designers are discussed. It is found that some user needs are disregarded, because of the space, time and power constraints imposed by the station. However, in this study it is determined that design solutions can be generated both regarding the user needs and the constraints imposed by the station. Through out the study, some problems are figured out affecting both the physiological and psychological well being of the crew members. Some guidelines are suggested accordingly that can be useful for designers in designing <b>exercise</b> <b>areas</b> for space for further missions. In addition, this study indicates the lack of in-depth qualitative studies that explores users’ physical and behavioral needs in the <b>exercise</b> <b>areas</b> in the ISS. Yılmaz, AslıM. S...|$|R

2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Dayton, Ohio, Schilling was raised by a single mother {{alongside}} two other siblings.
