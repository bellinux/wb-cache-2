50|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} on location in Boston. Eastwood claimed that the three lead actors were his <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> for the roles.|$|R
50|$|On November 4, 2008, {{voters in}} the town of Telluride, Colorado, passed an {{ordinance}} with 67% of the vote to adopt IRV for the next three mayoral elections, starting in November 2011 if three candidates file for the office. The system was used for the city's 2011 mayoral election. The incumbent mayor Stu Fraser was re-elected by securing a majority of <b>first</b> <b>choices.</b> In the 2015 mayoral election, Sean Murphy handily won an open seat election for mayor after trailing in <b>first</b> <b>choices.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 14 August 2010, Given {{was dropped}} from the Manchester City {{starting}} XI for their opening league game against Tottenham and replaced by Joe Hart. Hart became City's permanent <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> keeper, although Given played enough during the season to receive an FA Cup winners' medal. He challenged Hart to the <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> spot, though missed out and was resigned to bench duties for the 2010–11 Premier League campaign. His only domestic appearance came in a defeat to West Brom in the League Cup. He played two Europa League matches that season as well.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{medications}} and mechanical devices are the <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> in treatment {{because they are}} less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
5|$|Paul Newman was {{unanimously}} the <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> for {{the role}} of John Rooney. The actor prepared by requesting Frank McCourt, the Irish-American author of Angela's Ashes, to record a tape of his voice.|$|E
50|$|Nauru Borda, {{relative}} to normal Borda, places {{a much stronger}} emphasis on <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> over second choices, which is why Catherine did so poorly under that system.|$|R
5000|$|Bucklin {{was used}} for multiwinner elections. [...] For multi-member districts, voters marked as many <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> as there are seats to be filled. Voters marked {{the same number of}} second and further choices. In some localities, the voter was {{required}} to mark a full set of <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> for his or her ballot to be valid. However, allowing voters to cast three simultaneous votes for three seats could allow an organized 51% to win all three seats in the first round, so this method does not give proportional representation.|$|R
50|$|Many of the country's {{brightest}} talents choose IUT {{among their}} <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> in National University Entrance Exams. The university offers degrees in B.S., M.Sc., and PhD levels, in branches of Science and Engineering.|$|R
5|$|Roddenberry's {{favorite}} for Riker was Jonathan Frakes, {{who went through}} seven auditions before claiming the role. Despite being the second choice of the casting team, he was hired after their <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> was unimpressive in his auditions.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
5|$|After {{a strong}} {{start to the}} {{following}} season for both club and player, Jarvis injured his hamstring in the defeat to Reading on 30 September 2008 and {{was expected to be}} out of action for approximately six weeks.

50|$|John Abraham and Shilpa Shetty {{were the}} <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> to play Jignesh and Shilpa, respectively. After Abraham refused {{to play the}} role of Jignesh, Shetty decided she didn't want to play Shilpa and backed out, too.|$|R
50|$|In July 2012, the Ward Five race {{again was}} vacant. In another {{three-way}} race, first-time candidate Jarrett Smith was elected. After securing 44% of <b>first</b> <b>choices,</b> Smith won {{a majority in}} the instant runoff against Eric Hensal.|$|R

5|$|After another {{successful}} {{campaign with}} the Crusaders in 2003 (reaching the Super 12 finals), McCaw was again selected as <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> openside flanker for the All Blacks. In June {{he was involved}} in a narrow 13–15 defeat at home to England, was a non-playing reserve in a 55–3 victory against Wales and played in a 31–23 win over France.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{had used}} a mix of reserve players and {{starting}} (<b>first</b> <b>choice)</b> players in previous tournament matches, but for the final neither team used reserve players in their starting lineups. Seattle took the field in a 4-4-2 formation while D.C United was in a 3-4-3 formation. The match kicked off at 7:37pm local time.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{was once}} again the <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> goalkeeper under his former Juventus coach and Trapattoni's {{replacement}} Marcello Lippi, as Italy finished first in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group. Although his place in Italy's 2006 World Cup was initially in doubt, as he was being investigated for possible involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, he was later named by Lippi as Italy's starting goalkeeper for the tournament.|$|E
50|$|Worry was {{so named}} by its {{citizens}} who were worried after postal authorities had rejected their <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> for a town name. A post office was established as Worry in 1888, and remained in operation {{until it was}} discontinued in 1944.|$|R

5|$|Except for the <b>first</b> <b>choice,</b> the Wanderer has {{the choice}} of {{introducing}} the modified FEV into the purifier or not, which further affects the ending. Whatever the choice, a bright light enshrouds all, and an ending slideshow begins, including any actions they took that had an influence on the wasteland.|$|E
5|$|Fincher's <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> for {{the role}} of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was too young {{for the role}}. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E
5|$|Glatzer and Westmoreland were {{approached}} by Lex Lutzus and James Brown to adapt Genova's novel in 2011, when Glatzer {{had just been}} diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moore was their <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> for the lead role; she researched Alzheimer's disease for four months {{to prepare for the}} part. The film was shot in New York in March 2014, with a budget of $4 million.|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that taste ratings of {{repeatedly}} chosen pralines decrease more when the gift box is large compared to small. Within their <b>first</b> <b>choices</b> consumers select the most preferred praline less often from the large assortment. These results {{are discussed in the}} light of variety seeking and dysfunctional choice...|$|R

5|$|Justin Hartley plays Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), the CEO of Queen Industries {{and leader}} {{of a small group}} of superheroes. Hartley, a {{recurring}} guest in the sixth and seventh seasons, became a series regular in season eight and was the producers' <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> to play Oliver Queen. He was designed to shake up Clark and Lois in season six and to give Clark an alternate view of how to fight crime.|$|E
5|$|Leonid Kinskey as Sascha, the Russian {{bartender}} {{infatuated with}} Yvonne. He {{was born into}} a Jewish family in Russia and had immigrated to the United States. He told Aljean Harmetz, author of Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca, that he was cast because he was Bogart's drinking buddy. He was not the <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> for the role; he replaced Leo Mostovoy, who was deemed not funny enough.|$|E
5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not <b>first</b> <b>choice</b> treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{was unsure}} whether {{to release the}} film in theaters or direct-to-video. The studio was {{interested}} in Matthew McConaughey as Sparrow because of his resemblance to Burt Lancaster, who had inspired that script's interpretation of the character. If they chose to release it direct-to-video, Christopher Walken or Cary Elwes would have been their <b>first</b> <b>choices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{group was}} {{influential}} to early house and techno music, because of sampling by many artists, including Todd Terry and The Jungle Brothers, mostly from <b>First</b> <b>Choice's</b> 1977 track, [...] "Let No Man Put Asunder". [...] "Let No Man Put Asunder" [...] was also covered by Mary J. Blige on her 1999 album Mary.|$|R
