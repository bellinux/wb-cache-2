40|$|The {{onset of}} an illness such as acute lympho¬blastic leukemia in {{pediatric}} oncology {{is considered a}} traumatic event, {{not only for the}} child, but also for parents accompanying their child’s difficult thera¬peutic process; a child’s cancer is seen as a “family illness” with consequences that affect all its members. The psychological trauma, within a socio-constructivist and semiotics perspective of the mind, is related to the sudden and unexpected alteration of the basic elements that regulate the relationship between the subjects and the external world and to a crisis of the meaning processes that support the personal life story. This crisis of meaning destabilizes the subjective time perspective which is characterized by divisions, fractures, fragmentation, uncertainty towards the future, feeling of <b>interruption</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> of life, inability to reformulate past experiences that may persist over time. The narrative becomes the most important device to support meaning-making processes and for the reconfiguration of time perspectives aimed at supporting the traumatic experience, healing and development. Within the narrative paradigm, researchers highlight the existence of different types of narratives: narratives that fulfill a transformative function and integration of experiences and the construction of new meanings and narratives that do not pertain to that function. The narrative {{and the quality of the}} narrative output, in its form and in its content, convey different narrative functions that become indicators of a good, or not, process of construction of the meaning of experiences and integration of traumatic experiences. In our opinion we believe that the narrative output does not always it is transformative and healthy for the subject and therefore we consider necessary that the narrative, as a process, can be configured, within clinical settings, such as drivers of the transformation of meanings and regulation of the experiences. More frequently it is observed as the traumatic experience, especially in its beginning stage, be involved in and be put into words, we could say physiologically, to a disorganized and chaotic narrative. We believe that this represents a physiological passage where the narrative is disorganized or chaotic, however, a way of meaning and a way to manage the phases of shock and annihilation related to the beginning stages of such conditions. Our aim is to reflect on the construction of a diachronic model capable to highlight the narrative functions of support to the process of meaning-making for parents that accompany the traumatic experience of a ill child. Integrating the contributions proposed by the narrative therapy and our research findings we present a narrative model, a set of compasses that guide the process of meaning-making of the traumatic experience, where the narration, in being a clinical device, fulfills and carries out various supportive functions to the meaning-making processes: Putting the Shattering and Annihilating Experience Into Words; Reordering the Events; Connecting Emotions and Events; Reevaluating the Event; Reconstructing the Time Process. In the first time, the narrative device contains and gives legitimacy to the pain without being able to scare and then fulfills a reconstructive and transformative function. Identify the different functions do not represent an ideal model of narrative into which lead parents but bushes and trajectories that can guide the clinical action towards subjective development areas. The operation of the fragmentation of narrative functions responds to a logic aimed at breaking up functions to re-construct the process. We believe that the promotion of the elaboration of the traumatic experience is the sum and the synergy of all aforementioned narrative functions designed to make past the experience and be able to build new meanings, on the basis of experience, and new synthesis between continuity and discontinuity of life. We believe that this diachronic support should not develop within a predetermined time or at least that this can not be defined a priori in a generalized way, but we can say that it develops in relation to the time of the illness and to the transiency of the meanings in the flow of time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions are {{a feature}} of work in most complex sociotechnical systems in which people must handle {{multiple}} threads of work. Over the last 10 - 15 {{years there has been}} a crescendo of reviews and investigations into the impact that <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions have on safety-critical aspects of healthcare work, such as medication administration, but findings are still inconclusive. Despite this, many healthcare communities have taken steps to reduce <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions in safety-critical work tasks, a step that will usually do no harm but that may have unintended consequences. Investigations with a higher yield of certainty would provide better evidence and better guidance to healthcare communities. In this viewpoint paper we survey some key papers reporting investigations of <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions in the field, in simulators, and in the laboratory. We also survey reports of field interventions aimed at minimizing <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions with the intention of improving the safety of medication administration and other safety-critical healthcare tasks. To analyse the papers adopting each form of investigation, we use the three dimensions of fidelity, formal control exercised, and the potential generalizability to the field. We argue that studies of <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions outside the healthcare clinical context, but intended to generalize to it, should become more formally representative of the cognitive context of healthcare work. Research would be improved if investigators undertook programs of studies that successively achieve fidelity, control, and potential generalizability, or if they strengthened the design of individual studies...|$|R

The data is taken from a debate show because in a debate, interruptions are even expected. In conducting this research, the writer applies qualitative approach.

Descriptive statistics and univariable linear regression were used to determine the effects of the tabard, combined with personal inquiry and a focus group to find out experiences with the tabard. A total of 313 medication administrations were observed. Significant reductions in both <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> MAEs were found after implementation of the tabards.

Design and participants Pre- and postintervention observational study of nurses undertaking medication rounds. Setting Acute Medical Admissions Unit (AMAU) of a 1000 -bed teaching hospital. Intervention A set of measures previously proven successful in reducing <b>interruptions</b> (behaviour modification <b>and</b> staff education; checklists; visible symbols {{in the form of a}} red vest; and signage) were adapted and introduced onto the AMAU. Main outcome measures Rate of <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions pre- and postintervention overall and for each individual source of interruption. Results There was a highly significant association (p< 0. 0001) between the overall interruption/distraction rate and the pre-/postintervention studies, with the rate of interruptions postintervention being 0. 43 times that of the preintervention level. When individual sources of <b>interruptions</b> <b>and</b> distractions were compared pre- and postintervention, a significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the interruption/distraction rate was found for five of the 11 categories assessed.
