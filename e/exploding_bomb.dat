5|$|Upon graduation, Birdy and Al {{enlist in}} the United States Army and serve in the Vietnam War, during which Birdy is placed in a mental {{hospital}} after being missing in action for a month. A flashback reveals {{that he was the}} sole survivor of a helicopter crash. Al is hospitalized in the same facility, his face heavily bandaged for injuries that he sustained from an <b>exploding</b> <b>bomb.</b> Major Weiss, Birdy's doctor, informs Al that although Birdy's injuries are relatively minor, he has not spoken since he was found. Al speaks to Birdy at length, but grows increasingly frustrated by his lack of response. He is then elated when Birdy smiles at a joke he makes. Weiss dismisses the response as dissociative behavior.|$|E
25|$|Holding an <b>exploding</b> <b>bomb</b> {{together}} {{is the greatest}} challenge of fission weapon design. The heat of fission rapidly expands the fission core, spreading apart the target nuclei and making space for the neutrons to escape without being captured. The chain reaction stops.|$|E
25|$|The optimal way {{to store}} {{deuterium}} in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride. But the lithium-6 isotope {{is also the}} raw material for tritium production, and an <b>exploding</b> <b>bomb</b> is a nuclear reactor. Radiation implosion will hold everything together long enough to permit the complete conversion of lithium-6 into tritium, while the bomb explodes. So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the D-T fusion reaction without any pre-manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary. The tritium production constraint disappears.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{inside the}} <b>exploding</b> <b>bomb,</b> the free {{neutrons}} released by fission carry away about 3% {{of the initial}} fission energy. Neutron kinetic energy adds to the blast energy of a bomb, but not as effectively as the energy from charged fragments, since neutrons are not slowed as quickly. The main contribution of fission neutrons to the bomb's power is the initiation of other fissions. Over half of the neutrons escape the bomb core, but the rest strike U-235 nuclei causing them to fission in an exponentially growing chain reaction (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). Starting from one atom, the number of fissions can theoretically double a hundred times in a microsecond, which could consume all uranium or plutonium up to hundreds of tons by the hundredth link in the chain. In practice, bombs do not contain hundreds of tons of uranium or plutonium. Instead, typically (in a modern weapon) {{the core of a}} weapon contains only about 5 kilograms of plutonium, of which only 2 to 2.5 kilograms, representing 40 to 50 kilotons of energy, undergoes fission before the core blows itself apart.|$|E

[...] It was fitted with an improvised armament {{of a pair of}} rifles mounted {{on the side of the}} fuselage, angled outwards to avoid the propeller, together with the pilot's revolver. [...] It was one of the fastest aircraft available in the early months of the war, with it being said that:"Its speed enabled it to circle around the enemy machines and gave it a decided ascendancy." [...] It remained in use with 3 Squadron until March 1915, when it was damaged by an <b>exploding</b> <b>bomb</b> and was sent back to England.|$|E

Barnet, who came within forty miles of Paris early in October, is concerned chiefly with his account of the social confusion of the country-side and the problems of his command, but he speaks of heaped cloud masses of steam. 'All along the sky to the south-west' and of a red glare beneath these at night. Parts of Paris were still burning, and numbers of people were camped in the fields even at this distance watching over treasured heaps of salvaged loot. He speaks too of the distant rumbling of the explosion--'like trains going over iron bridges.' ...|$|E

40|$|Unexploded aerial Bombs, {{also known}} as duds or unfused bombs, of the bombardments in the past wars remain {{explosive}} for decades after the war under the earth’s surface threatening the civil activities especially if dredging works are involved. Interpretation of the aerial photos taken shortly after bombardments has been proven to be useful for finding the duds. Unfortunately, the reliability of this method is limited by some factors. The chance of finding a dud on an aerial photo depends strongly on the photography system, {{the size of the}} bomb and the landcover. On the other hand, <b>exploded</b> <b>bombs</b> are considerably better detectable on aerial photos and confidently represent the extent and density of a bombardment. Considering an empirical quota of unfused bombs, the expected number of duds can be calculated by the number of <b>exploded</b> <b>bombs.</b> This can help to have a better calculation of cost-risk ratio and to classify the areas for clearance. This article is about a method for calculation of a per parcel probability of dud bombs according to the distribution and density of <b>exploded</b> <b>bombs.</b> No similar work has been reported in this field by other authors...|$|R
