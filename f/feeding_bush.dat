50|$|Creosote bush walkingsticks are herbivores, <b>feeding</b> on {{creosote}} <b>bush</b> leaves, chunari leaves, {{and various}} other plants. Common predators of the walkingsticks include birds and lizards. Creosote bush walkingsticks are fairly common, {{but because they are}} nocturnal and very well camouflaged, they are hard to spot. They inhabit deserts and cactus forests. They are found in the Sonoran Desert, which extends throughout much of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico.|$|R
50|$|It has {{a fairly}} high {{resistance}} to most sheep diseases and also good tolerance against internal parasites. The Damara sheep has a diverse diet. It <b>feeds</b> on grass, <b>bush</b> and shrubs and can almost {{be classified as}} a browser. Research has indicated that up to 64% of the diet of the Damara sheep can consist of browsing material. This places the Damara in the same feeding category as goats.|$|R
50|$|The painted tiger parrot {{occurs in}} montane and subalpine forests and shrub at {{elevations}} of 2,400-4,000 m. Often, this species {{is seen in}} cautiously <b>feeding</b> in low <b>bushes,</b> eating a variety of seeds, berries, and small fruits of dacrydium conifers. It is also known to feed alongside Madarasz's tiger parrot. When startled, it flies into the canopy. This species is usually seen in pairs of groups of up to six birds.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed batis is solitary or seen in pairs, {{spending}} time in the canopy of bushes, moving about restlessly, foraging in the shade {{in the middle of}} the <b>bush.</b> <b>Feeds</b> on insects. The breeding biology is little known, the male may perform a courtship flight but this record may have referred to a pygmy batis. Cup nest made of bark strips and spider webs, concealed in the central fork of a thorn tree, in which 2-3 pale blue eggs are laid.|$|R
50|$|Adult argali eat 16 - 19 kg of food a day. The {{vegetation}} {{preferred by}} the species varies based on elevation and area. In higher elevations, they predominantly eat grasses, sedges, and forbs. At midelevation habitats, they more regularly <b>feed</b> on <b>bushes</b> and mesophyte grasses. In the lowest ranges and the spurs of deserts, grasses and sedges again predominate, but often of different species than the high-elevation ones. In north-central Kazakhstan, sprouts, leaves, flowers, and fruits are significant to the diet all year, whereas {{they appear to}} be a rare dietary supplement over the rest of the range. Water is needed by argali, which is rarely a problem for animals living at high elevation, where melting snow and small waterways are regularly encountered. In drier climes, argali may travel several kilometers in search of water. When available, argali readily consume saline soil.|$|R
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in {{groups on the}} top of the host plant's leaves. The {{caterpillar}} <b>feeds</b> on currant <b>bush</b> (Apophyllum anomalum), scrub caper berry (Capparis arborea), dog caper (Capparis canescens), nipan (Capparis lasiantha), Australian native orange (Capparis mitchellii), wild orange (Capparis sepiaria), Australian native caper (Capparis spinosa) and bush orange (Capparis umbonata). Unlike other caterpillars of its size the B. java feeds on a fairly minimal amount of food, making it less of an agricultural pest than the others. The caterpillars feed for about three weeks until fully grown and pupate. They emerge around December in much of their range.|$|R

40|$|Chantier qualité GAThe {{significance}} of clubbed antennae in grasshoppers {{was assessed by}} investigating the sensilla repertoire of 15 gomphocerine species. The influence of the diet type (graminivorous or polyphagous) and the apical thickening of antenna {{on the number of}} sensilla were tested. It appears that the antennal thickening has a stronger impact on the number of sensilla than the food mode. The species bearing clubbed antennae are globally low in olfactive and contact sensilla, maybe in relation with a more complex courtship, but are richer in mechanoreceptors, probably involved in the control of antenna movements. The food mode change from oligophagy to polyphagy is not associated to {{an increase in the number}} of olfactive or contact sensilla. In contrast, the high number of these sensilla in a monophagous grasshopper <b>feeding</b> on Ulex <b>bushes</b> is interpreted in the context of alkaloid detection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Due to the {{beneficial}} of the bushing form, the connection length and clamping strength is increased in friction drilling of thin-walled cast materials. In this experimental study 2400, 3600, and 4800 rpm spindle speeds, 50, 75, and 100 mm/min feed rates, 240, 360, and 480 tool conical angles were selected. 2, 4, and 6 mm thicknesses of A 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloys and St 37 steel materials were drilled with using 10 mm diameter HSS (High Speed Steel) and WC (Tungsten Carbide) rotating conical tools which have 16 mm cylindrical region length. I was analysed the surface roughness, bushing height and bushing sheet thickness {{according to the}} spindle speed, feed rate, tool conical angle, workpiece material thickness, both workpiece and tool material types parameters. Consequently {{it was discovered that}} in friction drilling of 2 mm thickness A 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloy, the bushing was formed as petal shape, which limited providing connection length and clamping strength owing to the brittleness of the material. In friction drilling of brittle materials, {{there were a lot of}} cracks generated on the bushing shape. The minimum surface roughness values were obtained at 3600 rpm spindle speed and 75 mm/min feed rate conditions friction drilling of St 37 steel material. The surface roughness values of A 7075 -T 651 aluminium alloys were higher than St 37 steel materials. In conditions decreasing the spindle speeds, tool conical angles, and increasing <b>feed</b> rates, the <b>bushing</b> height was increased and bushing wall thickness was decreased...|$|R
40|$|Yam (Dioscoreaspp.) is {{a primary}} {{agricultural}} commodity and a traditional staple food over much of West and Central Africa, where it is highly profitable both for producers and traders especially when production and storage strategies are successful in securing the supply of urban markets throughout the year. Insect pests such as mealybugs of the genus Planococcus Ferris (Hem. : Pseudococcidae) and the scale Aspidiellahartii (Cockerell) (Hem. : Diaspididae) can become major constrains causing significant yield losses both {{in the field and}} in storage. Detailed information on the pest status of the scale insects on yams and farmers' knowledge and perceptions of these insects were assessed in two surveys carried out in central and southern Benin in May and December 2009. In the May survey, covering 134 sites and 68 villages, scale infestations were found in 68 % of yam stores and sales points with in average 41 % of the tubers infested. Lower incidence and infestation rates were observed at the main harvest period in December when scale and mealybug infestations were found in 56 % of the 102 fields from 68 villages with an average of 23 % infested tubers, indicating that scale and mealybug infestations are initiated in the field. Aspidiellahartii tended to become proportionally more important in stores increasing from 9 to 40 % of the recovered scale insect pests. In both surveys the percentage of mixed infestations remained relatively low - at 13 and 5 % for the first and second survey respectively. Structured questionnaires performed at every site showed that almost all farmers and traders were able to recognize yam scales and mealybugs and ranked both groups equally in importance as pests. The presence of the scale insects was generally regarded as having a negative impact on the quality of stored tubers, especially their germination rate when used as seeds for planting new fields. Whereas all cultivars seemed to be at risk from scale insects, late varieties, appeared to be more susceptible than other varieties. Farmers estimated an average of 22 % reduction of the total yield and 23 % reduction in planting material due to scale insect infestations. Tuber rot, theft, cattle <b>feed</b> and <b>bush</b> fire were recurrently cited as the most important problems of stored yams. Interestingly, 66 % of the questioned farmers believed scale infestations have been on the rise over the last few years, {{while at the same time}} the length of fallow periods were on the decline primarily because of increasing pressure on the land which might suggest a relationship between scale infestation and fallow period. Farmers, however, differed considerably in their admission that such a relationship is real. Taken together, both field evidence and farmers perceptions of scale insect infestations on yams are a first and valuable step in the development of appropriate management practices to reduce yam losses due to scale insect infestations. Control options are presently limited to preventive actions such as early harvest, culling of infested tubers, selective early consumption, and production of yam chips.
