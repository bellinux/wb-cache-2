25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from Los Angeles to New York City.|$|E
25|$|With no {{two-point}} conversion option (that {{would not}} be adopted by the league until 1993), Cleveland needed two scores to come back. Pagel led the Browns 71 yards to score on his 2-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, cutting the score to 24–23 with 31 seconds left. Cleveland attempted an onside kick, which they failed to recover, but got another chance due to an Oilers penalty. Then the Browns recovered, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over again due to a penalty against them. Finally on the third try, Cleveland was penalized for touching the ball before it went 10 yards, resulting in a penalty that gave Houston the ball and the win.|$|E
25|$|But {{he begged}} the Court's indulgence because under Kenosha v. Bruno, {{another one of}} the cases {{following}} Monroe, if the school district had the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as a municipality Doyle could not seek equitable relief such as his reinstatement against the board as an entity; he would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> against the members personally. If the case were remanded in its present state, he said, he would be unable to proceed even if he won on all the other issues. Since Congress had changed the federal-question statute since Bivens, he felt that created the implied cause of action from the enabling language in the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, for {{the second}} time, Lee was {{dividing}} his army. Jackson would lead his Second Corps of 28,000 men around to attack the Union right flank while Lee exercised personal command of the remaining two divisions, about 13,000 men and 24 guns facing the 70,000 Union troops at Chancellorsville. For the plan to work, several things had to happen. First, Jackson {{had to make a}} 12-mile (19km) march via roundabout roads to reach the Union right, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> undetected. Second, Hooker had to stay tamely on the defensive. Third, Early would have to keep Sedgwick bottled up at Fredericksburg, despite the four-to-one Union advantage there. And when Jackson launched his attack, he had to hope that the Union forces were unprepared.|$|E
25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night in Grimshank's room and waking up as humans, Kröd and his men steal the vial of tears, throw the canine tooth {{out the window and}} tie up Grimshank. Kröd reveals to Aneka (India de Beaufort) and Ralph Longshaft (James Murray) that Grimshank is a traitor, but Grimshank insists he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so that he could get close to Dongalor and stop him. Aneka is thrilled Kröd is still alive, but when Longshaft reveals that he and Aneka have been having sex, a disheartened Kröd gives him the Pagan tears, much to Grimshank's horror. Suddenly, Dongalor arrives with his army and Longshaft, who reveals himself to be the true traitor, gives him the tears. Kröd says the tears are fake and that he simply was trying to expose the real traitor, but Dongalor calls out his guards and takes the real tears from Kröd (Krod tries to swallow the vial, but ends up choking it up into Dongalor's hands: Aneka, Longshaft and Dongalor's advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) then make cutting remarks about what he could have done with the vial). An annoyed Grimshank explains he planned to give the tears to Dongalor then use his powers to turn the weapon against him, but that he is now powerless without his canine tooth and cannot help. However, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce arrive to fend off the guards and a battle ensues.|$|E

500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> ourselves, because no one else would do it for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared {{with its}} predecessor, {{the game was}} more {{advanced}} in nearly all technological aspects. Koichi Nakamura programmed with several students, but since {{it was his first}} time working with a team, he didn't know how to delegate work or communicate his goals. Since the students were unfamiliar with the coding process, they {{did not know how to}} debug or to keep track of whose code it came from, so Nakamura <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> himself, which caused delays. In programming, they did the maps first. Then they worked on characters, including numbered characters in maps for assigned lines, and designed the NPC's moving route. The next step was programming the items, while the final step was setting the monsters data and converting Toriyama's artwork. [...] This work was completed by the end of October.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at Record Two Studio in Comptche, California. While recording the song, {{it began to}} develop differently from the original vision. Pike stated that the [...] "song was getting slower and slower and then it got weird. We started tripping out and second guessing ourselves." [...] Recording the album was difficult. Pike recalled that [...] "there was so much to memorize for that album, and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in like three different sections because a reel-to-reel only holds 22 minutes. It was really cool, {{but it was one}} of the hardest things I've ever done in in my life." [...] Sleep were in the studio for one month then went home to rehearse and returned for another month. Pike noted that they ended up with two or three different versions of the song.|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could {{keep an eye out for}} her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E
500|$|Completing {{the main}} cast, Patrick Wymark stars as Jason Webb, {{director}} of EUROSEC. Having selected {{him on the}} basis of his performance as John Wilder in the television series The Plane Makers (1963–65) and The Power Game (1965–70), Anderson stated that Wymark's acting impressed him as much as Hendry's, but also that his similar drinking habits resulted in slurred lines on set. During the filming of one scene, Wymark [...] "had to list these explanations... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over and over again." [...] Archer and Hearn identify Wymark's portrayal of Webb, a character described as [...] "John Wilder (2069 model)" [...] in publicity material, as the dominant performance of the film. The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology, who is now romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby.|$|E

500|$|Mechthild Gretsch {{describes}} Israel as [...] "one of {{the most}} learned men in Europe", and Lapidge says that he was [...] "an accomplished grammarian and poet, {{and one of the}} few scholars of his time to have first-hand knowledge of Greek". Greek scholarship was so rare in western Europe during this period that in the 870s Anastasius the Librarian was unable to find anyone competent to edit his translation of a text from Greek, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> himself. Israel wrote on theology and collected works of medicine. In the 940s he became interested in the Irish philosopher John Scottus Eriugena, and commented on his works in a manuscript which survives in Saint Petersburg. In a manuscript glossing Porphyry's Isagoge, he recommended John's Periphyseon. His redaction of a commentary on Donatus's Ars Minor was a major teaching text in the Middle Ages, and still in print in the twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in {{different}} stages of production.

So, we took the plunge {{at the end of}} 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Cal Ripken Sr. {{replaced}} the retired Weaver {{as manager of}} the Orioles {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season. That year, Ripken Sr. became the first manager to write two of his sons into the lineup card when both Ripken Jr. and his brother and fellow Oriole, Billy Ripken, played in the same game on July 11. Later in the season, Ripken Sr. decided to take Ripken Jr. out of the game on September 14, in a blow-out loss to the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium. Ron Washington replaced him in the eighth inning, ending Ripken's streak of 8,243consecutive innings played. Ripken Sr. called the streak a [...] "burden" [...] after the game, saying, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> sometime." [...] Consecutive innings streaks have not always been recorded, but Ripken's remains unchallenged by historians. Ripken finished the year batting a career-low [...]252, but he still hit 27 home runs, had 98 RBI, and walked a career-high 81 times. He also recorded a [...]982 fielding percentage.|$|E
