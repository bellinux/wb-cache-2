5000|$|In this example, {{the range}} being queried (x = 2, ..., 3, y = 2, ..., 6) is {{indicated}} by the dotted rectangle. Its highest Z-value (MAX) is 45. In this example, the value F = 19 is encountered when searching a data structure in increasing Z-value direction, so {{we would have to}} search in the interval between F and MAX (<b>hatched</b> <b>area).</b> To speed up the search, one would calculate the next Z-value which is in the search range, called BIGMIN (36 in the example) and only search in the interval between BIGMIN and MAX (bold values), thus skipping most of the <b>hatched</b> <b>area.</b> Searching in decreasing direction is analogous with LITMAX which is the highest Z-value in the query range lower than F. The BIGMIN problem has first been stated and its solution shown in Tropf and Herzog. This solution is also used in UB-trees ("GetNextZ-address"). As the approach does not depend on the one dimensional data structure chosen, there is still free choice of structuring the data, so well known methods such as balanced trees can be used to cope with dynamic data (in contrast for example to R-trees where special considerations are necessary). Similarly, this independence makes it easier to incorporate the method into existing databases.|$|E

5000|$|Working on foot, a few {{groups of}} Native Americans at times used fires to channel an entire herd of buffalo over a cliff, killing {{far more than}} they could use. The Olsen-Chubbuck archaeological site in Colorado reveals some techniques, {{which may or may}} not have been widely used. The method {{involves}} skinning down the back in order to get at the tender meat just beneath the surface, the area known as the [...] "hatched area." [...] After the removal of the <b>hatched</b> <b>area,</b> the front legs are cut off as well as the shoulder blades. Doing so exposes the hump meat (in the Wood Bison), as well as the meat of the ribs and the Bison's inner organs. After everything was exposed, the spine was then severed and the pelvis and hind legs removed. Finally, the neck and head were removed as one. This allowed for the tough meat to be dried and made into pemmican.|$|E

25|$|The {{realm of}} birds is {{particularly}} plentiful. Amrum counts {{among the most}} important <b>hatching</b> <b>areas</b> for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining <b>hatching</b> <b>area</b> for the Eurasian curlew in the Wadden Sea, and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, common gull and the lesser black-backed gull as well as many other species use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mud flats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where sea gulls and ducks are breeding. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast swarms of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, brent goose or sanderling, all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.|$|R
5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the <b>hatches,</b> and these <b>areas</b> must be reinforced. Often, <b>hatch</b> <b>areas</b> are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|R
