25|$|Working class houses {{comparable}} {{in space and}} number of rooms to the Ripley Ville houses started {{to be built in}} Bowling from about 1895 and were built in large numbers between 1900 and 1914. From about 1906 they usually had a bathroom with a WC on the first floor. Use of a transverse staircase as opposed to the longitudinal staircase in the Ripley Ville houses allowed access to a bathroom in addition to the rear bedroom. Retro fitting of bathrooms to the earlier houses of this type was accomplished by partitioning the rear bedroom. The transverse staircases were very steep compared to the Ripley Ville staircases and had no <b>direct</b> <b>lighting.</b> In most houses of this period attic bedrooms were lit only by skylights and did not have fireplaces. Although this type of house was comparable to the Ripley Ville houses of a half century earlier some aspects of the design were less satisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{certain cases}} an {{over-illumination}} lighting technique may be needed. For example, indirect lighting {{is often used}} to obtain a [...] "softer" [...] look, since hard <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> is generally found less desirable for certain surfaces, such as skin. The indirect lighting method is perceived as more cozy and suits bars, restaurants and living quarters. It is also possible to block the <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> effect by adding softening filters or other solutions, though intensity will be reduced.|$|E
30|$|The light {{blockage}} model {{introduced in}} Section “ 3 D scene reconstruction with light blockage model” assumes that a <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> path exists for any fixture-sensor pair. Thus, we install all sensors {{on the walls}} to make this assumption true. Apart from this assumption, we also assume that the <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> path is the dominating path, such that any changes in the diffuse reflection paths can be ignored relative to {{the changes in the}} <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> path. This assumption is mostly true, but may fail in some special cases. For example, when there is a large mirror in the room, there will be specular reflection paths. These specular reflection paths should be as important as <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> paths, and cannot be ignored.|$|R

A variety of materials and textures are used in the building floors and walls to allow for more efficient orientation.

50|$|It is {{recommended}} that if poles are stored or displayed indoors, then they should have minimal exposure to <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> sources. Many museums install UV filters when poles are on display indoors. Other recommendations for indoor storage include a climate-controlled environment, no food or beverages {{in the vicinity of}} any poles, a 24-hour security system and having active security guards on duty. Last, museums typically have a barrier between the visitor and the object on display. Continual touching of a pole can cause irreversible damage such as the absorption of skin oil into the wood.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{variations}} can {{be found}} as new materials become available to artisans. J. Kenton Manning (b. 1958-) http://www.jaydesigninc.com/artgeek.html a former painting techniques instructor at UCI (1985) taught reverse painting on glass as well as painting on celluloid, a popular technique in the animation industry. In his fine art, produced in the 21st century, he creates Mandalas and abstracts using metallic and iridescent paints reverse painted on Plexiglas, which produces a similar gilded effect. These draw an interesting connection between the old world spiritual subject matter and modernist abstract techniques. http://www.jaydesigninc.com/abstracts.html Like traditional verre églomisé, proper <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> is essential to produce the artist's intended effect.|$|E
50|$|When {{creating}} lightmaps, any lighting {{model may}} be used, because the lighting is entirely precomputed and real-time performance {{is not always}} a necessity. A variety of techniques including ambient occlusion, <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> with sampled shadow edges, and full radiosity bounce light solutions are typically used. Modern 3d packages include specific plugins for applying light-map UV-coordinates, atlas-ing multiple surfaces into single texture sheets, and rendering the maps themselves. Alternatively game engine pipelines may include custom lightmap creation tools. An additional consideration is the use of compressed DXT textures which are subject to blocking artifacts - individual surfaces must not collide on 4x4 texel chunks for best results.|$|E

[...] This allows the prompt to <b>direct</b> <b>lighting,</b> sound, flying effects and scene changes during a show. The prompt book also often contains blocking notes, so that the prompt is always aware of the intended positions and movements of all the actors on stage at any given time.|$|E

50|$|Establishments {{producing}} daguerreotype portraits generally had a daylight studio {{built on}} the roof, much like a greenhouse. Whereas later {{in the history of}} photography artificial electric lighting was done in a dark room, building up the light with hard spotlights and softer floodlights, the daylight studio was equipped with screens and blinds to control the light, to reduce it and make it unidirectional, or diffuse it to soften harsh <b>direct</b> <b>lighting.</b> Blue filtration was sometimes used {{to make it easier for}} the sitter to tolerate the strong light, as a daguerreotype plate was almost exclusively sensitive to light at the blue end of the spectrum and filtering out everything else did not significantly increase the exposure time.|$|E

50|$|Domes by the Asam brothers, such {{as those}} of Weingarten Abbey (1715-20) and Weltenburg Abbey (1716-21), blended fresco painting, stucco and, in the case of Weltenburg, {{indirect}} lighting to achieve their effects. Another set of brothers, Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann of Bavaria, emphasized white stuccowork under <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> blended with fresco painting at St. Peter and Paul Church at Steinhausen (1728-31) and Wieskirche at Weis (1745-54). In Bohemia and Moravia, Jan Santini Aichel blended styles in what has become known as baroque Gothic, {{as can be seen in}} his crossing dome at the Benedictine Monastery at Kladruby (1712-26) and the five-lobed dome of the Chapel of St. Jan Nepomuk (1719-22). More conventionally baroque is his dome at St. Peter and Paul Benedictine Monastery in Rajhrad (1722-24).|$|E
