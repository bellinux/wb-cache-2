5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When the Yankees were preparing {{for the start of the}} 1944 season, the team originally <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> Wensloff was, as they had not heard from him. He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season and the war ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered {{for his work on}} nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

25|$|Communication between {{ships and}} the British {{commander-in-chief}} were comparatively poor. For {{most of the}} battle, Jellicoe <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report enemy positions, contrary to the Grand Fleet's Battle Plan. Some {{of the most important}} signalling was carried out solely by flag instead of wireless or using redundant methods to ensure communications—a questionable procedure, given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield, and a foreshadowing of similar failures by habit-bound and conservatively minded professional officers of rank to take advantage of new technology in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Because of Forrest's {{relentless}} screening, Schofield <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the Confederate Army was headed. The aggressive Forrest had {{a considerable}} advantage over his Union cavalry opponents, commanded by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson. Wilson had {{arrived from the}} Eastern Theater in late October to reorganize and command Thomas's cavalry, but he possessed only 4,300 horsemen, scattered around the theater in numerous small units, compared to 10,000 men unified under Forrest. The Confederate cavalry advanced to Mount Pleasant by November 23. Croxton's brigade was hopelessly outnumbered against Forrest, so Thomas reinforced him with a division under Brig. Gen. Edward Hatch and a brigade under Col. Horace Capron.|$|E

25|$|During the French retreat, Reille {{turned up}} with three {{divisions}} of the Army of Portugal, adding 15,000 men to Joseph's army. Clausel's 25,000 troops were at large but Joseph <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> they were. For his part, Clausel never received any messages from the king until 15 June, at which time he gathered four divisions {{and set out to}} join the main army. Joseph massed his army behind the Ebro River, believing that it would be impossible for Wellington's army to outflank the line on the north. On 15 June, Hill's wing crossed the Ebro at Puente Arenas and Graham's wing crossed at San Martin de Lines. From the 13th until a cavalry encounter on 17 June, the French lost all contact with their adversaries.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{says that}} the Neuri had Scythian customs, but they were at first not {{considered}} Scythian. During the war between the Scythians and the Persian Empire, the Scythians came to dominate the Neuri. Strabo, younger contemporary of Pytheas, denies that any knowledge of {{the shores of the}} eastern Baltic existed. He had heard of the Sauromatai, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> to place them. Herodotus had mentioned these Sauromatai as a distinct people living near the Neuri. Pliny the Elder, however, is much better informed. The island of Baunonia (Bornholm), he says lies a days' sail off Scythia, where amber is collected. To him the limit of Germany is the Vistula. In contrast to Strabo, he knows that the Goths live around the Vistula, but these are definitely Germans.|$|E

The guards <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the tunnel entrance was, so they began searching the huts, giving men time to burn their fake papers. Hut 104 {{was one of the last}} to be searched, and despite using dogs the guards were unable to find the entrance. Finally, German guard Charlie Pilz crawled back through the tunnel but found himself trapped at the camp end; he began calling for help and the prisoners opened the entrance to let him out, finally revealing its location.|$|E

25|$|A charismatic monk and {{powerful}} orator named Peter the Hermit of Amiens was the {{spiritual leader of}} the movement. He was known for riding a donkey and dressing in simple clothing. He had vigorously preached the crusade throughout northern France and Flanders. He {{claimed to have been}} appointed to preach by Christ himself (and supposedly had a divine letter to prove it), and it is likely that some of his followers thought he, not Urban, was the true originator of the crusading idea. It is often believed that Peter's army was a band of illiterate, incompetent peasants who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> they were going, and who believed that every city of any size they encountered on their way was Jerusalem itself; this may have been true for some, but the long tradition for pilgrimages to Jerusalem ensured that the location and distance of the city were well known. While the majority were unskilled in fighting, there were some well-trained minor knights leading them, such as Walter Sans-Avoir (also mistakenly known as Walter the Penniless), who was experienced in warfare. A list of known members of Peter's army can be found in Riley-Smith, et al, A Database of Crusaders to the Holy Land.|$|E
25|$|The {{expanded}} 30th anniversary {{edition of}} the 1965 official book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, was notable for its exclusion {{of most of the}} evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map {{at the time of their}} PIXE research), but it did reprint a remarkable essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.|$|E

[...] The Spanish <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> to find La Salle, and in 1686 they sent a sea expedition and two land expeditions to try to locate his colony. Although the expeditions were unable to find La Salle, they did narrow the search to the area between the Rio Grande and the Mississippi. Four Spanish expeditions the following year failed to find La Salle, but helped Spain to better understand the geography of the Gulf Coast region.|$|E

However, as [...] "Adrift" [...] was written, they realized their heist story flowed naturally from it. Even though Martin Wood was credited for directing the episode, Andy Mikita ended up directing most of it instead, as well as directing parts of [...] "Adrift"; Wood was directing [...] at the time of filming. Amanda Tapping requested that showrunners Mallozzi and Mullie not give her a big part for the episode, as she was in the Arctic filming for Stargate: Continuum. Another reason that Carter's appearance was small was that Torri Higginson was still a part of the show, and the producers wanted Carter to be introduced slowly. The episode, as a [...] "third part", was difficult to write, since the second part ("Adrift") is a comeback resolve of the first part ("First Strike"), and the third part has to [...] "resolve the resolve." [...] In the writing stages, there was also talk {{as to whether or not}} to save the experimental hyperdrive jumper. Eventually it was decided that it would be saved, to keep open the possibility of using it again.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} the advance of Armistead's regiments, John Magruder and his men arrived near the battlefield, albeit quite late because of the {{confusion}} regarding the names of local roads—by this time, it was 4pm. Magruder was told at that morning's war council to move to Huger's right, but {{he was unaware of}} Huger's position, and sent Major Joseph L. Brent to locate Huger's right flank. Brent found Huger, who said that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> his brigades were. Huger was noticeably upset that his men had been given orders by someone other than himself; Lee had told Huger's two brigades under Armistead and Ambrose Wright to advance to the right part of the Confederate line. Upon hearing of this, Magruder was quite confused. He sent Capt. A. G. Dickinson to find Lee and inform him of the [...] "successful" [...] charge of Armistead's men and request further orders. Contrary to this message, Armistead was in fact pinned down halfway up Malvern Hill. At the same time, Whiting sent Lee an incorrect report that Union forces were retreating. Whiting had mistaken two events for a Federal withdrawal—the movement of Edwin Sumner's troops, who were adjusting their position to avoid the Confederate fire, and the relaxing of Union fire on his side, which was actually the Union artillery concentrating their firepower to a different front. Whiting and Magruder's erroneous reports led Lee to send a draft of orders to Magruder via Dickinson: [...] "General Lee expects you to advance rapidly", wrote Dickinson. [...] "He says it is reported that the enemy is [...] Press forward your whole line and follow up Armistead's success." [...] Before Dickinson returned with these orders, Magruder was belatedly handed the order sent out three hours previously (at 1:30 pm) by Chilton. Since no time was affixed to the text of the orders, Magruder was unaware that these orders had been rendered meaningless by the failure of the Confederate artillery during the past few hours, and believed he had received two successive orders from Lee to attack.|$|E
