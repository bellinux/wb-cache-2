500|$|Lynch's {{performance}} as Sue attracted praise, with Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Liz Pardue of Zap2it both calling her portrayal Emmy-worthy. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker called her [...] "the greatest Broadway-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series", deeming [...] "Throwdown" [...] "possibly the best showcase yet for Jane Lynch", while Malcom praised {{the interaction between}} Lynch and Morrison, writing that their scenes [...] "crackled with electric wit". The pregnancy storyline drew criticism, with Tucker opining that it [...] "nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode" [...] and writing: [...] "there's {{got to be a}} better way to ground the series in a serious plot-line that doesn't make you wish the pregnancy plot was all just a non-musical dream sequence." [...] Malcom also criticized the storyline, asking if it could [...] "please <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> already?" [...] and writing that her patience with it was running out.|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent and the Liberals {{suffered}} {{other problems}} during the campaign. According to Newman, St. Laurent sometimes seemed {{unaware of what}} was happening around him, and at one campaign stop, shook hands with the reporters who were following him, under the apparent impression they were local voters. On the evening of Diefenbaker's Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death, poking the voter in the stomach and saying [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government." [...] At another rally, Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal questioner, saying [...] "Look here, my good man, when the election comes, why don't you <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and vote for the party you support? In fact, why don't you just go away?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1930 – [...] {{he nearly}} always {{stepped back to}} meet the ball with a {{vertical}} bat. And {{this is where he}} had his limitations, for the tour proved that when he met a bowler either left-hand or right who could make the ball <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> he never seemed quite such a master as against off-break or straight fast bowling. A glorious driver, he hit the ball very hard, while his placing was almost invariably perfect. He scored most of his runs by driving... only on rare occasions did he lift it.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{sought help}} {{from him and}} after he did, he <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>away.</b> Suddenly, we lost track of him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] he answered. [...] "He {{came last}} night. To {{tell you the}} truth, he has <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> in a temper. I {{do not know whether}} he will return to the house or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was up at}} the store, and the {{storekeeper}} told me you had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> {{and were}} bound up the river. If you don't mind, I {{would like to have}} a talk with you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{described}} {{the process of}} film making: [...] "I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel {{at different stages of}} the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what I do! The {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along. The words aren't just shouted over some loop which repeats itself." [...] Van Peebles later received an offer from Capitol Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, and leave me alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. <b>Just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away,</b> and let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you." [...] Capitol gave Van Peebles complete artistic control over the recording as a result, and he was satisfied with the business deal, {{as well as the}} finished album.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{learned to}} check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Blood went to Venice {{with her}} uncle last Saturday. The Aroostook {{is here in}} Trieste. The captain has <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away.</b> He's stood watch and watch with me, while you were off on business." ...|$|R
60|$|The cook {{told her}} that she might have a place and leave to stay there at once and wash up, for the girl who had done that before had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away.</b> 'And {{as soon as you get}} tired of being here you will take {{yourself}} off too,' said he.|$|R
60|$|It rained and {{the light}} was going when Foster sat in a window seat of the library at the Garth. He was alone, but did not mind this. The Featherstones treated {{him as one of}} the family; he was free to do what he liked, and Alice had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away,</b> after talking to him for half an hour. Lighting a cigarette, he mused and looked about.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do. What {{business}} had {{you to say}} I used that nasty word? I never do use them words. I wouldn't even so much as look at a man who'd demean himself to put such words as them into my mouth. So I {{tell you what it}} is, Mr. Crocker; you may <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> I am going to become Daniel Tribbledale's wife, and it isn't becoming in you to stand here talking to a young woman that is engaged to another young man." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{discovering}} her husband's affair, Oh Sun-ae (Ha Hee-ra) {{tries to}} start a new life, but when the past (along with the new woman) <b>just</b> won't <b>go</b> <b>away,</b> moving on is not easy. Still, Oh Sun-ae is determined.|$|R
500|$|Michael Glabicki of the American band Rusted Root {{acknowledges}} {{this album}} {{as a key}} influence on his own career exploring worldbeat music, saying, [...] "I just kind of got locked into that sound. Peter Gabriel's So kind of gave everyone the go-ahead that this could work in a popular fashion. For people like me who were exploring those sounds, the wonder of if it's going to work or not <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>away</b> at that point." [...] English musician Steven Wilson said, [...] "People think the 80s were a shallow, superficial era", but he cited So as an album that was [...] "really smart".|$|R
60|$|Torpenhow was {{sprawling}} {{in a long}} {{chair with}} a small fox-terrier asleep on his chest, while Dick was preparing a canvas. A dais, a background, and a lay- figure were the only fixed objects in the place. They rose from a wreck of oddments that began with felt-covered water-bottles, belts, and regimental badges, and ended with a small bale of second-hand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms. The mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a military model had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away.</b> The watery autumn sunlight was falling, and shadows sat {{in the corners of}} the studio.|$|R
5000|$|With all the revulsion {{that some}} people feel toward homosexuality, it cannot be {{dismissed}} by simply ignoring its presence. It is a subject that deserves discussion. We {{might just as well}} refuse to discuss alcoholism or narcotics addiction as to refuse to discuss this subject. It cannot be swept under the rug. It will not <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chiyo Uno {{has had a}} {{crush on}} Shin Tsubaki since her {{freshman}} year. But now that she's in the same class as him, she discovers what a jerk he actually is. Chiyo wishes he would <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> - and her wish is granted: an alien takes over Shin's body. This 'Shin-sama' is the opposite of the owner of the body.|$|E
5000|$|Ted later {{described}} {{his reaction to}} her death: [...] "I didn't know whether to kill myself, burn the house down, or <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and get lost." [...] About Helen's death, Ted's niece Peggy commented: [...] "Whatever Helen did, she did it out of absolute love for Ted." [...] Peggy called Helen's death [...] "her last and greatest gift to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{something}} to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I think will heighten your opinion of him," [...] said Dorothea to her husband in the coarse of the evening. She had mentioned immediately on his entering that Will had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away,</b> and would come again, but Mr. Casaubon had said, [...] "I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I believe," [...] saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any subject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish for a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited.|$|R
6000|$|When he {{was gone}} Wagley burst out laughing. 'COAL-BLACK eyes!' said he; 'you've just hit it. That's Mrs. Sackville Maine, and that was her husband who <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>away.</b> He's a coal-merchant, Snob my boy, and I have no doubt Mr. Perkins's Wallsends are {{supplied}} from his wharf. He is in a flaming furnace when he hears coals mentioned. He {{and his wife and}} his mother are very proud of Mrs. Sackville's family; she was a Miss Chuff, daughter of Captain Chuff, R.N. That is the widow; that stout woman in crimson tabinet, battling about the odd trick with old Mr. Dumps, at the card-table.' ...|$|R

50|$|Jimmy's {{father is}} self-pitying and selfish, and doesn't pry very much either, but {{simply because of}} his belief that if you ignore a problem, it will <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> He {{physically}} abuses Jimmy's mother, which causes Jimmy to attempt suicide a second time. Bob eventually moves out, and Jimmy and Lydia know they are better off.In the film, Bob is played by Jackie Earle Haley.|$|E
5000|$|His small {{government}} conservatism {{is partly}} {{expressed in this}} quote:"Government tries to replace the family, the church, the neighborhood, the community with a benevolent bureaucracy. The benevolent bureaucracy cannot do what society can do, but it has pushed civil society aside. It's said, 'This is our problem. <b>Just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> By the way, go work some more {{so that we can}} do more of this.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014, Oliver {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with the Herald, that he was [...] "proud of Britain" [...] and noted his dislike of the upcoming Scottish independence referendum saying that he found [...] "this kind of internecine squabbling puts my teeth on edge.

His groundwork has created an avenue for South African youth to channel their anger, talent and their voice, an outlet that they can call their own. Through this music the youth were able to express their feelings of oppression. One of the originators of Kwaito, DJ and producer Oskido of B.O.P, {{has said that it}} started out as house with small additions to that genre such as congas and other instruments.|$|E

50|$|Most states {{agree to}} lower the voting age within days, {{in the wake of}} the demonstrations, and Max Frost and the Troopers {{campaign}} for Johnny Fergus until the election, which he wins by a landslide. Taking his place in the Senate, Fergus wishes Frost and his people would now <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>away,</b> but instead they get involved with Washington politics. When a congressman from Sally LeRoy's home district dies suddenly, the band enters her in the special election that follows, and Sally (the eldest of the group, and the only one of majority age to run for office) is voted into Congress by the new teen bloc.|$|E
5000|$|At the café, colonel Von Strohm, {{lieutenant}} Gruber and captain Bertorelli are enquiring about René, while Fanny is [...] "warming up her tonsils" [...] for the evening, {{when she}} is going to sing. Before the Germans leave, with Yvette having assured them that Rene has <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> for a few days, they order a table at the café for that same evening. When they have left, officer Crabtree arrives, telling Mimi and Yvette that Michelle has had a message from England, that René and Edith are over there and that they do not know where the airmen are. Michelle is going to speak to London on the radio in Fanny's bedroom and two o'clock. Meanwhile, Crabtree is going to look for the airmen on his bicycle.|$|R
