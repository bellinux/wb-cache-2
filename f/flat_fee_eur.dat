40|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is an important}} topic in environmental economics, {{and there is a}} need for providing better incentives to further optimize the chain of materials and waste. We investigate market distortions caused by <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> pricing in the solid waste market and we show how <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> pricing influences households in their decisions to recycle, separate or dispose of rest waste. We develop and apply a general equilibrium model for the solid waste market and describe in detail how market distortions, as a result of <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> pricing, can be analyzed in an applied general equilibrium framework. A numerical example demonstrates the effects of <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> pricing on both waste generation and recycling. In the presence of <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> pricing, the cost of recycling has no impact on the behavior of households, and thus households are not responsive to recycling subsidies. The results show that introducing a unit-based pricing scheme for waste collection can stimulate recycling far more effectively than subsidies and improve the effectiveness of recycling policie...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} use of <b>flat</b> {{continuing}} franchise <b>fees</b> or royalties with percentage-based continuing franchise fees in Australian franchises. The population of Australian franchisors is surveyed to investigate why some franchisors choose a <b>flat</b> continuing <b>fee</b> structure. It is found that franchises using <b>flat</b> continuing <b>fees</b> offer their franchisees similar types of ongoing support throughout {{the life of the}} franchise agreement, but provide less ongoing support than franchises characterised by percentage <b>fees.</b> The <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> franchises also conduct less monitoring of their franchisees, grow at a faster rate, and are less costly to enter than percentage fee franchises. The results suggest that whereas percentage fee franchisors can improve their ongoing income by helping franchisees to increase their sales, the <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> franchisors are motivated to improve their ongoing income by increasing the size of their systems...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> MLS {{service is}} radically {{different}} from traditional real estate brokerage services. Because every State requires a listing agreement between {{a real estate broker}} and property owner, the rapid explosion of <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> service providers has created a gap in the States developing laws governing <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> services provided by real estate broker. In most real estate board / MLS systems, there are generally two types of listing agreements, although some Boards allow others. The first and most common is called an [...] "Exclusive Right to Sell" [...] listing, in which the seller will not only pay a commission if their property is sold through their listing broker or another MLS broker (buyers broker), but also if the seller finds their own buyer. In an [...] "Exclusive Right to Sell" [...] listing, the listing broker gets the commission specified in the listing agreement regardless of who actually finds the buyer. [...] The second type of listing agreement is called an [...] "Exclusive Agency" [...] listing agreement. This [...] "Exclusive Agency" [...] is one form of agreement {{that can be used to}} allow the seller to market their property [...] "By Owner" [...] and pay zero commission if they are successful in finding their own buyer. It is this [...] "Exclusive Agency" [...] listing agreement that forms the basis for many <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> service provider's listing agreements. In essence, <b>Flat</b> <b>Fee</b> MLS listings are a logical progression of reduced-cost selling alternatives to property owners who are comfortable with managing part or all of the selling process, who believe the MLS will effectively [...] "advertise" [...] their property, and who are willing to pay a buyer's broker a commission.|$|R

The commission which is normally paid to the [...] "listing" [...] broker is attempted to be replaced by payment of the <b>flat</b> <b>fee,</b> which is paid in advance by the seller and is non-refundable, {{regardless of whether or not}} the property sells.|$|R

5000|$|In a <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> MLS listing, {{the listing}} {{agreement}} between the real estate broker and the property owner typically requires the broker to enter the property into the MLS and provide other contracted services, with the broker acting as what the traditional industry has coined a [...] "limited service broker". However, the <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> industry prefers the term à la carte broker because the services are not limited. Instead freedom of choice is expanded to allow sellers to pick from a menu of services. For example if a seller opts to purchase marketing in an MLS, and other distribution channels only, that {{does not imply that}} the listing broker would not have negotiated or offered more services if the seller wanted to pay for those services. In fact many <b>flat</b> <b>fee</b> brokers offer upgraded packages that sellers often contract for. Consequently, the services is not limited but instead custom crafted to the needs and wants of the seller.|$|R
