500|$|Anderson {{opened his}} senior stint on November 23, 2004 with 14 points, 3 assists, and 5 steals against Birmingham–Southern. In his next {{appearance}} vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, [...] "What else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its {{great to see}} Anthony have six points {{in the game and}} win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good for him {{to go out there and}} play and direct these kids that he has out there under him." [...] In mid-December 2004, Anderson was suspended for three games after failing a drug test. Lappas called it a [...] "violation of team rules." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Holden died, President Ronald Reagan {{released}} a statement, saying, [...] "I {{have a great}} feeling of grief. We were close friends for many years. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> a longtime friend - {{a sense of personal}} loss, a fine man. Our friendship never waned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another hadith narrated from Shia {{scholars}} {{states that}} Ali Al-Ridha, during the {{discussions with the}} scholars of other religions about prophets' infallibility, asked one of them, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> David?" [...] he said [...] "David was praying, when a beautiful bird appeared in front of him, and David left his prayer and went after the bird. While David was walking {{on the roof of}} his palace, he saw Bathsheba having a bath... so David placed her husband in {{the front lines of the}} battlefield, in order to get killed, so that he could marry Bathsheba." [...] Ali Al-Ridha got upset and said: [...] "Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un, you assign sluggishness in prayer to the prophet of God, and then accuse him of unchastity, and then charge him with the murder of an innocent man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is he dead? Oh, that's {{different}} altogether!' said Knight, immensely relieved. 'But, let me see--what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> that tomb and him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see, I see." [...] She did full {{justice to}} his explanation. [...] "And what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> a 'basis'? The blessed man offers to settle--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|One of the {{old friends}} of the house arched her eyebrows in saying good-night, and offered {{the two young men}} {{remaining}} seats home in her carriage. Beaton gloomily refused, and she kept herself from asking the student of human nature, till she had got him into her carriage, [...] "What is Moffitt, and what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think there}} are a dozen men in London can give you such a glass of wine as that. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> that champagne, Monogram?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} story {{attached}} to it, Mr. Glover? Let me see, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{it in your}} report?" [...] and he opened it and read aloud: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this {{marriage}} {{which is being}} arranged for me?" [...] the prince asked suddenly, one night, as they were sitting by a huge fire in the forest.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Cope had {{not much}} hope from the parish, so he said, 'Mr. Shepherd {{ought to do}} {{something}} for him after he has worked for him so long. He has been looking wretchedly ill for some time past; and I dare say half this illness is brought on by such lodging and living as he got there. But what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> some eggs?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go {{and talk}} with him on this matter, Okiok," [...] said the seaman. [...] "Meanwhile, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>about</b> it to any one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell me," [...] {{retorted}} Allan, [...] "when {{you took}} me in here the other day, and made a clean breast of it? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this room, and the second vision of the dream? By Jupiter!" [...] he exclaimed, starting to his feet once more, [...] "now I look again, here is the Second Vision! There's the rain pattering against the window--there's the lawn and the garden outside--here am I where I stood in the Dream--and there are you where the Shadow stood. The whole scene complete, out-of-doors and in; and I've discovered it this time!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The tall, stiff peer in {{the white}} great coat mused for a moment with his pencil at his lip, and then said, [...] "Well, I'll give you six. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Mango?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] He {{began to}} walk about the room {{with his hands in}} his pockets, showing that he had been {{thinking}} as much. [...] "Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her doctor? Is he a good doctor, my love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{starting}} {{on a regular}} hunt to-morrow?" [...] asked Dave. [...] "We might go out directly after breakfast and carry our lunch with us. Who knows but what in looking for the wild man we might run across some trace of Link Merwell." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR WILLIAM:--Yours of January 30th just received. <b>Do</b> just as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the money}} matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time enough yet." [...] The fingers tapped thoughtfully on {{the broad}} knee. [...] "But--they must be strange-minded folk over yonder with you! Have you thought to send for your mother? She dead? My dear, my dear! Never mind! She'll be happy where she knows. 'Tis God's work. An' we was only waitin' for it, for you've never failed in your duty yet. It ain't your way. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> my Mary's doings?" [...] Mrs. Cloke's face {{hardened}} as she pressed her chin on Sophie's forehead. [...] "If any of your girls thinks to be'ave arbitrary now, I'll--But they won't, my dear. I'll see they do their duty too. Be sure you'll 'ave no trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Child of Senzangacona, age has {{not made}} me deaf, but my spirit in these latter days floats far from my body. It is like a bladder filled with air that a child holds by a string, and before I can speak I must draw it from the heavens to earth again. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the place that I have chosen? Well, what better place could I choose, seeing that it was here in this very Vale of Bones that I met the first king of the Zulus, Chaka the Wild Beast, who was your uncle? Why then should I not choose it to meet the last king of the Zulus?" ...|$|R
6000|$|PRESS. [Scribbling] One moment, please. I'll {{just get}} that down-- [...] "Too jolly awful--lies awake over it. Was {{wearing a white}} {{waistcoat}} with pearl buttons." [...] [At a sign of resentment from his victim.] I want the human touch, Lord William--it's everything in my paper. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this attempt to bomb you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I've {{asked about}} a dozen gamekeepers if they ever saw such a thing, and all said they hadn't; they never heard {{hedgehogs}} make that twittering sound, like a bird or a singing mouse; they had only heard them scream like a rabbit when in a trap. Now what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{enjoyed the}} triumph--the unholy triumph, I fear I must admit--of seeing Mr. Bruff utterly confounded and overthrown {{by a few}} plain words from Me. He started to his feet, {{and stared at me}} in silence. I kept my seat, undisturbed, and related the whole scene as it had occurred. [...] "And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Ablewhite now?" [...] I asked, with the utmost {{possible}} gentleness, as soon as I had done.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{may never}} {{see you on}} earth. All thought of such a joy is gone. I did really cling to it (I see it now) when most I thought I was quite content {{to wait for the}} hope of the great meeting. I will try to {{remember}} and to <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> all business matters.|$|R
6000|$|MAYOR. That {{charge is}} not pressed, and we can't {{go into the}} circumstances. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> your conduct towards the constable? ...|$|R
6000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after taking his seat my father began: [...] "Well now, daughter, {{you are the}} captain. Right here I abdicate. Anything <b>you</b> want <b>done</b> shall be <b>done.</b> What <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> things in the kitchen shall be law. I will furnish the raw materials--you and the girls must do the rest. We like to be bossed, don't we, Belle?" [...] He ended addressing mother.|$|R
60|$|CYRIL. There is {{something}} in what you say, {{and there is no}} doubt that whatever amusement we may find in reading a purely model novel, we have rarely any artistic pleasure in re-reading it. And this is perhaps the best rough test of what is literature and what is not. If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use reading it at all. But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the return to Life and Nature? This is the panacea that is always being recommended to us.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR GOSSE,--Your office--office is profanely said--your bower {{upon the}} leads is divine. Have you, like Pepys, [...] "the right to fiddle" [...] there? I see you mount the companion, barbiton in hand, and, fluttered about by city sparrows, pour forth your spirit in a voluntary. Now when the spring begins, you must lay in your flowers: how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> a potted hawthorn? Would it bloom? Wallflower {{is a choice}} pot-herb; lily-of-the-valley, too, and carnation, and Indian cress trailed about the window, is not only {{beautiful}} by colour, but the leaves are good to eat. I recommend thyme and rosemary for the aroma, which should not be left upon one side; they are good quiet growths.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{said about}} ten," [...] Tony repeats. [...] "Yes, so <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> ten. But {{according}} to my count, it's ten times ten--it's a hundred o'clock. I never had such a night in my life!" ...|$|R
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. Why are {{you talking}} about Mrs. Cheveley? Everybody is talking about Mrs. Cheveley! Lord Goring says—what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Lord Goring, <b>about</b> Mrs. Cheveley? Oh! I remember, that she was a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>did</b> hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> a gold piece," [...] the shellman admitted. [...] "You didn't talk very plainly and I understood very little.

6000|$|... "You may {{say what}} you please," [...] said Madame Merle, who had listened to this quick {{outbreak}} none the less attentively, we may believe, because her eye wandered away from the speaker and her hands busied themselves with adjusting the knots of ribbon on her dress. [...] "You Osmonds are a fine race--your blood must flow from some very pure source. Your brother, like an intelligent man, has had the conviction of it if he has not had the proofs. You're modest about it, but you yourself are extremely distinguished. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> your niece? The child's a little princess. Nevertheless," [...] Madame Merle added, [...] "it won't be an easy matter for Osmond to marry Miss Archer. Yet he can try." ...|$|E

50|$|One day, when Gurgani and Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar were talking, Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar {{asked the}} {{following}} question: “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the tale of}} Vis and Rāmin?” Gurgani then {{told him that the}} story was only written in Middle Persian. Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar then asked Gurgani to versify the story, which he did; during the Mehregan festival, Gurgani presented the poem to him, in which he praises Tughril, the vizier Abu Nasr Kunduri, and Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar. Gurgani later died in c. 1058.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} The Midnight Organ Fight, {{the current}} quartet line-up was completed {{with the addition}} of guitarist/keyboardist Andy Monaghan of Piano Bar Fight (who have previously played as support to Frightened Rabbit). In an interview, Scott mentions that he [...] "met him on New Year's Eve, in Glasgow, in a bar. I was really hammered and I was like 'why don't you come and play some shows with us man?' and he was like 'Yeah!'.

6000|$|... "Ah!
