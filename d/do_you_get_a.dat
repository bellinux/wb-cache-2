The city itself is just down-home, down-to-earth, blue-collar, full of everyday kind of people. My music is along the same lines, just being simple – I just try to be honest in what I do." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "Brother from Another Series" [...] {{introduces}} Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to work with}} an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] Several of Frasier producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as [...] "Maris". In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.|$|E

6000|$|In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human {{interest}} is wanting. It {{is true that}} yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have not found, a better word than [...] "shades" [...] for the specific differences of a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign {{by the side of}} a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone, and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals, and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag, mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when Tennyson speaks of the [...] "speedwell's darling blue," [...] we know that he is right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flower--buttercup or kingcup, yellow flag, sea poppy, marsh marigold, or broom, or furze, or rock-rose, let us say--by such a word--the word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feeling--the feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind. Nor could that word of Tennyson be properly used of any pure white flower--the stitchwort for instance; nor of any white and yellow flower like the Marguerite. But no sooner <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower, as we see in the daisy and eyebright, than you can say of it that it is a [...] "dear" [...] or a [...] "darling" [...] colour, and no one can find fault with the expression.|$|E

5000|$|On 25 April 2012 {{retired air}} force Colonel Paul Maillet, an {{aeronautical}} engineer and former CF-18 fleet manager at National Defence Headquarters spoke out against purchasing the F-35, indicating it was unsuitable for Canadian service.

5000|$|Harte {{had just}} {{released}} the Neighborhoods' [...] "Prettiest Girl" [...] single, which went {{to become a}} huge local hit, selling a still astounding ten thousand copies. The single was Harte's very persuasive calling card. [...] "If {{you want to do}} that with us," [...] Harte offered Burma, [...] "we'll do it." [...] It was an offer Burma couldn't refuse.

5000|$|Following {{the tragedy}} of her son's suicide in 1939, she dressed in {{mourning}} {{for the rest of}} her life. She devoted herself to philosophy and wrote innumerable letters. She regularly staged the famous show jumping event, the Concours hippique, in Rümligen, and was noted for her imperious manner. The lifestyle of Elisabeth de Meuron gave rise to innumerable anecdotes which, however, while having substance, should not all be taken at face value. Her reputation as a Bernese original was derived not only from her anachronistic appearance - old fashioned widow's weeds, walking stick and ear trumpet (So that I hear only what I want to hear) - but also on account of her eccentric behaviour. She was often seen in Bern city centre accompanied by her Russian greyhounds. Her staff were allowed to park her car anywhere and if a policeman came along, she would explain: That stays here! She never bought a tram ticket because, as she said: I was here before the tram! [...] She would ask total strangers: Are you someone or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> salary? When a farmer wanted to sit on the Frisching family pew, she put him right, saying: Up in heaven we'll all be equal, but in the meantime down here, we'll have a bit of discipline. And once when a female vagrant (or as she put it: crazy little beggar woman) was caught stealing fruit from her castle grounds, she locked her up in the coach house for two days. When charged with false imprisonment, she produced in court a document dating from the Middle Ages which authorised the owner of Rümligen Castle to administer low justice. She was let off with a small fine and a lecture on current law.|$|E
