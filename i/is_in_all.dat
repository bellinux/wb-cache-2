5|$|There {{was also}} a {{misconception}} about the intoxicating effects of hemp because {{it has the same}} active substance, THC, which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> cannabis strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational cannabis strains but, in the 1930s, THC was not yet fully identified. The methods FBN used for predicting the psychoactive effect of different samples of cannabis and hemp therefore gave confusing results.|$|E
5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E

25|$|However true, therefore, it may be, {{that the}} {{judicial}} department <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> questions submitted {{to it by}} the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last {{in relation to the}} authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, {{as well as the other}} departments, hold their delegated trusts.

25|$|Some {{commentators}} have expressed {{the view that}} excessive value has been placed by the courts on protecting {{the independence of the}} judiciary, and that insufficient weight has been given to the right to freedom of speech. One assumption said to be incorrect is that undermining public confidence in the administration of justice <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> circumstances harmful to the public interest. Arguably, if the scandalizing allegation is true or is an opinion honestly and reasonably held, then it is in the public interest that such speech be heard precisely because {{of the importance of the}} judiciary to society. However, common law rules of contempt do not recognize the defence of either justification or fair comment which are available to the tort of defamation. Secondly, the claim that scandalizing the court may undermine public confidence in the judiciary represents an unduly pessimistic view of the maturity and ability of the Singapore public to assess for itself whether or not the scandalizing speech is true, and is perhaps a sweeping statement as to general public awareness. Lastly, it is also assumed that public confidence in the judiciary can be preserved by the suppression of scandalizing speech. However, it is unlikely that such speech can ever be completely suppressed. It would be impossible to monitor speech that goes on in homes, coffee shops and hawker centres. Through these informal channels, suspicions of the judiciary may fester and grow.|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{animosity}} {{between the two}} men was their competition for the attention of the poet Frances Sargent Osgood in the mid to late 1840s. While both she and Poe were still married to their respective spouses, the two carried on a public flirtation that resulted in much gossip among the literati. Griswold, who was smitten with Osgood, escorted her to literary salons and became her staunchest defender. [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> things the most admirable woman I ever knew", he wrote to publisher James T. Fields in 1848. Osgood responded by dedicating a collection of her poetry to Griswold, [...] "as a souvenir of admiration for his genius, of regard for his generous character, and of gratitude for his valuable literary counsels".|$|E
500|$|Some {{theories}} about Hamnet's influence on his father's plays are {{centered on the}} tragedy Hamlet, composed in 1599 or 1601. The traditional view, that grief over his only son's death may have spurred Shakespeare to write the play, <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> likelihood incorrect. Although the names Hamlet and Hamnet were considered virtually interchangeable, and Shakespeare's own will spelled Hamnet Sadler's first name as [...] "Hamlett", {{the name of the}} character in the play has a different derivation. Prince Hamlet's name is more often thought {{to be related to the}} Amleth character in Saxo Grammaticus' Vita Amlethi, an old Scandinavian legend that is very similar to Shakespeare's story. More recent scholarship has argued that, while Hamlet has a Scandinavian origin and may have been selected as a play subject for commercial reasons, Shakespeare's grief over the loss of his only son may lie at the heart of the tragedy.|$|E

500|$|The opera {{begins with}} a short, [...] "strenuous" [...] {{instrumental}} prelude, which forms {{the basis of the}} musical accompaniment to the opening congregational hymn; its first phrase is founded on a descending bass E-B-F, itself to become an important motif. Humphrey Carpenter notes that throughout the hymn the bass line is {{out of step with the}} singing, an effect which, he says, [...] "suggests an adult world where purity is unattainable". Following the hymn, the Voice of God is accompanied, as it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> his pre-flood warnings and declamations, by the E-B-F notes from the opera's opening bass line, sounded on the timpani. After Noye's response in recitative, the next musical episode is the entry of Noye's children and their wives, a passage which, Carpenter suggests, replaces the pessimism of the adult word with [...] "the blissful optimism of childhood". The syncopated tune of the children's song is derived from the final line of Noye's recitative: [...] "As God has bidden us doe".|$|E
500|$|The villain in the story, Mad Wayne, {{had been}} dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses.

As we'll see with the introduction {{in a moment of}} a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, {{has to do with the}} character Wayne." [...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying to show us the game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} favorable reviews from critics. Soman S. Chainani from The Crimson was positive in his review, stating, [...] "The video is deliciously subversive.

[...] Labelling it a [...] "surreal" [...] video with [...] "angular" [...] imagery and direction, he concluded, [...] "Random? Of course not. Realizing it's all the pieces of a puzzle, we grasp the stunning answer. Madonna <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> truth, a modern-day Geisha. She is trapped within her corridor, without the least privacy, but she is free to perform." [...] A reviewer from HitFix commented, [...] " [...] is a gorgeous futuristic creation and one of Madonna's most underrated videos. Dark and hypnotic, 'Matters' features unconventional choreography that was initially off putting to many (at least for 1999), but in actuality director Johan Renck has created a visual spectacle that demands repeat viewing. It also features one of Madonna's more inspired video performances." ...|$|E
