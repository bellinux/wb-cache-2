50|$|Lee Sun Chau was a niece of Man-Kai Wan (尹文階)(1869-1927), who was {{a younger}} brother of her mother, a son of Rev. Wei Tsing Wan (尹維清) and a {{son-in-law}} of To Tsai Church (道濟會堂) Elder Au Fung-Chi (區鳳墀)(1847-1914). Au was the Chinese language teacher of Sun Yat-sen (孫中山). Man-Kai Wan {{was one of the}} first Chinese doctors of Western Medicine in Hong Kong. In 1920-1922, he served as the inaugural Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association 香港中華醫學會 (currently Hong Kong Medical Association 香港醫學會). In 1922, he served as the Chairman of the Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong (香港中華基督教青年會). He was also a secondary school classmate of Sun Yat-sen in The Government Central College (中央書院, currently Queen's College, Hong Kong, 皇仁書院) in Hong Kong. Wan and Sun graduated from secondary school together in 1886. In 1893, they started a medical clinic (東西藥局) together. Wan also protected Sun during Sun's long and <b>dangerous</b> <b>preparation</b> for the 1911 Chinese Revolution. Man-Kai Wan was also the Chairman of the Board of a Christian newspaper called “Great Light Newspaper” (大光報) that was distributed in Hong Kong and China. In 1912, Sun wrote for the newspaper four words “與國同春”, meaning springtime along with the Nation.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigations}} of used lime at plant from company Messer-Tehnogas, Belgrade, {{were in the}} aim to improvement technologically results from flotation concentration of copper minerals in flotation plant Veliki Krivelj. This paper shows usage of slaked lime, which is waste {{in the process of}} technical gas production, for regulation of pH value in the process of copper minerals flotation concentration. It is {{important to point out that}} slaked lime is a waste material that is not <b>dangerous.</b> <b>Preparation</b> and dosage includes preparation procedures, which enable introduction into flotation process with the aim of achieving better results. Lime from Limekiln Zagrađe is brought into four storage places in flotation. Volume of each storage place is 80 m 3. Lime in pieces from storage place is added by airbladders on transportation line and by system of transportation lines lime gets to the ball mill. At the mill entrance water is added and then follows lime grinding. Milk glass of lime thus prepared goes to the pump basket from where is transported by pipeline to conditioner, and then by manual and (or) automatic valves it is dosed to the flotation concentration of copper minerals process. Prospect of advancement and rationalization of the used lime in flotation plant Bor, Veliki Krivelj and Majdanpek as well as a way to link different branches of industry was demonstrated. Total cost of lime supplying, transporting, preparation and distribution related slaked lime is lower for 2. 955 din/kg. Particularly, using lime from Messer in content of 2. 1 g/l value of pH 11. 82 is possible to obtain...|$|E

40|$|What differentiates the {{transport}} of <b>dangerous</b> substances and <b>preparations</b> from other types of goods transport is, of course, the risk associated with its eventual release during transport, since they can be extremely harmful {{to the environment and}} human health. The release of these materials during transport is a hazard, ie a process capable of producing identifiable damages (Julian, RP et al, 2009). Among existing models for hazmat transport risk assessment we focus on two of the most widely used, from ERKUT and VERTER (1995, 1998). According to these, the largest obstacle to developing more accurate models, particularly for the determination of the potentially affected areas (APA), are the limitations of available data on meteorological conditions, topography, the effect of the substance transported in people and locating of these people {{at the time of the}} incident. This limitation leads to the use of fixed limits specified by the Emergency Response Guidebook. On this purpose, there is free software very easy to use, for the determination of APAs, as ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres), produced by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. We test this software and show that important differences occur as parameters on the type and quantity of hazmat, the characteristics of the area for the type of occupancy, weather conditions and topography are included or not...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to propose {{measures}} to implement the emergency planning and emergency clearance operations, to prevent or reduce the immediate risk of accidents, according to documents provided by the IRS components, the community, administrative bodies and the storage operator. Another objective is to propose measures ensuring protection {{of the population in}} the emergency planning zone, in order to satisfy in the best possible way the following hypothesis: "Measures to implement the emergency planning and emergency clearance operations and measures to ensure population protection {{are an integral part of}} the external emergency plan, ready to resolve possible accident cases endangering lives, health, significant property values or the environment. " To meet the objectives and verify the hypothesis, I used my own experience in the field of emergency planning and my personal knowledge of the site so that I could create a proposal of appropriate measures, designed to reduce an immediate menace, and mitigate the impacts of a possible major accident. To complete the goal I chose "The storage of propane - butane bottles and bottling plant Branice at Milevsko", the local juristic person with the name TOMEGAS Ltd. By the South Bohemian regional authority, these operations were classified as category B under Act No. 59 / 2006 Coll., on the prevention of major accidents caused by selected hazardous substances or chemical preparations, and also an emergency planning zone with a radius of 1 km was established. Those objectives are proposed in accordance with all legal standards and regulations. I believe that the findings of my work will be applicable in building and updating an external emergency plan for given operations. The hypothesis is undoubtedly confirmed by the existence of international treaties and the EU legislation focused on the protection of people living in the neighborhood of buildings where <b>dangerous</b> substances and <b>preparations</b> are handled, as well as by the number of accidents happening worldwide.

40|$|Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) {{are part}} of the {{alkylphenol}} ethoxylate group of non-ionic surfactants. All NPEs degrade relatively easily to form short-chained NPEs and (particularly in anaerobic conditions) nonylphenol (NP). NP and short-chained NPEs are toxic to aquatic organisms. Since they are lipophilic, they accumulate in sewage sludge and sediments, and bioaccumulate in aquatic species. NP/NPEs also possibly have endocrine-disrupting properties. NP/NPEs were included in the 1992 OSPAR Action Plan, and were therefore added to the List of Chemicals for Priority Action in 1998. NPEs are used as emulsifiers, dispersive agents, surfactants and/or wetting agents and are the primary source of inputs to the sea of NP and NPEs. The main users are the industrial, institutional and domestic cleaning sectors (30 % of EU use). Other significant sectors are emulsion polymerisation (12 %), textiles (10 %), chemical synthesis (9 %) and leather (8 %). Estimated use in Western Europe in 1997 was 76 600 tonnes. Concentrations in the environment have decreased significantly, at least in some areas, over the last 15 - 20 years. Levels of around 0. 08 – 3. 1 μg/l of dissolved NP and 0. 09 – 5. 2 μg/l total extractable NP have been found in a UK estuary. Levels of up to 9. 5 mg/kg dry weight of NPEs have been measured in the livers of river fish. The existing OSPAR measure is PARCOM Recommendation 92 / 8 on Nonylphenol-Ethoxylates which required the phasing out of the use of NPEs as cleaning agents for domestic uses (1995) and industrial uses (2000) and initiated further study on other uses of NPEs and similar substances. National initiatives have been taken in some OSPAR States on the use of NPEs in water-based paints, agricultural pesticides, and emulsion polymers. EC action on NPEs is being considered under the EC directive relating to the restriction on the marketing and use of certain <b>dangerous</b> substances and <b>preparations,</b> but no draft directive has yet been presented. NP is included on the draft list of priority hazardous substances under the EC Water Framework Directive. The action recommended is: to support EC risk-reduction measures on NP/NPE use in agricultural pesticides and in emulsion polymers for the textile industry and coatings; to support an EC limit on NP/NPE concentrations in sewage sludge applied to agricultural soil; to develop and OSPAR monitoring strategy; to take action to prevent the substitution for NP/NPEs of other alkylphenols with similar properties; to consider whether OSPAR action is needed on the use of NP/NPEs in the offshore industry; a review by OSPAR in 2003 of the need for further OSPAR measures to supplement the eventual EC measures; and to ask other relevant international forums to take account of the background document. A monitoring strategy for nonylphenol/nonylphenolethoxylates is annexed to this background document...|$|R
