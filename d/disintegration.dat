The total number of <b>disintegrations</b> in the bone marrow was calculated by multiplying the average number of <b>disintegrations</b> within these three VOIs by the red marrow mass of the ICRP- 89 adult male reference phantom [21]. To estimate the absorbed dose to the colon, the total number of <b>disintegrations</b> in this organ was partitioned to its components (right colon, left colon and rectum) proportionally to their respective masses of the ICRP- 89 male reference phantom [21].|$|R

5|$|Diefenbaker's disinclination to make {{concessions}} to Quebec, along with the <b>disintegration</b> of the Union Nationale, {{the failure of the}} Tories to build an effective structure in Quebec, and Diefenbaker appointing few Quebecers to his Cabinet, none to senior positions, all led to an erosion of Progressive Conservative support in Quebec. Diefenbaker did recommend the appointment of the first French-Canadian governor general, Georges Vanier.|$|E

Kalonji remained popular among some groups, but lost the support of the South Kasaian évolués who saw his elevation as flagrant opportunism. Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by ten of South Kasai's 13 representatives in the Léopoldville parliament, beginning the <b>disintegration</b> of the secessionist state.|$|E

30|$|To {{calculate}} the dose {{absorbed by the}} red marrow, VOIs corresponding to L 4 and L 5 were drawn in each 64 CuCl 2 -PET/CT dataset for every patient (50 in total) [43]. Indeed, the red marrow in these two vertebrae accounts for 6.8 % of that of the entire skeleton [44]. Thus, the number of <b>disintegrations</b> in this vertebral region was divided by 0.068 to obtain the number of <b>disintegrations</b> in the entire red marrow.|$|R
40|$|The DNA in Chinese hamster cells {{was labeled}} first for 3 h with [3 H]TdR {{and then for}} 3 h with [125 I]UdR. Chromatin was extracted, frozen, and stored at - 30 degrees C until 1. 0 X 10 (17) and 1. 25 X 10 (17) disintegrations/g of labeled DNA {{occurred}} for 125 I and 3 H respectively. Velocity sedimentation of chromatin (DNA with associated chromosomal proteins) in neutral sucrose gradients indicated that the localized energy from the 125 I <b>disintegrations,</b> which gave about 1 double-strand break/disintegration plus an additional 1. 3 single strand breaks, selectively fragmented the [125 I] chromatin into pieces smaller than the [3 H] chromatin. In other words, 125 I <b>disintegrations</b> caused much more localized damage in the chromatin labeled with 125 I than in the chromatin labeled with 3 H, and fragments induced in DNA by 125 I <b>disintegrations</b> were not held together by the associated chromosomal proteins. Use of this 125 I technique for studying chromosomal proteins associated with different regions in the cellular DNA is discussed. For these studies, the number of <b>disintegrations</b> required for fragmenting DNA molecules of different sizes is illustrated...|$|R

40|$|The killing {{efficiency}} of tritium <b>disintegrations</b> in frozen mammalian cells labeled with tritiated uridine, histidine, and lysine was {{compared with the}} killing {{efficiency of}} incorporated tritiated thymidine. In each case, the distribution of tritium in the cells was determined by chemical fractionation {{as well as by}} radio-autography. Of all tritium <b>disintegrations,</b> by far the most effective were those occurring in DNA molecules within frozen cells; such incorporated tritium has a killing efficiency of 0. 006. When cells were incubated with tritiated uridine for 10 min to label nuclear RNA, the killing efficiency was 0. 0015. When the cells were pulse labeled with tritiated uridine and permitted to grow in nonradioactive media for 10 hr before freezing in order to incorporate tritium into cytoplasmic RNA, the killing efficiency was reduced to 0. 0010. The results suggest that decay of tritium in nuclear RNA is more effective than that in cytoplasmic RNA. When the cells were labeled with tritiated histidine or lysine for 30 min, tritium atoms were found mainly in the acid soluble rather than in the protein fraction and the killing efficiency in each case was approximately 0. 0007. The results of these suicide experiments indicate that the killing efficiency of tritium <b>disintegrations</b> depends on where tritium is located within the cells. Tritium <b>disintegrations</b> in the nucleus are more effective in killing the cell than that in cytoplasm; and tritium <b>disintegrations</b> on DNA in the nucleus is more effective in killing the cell than that of nuclear RNA...|$|R
