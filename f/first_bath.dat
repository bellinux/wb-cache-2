25|$|In the {{two-stage}} or two-bath method, the <b>first</b> <b>bath,</b> {{sometimes called}} blanching, is in hot fat (around 160°C / 320°F) to cook them through. This may {{be done in}} advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190°C / 375°F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a colander or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend {{on the size of}} the potatoes. For example, for 2–3mm strips, the <b>first</b> <b>bath</b> takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.|$|E
25|$|Muslims {{practice}} {{a series of}} life-cycle rituals that {{differ from those of}} Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Several rituals mark the first days of life—including the whispering call to prayer, <b>first</b> <b>bath,</b> and shaving of the head. Religious instruction begins early. Male circumcision usually takes place after birth; in some families, it may be delayed until after the onset of puberty.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensive}} Greek and Latin {{medical literature}} covered obstetrics and infant care, and the 2nd century Greek gynecologist Soranus of Ephesus advised midwives {{not to be}} superstitious. But childbirth in antiquity remained a life-threatening experience for both {{the woman and her}} newborn, with infant mortality as high as 30 or 40 percent. Rites of passage pertaining to birth and death had several parallel aspects. Maternal death was common: {{one of the most famous}} was Julia, daughter of Julius Caesar and wife of Pompey. Her infant died a few days later, severing the family ties between her father and husband and hastening the Caesar's Civil War, which ended the Roman Republic. Some ritual practices may be characterized as anxious superstitions, but the religious aura surrounding childbirth reflects the high value Romans placed on family, tradition (mos maiorum), and compatibility of the sexes. Under the Empire, children were celebrated on coins, as was Juno Lucina, the primary goddess of childbirth, as well as in public art. Funerary art, such as relief on sarcophagi, sometimes showed scenes from the deceased's life, including birth or the <b>first</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E

When the mass fraction of the <b>first</b> coagulating <b>bath</b> is among 0 %- 50 %, the pure water flux of the membrane decreases with the concentration, and the rejection ratio of BSA change less, and when the concentration of the <b>first</b> coagulating <b>bath</b> exceeds 60 % and the openings appear on the membrane surface, the pure water flux would ascend but the rejection ratio would markedly decrease...|$|R

The foundation stone was put in place in September 1891 but due to various delays including changes to drainage plans and a union dispute over the quality of lime being used in the concrete, on analysis found to be up to standard, the opening was not until well into the following year.|$|R
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the day that I took my <b>first</b> <b>bath</b> in the valley, we received another visit from Mehevi. The noble savage seemed {{to be in the same}} pleasant mood, and was quite as cordial in his manner as before. After remaining about an hour, he rose from the mats, and motioning to leave the house, invited Toby and myself to accompany him. I pointed to my leg; but Mehevi in his turn pointed to Kory-Kory, and removed that objection; so, mounting upon the faithful fellow’s shoulders again—like the old man of the sea astride of Sinbad—I followed after the chief.|$|E
60|$|It was thrice {{twenty-four hours}} after his <b>first</b> <b>bath,</b> before Mark Woolston had {{sufficient}} strength {{to reach the}} galley and light a fire. In this he then succeeded, and he treated himself to a cup of good warm tea. He concocted some dishes of arrow-root and cocoa, too, {{in the course of}} that and the next day, continuing his baths, and changing his linen repeatedly. On the fifth day, he got off his beard, which was a vast relief to him, {{and by the end of}} the week he actually crawled up on the poop, where he could get a sight of his domains.|$|E
60|$|When Jone {{told me his}} <b>first</b> <b>bath</b> was to be {{heated up}} to ninety-four degrees I said to him that he'd be boiled alive, but he wasn't; {{and when he came}} home he said he liked it. Everything is very {{systematic}} in the great bathing-house. The man who tends to Jone hangs up his watch on a little stand {{on the edge of the}} bathtub, and he stays in just so many minutes, and when he's ready to come out he rings a bell, and then he's wrapped up in about fourteen hot towels, and sits in an armchair until he's dry. Jone likes all this, and says so much about it that it makes me want to try it too; though as there isn't any reason for it I haven't tried them yet.|$|E

In 1836, Józef Micewski, with support of Agenor Goluchowski, initiated construction of the spa complex. In 1853, the village was visited by Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria. In 1911, a rail station was opened here, and by 1913, the town was receiving some 5,000 visitors per year.|$|R
60|$|After superintending Aubrey's <b>first</b> <b>bath,</b> and duly {{installing}} the vice-M. D. and her charges, Dr. Spencer departed; and Ethel was launched on an unknown ocean, as pilot to an untried crew. She {{had been told}} to regard Leonard's bashfulness as a rare grace; but it was very inconvenient to have the boy wretchedly drooping, and owning nothing amiss, apparently unacquainted with any English words, except 'Thank you' and 'No, thank you.' Indeed, she doubted whether the shyness were genuine, for stories were afloat of behaviour at Stoneborough parties which savoured of audacity, and she vainly consulted Aubrey whether the cause of his discomfiture were her age or her youth, her tutorship or her plain face. Even Aubrey could not elicit any like or dislike, wish or complaint; and shrugging up his shoulders, decided that it was of no use to bother about it; Leonard would come to his senses in time. He was passive when taken out walking, submissive when planted on a three-cornered camp-stool that expanded from a gouty walking-stick, but seemed so inadequately perched, and made so forlorn a spectacle, that they were forced to put him indoors out of the glare of sea and sky, and hoping that he would condescend to the sofa when Ethel was out of sight.|$|E
