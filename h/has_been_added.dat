5|$|Intellectual Disability – Athletes with a {{significant}} impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed {{before the age of}} 18. However, the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E

The boomboxes featured in the video are animated to look like drawings and a performance by Bedingfield {{in a room with}} flowing white drapery <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> The video debuted in June 2005 and proved successful on US video chart programs.

Several additions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> by contractor Sano-Rubin Construction Services. A gymnasium and gate station <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> Also several wings on the second and first floors and three science labs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> As well, they have moved the Pupil Personnel Services, expanded the Counseling Center, expanded and moved art rooms, expanded the cafeteria, and moved the fitness center.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} map {{itself of}} Europa Barbarorum covers a wider geographical area {{than that of}} Rome: Total War, expanding into {{areas such as the}} Arabian Peninsula, India, Central Asia, and Scandinavia. Relief, province boundaries, snow boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map. The Nile–Red Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the map, as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such as the Amber and Silk Roads, which can be captured and exploited by the player or by the artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Isambard Kingdom Brunel and {{his family}} lived in Weston, at Swiss Villa (towards {{the north end of}} Trevelyan road), while he was supervising the {{construction}} of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in the area. With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the Midlands and further afield, on works outings and bank holidays. Mining families also came across the Bristol Channel from South Wales by paddle steamer. To cater for them, Birnbeck Pier was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday amusement arcades, tea rooms, amusement rides and a photographic studio. It is now in a derelict state and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register, but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire. It was designed by Eugenius Birch with ironwork by the Isca Foundry of Newport, Monmouthshire. It is a grade II* listed building.|$|E

[...] Later, apparently by 1907, sides <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> {{to the lower}} house and an upper cabin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> [...] This increased the vessel’s draft.|$|R
50|$|Levels one and {{two have}} {{terracotta}} tile awnings with timber brackets. Two offices <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> {{to the rear of}} the ground level, and a rear bedroom and side bathroom, both with corrugated iron skillion roofs, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to level two.|$|R

5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> automatically.|$|E
5|$|The Ardennes or Ardennais {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} breeds of draft horse, and {{originates}} from the Ardennes area in Belgium, Luxembourg and France. They are heavy-boned with thick legs and are used for draft work. The Ardennes is found in many colors, although black horses are very rare and are not allowed to be registered with the breed registry. Their history reaches back to Ancient Rome, and throughout the years blood from several other breeds <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the Ardennes, although only the Belgian breed had any significant impact. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, and the first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. The horses have been used throughout history as war horses, both as cavalry mounts and to draw artillery, and are used today mainly for heavy draft and farm work, meat production and competitive driving events. They have also been used to influence or create several other horse breeds throughout Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-48 {{like all}} {{other parts of the}} state trunkline highway system under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the average traffic levels for a roadway segment on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT figured that between 580 and 1,800vehicles a day used sections of M-48. In addition, the department has added the portion of M-48 between the northern M-129 junction and M-134 to the Lake Huron Circle Tour, a scenic drive that loops around the lake. No part of the highway <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-61 {{like all}} other state trunkline highways in the state. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This is a measurement of the traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. The highest traffic level for M-61 in MDOT's 2009 surveys was 9,257vehicles per day along the Harrison business loop. The lowest AADT was 981vehicles daily between the Osceola–Clare county line and the Muskegon River crossing. No section of M-61 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present {{in every one of}} the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
