40|$|The {{flanging}} and squealing noise {{generated by}} transit metro trains while crossing a curvature path has been studied. The noise emission at curvature is analyzed {{in case of}} non lubricated and lubricated track for wayside and interior of the train. The gauge face lubrication {{does not have a}} significant effect on the A-weighted noise generated by the train transit system while passing through a curved track. The negation of lubrication effect in controlling the overall A-weighted noise emission is attributed to an additional reaction force component, which accentuates the wheel/rail interaction comparatively more than the reduced high frequency squeal and <b>flanging</b> <b>noise</b> for the lubricated track. This additional force component is generated due to longitudinal and spin creepage on the flange while encountering a curved track and is observed to cause an increase in noise emission in the frequency range 250 - 400 Hz, where the rail/wheel interaction is dominant; in both way side as well as interior noise levels...|$|E

40|$|Top of rail Friction Modifiers are {{designed}} to control frictional characteristics at the wheel-rail interface that influence noise, corrugations, and lateral forces. Key characteristics of the resulting thin film are 1) controlled intermediate coefficient of friction and 2) positive friction, to reduce roll-slip oscillations related to both curve squeal noise and short pitch corrugation development. Practical results are presented {{on the effect of}} friction modifiers on curve squeal and <b>flanging</b> <b>noise</b> generation at a range of European mass transit sites. Noise reductions ranging from 6. 3 to 22. 8 dBA were recorded, with an average reduction across the different test sites of 12. 0 dBA. Both top of rail squeal and flanging components of noise were reduced. The effect of friction modifier on short pitch corrugation development was evaluated over several years at two curves at Metro Bilbao. Under conditions where corrugations grew from 0. 01 mm to 0. 05 mm in eighteen months under baseline conditions, with application of friction modifier essentially no corrugation growth occurred in an equivalent time period. 1...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Sound {{pressure}} levels exceeding {{acceptable limits}} are being generated by trains travelling on the 1000 m radius curved railway line past {{the town of}} Elands Bay. Unacceptable sound levels are attributed mainly to top of rail wheel squeal. Top of rail wheel squeal belongs {{to the family of}} selfinduced vibrations and originates from frictional instability in curves between the wheel and the rail under predominantly saturated lateral creep conditions. In small radius curves, saturated lateral creep conditions occur due to the steering of railway wheelsets with large angles of attack. Given the large curve radius and the utilisation of self-steering bogies on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore railway line, curve squeal is a highly unexpected result for the 1000 m radius curved railway line. This is because curving of bogies in large radius curves are achieved without high wheelset angles of attack leading to saturated creep conditions. An experimental and analytical investigation was carried out to identify the mechanisms influencing the generation of wheel squeal in large radius curves. Simultaneous measurement of sound pressure and lateral wheel-rail forces were made during regular train service in one of the two 1000 m radius curves at Elands Bay to characterise the bogie curving behaviour for tonal noise due to wheel squeal occurring in the large radius curve. The lateral force curving signature not only reveals the levels of lateral wheel-rail forces required for bogie curving, but also whether the bogie is curving by means of the creep forces generated at the wheel-rail interface only or if contact is necessitated between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner to help steer the bogie around the curve. The test set-up consisted of two free field microphones radially aligned at equivalent distances towards the in – and outside of the curve in line with a set a strain gauge bridges configured and calibrated to measure the lateral and vertical forces on the inner and outer rail of the curve. This test set-up allowed the squealing wheel to be identified from the magnitude difference of the sound pressures recorded by the inner and outer microphones in combination with comparing the point of frequency shift of the squeal event due to the Doppler Effect with the force signals of the radially aligned strain gauge bridges. From the experimental phase of the investigation, it was found that wheel squeal occurring in the 1000 m radius curve at Elands Bay is characteristic of empty wagons and is strongly related to the squealing wheel’s flange/flange throat being in contact with the gauge corner of the rail. Here high levels of spin creepage associated with high contact angles in the gauge corner lead to high levels of associated lateral creepage necessary for squeal generation. This is in contrast to lateral creepage due to high wheelset angles of attack being the key kinematic parameter influencing squeal generation in small radius curves. Furthermore, the amplitude of wheel squeal originating from the passing of empty wagons was found to be inversely proportional to the level of flange rubbing on the squealing wheel i. e. increased flange contact on the squealing wheel brings about a positive effect on squeal control. Contrary to the empty wagons which are characterised by tonal curve squeal, loaded 4 wagons requiring contact between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner in the 1000 m curve was characterised by broadband <b>flanging</b> <b>noise.</b> It was concluded from measurements that flange contact occurring under high lateral forces for steady state curving of loaded wagons provides the complete damping necessary for squeal control. The curve squeal noise that originated from the passing of empty wagons in the Elands Bay curve could further be classified according to the frequency at which the squeal event manifested itself in the curve, i. e. low frequency audible (0 – 10 kHz), high frequency audible (10 – 20 kHz) and ultrasonic squeal (> 20 kHz). The vast majority of low frequency audible squeal events recorded in the 1000 m Elands Bay curve occurred at approximately 4 kHz and originated from the low rail/trailing inner wheel interface, whilst the vast majority of high frequency audible squeal events occurred in the frequency range between 15 and 20 kHz and originated from both the high rail/leading outer wheel and low rail/trailing inner wheel interfaces...|$|E
