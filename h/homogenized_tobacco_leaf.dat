50|$|A little cigar is a cigar that is {{the same}} size as a cigarette—often {{featuring}} a filter—however, it still retains its identity as a cigar because it is wrapped in a <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> or more often a paper wrapper made of tobacco pulp, reconstituted <b>tobacco</b> or <b>homogenized</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Flavored little cigars are available on the market as well. Flavored little cigars have been steadily increasing in popularity among cigar smokers. Manufacturers like Prime Time have been offering flavored little cigars since 1993.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Nowadays tobacco {{enterprises}} {{are required}} to enhance the level of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> management {{in order to increase}} their competitiveness in complex markets. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> value chain management plays a fundamental role in this process as the correct implementation of strategies is determined by the information transfer and integration within the enterprise. This paper presents the <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> value chain management model by through the collaboration of ERP and PDM system with SAP XI as the enterprise service bus. Under this collaboration management model, PDM system manage the whole life cycle of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> and in ERP system, manage all business processes, systems interactive information by the way of Web Services. Therefore, logistics, capital flow and information flow can be better unified management in <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> management. And this model could achieve the information support for tobacco resource procurement management and aimed at reduce the operating costs of production, thereby enhancing the market competitiveness of the cigarette products...|$|R

5000|$|Modern {{cigarettes}} produced {{after the}} 1950s, although composed mainly of shredded <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> use a significant quantity of tobacco processing byproducts in the blend.

These leaves are selected, processed, and aged prior to blending and filling. The processing of brightleaf and burley <b>tobaccos</b> for <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> [...] "strips" [...] produces several byproducts such as <b>leaf</b> stems, <b>tobacco</b> dust, and <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> pieces ("small laminate").

A designing method and Implementation algorithm of fuzzy-PID is given. For the difficulty of traditional PID controller parameters adjusting, the PID parameters were adjusted online by using fuzzy reasoning method. It can combine the advantages of general fuzzy control and traditional PID control in this method, and it is simulated and compared with general PID control on the simulation platform of MATLAB control box. The simulation results show that the fuzzy self-tuning PID controller has good dynamic response curve, short response time, small overmodulation, high steady state precision, and good dynamic and static performance by comparing with the traditional PID controller. Therefore temperature and humidity control of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> roasting will perfectly improved by fuzz PID control...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco {{production}} in China {{is influenced by}} a government-set procurement price for <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> and an excise tax on <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> revenue. This study examines {{the increase in the}} procurement price needed to keep tax revenue constant {{in the face of a}} 50 % reduction in the tax rate. This “compensative effect” is important because reductions in the tax rate are contemplated and tobacco tax revenue is a major source of funding for rural communities. Based on an equilibrium-displacement model of China’s tobacco sector, results suggest the “Compensated Effect Elasticity” (CEE) is between 1. 0 and 2. 5. This means a 50 % cut in the tax rate would necessitate an increase in the procurement price of between 50 % and 125 %. Sensitivity analysis indicates CEE is most sensitive to the retail demand and input substitution elasticities and least sensitive to oligopoly power and returns to scale. <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> tax rate, procuring price, compensative effects, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

50|$|The Macdonald Tobacco Company {{was founded}} in 1858 by William Christopher Macdonald and his brother Augustine. Initially called McDonald Brothers and Co., the company {{procured}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> from suppliers in the southern United States that was converted to pipe and chewing tobacco at their small Montreal facility. While the use of tobacco products was growing in popularity, the American Civil War afforded the fledgling company an opportunity that brought enormous financial success leading to Macdonald Brothers becoming the preeminent company {{in the field in}} Canada. Virtually all of the tobacco growers were located in U.S. states that were part of the Confederacy and with the onset of the war, the northern states faced a huge shortage of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf.</b> Because Macdonald <b>Tobacco</b> was a Canadian company, they were able to buy the <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> from the Southern United States and have it brought by ocean cargo vessels to Montreal.

40|$|Reaction of <b>tobacco</b> {{and rice}} <b>leaf</b> tissue {{infiltrated}} with either st. rains of Burkholderia glumae or B. gladioli was investigated. Visual alteration areas of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> at sites infiltrated with high concentration (more than 10 ⁷ cells/ml) {{of the bacteria}} were categorized into two types, one causing necrosis with hypersensitive-like reaction (HLR) within 24 hr of infiltration, and the other developing only yellowish discoloration. Living bacterial cells and the toxoflavin were effective for necrosis induction, whereas heat-killed celis, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) were ineffective. In the case of B. glumae, necrosis occurred with toxoflavin producing strains. No necrotic lesions developed with toxoflavin non-producing strains. All strains of B. gladioli induced necrosis with water soaking lesions in <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf.</b> Infiltration of toxoflavin producing strains of B. glumae and B. gladioli to rice leaf caused necrosis or a chlorotic spot on the leaf. A toxoflavin dose of more than 100 μg/ml induced necrosis, suggesting dose relationship between virulence to rice and necrosis inductivity to an lmcongenial plant such as tobacco. Thus, the principle which induces HLR {{can be regarded as}} an essential attribute for pathogenicity. In contrast to the reaction of rice leaf toward toxoflavin, necrosis in <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> could not simply be a reaction to toxoflavin but rather to additional lmknown factors...|$|R

The data analysis technique is by using One-Way Anova testing followed by the Games-Howell test. The results of this study indicate that LC 50 and LC 90 concentrations of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> extracts are 0. 058 % and 0. 095 %.
