40|$|Abstract — When the {{end-effector}} of a robot is slid {{on a flat}} surface, {{the stiffness}} matrix obtained by linear fitting of position and force contains information {{not only on the}} stiffness coefficient and on the normal direction, but also on the friction coefficient. This paper proposes a new method for extracting information on those properties from the stiffness matrix provided by the impedance perception, which the authors previously proposed. The proposed method can be easily implemented as an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>module</b> for perception, which is separated from any control and planning methodologies. Therefore, this can be used for both autonomous and remote controlled robots, and even for monitoring a manipulation tasks performed by humans. Results of preliminary experiments are presented.

40|$|Objects take {{up space}} in memory. If your program creates lots of objects, throws them away, and creates more, you might {{eventually}} {{run out of}} memory. To reduce the chance that this will happen, Java has garbage collection. While the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs your program, it also spends little bits of time searching for objects that you’re no longer using, so it can reclaim their memory for use by other objects. You don’t have {{to know anything about}} garbage collection to be an effective Java programmer. But garbage collection is interesting because the JVM uses a lot of hidden data structures to manage memory.

Choppy (Eds.), Springer, Berlin, LNCS 655, pp. 40 - 65 There is a peculiar confusion around the notions of object and abstract data type in practice: while the latter has been made mathematically precise as an isomorphism class of algebras, practitioners tend to view an abstract data type as an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>module</b> exporting a set of procedures through which its data can be accessed and manipulated.

We investigated the effects of CdS thickness in collaboration with six CdTe cell-fabrication laboratories; {{there appears to be a}} critical thickness, between 500 and 1000 {Angstrom} depending on fabrication process, below which junction quality is degraded. Our experimental and modeling project showed that conduction-band offsets less than about 0. 3 eV have little effect on the performance of a CuInSe{sub 2 } (CIS) or CdTe cell under the traditional assumption that the absorber material accounts for most of the depletion region. The work in several other cell projects included the role of Ga distribution in Cu{sub 1 -x}Ga{sub x}Se{sub 2 } (CIGS) cells, changes that occur in some cells over time, optical characterization of commonly used CdTe substrates and front contacts, and comparative characterization of CIGS cells where identical absorbers were combined with variations in window fabrication. Our work on the primary module-characterization project developed the successful use of chopping-frequency variation in a scanning beam to separate photocurrent and shunting problems affecting individual cells of an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>module.</b> Other module projects included modifications in analysis required by the typical module-cell geometry, the practical effect of nonuniformities in light intensity or cell temperature, and the advantages and pitfalls of forward bias across a module during a light scan...|$|E
40|$|This final {{subcontract}} report, describing work {{to fabricate}} a large-area, stable, 12. 5 % (aperture) -efficient encapsulated CuInSe{sub 2 } (CIS) module by scalable, low-cost techniques on inexpensive substrates. Demonstrated <b>encapsulated</b> <b>module</b> efficiencies (encapsulated 12. 8 %-efficient mini-module on 68. 9 cm{sup 2 } and an NREL-verified 12. 7 %-efficient unencapsulated circuit on 69 CM{sup 2 } with a prismatic cover) {{are the highest}} reported mini-module demonstrated (and verified by NREL). This is the first thin-film module of its size to exceed the 10 % efficiency level. SSI also supplied NREL with a 1 -kW array of large-area ({approximately} 3890 CM{sup 2 }) approximately 30 -W modules. The NREL-verified performance of this array is a significant step toward meeting the efficiency target of the USDOE Five-Year Plan goals of 8 % [...] 10 %-efficient commercial thin-film, flat-plate modules. Long-term outdoor stability of CIS and CIS-based absorbers was demonstrated by testing at NREL. Excellent stability was demonstrated for 6 years of outdoor exposure. The stability of the 1 -kW Siemens CIS array, installed and tested at NREL, was also demonstrated for an exposure of about 1 year. The foundations have been laid to meet the thin-film milestones of the DOE Five-Year Plan. Outdoor testing has demonstrated excellent intrinsic module stability.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{developments have}} redefined a Whorfian effect as a processing difference {{due to the}} language of the individual, and no longer as a marker for or against linguistic determinism. Within this framework, Whorfian effects can be used to investigate whether a particular part of the cognitive system is penetrable by language processes or forms an <b>encapsulated</b> <b>module,</b> provided the experimenter ensures that the target language difference is not caused by peripheral input or output processes. In this article, we examine the possibility of a Whorfian effect in numerical cognition by making use of the: fact that in the Dutch number naming system the order of tens and units is reversed (i. e. 24 is read 'four-and-twenty'). In a first experiment, we asked native French- and Dutch-speaking students to name the solution of addition problems with a two-digit and a single-digit operand (e. g. 20 + 4 = ?, 24 + 1 = ?). The order of the operands was manipulated (20 + 4 vs. 4 + 20) as well as the presentation modality (Arabic vs. verbal). Three language differences emerged from this study. Experiment 2, however, showed that these differences were all due to input or output processes rather than differences in the addition operation (i. e. the differences between Dutch and French disappeared when subjects were asked to type the answer rather than pronounce it). On the basis of these findings, we question the idea that mathematical operations are based on verbal processes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

40|$|Jerry Fodor’s {{modularity}} theory {{holds that}} psychological processes behind basic perception {{have a property}} called informational encapsulation that preserves a consistency of experience across individuals and over time. Encapsulation keeps basic perception fixed, mechanical, insulated, and leaves it largely unalterable by the variability of higher-level cognition, as in acquired beliefs, knowledge, imagination, memory, and individual learning. However, encapsulation conflicts with mounting evidence that perceptual processes are sensitive to higher-level cognition under specific conditions. In this thesis, I will argue that modularity cannot adequately account for certain findings about perceptual experience. I will then propose an alternative theory of ‘holistic information transfer’, ‘cognitive information taps’, and ‘adaptive automations’ that accommodates the empirical literature behind observed cases of perceptual plasticity and accounts for the apparent implasticity that motivates modularity theory.

There are several design paradigms in use today, including traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and Instance-Oriented Programming (IOP). FOP studies the modularity of features in product lines, where a feature is an increment in program functionality. AOP aims to separate and modularize aspects when an aspect is a crosscutting concern. IOP, as an extension to FOP, makes the layers work like object factories.
