50|$|The {{loading gauge}} is maximum size of rolling stock, which is {{distinct}} from the structure gauge, which is minimum size of bridges and tunnels which must be larger to allow for engineering tolerances and car motion. The {{difference between the two}} is called the clearance.

50|$|The {{standard}} defines static envelopes for trains on {{the national}} network as T, Tc and Tpr. The static profile 1-T is the common standard on the complete 1520 mm rail network including the CIS and Baltic states. The structure clearance is given as S, Sp and S250. There is a tradition that structure clearance is {{much bigger than the}} common train sizes. For international traffic the standard references the <b>kinematic</b> <b>envelope</b> for GC and defines a modified GCru for its high-speed trains. For other international traffic there are 1-T, 1-VM, 0-VM, 02-VM and 03-VMst/03-VMk for the trains and 1-SM for the structure clearance.|$|E
30|$|The use {{of small}} CLT panels {{for making a}} large shear wall {{requires}} many panel-to-panel connections. When designing a large CLT wall with small panels, the designer must ensure that the wall does not fail by the HE and VE connections and by the uplift at the bracket like a single panel wall. In this study, additional kinematic formulae for panel-to-panel failure were made. Using the formulae, the two CLT shear walls containing panel-to-panel connection were designed to fail at the bracket by the uplift force and were experimentally investigated. Also, using the <b>kinematic</b> formulae the <b>envelope</b> curves were predicted.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigorous mathematical formulation for mod-elling the upper extremity that {{is capable of}} considering a relatively large number of degrees of freedom, thus yielding a realistic model and associated <b>envelope.</b> <b>Kinematic</b> models are used to determine the reach envelope in closed form and to better understand human motion. Joint ranges of motion are taken into account by transform-ing unilateral inequality constraints into equalities that are included in the formulation. Methods from geometry are implemented to analyze the motion and delineate barriers within the workspace. These barriers are, in fact, observed to be surfaces where one or more joints of the limb are at their limits, but also where the hand's motion has encountered a kinematic singular configuration. Such a configuration is mathematically defined, and is physically associated with two links being parallel at an instant in time or where two joints axes are parallel (e. g., a fully extended arm yields a singular configuration). Barriers to motion can now be characterized in terms of different human performance measures, thus leading {{to a better understanding of}} the path trajectories assumed by humans as they execute tasks...|$|R
40|$|The Young Stellar Object (YSO) W 33 A {{is one of}} {{the best}} known {{examples}} of a massive star still in the process of forming. Here we present Gemini North ALTAIR/NIFS laser-guide star adaptive-optics assisted K-band integral-field spectroscopy of W 33 A and its inner reflection nebula. In our data we make the first detections of a rotationally-flattened outer envelope and fast bi-polar jet of a massive YSO at near-infrared wavelengths. The predominant spectral features observed are Br-gamma, H_ 2, and a combination of emission and absorption from CO gas. We perform a 3 -D spectro-astrometric analysis of the line emission, the first study of its kind. We find that the object's Br-gamma emission reveals evidence for a fast bi-polar jet on sub-milliarcsecond scales, which is aligned with the larger-scale outflow. The hybrid CO features can be explained as a combination of hot CO emission arising in a disk close to the central star, while cold CO absorption originates in the cooler outer <b>envelope.</b> <b>Kinematic</b> analysis of these features reveals that both structures are rotating, and consistent with being aligned perpendicularly to both the ionised jet and the large-scale outflow. Assuming Keplerian rotation, we find that the circumstellar disk orbits a central mass of > 10 Msun, while the outer envelope encloses a mass of ~ 15 Msun. Our results suggest a scenario of a central star accreting material from a circumstellar disk at the centre of a cool extended rotating torus, while driving a fast bi-polar wind. These results therefore provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the formation mechanism for high-mass stars is qualitatively similar to that of low-mass stars.

40|$|A major {{research}} project investigating {{the effect of}} tunnelling on existing tunnels has been completed at Imperial College London. This subject is always of great concern during the planning and execution of underground tunnelling works in the urban environment. Many cities already have extensive existing tunnel networks {{and so it is}} necessary to construct new tunnels at a level beneath them. The associated deformations that take place during tunnelling have to be carefully assessed and their impact on the existing tunnels estimated.

40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} how enhanced total flight force production compromises steering performance in tethered flying fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The animals were flown in a closed-loop virtual-reality flight {{arena in which}} they modulated total flight force production in response to vertically oscillating visual patterns. By simultaneously measuring stroke amplitude and stroke frequency, we recorded the ability of each fly to modulate its wing kinematics {{at different levels of}} aerodynamic force production. At a flight force that exactly compensates body weight, the temporal deviations with which fruit flies vary their stroke amplitude and frequency are approximately 27 ° and 4. 8 Hz of their mean value, respectively. This variance in wing kinematics decreases with increasing flight force production, and at maximum force production fruit flies are restricted to a unique combination of stroke amplitude, stroke frequency and mean force coefficient. This collapse in the <b>kinematic</b> <b>envelope</b> during peak force production could greatly attenuate the manoeuvrability and stability of animals in free flight. ...|$|E
