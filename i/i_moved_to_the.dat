500|$|They were on {{the road}} again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Argyle came away with all three points {{courtesy}} of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner. [...] "It was pretty special and I was a little choked up," [...] he said. [...] "It was a special night. When <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> States 20 years ago, I didn't think it would come to fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough. Bringing Plymouth Argyle here in my present role was a special occasion." [...] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park {{for the first time since}} his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2–0 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat. Argyle played out an entertaining 0–0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later, but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety. They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2–1 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips. In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2–0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side, which left them four points adrift with four games left. A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road, but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. [...] "We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday." ...|$|E

Stewards did not seek to investigate the incident but critics alleged he braked (or did not accelerate as expected) in front of Hamilton causing Hamilton to crash into him. The telemetry data from Alonso's car proved these accusations to be wrong. Hamilton himself stated [...] "I was behind him, and <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, and he moved to the right and that was it– a racing incident I guess". It was later revealed by McLaren that Hamilton's front wing, which was damaged when he hit Alonso earlier in the race, had broken seconds before the impact and has been identified as the cause of the crash. Alonso started the [...] with promising pace, qualifying on the front row in second place behind Kimi Räikkönen even though he had a light fuel load. He was running in fifth place when his engine blew on lap 35.

2500|$|Musically, A Girl like Me reveals {{new types}} of musical genres {{compared}} to Rihanna's light and uptempo debut effort, Music of the Sun. Her goal on the album was to find songs that express the many things young women want to say, but might not know how. In an interview, Rihanna said: [...] "Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] Reggae music, present in her debut album, subsequently continues into A Girl like Me. For the album, Rihanna used influences of different music genres, including rock music, while keeping the roots of her previous album, which where reggae and dancehall. The new effort also presents Rihanna's new side with some balladic elements. Although the album mostly follows the disco-ish mode of its predecessor, it was noted for its introduction of the rock genre to Rihanna's music, mostly represented by the rock and reggae mash-up [...] "Kisses Don't Lie", though Rihanna herself stated that the album is not overall driven by rock influence. In an interview, Rihanna commented: [...] "Growing up in Barbados, I wasn't exposed {{to a lot of}} rock music. We really love reggae and soca music and hip-hop. But when <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States last year, I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [...] I love rock music." [...] Celia SanMiguel of Vibe [...] magazine wrote that A Girl like Me is [...] "a pop album, one informed but not bounded by Rihanna's Caribbean roots", and that it [...] "dispels any lingering notions of her as a dancehall-meets-R ambassador." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the album [...] "a record that almost identically" [...] veered between [...] "sunny dancehall/dub-pop", [...] "hip-hop-infused club bangers", and [...] "adult-oriented ballads".|$|E

Yet I did not shrink from him. I welcomed him with a smile. He whispered into my ear. It was like the hiss of a snake; but I smiled. I whispered back again. He nodded. Ah! the way before me was growing clear at last. Was it not fate that had brought Gomez ready to my hand? Ay! fate! A good fate! A kind fate!

But if it were some new kind of foot-gear {{that he had not}} yet made me, then indeed he would observe ceremony--divesting me of my boot and holding it long in his hand, looking at it with eyes at once critical and loving, as if recalling the glow with which he had created it, and rebuking the way in which one had disorganized this masterpiece. Then, placing my foot on a piece of paper, he would two or three times tickle the outer edges with a pencil and pass his nervous fingers over my toes, feeling himself into the heart of my requirements.|$|E

60|$|On {{my table}} there lay {{a piece of}} the same yellow paper I had seen in the north room; it was written on with pencil in the same hand, Olalla's hand, and I picked it up with a sudden sinking of alarm, and read, 'If you have any {{kindness}} for Olalla, if you have any chivalry for a creature sorely wrought, go from here to-day; in pity, in honour, for the sake of Him who died, I supplicate that you shall go.' I looked at this awhile in mere stupidity, then I began to awaken to a weariness and horror of life; the sunshine darkened outside on the bare hills, and I began to shake like a man in terror. The vacancy thus suddenly opened in my life unmanned me like a physical void. It was not my heart, it was not my happiness, it was life itself that was involved. I could not lose her. I said so, and stood repeating it. And then, like one in a dream, <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, put forth my hand to open the casement, and thrust it through the pane. The blood spurted from my wrist; and with an instantaneous quietude and command of myself, I pressed my thumb on the little leaping fountain, and reflected what to do. In that empty room there was nothing to my purpose; I felt, besides, that I required assistance. There shot into my mind a hope that Olalla herself might be my helper, and I turned and went down stairs, still keeping my thumb upon the wound.|$|E
6000|$|Eight or {{nine months}} after the {{distress}} of the torrents had departed from me, the roar and thunder of the streets of Paris brought it all back again. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace. About midnight the noises dulled away, and I was sinking to sleep, when I heard a new and curious sound; I listened: evidently some joyous lunatic was softly dancing a [...] "double shuffle" [...] in the room over my head. I {{had to wait for}} him to get through, of course. Five long, long minutes he smoothly shuffled away--a pause followed, then something fell with a thump on the floor. I said to myself [...] "There--he is pulling off his boots--thank heavens he is done." [...] Another slight pause--he went to shuffling again! I said to myself, [...] "Is he trying to see what he can do with only one boot on?" [...] Presently came another pause and another thump on the floor. I said [...] "Good, he has pulled off his other boot--NOW he is done." [...] But he wasn't. The next moment he was shuffling again. I said, [...] "Confound him, he is at it in his slippers!" [...] After a little came that same old pause, and right after it that thump on the floor once more. I said, [...] "Hang him, he had on TWO pair of boots!" [...] For an hour that magician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as twenty-five pair, and I was hovering on the verge of lunacy. I got my gun and stole up there. The fellow {{was in the midst of}} an acre of sprawling boots, and he had a boot in his hand, shuffling it--no, I mean POLISHING it. The mystery was explained. He hadn't been dancing. He was the [...] "Boots" [...] of the hotel, and was attending to business.|$|E
6000|$|Appearances {{are against}} me. Don't believe them. I have written you, in intention, fifty letters, and I can claim no credit for anyone of them (though {{they were the}} best letters you ever read), for they all {{originated}} in my desire to live in your memory and regard. Since I heard from Count D'Orsay, I have been beset in I don't know how many ways. First of all, I went to Marseilles {{and came back to}} Genoa. Then <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peschiere. Then some people, who had been present at the Scientific Congress here, made a sudden inroad on that establishment, and overran it. Then they went away, and I shut myself up for a month, close and tight, over my little Christmas book, [...] "The Chimes." [...] All my affections and passions got twined and knotted up in it, and I became as haggard as a murderer, long before I wrote [...] "The End." [...] When I had done that, like [...] "The man of Thessaly," [...] who having scratched his eyes out in a quickset hedge, plunged into a bramble-bush to scratch them in again, I fled to Venice, to recover the composure I had disturbed. From thence I went to Verona and to Mantua. And now I am here--just come up from underground, and earthy all over, from seeing that extraordinary tomb in which the dead saint lies in an alabaster case, with sparkling jewels all about him to mock his dusty eyes, not to mention the twenty-franc pieces which devout votaries were ringing down upon a sort of sky-light in the cathedral pavement above, {{as if it were the}} counter of his heavenly shop. You know Verona? You know everything in Italy, I know. The Roman Amphitheatre there delighted me beyond expression. I never saw anything so full of solemn ancient interest. There are the four-and-forty rows of seats, as fresh and perfect as if their occupants had vacated them but yesterday--the entrances, passages, dens, rooms, corridors, the numbers over some of the arches. An equestrian troop had been there some days before, and had scooped out a little ring at one end of the arena, and had their performances in that spot. I should like to have seen it, of all things, for its very dreariness. Fancy a handful of people sprinkled over one corner of the great place (the whole population of Verona wouldn't fill it now); and a spangled cavalier bowing to the echoes, and the grass-grown walls! I climbed to the topmost seat, and looked away at the beautiful view for some minutes; when I turned round, and looked down into the theatre again, it had exactly the appearance of an immense straw hat, to which the helmet in the Castle of Otranto was a baby; the rows of seats representing the different plaits of straw, and the arena the inside of the crown. I had great expectations of Venice, but they fell immeasurably short of the wonderful reality. The short time I passed there went by me in a dream. I hardly think it possible to exaggerate its beauties, its sources of interest, its uncommon novelty and freshness. A thousand and one realisations of the Thousand and one Nights, could scarcely captivate and enchant me more than Venice.|$|E
