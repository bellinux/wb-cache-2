5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism <b>itself,</b> <b>a</b> philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

While Hermine {{was not of}} <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> particularly damaging storm, its effects combined {{with those of other}} tropical cyclones, and resulted in agricultural damage.|$|E
