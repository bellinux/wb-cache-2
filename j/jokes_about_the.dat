25|$|In October 2004, {{during an}} 18-night stint at London's Hammersmith Apollo, Connolly was criticised for making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hostage Kenneth Bigley. Shortly after Connolly joked {{about the future}} killing of the hostage and touched {{on the subject of}} Bigley's young Thai wife, Bigley was {{beheaded}} in Iraq. Connolly claims he was misquoted. He has declined to clarify what he actually said, claiming that the context was as important as the precise words used.|$|E

His friend, Mr. Darcy, is reputed to be twice as wealthy; however, he is haughty and aloof. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, suggesting that she is not pretty enough to tempt him. She finds this amusing and <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> statement with her friends. Mr. Bingley's sister, Caroline, later invites Jane to visit.|$|E

25|$|Most Gulag {{inmates were}} not {{political}} prisoners, although {{significant numbers of}} political prisoners {{could be found in}} the camps at any one time. Petty crimes and <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government and officials were punishable by imprisonment. About half of political prisoners in the Gulag camps were imprisoned without trial; official data suggest that there were over 2.6 million sentences to imprisonment on cases investigated by the secret police throughout 1921–53. The GULAG was reduced in size following Stalin’s death in 1953, in a period known as the Khrushchev Thaw.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, [...] "Probably the least {{satisfying}} of Sideshow Bob's gleamings - but there's enough slapstick and satire to keep things ticking along nicely." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote, [...] "Though it doesn’t compete with the best Bob shows, {{it has more than}} a few nice moments." [...] He added that he enjoyed R. Lee Ermey's guest appearance as well as the <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Fox network. Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when Milhouse was playing in the fighter jet at the air show. Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B.|$|E
500|$|The special {{broadcast}} of the episode in Ireland was part of Fox's year-long [...] "Best. 20 Years. Ever." [...] celebration which commemorates the 20th anniversary of the show. To promote the broadcast, Jean, Brooks and voice actor Nancy Cartwright visited Ireland and participated in the Saint Patrick's Day parade in Dublin. Critics in Ireland mostly enjoyed the <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nation but felt that the episode itself was average. The initial broadcast on Sky1 in Ireland was watched by 511,000 viewers, with a 33% share making it the most watched Sky1 broadcast in Ireland ever. In the United Kingdom, an average of 957,000 viewers (with a 4.7% share) watched. The first airing of the episode on Fox in the United States finished with a 3.6 Nielsen rating and was viewed in 6.15 million homes, finishing third in its timeslot.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said [...] "94 Meetings" [...] was a {{particularly}} strong episode that focused equally on the show's premise and developing the relationships between characters. He particularly praised Susan Yeagley, but said Tom Haverford was underused, and felt the scenes between Ann and Mark were lacking. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell {{said it was a}} fast-paced and funny episode, calling the <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> complaining residents [...] "rapid-fire scenes". Kandell criticized Mark, who he said has been resorted to boring [...] "straight-man services", and said he did not mind that Paul Schneider was leaving the series. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad appreciated that the episode reintroduced the fact that Leslie once was in love with Mark, and criticized the show for ignoring that fact all season. Gallagher also criticized the fact that a historic building could so easily be damaged and demolished, which he called unrealistic.|$|E
500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole thing was a bit of a waste of time." ...|$|E
500|$|When Lois {{says they}} haven't heard from Joe, he is seen {{screaming}} the Rifleman's Creed at his wheelchair like marines {{do with their}} rifles in the bootcamp sequence in Full Metal Jacket. When the Griffins return home to Stewie, the background music is an instrumental of [...] "Somewhere In My Memory" [...] by John Williams, which scores a similar scene in Home Alone. When Stewie is exploring the house he finds a Hustler magazine under his brother's bed, curious of what a vagina looks like. After seeing a page of the magazine, however, he instantly becomes horrified {{by the sight of}} a vagina on one of the pages, retrieves a submachine gun from hammerspace, and opens fire on the magazine, reducing it to scraps of paper with the whole magazine of the weapon. Stewie mentions that Aquaman is pretty useless if the crime does not take place on water. Other references included <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> television series Lost and actors Robin Williams and Sean Connery.|$|E

500|$|TV Fanatic {{said the}} episode {{was not as}} strong as {{previous}} seasons, but an improvement over [...] "Sexual Healing". The site praised the emphasis on Butters and the pop culture references to The Catcher in the Rye, John Lennon, Sarah Jessica Parker and [...] "the useless Kardashian Klan". The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said he [...] "chuckled a few times", but found the vomit jokes acted like a substitute for [...] "actual dialogue". However, O'Neal praised the satire of people looking too deeply into the meaning of meaningless art, and how easily that theme can be applied to South Park itself. Not all reviews were entirely positive. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Butters was [...] "awesome, as usual", and thought the <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Kardashians were funny, but that the positive elements of the episode were [...] "not enough to balance out the failures". He particularly criticized the Sarah Jessica Parker jokes as [...] "flat and random", and the constant vomiting as [...] "just one long-running 'joke' that was just plain awful".|$|E
500|$|On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart remarked, {{tongue in}} cheek, [...] "apparently [...] {{was under the}} {{impression}} that they'd hired him to do what he does every night on television". While comics were expected to tell <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> administration, the 2006 dinner was held at a time when the relationship between the administration and the media was under great strain, and the administration was sensitive to criticism. Attorney and columnist Julie Hilden concluded that Colbert's [...] "vituperative parody" [...] might have been unfair under different circumstances, but noted that Bush's record of controlling bad press created a heightened justification for people to criticize him when they got the chance. Media Matters [...] and Editor & Publisher came to Colbert's defense, calling his detractors hypocrites. They contrasted the critical reaction to Colbert to the praise that many in the press had for a controversial routine that Bush performed at a similar media dinner in 2004, where Bush was shown looking for WMDs in the Oval Office and joking, [...] "Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere!" [...] and [...] "Nope, no weapons over there!" ...|$|E
500|$|Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{pointed out}} that {{although}} the episode mocked drug addicts and handicapped children, it did not face the kind of censorship [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201" [...] did, which he suggested proved that censorship was born of fear rather than ethics. Delgado also said the comparison of handicapped children to Looney Tunes characters [...] "should remind us all that such cruel portrayals of disabled people {{have been going on}} for years". Others criticized the episode. MTV writer Adam Rosenberg thought the episode [...] "just wasn't very funny", and said it missed an opportunity to continue the creative edginess demonstrated in [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201". Rosenberg found the jokes about handicapped children [...] "pointlessly mean", and said {{the fact that they are}} allowed where depictions of Muhammad are censored [...] "makes a point about the absurdity of what is and isn't TV-acceptable". The television website TV Fanatic praised the Towelie storyline and the use of his son [...] "Washcloth", but said the <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> handicapped children were unfunny and irritating. The site called it [...] "by far the weakest of the season" [...] and a disappointment following [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201".|$|E

500|$|John's lack of {{religious}} conviction {{has been noted}} by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that John was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time. Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> implausibility of the Resurrection. They commented on the paucity of John's charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argues that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may have turned him against the church. Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John's personal interest {{in the life of}} St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later declared a saint. Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances – albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance. The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was [...] "at least conventionally devout," [...] citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries.|$|E
500|$|Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall cited [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] as {{the best}} future-set episode of The Simpsons since the first one, [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He noted that it was [...] "the {{emotional}} side of things" [...] that made the episode successful, such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children, and also Homer's transformation into a [...] "very wise, sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age." [...] Sepinwall particularly praised {{the scene at the}} cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as [...] "really sweet", and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as [...] "a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [...] because he's such a pain in the ass." [...] Sepinwall also commended the episode for its <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future, highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing Krusty as [...] "the Andy Rooney of 2041" [...] and Ralph Wiggum as [...] "an endless series of stupid clones who keep killing one another." [...] In February 2012, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of [...] "Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics". He noted that the [...] "reconciliations between Bart and Lisa and their kids are moving." ...|$|E
500|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Howard (Melissa Leo) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} an Iowa woman who {{was shot to death}} in front of her husband Robert Ellison (Robin Williams) and two young children during a stick-up. Since the victims are tourists, the case becomes a [...] "red ball" [...] and receives considerable attention from the press, city officials and top police brass. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) tries to interview the two young children, but Ellison stops him, protesting that the experience is too hard on them. After obtaining information from street thugs, the police arrest Marvin (Antonio Charity), who possesses 45-caliber bullets matching those used in the shooting. Marvin tells the detectives that he's a [...] "stone stick-up man" [...] who has robbed dozens of people and never shot anyone because people don't argue with a [...]45-carrying man, and also that he knows he will spend decades in prison anyway because he was involved in the shooting so there is no reason he would lie about being the shooter. A mournful Ellison overhears Felton making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> investigation and bragging about the overtime he expects to receive from it. He angrily demands Felton be thrown off the case, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calms him down by explaining the police have to be detached from the victims because they encounter so many. Ellison takes his children back to their hotel room, where his daughter Abby (Julia Devin) is in denial about her mother's death, and his son Matt (Jake Gyllenhaal) angrily refuses to talk to his father.|$|E

5000|$|On March 24, 2004, Bush <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{weapons of}} mass {{destruction}} issue at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner. While showing slides of himself searching the Oval Office, he joked, [...] "those {{weapons of mass}} destruction have got to be somewhere ... nope, no weapons over there ... maybe under here?" [...] Some found it tasteless of him to be <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue. Others defended the joke as being in line with the self-deprecatory sort of humor that has come to be expected of Presidents when they speak at that event.|$|R
