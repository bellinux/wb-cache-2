500|$|He was a cricket enthusiast, {{taking his}} bat {{with him when}} {{evacuated}} during the Blitz. In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: [...] "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read {{about it all the}} time." [...] He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. [...] The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.|$|E
500|$|The band {{illustrated}} the theme {{on the cover}} of Double Nickels on the Dime, which depicts Watt driving his Volkswagen Beetle at exactly 55 miles per hour ("double nickels" [...] in trucker slang) traveling southbound through downtown Los Angeles on Route 110, also known as the Harbor Freeway, toward the band's hometown of San Pedro, California. [...] "The title means fifty-five miles per hour on the button, like we were Johnny Conservative." [...] Dirk Vandenberg, the band's [...] "buddy/contributor," [...] took photos from the backseat as Watt drove under the sign to San Pedro; it took three circuits of the highway and two days of photography before Minutemen were happy with the cover. Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: [...] "There were three elements that Mike [...] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes reflected in the rearview mirror, the speedometer pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home". However, when the cover was presented to SST, [...] "someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Cottingham of NME {{gave the}} album {{six out of}} ten, saying that [...] "Tinie is most {{definitely}} a star, second only to Dizzee Rascal on the UK scene, perhaps even above him following Dizzee's dismal ‘The Fifth’ album. So perhaps it's no surprise Tinie's brimming with confidence on record number two." [...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that makes all the right moves, but lacks any serious bite." [...] Larry Day of musicOMH gave the album two and half out of five stars, commenting [...] "this is a massive collaborative project. That's probably the reason it's such a chaotic, unwieldy mess." [...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic." [...] Day concluded the review with [...] "Tempah has gone from rapping with a knowing wink or a <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eye to unloading a lewd spiel sans wit." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} hand {{from his pocket and}} the barrel of an {{automatic}} pistol <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> the light.|$|R
60|$|He leaned {{heavily on}} the bridge rails, with the pistol <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> his hand, and Austin endeavoured to answer him soothingly.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a little click‐clack that sounded horribly distinct, and as he swung round again a pistol <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> the tobacco merchant’s hand.|$|R
2500|$|Billington {{directed}} {{the growth of}} the Library of Congress' digital outreach and analog collections during the period 1992 through 2014 when the Library also experienced a 30 percent decrease in its staff largely due to legislative appropriations cutbacks. Every three years, the Librarian reviews the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In 2010, Billington's decision to open new DCMA loopholes resulted in his being described as [...] "the most important person you never heard of, having headed the library since well before the Web was spun or the DMCA was even a <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> the Recording Industry Association of America's eye [...] [...] [...] It was probably Billington's unassailable reputation for integrity and probity that won the LOC this power under the DMCA.|$|E
2500|$|Fischer makes several {{atmospheric}} {{observations about}} his opponent's habits and {{reaction to his}} moves. In the opening game he writes that [...] "Sherwin slid the rook with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move." [...] In another game he recalls that [...] "Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this point. Petrosian made a wry face which {{looked to me like}} 'Can Black do this and live?'." [...] "Poker-faced as always Keres made this move as though it was the most natural one on the board" [...] (Game 37). [...] "From the <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eye I could see that he had come prepared for my King's Indian" [...] (on the game against Botvinnik).|$|E
2500|$|Mel's exit storyline {{was linked}} to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit {{a few months after}} Steve's. She commented, [...] "Mel is devastated by Steve's death. She thinks that Phil caused it and rushes into the Vic and goes for him. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a {{necklace}} of black pearls on the day Steve dies and it breaks her heart. She knows Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He has been nothing but trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up." [...] In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell. After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as [...] "a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [...] one by one her friends desert her." [...] Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: [...] "When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is a <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> her eye as Mel looks at the destination board and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trevor Bailey, {{writing in}} the 1981 Wisden about cricketers' hairstyles, said that Sutcliffe's was [...] "black patent-leather <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> the sun, {{complete}} with the straightest of partings".|$|R
60|$|Morella listened, rocking {{himself to}} and fro upon the bed, then with an oath sprang towards her, to be met by a dagger-point <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Maccario looked round, {{and laughed}} softly {{as he saw}} the American {{standing}} grim in face {{with his back to}} the door and a pistol <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> his hand.|$|R
60|$|The Ambassador bowed once more, {{and there}} was a steely <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{waiting for}} him smiled with an exultant <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> her half-concealed eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{had made}} the {{resolution}} only that moment, but she saw the sudden <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{crackle of}} undergrowth, and a white-clad figure {{stepped out of}} the bush with {{something}} that caught the moonlight and <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> its hand. Nares moved forward, and in another moment or two stopped by Ormsgill's side.|$|R
60|$|Around all lay {{the great}} sea, like a {{transparent}} blue shield, {{on which the}} sun <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> myriad ripples of burnished gold. Everywhere God's work was glorious, but God's image in man was not there, for poor Zeppa looked upon it all with total indifference.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The wee wee stern that <b>glints</b> <b>in</b> heaven {{may be a}} lowin' sun, Though like a {{speck of}} light it seem amid the welkin dun; The humblest sodger on the field may win a warrior's crest: The birdie sure to sing is the gorbal of the nest.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a flicker}} of warmer colour under Seaforth's bronze, and a curious <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Leland stooped lower {{over her}} with the veins swollen on his {{forehead}} and a <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Tomlinson {{looked at}} him with a little <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes, and then laid his hand on Ingleby's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} {{say that he had}} not changed, for there was little in this tall, broad-shouldered man of the world, with grey <b>glints</b> <b>in</b> his hair, to suggest the slim, boyish young lover whose image she had carried in her heart all the long years.|$|R
50|$|The pair {{make their}} way slowly towards the rock, only to realise as they {{approach}} that the mass of white specks they have seen <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> the sun {{at the base of}} the rock are human bones, none of which have been there for more than ten years...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fool," [...] said Demetrius in {{a changed}} voice, [...] "remember quickly, or here is {{something}} that will----" [...] and he showed him a dagger <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> his hand. [...] "Now then, {{do you wish to}} go the same road as they carried the Jewish girl and the Eastern?" ...|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} {{perfectly}} steady, but, though {{the light was}} fading fast, Ida saw the <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes, and she answered conventionally.|$|E
60|$|Herrero {{who saw the}} <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes, {{backed away}} from him, and flashed a warning glance at Gavin, who turned to Ormsgill quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why can't you?" [...] demanded Bostil, {{straightening}} {{up with a}} <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his big eyes. It was {{the first}} time he had asked Slone that.|$|E
60|$|He came up beautifully, {{throwing}} the spray, <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> the sun, an angry fish with sail spread and his fins going. Then {{on the boat}} was the same old thrilling bustle and excitement and hilarity I knew so well and which always pleased me so much. This sailfish was a jumper.|$|R
60|$|Miss Barrington made no answer, but {{her face}} was very grave, and just then those nearest it drew back a little from the door. A trooper stood outside it, his carbine <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> the light, and another was silhouetted against the sky, sitting {{motionless}} in his saddle further back on the prairie.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not going}} away without the cattle, {{and you can see}} there are more of us now, while two proved too many for you before," [...] I said, still {{decreasing}} the distance between us; but my adversary perhaps divined my intention, for a short barrel <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> his hand when he raised it.|$|R
60|$|He arose {{and took}} the child's hand. The old woman sat staring at them in silence, but with an evil <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> her glistening eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "And also, I hope," [...] Dominey rejoined, smiling {{a little}} seriously {{and with a}} curious <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes, [...] "upon what I may yet accomplish." ...|$|E
60|$|Courthorne {{appeared}} {{to consider a}} moment, {{and there was a}} curious little <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> his eyes which did not escape his companion's attention, but he laughed.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this was}} frankly {{said in the}} {{presence}} of Alora Jones, the heiress, of whose person and fortune, her father, Jason Jones, was now sole guardian. It was not strange that the man seemed annoyed and ill at ease. His scowl grew darker and his eyes <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> an ugly way as he replied, after a brief pause: ...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the summit}} of the temple wall they saw two figures--a Ho-don warrior and beside him an almost naked {{creature}} of the race of Tarzan-jad-guru, across his shoulders and about his hips were strange broad belts studded with beautiful cylinders that <b>glinted</b> <b>in</b> the mid-day sun, and in his hands a shining thing of wood and metal from the end of which rose a thin wreath of blue-gray smoke.|$|R
60|$|Linda pouted, {{advancing}} her red lips, {{which were}} almost too red; {{but she had}} admirable eyes, brown, with a sparkle of gold in the irises, full of intelligence and meaning, and so clear that they seemed to throw a glow upon her thin, colourless face. There were bronze <b>glints</b> <b>in</b> the sombre clusters of her hair, and the eyelashes, long and coal black, made her complexion appear still more pale.|$|R
