He was elected as a Member of the British Parliament in 1970 but stood down at the February 1974 general election.

In March 1933 Freud told him that his contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish Character Analysis had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.|$|E

5|$|In early July the Mordecai gimmick {{was dropped}} and Fertig {{was sent back}} to OVW for more training. Fertig's return to OVW was also due to his <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bar fight, and {{subsequent}} impending lawsuits meant that WWE decided to take Fertig off television. Fertig returned to OVW, wrestling under a mask as Vengeance, and competed only sporadically against wrestlers including Elijah Burke, Mark Henry, Johnny Jeter, and Matt Cappotelli. He was then soon released in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Jones faced Republican Larry Hopkins, a seven-term congressman {{representing}} Kentucky's 6th congressional district. Hopkins {{was considered the}} Republicans' best hope of capturing the governorship since Louie B. Nunn in 1967. Instead, Hopkins' negative campaign ads, mistakes about his record, and <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> House scandal involving bounced checks all hurt his chances. Jones won the election {{by a vote of}} 540,468 to 294,542, the largest margin of victory in a Kentucky gubernatorial race.|$|E

There were 67,658 foreclosure actions {{in the first half}} of 2008. An editorial in The New York Times purported that Republicans may try to use foreclosure lists to block voters. Brunner warned all election boards that <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foreclosure is not, by itself, sufficient basis for challenging enfranchisement.|$|E

The provision empowers the Minister to make an order directing that a person be detained if the President is satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Rioch was {{dismissed}} by Arsenal. He {{was replaced by}} Arsène Wenger, who became the club's first manager born outside the British Isles. Wenger had creditable experience in UEFA club competitions; at Monaco he reached {{the final of the}} Cup Winners' Cup in 1992, losing 2–0 to Werder Bremen and took the club into the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1993–94. Wenger wanted Arsenal {{to become one of the}} biggest clubs in Europe, emphasising on buying talent from all over the world and patience shown by the club's board and supporters. His first <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> European match for Arsenal was against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 26 September 1996 in the UEFA Cup; Arsenal lost 6–4 on aggregate. Having watched the game from the stands in the first half, he assumed control in the second, suggesting the formation should accommodate four defenders instead of five.|$|E

5|$|In December 1408, Władysław and Vytautas held {{strategic}} {{talks in}} Navahrudak Castle, where {{they decided to}} foment a Samogitian uprising against Teutonic rule to draw German forces away from Pomerelia. Władysław promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty. The uprising, which began in May 1409, at first provoked little reaction from the Knights, {{who had not yet}} consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying Władysław's court at Oborniki, warning his nobles against Polish <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war between Lithuania and the Order. Władysław, however, bypassed his nobles and informed new Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia, Poland would intervene. This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on 6 August, which Władysław received on 14 August in Nowy Korczyn.|$|E
5|$|Mansur was {{dismissed}} in 1579 {{and replaced by}} his son Muhammad, who was imprisoned by the authorities in 1584 for alleged <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> looting raid against an Istanbul-bound caravan. He was restored to Keserwan in 1585 and was given tax collection authority over the rural districts of Tripoli Eyalet; this brought him into conflict with the Sayfa clan, the Assafs' erstwhile Turkmen clients, one of whose members, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa, was governor of Tripoli. The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in Akkar. Afterward, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa married Muhammad's widow and inherited the Assaf realm.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesia-Malaysia {{confrontation}} {{was fought}} from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over {{the creation of}} the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian seaborne and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and airforce units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help mop up infiltrators from seaborne and airborne incursions at Labis and Pontian, in September and October 1964.|$|E

5|$|The Marshalsea {{became the}} main holding prison for Roman Catholics {{suspected}} of sedition during the Elizabethan era. Bishop Bonner, the last Roman Catholic Bishop of London, was imprisoned there in 1559, supposedly {{for his own}} safety, until his death 10years later. William Herle, a spy for Lord Burghley, Elizabeth I's chief adviser, was held there in 1570 and 1571. According to Robyn Adams, the prison leaked both physically and metaphorically. In correspondence about Marshalsea prisoners Herle suspected of <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plot to kill the Queen, he wrote of a network within the prison for smuggling information out of it, which included hiding letters in holes in the crumbling brickwork for others to pick up.|$|E
