5|$|Smythe Park and Recreation Centre in Toronto {{is located}} on the site of his old <b>gravel</b> <b>pit.</b> The {{surrounding}} neighbourhood is named Rockcliffe-Smythe, partly a sub-division Smythe built for war veterans. Smythe made provisions for a portion of the lands of the sub-division to be reserved for the centre. A street north of Eglinton Avenue, west of Markham Avenue, is named Conn Smythe Drive in his honour.|$|E
5|$|After the closure, the {{non-profit}} organization Friends of the Numedal Line was established and offered occasional heritage rides along the line. It maintains the tracks between Rollag and Rødberg and offers draisine rental between Veggli and Rødberg. Irregular transport from the <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> at Svene and the sawmill Numedal Bruk at Flesberg. The latter is operated by Tågåkeriet i Bergslagen and hauls lumber from Uddevalla, Sweden.

5|$|Managed by the German SS and Trawnikis (also {{known as}} Hiwi guards – the {{auxiliary}} police enlisted from Soviet POW camps {{to assist the}} Germans), the camp consisted of two separate units. Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp (Arbeitslager) whose prisoners worked in the <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> or irrigation area and in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the crematoria. Between 1941 and 1944, {{more than half of}} its 20,000 inmates died from summary executions, hunger, disease and mistreatment.|$|E

40|$|LANDSAT {{data from}} July 1973 and June 1978 for the Patuxent River Watershed of Maryland were {{processed}} {{in an effort}} to devise an economical method of monitoring the reclamation of sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>pits.</b> ASTEP-II and IDIMS software were utilized to derive signatures for sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> and other land use/land cover types. Both unsupervised and supervised classifications of the two data sets were produced. Resultant statistics and color output products were compared {{in order to determine the}} extent of reclamation and expansion of sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> over the five-year time span and to check the locations of more recent sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>pits.</b> Preliminary results indicate that, for a selected northern sub-acre, signatures derived for sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> were nearly 90 percent accurate...|$|R

5|$|Smythe {{continued}} to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, {{when he made}} plans {{to fight in the}} Second World War. He did not re-enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a <b>gravel</b> <b>pit.</b> At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} sports and {{recreational}} grounds {{located on the}} river course or <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> and artificial lakes adjacent to the Sava. Tacen Whitewater Course, located on the right bank of the Sava in Tacen suburb of Ljubljana, was built as a permanent kayaking course in 1948. It hosts a major international competition almost every year, examples being the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in 1955, 1991, and 2010. In Zagreb, Jarun complex of lakes along the river course offers a range of facilities for swimming, water sports and cycling. The island of Ada Ciganlija in Belgrade is the major recreational zone of the city, gathering as much as 100,000 visitors daily in summer months.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gravel</b> <b>pits</b> {{near the}} Mohelnice city, Czech Republic, are {{situated}} in an aquifer {{that is important}} for ground water supply. The impact of <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> on ground water levels was assessed using numerical computer modeling and different stages of mining were simulated. The maximum rise of the ground water table has reached + 1 m, while the decline is- 3 m, compared to original levels. The <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> become drainage bases of the aquifer {{as the result of}} both mining activity and artificial changes in the Morava River channel. As a result of ground water flow into the open <b>gravel</b> <b>pits,</b> there is precipitation of calcite, pyrolusite and amorphous Fe(OH) 3, as well as an increase of pH values...|$|R

5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were routed through the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern crested newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian crested newt) rice paddies. The Danube crested newt is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the smooth, the palmate, the Carpathian, and the alpine newt.|$|E
5|$|Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto {{to be close to}} Smythe's sand and gravel business, which operated a <b>gravel</b> <b>pit</b> north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair. (Smythe Park exists on the site today). In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor; a specialist in rheumatology, and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971. Stafford's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn's death.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, a small {{spur line}} {{built by the}} Canadian Northern Railway {{branched}} off the Oak Point Subdivision at Grosse Isle heading north. This first year, the railway reached a <b>gravel</b> <b>pit,</b> possibly to supply future or existing railbeds. The next year, this new local line reached through the Argyle and Brant Districts, ending at Woodroyd, Manitoba. Eventually, the line was built to Hodgson, following a zig-zag formation to pass nearest the existing settlements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The loss {{of natural}} {{wetlands}} throughout the World has made created habitats such as <b>gravel</b> <b>pits,</b> reservoirs or rice fields potentially important for waterbird conservation. In southwest France, the increasing abundance of <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> has allowed several bird species to colonize the region. The avian community was studied from 1996 to 1998 in six <b>gravel</b> <b>pits</b> in the Garonne floodplain. A total of 39 species of waterbirds were recorded, with higher abundance {{during the winter}} and post-breeding periods. We analyzed habitat use to identify key environmental factors determining the temporal and spatial distribution of the avian community. The presence of submerged macrophytes {{was found to be}} the most important factor influencing the distribution of waterbirds. The presence of paths in the vicinity of the areas reduced both the total number of birds and species richness owing to human disturbance. <b>Gravel</b> <b>pits</b> have an increasingly important role in the conservation of bird biodiversity. By controlling dis-turbance and management of vegetation, managers can enhance this role...|$|R
