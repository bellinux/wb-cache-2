500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E
