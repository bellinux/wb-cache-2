5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks <b>into</b> <b>wedges.</b> These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
60|$|For {{a second}} or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: {{impressed}} {{with the belief that}} the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut <b>into</b> <b>wedges,</b> the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.|$|E

50|$|Cleveland Golf has a proud {{heritage}} {{of being at}} the cutting edge of innovation. The company was the first to market wedges with multiple bounce options on the sole and individually mill grooves <b>into</b> <b>wedge</b> faces. Cleveland was the first major manufacturer to produce a 460cc driver - the Launcher 460, in 2003 - and a geometrically shaped driver - the HiBore, in 2006.|$|R

50|$|Throdkin is a {{traditional}} breakfast food of the Fylde, Lancashire, England. It consists of a dough of oatmeal and water pressed into a pie plate, topped with pieces of fat bacon, and baked. It was cut <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> tart-style for serving.|$|E
5000|$|Cleaving is done {{by driving}} a wedge between the fibres of a log, so as to split fibres apart along their weakest path. This work may appear strenuous, but is far less effort than rip sawing by hand. It is first done radially, to split the log <b>into</b> <b>wedged</b> segments. Timbers with {{medullary}} rays, such as oak, {{may be hard to}} split through these radial rays and so careful alignment is made to split between them. Segments are halved symmetrically at each step, as this encourages them to split more evenly than attempting to cleave off thin sheets repeatedly from one end.|$|R

50|$|Tortilla chips — {{made from}} maize tortillas cut <b>into</b> <b>wedges,</b> then fried — first gained {{popularity}} in the 1940s in Los Angeles, California and were mass-produced there. Often mistaken as Mexican food, {{they are in fact}} Southwestern food. The ingredients in maize tortillas are maize, lime, and water. Fried chips add salt and vegetable oil.|$|E
50|$|Grampy is an {{eccentric}} inventor, whose labor-saving devices {{are of the}} Rube Goldberg variety.

40|$|Wedge shaped defects of the {{retinal nerve}} fiber layer (RNFL) may occur in glaucoma. Currently, {{automatic}} detection of wedge shaped defects in Scanning Laser Polarimetry (SLP) {{images of the}} RNFL is not available. An automatic classification is currently based only on global parameters, thereby ignoring important local information. Our method works by a modified dynamic programming technique that searches for locally strong edges with a preference for straight edges. These edges are initially classified based on their strength and next combined <b>into</b> <b>wedge</b> shaped defects. Our method yields a sensitivity of 73 % and a specificity of 90 % on a limited set of 65 image...|$|R

50|$|Potatonik may {{refer to}} two {{distinct}} potato-based dishes derived from Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. One version is a hybrid between potato kugel and bread, containing shredded potatoes and onions {{as well as}} ample flour and leavened with yeast. Another dish, apparently unrelated but called by the same name, is essentially a very large latke meant to be cut <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> at the table. Also known as Geribinik.|$|E
5000|$|A dish titled [...] "Brummie bacon cakes" [...] {{is said to}} also be a dish local to Birmingham it {{consists}} of a mixture of flour, salt, and butter or margarine, with chopped bacon and cheese added to it.

50|$|It can be {{seen that}} the length of each wedge is the product of the {{diameter}} of the circle and cos(θ). It can also be seen that the maximum rate of photon emission per unit solid angle is along the normal and diminishes to zero for θ = 90°. In mathematical terms, the radiance along the normal is I photons/(s·cm2·sr) and the number of photons per second emitted <b>into</b> the vertical <b>wedge</b> is I dΩ dA. The number of photons per second emitted <b>into</b> the <b>wedge</b> at angle θ is I cos(θ) dΩ dA.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{cheese and}} ham are {{sandwiched}} between two flour tortillas, then cut <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> to serve what is {{commonly known as}} sincronizada (Spanish for [...] "synchronized") in Mexico. Despite appearing almost the same as a quesadilla, it is considered a completely different dish. The sincronizada is frequently confused with the quesadilla by tourists because it is typically called a quesadilla in most Mexican restaurants outside of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{ingredients}} in macaroni pie include macaroni noodles, cheese, milk, butter, flour, salt, pepper and various spices. Additional ingredients sometimes used include onion and bread crumbs. Other ingredients {{may also be}} used. It can be prepared as a low-fat dish using reduced fat cheese and skim milk. Some versions, {{such as those in}} Scotland, are prepared using a pie crust, while others are not. It may be served sliced <b>into</b> <b>wedges.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of the topping {{ingredients}} can {{first be}} dried in an oven {{to reduce their}} moisture, which prevents the pizza from being soggy when finished. Baking it on a pizza stone can also prevent sogginess. It may be finished with olive oil drizzled atop the pizza. The pizza can be sliced <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> or by its four sections. Pizza quattro stagioni can be prepared as a vegetarian dish.|$|E

5000|$|If global {{emissions}} of [...] are graphed {{for the next}} 50 years, {{the difference between the}} business as usual scenario and the flat path forms a triangle. This triangle is known as the stabilization triangle. Pacala and Socolow divided this hypothetical triangle <b>into</b> seven stabilization <b>wedges,</b> which represent different measures that must be taken to reduce emissions. When speaking of different strategies to reduce emissions, the language [...] "to reduce one wedge's worth," [...] is often employed, and by reducing the stabilization wedge of fourteen gigatons of [...] <b>into</b> seven <b>wedges,</b> the task is much easier to conceptualize.|$|R
