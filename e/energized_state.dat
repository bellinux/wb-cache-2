50|$|As {{in other}} Neolithic communities, life at Banpo was {{synchronized}} to the agricultural year, which was timed by {{the movement of}} the Big Dipper, which functioned as a celestial clock. The Classic of Poetry describes this annual cycle. Beginning in spring, adolescents swam through the flood waters at the triangular confluence of two rivers. They emerged shivering, and in this state they were infused with the souls of ancestors buried in the earth who had reemerged at the springs of the Yellow River. In this <b>energized</b> <b>state</b> they procreated in a location deemed to possess magical earth energy. These locations were unsuitable for agriculture, usually a hill, and therefore were uncleared primeval forests. Consecrated procreation was essential to maintaining the cycle of life. When the flood waters receded, the triangle was divided into fields between the families. In autumn there was a large festival at the completion of the harvest. In winter, the men left their homes and retired to the Great Hall, where they were led by the village elders in drinking and singing to repel the cold.|$|E

Amongst the factors implicated in these changes is a progressive replacement fibrosis secondary to cardiomyoctye death, oxidative damage, and energetic deficit, each of which may be secondary to impaired mitochondrial function. Here, we performed an in-depth examination of mitochondrial function in saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocyte bundles, a preparation where all mitochondria are represented and their structure intact, from young adult (YA) and senescent (SEN) rats (n = 8 per group). When accounting for increased fibrosis (+ 19 %, P< 0. 01) and proportional decrease in citrate synthase activity in the SEN myocardium (− 23 %, P< 0. 05), mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (H 2 O 2) emission across a range of <b>energized</b> <b>states</b> was similar between age groups. Accordingly, the abundance of electron transport chain proteins was also unchanged. Likewise, except for CuZnSOD (− 37 %, P< 0. 05), the activity of antioxidant enzymes was unaltered with aging. Although time to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening was decreased (− 25 %, P< 0. 05) in the SEN heart, suggesting sensitization to apoptotic stimuli, this was not associated with a difference in apoptotic index measured by ELISA.

40|$|The {{influence}} of mitochondrial inhibitors, including oligomycin, antimycin and rotenone, on the iodide and oxygen uptake and the nucleotide content of incubated sheep thyroid slices was investigated.

Inhibitor concentrations sufficient to inhibit iodide uptake strongly had only slight effects on the thyroidal Na++K+-activated adenosine triphosphatase.

ATP synthesis appears to be essential for iodide uptake to occur, and the high-energy intermediates (or <b>energized</b> <b>state)</b> of oxidative phosphorylation cannot be used to energize the uptake process.

40|$|AbstractCapacitative {{regulation}} of calcium entry {{is a major}} mechanism of Ca 2 + influx into electrically non-excitable cells, but it also operates in some excitable ones. It participates in the refilling of intracellular calcium stores and in the generation of Ca 2 + signals in excited cells. The mechanism which couples depletion of intracellular calcium stores located in the endoplasmic reticulum with opening of store-operated calcium channels in the plasma membrane is not clearly understood. Mitochondria located {{in close proximity to}} Ca 2 + channels are exposed to high Ca 2 + concentration, and therefore, they are able to accumulate this cation effectively. This decreases local Ca 2 + concentration and thereby affects calcium-dependent processes, such as depletion and refilling of the intracellular calcium stores and opening of the store-operated channels. Finally, mitochondria modulate the intensity and the duration of calcium signals induced by extracellular stimuli. Ca 2 + uptake by mitochondria requires these organelles to be in the <b>energized</b> <b>state.</b> On the other hand, Ca 2 + flux into mitochondria stimulates energy metabolism.

Similarly, the detergent-induced loss of accumulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of potassium from Escherichia coli is also strongly affected by the energy state of the cells. The differential susceptibility of energized and nonenergized cells was observed at all detergent concentrations tested. Measurements of substrate efflux at different concentrations of Triton indicated that only Triton monomers are responsible for the increase in permeability. The absorption of [14 C]Triton X- 100 by Chlorella and the binding of detergent to the cells were measured in the presence of metabolic inhibitors.

40|$|Functional {{studies on}} {{isolated}} mitochondria critically {{rely on the}} right choice of respiration buffer. Differences in buffer composition can lead to dramatically different respiration rates leading to difficulties in comparing prior studies. The ideal buffer facilities high ADP-stimulated respiratory rates and minimizes substrate transport effects so {{that the ability to}} distinguish between various treatments and conditions is maximal. In this study, we analyzed a variety of respiration buffers and substrate combinations to determine the optimal conditions to support mitochondrial function through ADP-stimulated respiration and uncoupled respiration using FCCP. The buffers consisted of a standard KCl based buffer (B 1) and three modified buffers with chloride replaced by the K-lactobionate, sucrose, and the antioxidant taurine (B 2) or K-gluconate (B 3). The fourth buffer (B 4) was identical to B 2 except that K-lactobionate was replaced with K-gluconate. The substrate combinations consisted of metabolites that utilize different pathways of mitochondrial metabolism. To test mitochondrial function, we used isolated cardiac guinea pig mitochondria and measured oxygen consumption for three respiratory states using an Oroboros Oxygraph- 2 k. These states were the leak <b>state</b> (<b>energized</b> mitochondria in the absence of adenylates), ADP-stimulated <b>state</b> (<b>energized</b> mitochondria in the presence of saturating ADP concentrations), and uncoupled <b>state</b> (<b>energized</b> mitochondria in the presence of FCCP). On average across all substrate combinations, buffers B 2, B 3, and B 4 had an increase of 16 %, 26 %, and 35 % for the leak state, ADP-simulated state, and uncoupled state, respectively, relative to rates using B 1. The common feature distinguishing these buffers from B 1 is the notable lack of high chloride concentrations. Based on the respiratory rate metrics obtained with the substrate combinations, we conclude that the adenine nucleotide translocase, the dicarboxylate carrier, and the alpha-ketoglutarate exchanger are partially inhibited by chloride. Therefore, when the goal is to maximize ADP-stimulated respiration, buffers containing K-lactobionate or K-gluconate are superior choices compared to the standard KCl-based buffers...|$|R
