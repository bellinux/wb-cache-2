The Scottish historian Alexander Tytler, in his Essay on the Principles of Translation (1790), emphasized that assiduous reading is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including listening to the spoken language, had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and grammarian Onufry Andrzej Kopczyński.|$|E

25|$|David Ervine was the {{youngest}} of five children born to Walter and Elizabeth Ervine, and raised in a Protestant working-class area of east Belfast between the Albertbridge and Newtownards roads. His household was not loyalist at all, his father Walter described himself as a socialist, had no time for Ian Paisley and didn't attend church. When Ervine joined the Orange Order aged 18, he said he was the first member of his family to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> member. His membership however didn't last long. Like many in his situation, he grew up closely identifying with his community and absorbed the Ulster Unionism ideals and opinions that go along with this identity. He left Orangefield High School at 14, and at the age of 19 Ervine joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), believing this to {{be the only way to}} ensure the defence of the Protestant community after the events of Bloody Friday. A neighbour of Ervine's who was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) William Irvine, had died in one of the bomb blasts on Bloody Friday.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} Lorain, Ohio {{and working in}} a factory, Barr first learned how to fly {{aircraft}} in 1946 {{as part of a}} Piper club. She had dropped out of Oberlin College the year before in order to find a job to pay for flying lessons. After completing her training, she obtained a job training others to be commercial pilots. During the end years of World War II, she decided to help build aircraft for the war, which led to her moving to New York City and joining a aircraft mechanic school. This also involved acting alongside members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots to assist in transporting war goods and planes across the US. The end of the war resulted in the Barrs moving to Susanville, California in 1949, and setting about running and improving the Susanville airport. After obtaining her certification in 1957, she obtained the position of FAA Pilot Examiner for Lassen County. In 1964, Barr {{became one of the first}} four women to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of the Reno Air Races. She placed second in the Reno National Championships in the Stock Plane Class using a Piper Cherokee.|$|E

500|$|Pathways {{sold more}} copies than expected, making it Bungie's first {{commercial}} success. It {{was the third}} bestselling Macintosh title {{of the first half}} of 1994 after Myst and Sim City 2000, with projected seven-figure sales for the year. The game made Bungie enough money that the company was able to move from Seropian's apartment to a dedicated office in Chicago's South Side. At their new location, the Bungie team expanded and began work on another first-person shooter, Marathon. Interviewed by Inside Mac Games, Jones said that he did not believe that there would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sequel to Pathways. [...] "There's a lot of reasons for that, one of them being that I tend to dislike sequels," [...] he said, [...] "A lot of cool things have happened with the rendering technology since Pathways shipped, and it suggests some different products which don't really fit into the Pathways world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} to [...] "Trinity War" [...] received an 8 out of 10 from Richard Gray of Newsarama. He said, [...] "It {{was clear from}} the start of “Trinity War” that this would only <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bridge between one phase and the next. By the final page of Justice League #23, that bridge is not so much burned as left a bit smokey from the waves of revelations that come to light in the issue’s final pages. It’s a fitting conclusion, but one that will require additional reading when the dust has settled." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources was critical of the final issue, giving it 3.5 stars out of 5. He felt that while [...] "Justice League #23 is a loud, clanging final chapter to the crossover between Justice League books", there [...] "was way too much is left hanging out to be completed elsewhere." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN was highly critical of Justice League #23, giving it a 6.0 out of 10. Schedeen felt that the Trinity of Sin [...] "are practically non-entities in the story" [...] at the end, after being teased as the center of the event back in 2012. He also felt the splash pages were overused and did not like lack of conclusion. Finally, he felt it was [...] "refreshing to see that Johns has been executing a long-term plan for the past two years" [...] and [...] "the highlight of this issue, and probably the crossover as a whole, is the reveal of the Justice League traitor." [...] Ivan Reis' art was a standout in the issue, and praised by all.|$|E
500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses {{numerous}} threats {{to people and}} the environment and point to studies in the literature that question if it will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sustainable energy source. These threats include health risks, accidents and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport. [...] Along with the fears associated with nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear power opponents fear sabotage by terrorists of nuclear plants, diversion and misuse of radioactive fuels or fuel waste, as well as naturally-occurring leakage from the unsolved and imperfect long-term storage process of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They further argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.|$|E
