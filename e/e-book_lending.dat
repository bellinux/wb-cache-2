50|$|<b>E-book</b> <b>lending</b> is a {{practice}} in which access to already-purchased downloads or online reads of e-books is made {{available on a}} time-limited basis to others. It works around the digital rights management built into online-store-published e-books by limiting access to a purchased e-book file to the borrower, resulting in loss {{of access to the}} file by the purchaser {{for the duration of the}} borrowing period.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the Tallinn Central Library created ELLU, a <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> {{program for}} works of modern Estonian literature. Tallinn Central Library {{is the only}} library in Estonia that {{provided}} copies of modern Estonian literature via e-book, {{and access to the}} ELLU system is available to anyone in the world, with registered users being reported from countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. In 2017 the library expanded their e-book offerings to allow English and Russian speaking patrons to access e-books.|$|E
50|$|<b>E-book</b> <b>lending</b> {{has become}} an {{increasing}} practice in the early 2010s for public libraries as well as independent <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> communities; the latter is increasingly viable, especially for books which are not available in the Amazon Kindle's Kindle Format, Mobipocket or Barnes & Noble Nook formats. Websites such as Lendle.me and BookLending.com have emerged to facilitate lending and borrowing of books between strangers. In a survey of interlibrary loan librarians {{it was found that}} 92% of libraries held ebooks in their collections and that 27% of those libraries had negotiated interlibrary loan rights for some of their ebooks. This survey found significant barriers to conducting interlibrary loan for ebooks. Demand-driven acquisition (DDA) {{has been around for a}} few years in public libraries, which allows vendors to streamline the acquisition process by offering to match a library's selection profile to the vendor's e-book titles. The library's catalog is then populated with records for all the e-books that match the profile. The decision to purchase the title is left to the patrons, although the library can set purchasing conditions such as a maximum price and purchasing caps so that the dedicated funds are spent according to the library's budget.The 2012 meeting of the Association of American University Presses included a panel on Patron-driven acquisition (PDA) of books produced by university presses based on a preliminary report by Joseph Esposito, a digital publishing consultant who has studied the implications of PDA with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} trends currently impact libraries. Academic libraries face the fundamental shift of collections toward ever increasing proportions of electronic content; public libraries continue to see vigorous interest in print materials, now supplemented by demand to provide <b>e-books</b> for <b>lending.</b> Breeding will explore these and other trends and describe some of the technologies available and emerging to help libraries meet the challenges involved in this context...|$|R
50|$|E-books {{have the}} same issue. Because the first sale {{doctrine}} {{does not apply to}} electronic books, libraries cannot freely <b>lend</b> <b>e-books</b> indefinitely after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text. This results in e-book publishers placing restrictions on the number of times an e-book can circulate and/or the amount of time a book is within a collection before a library’s license expires, then the book no longer belongs to them.|$|R
40|$|Most library studies thematically {{related to}} {{electronic}} books don't consider readers of electronic books. Only {{in recent years}} librarians conduct studies in which they {{want to find out}} readers' opinions about the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages of reading using e-readers, as well as their possible application in the libraries. User studies of e-readers have shown that their opinion is generally positive, but great attachment to traditional books is still present, e-readers are still seen only as an additional tool for reading. Sony with its e-reader (the latest Reader model Daily) and Reader Store online bookstore ([URL] the only one who cooperate with libraries and has made lending electronic books possible. Cooperation was launched in 2009 th,and the New York Public Library was the first library that offered such a service. Cooperation between Sony and libraries, indicates clearly what the near future could be if other online booksellers / publishers begin to follow the model of <b>lending</b> <b>e-books</b> through the libraries over the network. However it is possible that a large online bookstores / publishers consider that the further price reduction of e-readers and electronic books will constantly increase their sales, and in that case <b>lending</b> <b>e-books</b> will be unnecessary. Are the libraries ready for this scenario...|$|R

5000|$|US Libraries began {{providing}} free e-books to {{the public}} in 1998 through their websites and associated services, although the e-books were primarily scholarly, technical or professional in nature, and could not be downloaded. In 2003, libraries began offering free downloadable popular fiction and non-fiction e-books {{to the public}}, launching an <b>E-book</b> <b>lending</b> model that worked much more successfully for public libraries. The number of library e-book distributors and lending models continued to increase over the next few years. From 2005 to 2008 libraries experienced 60% growth in e-book collections. In 2010, a Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study found that 66% of public libraries in the US were offering e-books, and a large movement in the library industry began seriously examining the issues related to lending e-books, acknowledging a [...] of broad e-book usage.|$|E

The Brise network was created in 1988 and aimed at gathering all the holdings from close to 40 public and college libraries of Saint-Étienne in two online catalogs. The public libraries of Saint-Étienne also have implemented a shuttle system in 2011, thanks to which a user who has borrowed documents can return them in any of the libraries, including the bookmobiles.The central library of Tarentaize provides a service dedicated to teaching users about multimedia technology, for example how to use the Internet or word processors.Since January 2016, the library has launched an <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> service. Its e-book catalog currently holds 167 digital books.The library also grants access to 1D Touch, which is a streaming platform which offers independent cultural content. By this means, library users can listen to about 1 million music tracks.|$|E
40|$|As e-books {{settle into}} the {{academic}} market, {{the relationship between}} publishers, vendors, and libraries grows more complex. This article highlights how licenses, which govern this business affair, are no exception. From aggregators to individual publishers, from large STM companies to small societies, e-book enterprises must acknowledge library values {{in order to remain}} economically viable. For the benefit of all parties involved, new and better ways of balancing the profit-driven goal of selling e-books and the educational benefit of <b>lending</b> <b>e-books</b> need to be negotiated.

40|$|Public Lending Right (PLR) and Educational Lending Right (ELR) schemes are remunerating Australian {{authors and}} {{publishers}} for making available their books in Australian libraries. However, e-books are currently not included under these schemes. With {{the expansion of}} the e-book market and e-lending services within Australian libraries, {{it has been suggested that}} the schemes should be technologically neutral and extend to include e-books. After an extensive analysis of the technological neutrality principle, this article concludes this principle does not impose a legal obligation to extend PLR and ELR to <b>e-books</b> since traditional <b>lending</b> and e-lending are not functionally and economically equivalent services. Nevertheless, such an extension could be favourable when taking into account other economic, cultural and political circumstances...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master’s thesis is to {{identify}} the potential and the limitations of <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> in Swedish public libraries through {{a case study of}} Sollentuna Library. The theoretical framework is made up of concepts derived from the work of both Rogers and Winston concerning the diffusion of innovations. The main obstacles and supportive factors for <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> in a public library were identified. The study reveals that contracts with e-book distributors are costly for libraries. First-time users find use of the service complicated and the library experience a loss of control over their e-book stocks through the current licensing system. Factors supporting <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> include the library’s decision to include the distributors’ entire e-book supply. This led to a significantly increased number of e-book loans. Ongoing work with the development of e-book help services such as workshops and individual assistance supports use of the service. Furthermore, e-book reading is actively encouraged through the library web service. In conclusion, the complexity of the e-book as a separate technical phenomenon requires public libraries to find new methods of working that suit the e-book's potential as a technological innovation. <b>E-book</b> <b>lending</b> has become a compromise between the interests of the library users and the commercial interests of the publishers...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the topic of electronic lending of fictional documents in public libraries. The work {{is based on the}} marketing view of the public library on <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> issues and is divided into two parts. In the first part, after defining the term of e-book loan, follows a detailed course of action for the implementation and realization of service in a particular institution of the Municipal Library of Úvaly. The second part of the thesis evaluates the use of the <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> service after two years of operation, based on e-borrowing statistics and a quantitative questionnaire survey addressed to registered library readers. Based on the results of the research, recommendations have been formulated to improve the functioning of the <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> service. The procedure for commissioning the service and the actual operation of the service in a particular time period has also been evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The Amazon Kindle is revolutionizing {{the way we}} buy {{and read}} books. But {{according}} to Amazon, Kindle books are not sold at all. Rather, they are licensed under surprisingly aggressive terms. This may surprise Kindle users. Amazon 2 ̆ 7 s promotional materials paint a very different picture of Kindle e-book transactions than its Terms of Service, which are buried online and purport to bind users automatically by a 2 ̆ 2 browsewrap 2 ̆ 2 agreement-meaning users are bound by its terms simply by visiting Amazon 2 ̆ 7 s Web site. It {{is not clear whether}} courts will uphold Amazon 2 ̆ 7 s characterization of Kindle e-book transactions as mere licenses, or instead reclassify them as sales. If the transaction is deemed a sale, Kindle e-books would trigger the protection of the copyright 2 ̆ 7 first sale 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, allowing <b>e-book</b> owners to <b>lend,</b> trade, and resell them. This Article surveys the legal landscape surrounding digital content transactions, including copyright law, case law, and the Uniform Commercial Code, and argues that Kindle e-book transactions should be characterized as sales. This Article also presents possible ways to make sales of e-books viable, using Digital Rights Management to enforce single-copy ownership. Books are important and lasting cultural contributions, a fundamental vehicle of free thought. While licensing may make sense for software or other short-lived digital content, courts should protect our ownership interest in books-which brings with it the right to share, sell, and pass on-whether digitally displayed or otherwise...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the question of whether}} the public lending right (PLR) as harmonized under the EU Rental and Lending Directive 2006 / 115 /EC should equally apply to both print books and e-books. This question has been answered in the affirmative by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the recent VOB case. The article argues that extending the PLR exception to <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> might not be the most appropriate solution. It would neither solve the problems that libraries face in relation to e-lending, nor would it ensure appropriate remuneration to authors. At this stage, other possible alternatives should be explored...|$|E
40|$|The {{library is}} a selling point and {{visibility}} {{among the different}} business models of the eBook. These data are observed in the various studies conducted in the United States, marketing obligatory reference e-book and use worldwide (Pew Research, Library Journal, etc.). In Spain {{the integration of the}} e-book in the library is in its initial process, becoming the first platforms in use. The study analyzed the sources for the acquisition of library eBooks: publishers, aggregators and platforms, {{the pros and cons of}} each and other providers. It also discusses the business models: subscriptions Packages, Shopping in perpetuity, Pay per use, Patron -driven acquisition (PDA) and finally shows the main suppliers and their policies regarding the sale for <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> libraries. In conclusion, to say that the challenge of the library is to acquire a sufficiently attractive and updated collection of electronic documents, but the major controversies in this regard still revolve around restrictive policies imposed by publishers on the circulation of the same for its lending libraries. Publishers fear that e-books that are available in a public library at no additional cost for customers will compete directly with e-books sold through retailers. In this situation, perhaps professional associations, consortia and publishers to work on a common project and establish an electronic marketplace for selling ebooks licenses directly to libraries...|$|E
40|$|Research problem: Libraries face many {{challenges}} as they strive to provide e-books to their members, often caused by less-than-ideal licensing conditions, or publishers {{who will not}} yet license their titles to libraries for lending. This research project, developed {{in conjunction with a}} National Library of New Zealand initiative investigating collaborative ebook procurement for libraries, surveyed New Zealand public libraries in order to discover what elements of existing and proposed models would best meet the needs of their users. Methodology: a link to an online survey was emailed to public library managers, who were asked to complete the survey or delegate it to an appropriate staff member. Results: Valid responses were received from 34 of the 67 library systems contacted (response rate = 50. 8). New Zealand public libraries are anticipating a large increase in spending on the provision of e-books, with the growth in spending on e-books set to outstrip growth in spending on other e-resources. They show a strong preference for perpetual access licenses, and generally tend to favour licenses that allow for control over title selection and predictability over budgets. They are concerned with system integration and would ideally like to see e-books from all their chosen vendors available through one interface that integrates with their catalogues. Libraries {{would like to see more}} New Zealand content available, and access to library <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> on all devices their users may choose to use...|$|E
40|$|We often {{regulate}} actors as a {{proxy for}} protecting categories of information. Rather than directly protect reading records, for example, we target actors like libraries who are likely to possess them. This approach has proven increasingly untenable in the digital age, where the relevant actors are difficult to identify and constantly shifting. Unanticipated third parties now insert themselves as intermediaries or eavesdroppers in all manner of transactions, even in protected spaces like libraries. Where this happens, actor-defined regimes fail to vindicate their privacy commitments even within the institutions for which they were designed. Libraries provide a clear example of this problem. Private reading historically has been protected through a regime that restricts libraries’ ability to exploit reading records. Yet this regime now fails to protect reading records even in libraries because it does not bind third parties who provide library services digitally. Illustrating the point, Amazon facilitates <b>e-book</b> <b>lending</b> for a number of public and academic libraries. Although Amazon collects detailed reading records from patrons utilizing these services, the library confidentiality regime does not restrict what it can do with the records. These patrons accordingly confront the risks to intellectual privacy the library regime was meant to counter. This Article proposes a content-defined approach whereby confidentiality obligations would attach to particular types of information regardless of which actors possessed it. Such an approach would not only save extant confidentiality regimes from obsolescence, but also provide a vehicle for extending privacy commitments to future data practices that implicated the same types of sensitive records...|$|E
