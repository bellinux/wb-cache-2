25|$|JPEG File <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> is {{a minimal}} file format which enables JPEG bitstreams to be {{exchanged}} between {{a wide variety}} of platforms and applications.

Nor should it, for the only purpose of this simplified format is to allow the exchange of JPEG compressed images.|$|E
25|$|The {{motivation}} {{for creating the}} PNG format was in early 1995, after it became known that the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) data compression algorithm used in the Graphics <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (GIF) format was patented by Unisys. There were also other problems with the GIF format that made a replacement desirable, notably its limit of 256 colors {{at a time when}} computers able to display far more than 256 colors were becoming common.|$|E

25|$|Several {{additional}} {{standards have}} evolved to address these issues. The first of these, released in 1992, was JPEG File <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (or JFIF), followed {{in recent years by}} Exchangeable image file format (Exif) and ICC color profiles. Both of these formats use the actual JIF byte layout, consisting of different markers, but in addition employ one of the JIF standard's extension points, namely the application markers: JFIF uses APP0, while Exif uses APP1. Within these segments of the file, that were left for future use in the JIF standard and aren't read by it, these standards add specific metadata.|$|E

ISO/IEC 19794-5 defines specifically a standard scheme for codifying data describing human faces within a CBEFF-compliant data structure, for use in facial recognition systems.

Many organizations and have already started enforcing its directives, and several software applications have been created to automatically test compliance to the specifications.|$|R
50|$|Three new decimal formats are described, {{matching}} the lengths of the 32-128-bit binary formats. These give decimal <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> with 7, 16, and 34-digit significands, {{which may be}} normalized or unnormalized. For maximum range and precision, the formats merge part of the exponent and significand into a combination field, and compress {{the remainder of the}} significand using either a decimal integer encoding (which uses Densely Packed Decimal, or DPD, a compressed form of BCD) encoding or conventional binary integer encoding. The basic formats are the two larger sizes, which have 64-bit and 128-bit encodings. Generalized formulae for some other <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> are also specified.|$|R
