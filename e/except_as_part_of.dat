Thus, when we are trying to show that there must be objects independent of our own sense-data, we cannot appeal to the testimony of other people, since this testimony itself consists of sense-data, and does not reveal other people's experiences unless our own sense-data are signs of things existing independently of us. We must therefore, if possible, find, in our own purely private experiences, characteristics which show, or tend to show, that there are in the world things other than ourselves and our private experiences.|$|E

The percep-tions of four key Egyptian stakeholder groups – industry, university, government and non-governmental organisations – were identified via in-depth semi-structured one-to-one interviews. The research gap between Egyptian universities and the hospitality and tourism industry is wider than suggested in the litera-ture on university–industry collaboration. There was consensus of the absence of a research culture in faculties of tourism and hotels where social science research was perceived as having little/no value <b>except</b> <b>as</b> a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> academic degrees or for promotional purposes, rather than for knowledge creation or to inform industry’s practices. Egyptian faculties of tourism and hotels had not undergone the first academic revolution experienced in the US and Europe in the late 19 th century. There was no evidence of government interventions to drive university–industry research collaboration for the tourism and hospitality industry, despite its undoubted importance to the Egyptian economy. The study sends a message to policy-makers, particularly government, that unless serious attention is paid to hospitality and tourism education and research, the impact on economic and social development will be negative...|$|R

In this article, we have described the physiological changes in the skin that occur with aging and decreasing estrogen in women and have explored the benefits of HRT in improving these dermatological symptoms (i. e.,reju-venation of the skin), in addition to our experience with HRT in outpatients. The three most common complaints among our patients are "I have prominent freckles", "the skin feels extremely dry", as well as "I have an itching sensation", and these dermatological symptoms are found to be as frequent as other menopausal symptoms. Furthermore, "increased water content in the stratum corneum", "decreased perspiration", and "decreased skin temperature" have been found to characterize the typical physiological changes that occur in the skin after menopause. Reports also indicate that HRT helps to maintain skin elasticity, skin thickness and sebum content in women of menopausal age which suggest the need for further research on the role of HRT in dermatological as well as in gynecological practice as an area worthy of further exploration and research...|$|R
