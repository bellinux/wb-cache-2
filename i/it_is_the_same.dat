5|$|These {{names were}} used for storms in 1975. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> list used in the 1971 season. This {{is the last time}} this list was used, as modern naming began in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Some {{references}} {{also say}} that it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch-station; or <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom. According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana. the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.|$|E
5|$|T. m. propinquus breeds from {{southeast}} British Columbia, southern Alberta, southwest Saskatchewan {{south to}} southern California and northern Baja California. It winters {{throughout much of}} the southern breeding range and south to Baja California. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size as or slightly larger than nominate T. m. migratorius, but paler and tinged more heavily brownish-gray. It has very little white on the tip of the outermost tail feather. Some birds, probably females, lack almost any red below. Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish sides to the head.|$|E

5|$|The shuttle crash-lands in a dense jungle {{on top of}} a plateau. When the boy emerges, {{he finds}} a ferocious-looking beast has {{replaced}} his dog. He decides to perform a test to see if the wolf and his pet dog are one and the same; he tosses a stick for the wolf to fetch, only to receive a giant bone instead. The boy shrugs this off and assumes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dog.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the {{species in the}} genus Oryzomys in 1948. He remarked {{that it was an}} especially distinctive member of that genus, and hence classified it in its own subgenus Micronectomys. J. Hernández-Camacho described a second species of Micronectomys, Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi, from Colombia in 1957. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated O.dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name Micronectomys was a nomen nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Micronectomys remains a nomen nudum. Hershkovitz also noted that while O.dimidiatus resembles a juvenile Nectomys in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). He accepted O.borreroi as an Oryzomys, but did not think it closely related to O.dimidiatus. Six years later, Alfred Gardner and James Patton instead suggested that O.borreroi was a Zygodontomys, and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Zygodontomys brunneus.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> type of gun {{that was used in}} the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
50|$|Finally, however, in <b>the</b> Challenge Cup, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{old story}} - eight seasons and eight first round defeats - Falkirk would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> victors this time.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} 2016 season, Jankauskas became The most {{prospective}} player, {{playing in}} Lithuania. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ceremony, where Fedor Černych became the best lithuanian player of 2016.|$|R
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe it}} is if {{properly}} prepared – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> substance as Isinglass.|$|E

50|$|Afridi {{has played}} one Test match, for the Pakistan {{national}} cricket team against the Sri Lanka national cricket team. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> match which saw Naved-ul-Hasan make his Test debut.|$|R

50|$|From Earth's {{point of}} view, the ring system appears about 3.7 milliarcseconds across. For comparison, if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{distance}} from {{our solar system}} Saturn's ring system would be 0.006 milliarcseconds across.|$|R

25|$|Chardal is an initialism of {{the words}} Charedi and Leumi. The acronym is easily remembered by Hebrew {{speakers}} because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the Hebrew word for mustard.|$|E
50|$|From 1995 to 1996, while Jarrah {{was still}} living in Yemen, {{according}} to his family, somebody of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> name rented an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. <b>The</b> landlords claimed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Ziad Jarrah as in the FBI photographs.|$|R
50|$|A later {{chapter of}} Manchester's book claims that three years {{afterwards}} he discovered a vampiric corpse (he implies that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> one) in <b>the</b> cellar {{of an empty}} house in the Highgate/Hornsey area, and staked and burned it.|$|R
25|$|The late Grand Rabbi of Munkatch, Chaim Elazar Spira, <b>was</b> {{aware of}} <b>the</b> change.

25|$|A. a. taprobana Kleinschmidt, 1894. Resident breeder in Sri Lanka and {{southern}} India. Its upperparts are bright blue, not green-blue; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size as A. a. bengalensis.|$|E
25|$|The figure dash (‒) is {{so named}} because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> width as a digit, at least in fonts with digits of equal width. This is true of most fonts, not only {{monospaced}} fonts.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponent}} is also universal, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in the Ising {{model as}} in the experimental magnet and gas, {{but it is not}} equal to the mean field value. This was a great surprise.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, in 1877 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} by Di Rovasenda in Barletta, south of Italy, the cultivar Quagliara, {{a very similar}} denomination to Quagliano, and if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> variety, <b>it</b> could have <b>been</b> its last and only report before being lost (Di Rovasenda 1877).|$|R
50|$|Emmotum {{was named}} by Desvaux and Hamilton (1783-1856) in 1825. George Bentham {{described}} the genus Pogopetalum in 1841, but John Miers recognized that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Emmotum, described earlier. Because the earlier name has priority, Pogopetalum {{is no longer}} a correct name.|$|R
30|$|As {{demonstrated}} before, Algorithm 3 {{returns the}} shortest {{path in the}} reduced graph. However, it remains {{to prove that the}} cost of the shortest path obtained by the proposed algorithm and the one obtained by Dijkstra’s algorithm (in the original graph without reducing <b>it)</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|R
25|$|Starting pitcher Jaime García {{announced}} on July 5 {{that he would}} have season-ending surgery to correct the thoracic outlet syndrome condition. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> nerve condition that caused the end of former pitcher Chris Carpenter's career with the Cardinals.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{evaluating}} the above equations or using commercial software applications for this, books of tables {{for the most}} common cases can be used. Generally instead of Ka, the horizontal part Kah is tabulated. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Ka times cos(δ+θ).|$|E
25|$|A matrix {{representation}} of P (in {{any number of}} dimensions) has determinant equal to −1, and hence is distinct from a rotation, which has a determinant equal to 1. In a two-dimensional plane, a simultaneous flip of all coordinates in sign is not a parity transformation; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a 180°-rotation.|$|E
50|$|A caramel {{version was}} also {{launched}} in 1995 which replaced the dark toffee {{of the original}} with caramel of similar consistency. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size and shape as the original Eat-More, but it came in a copper coloured wrapper. The caramel version has since been discontinued.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} modification <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fitting of a stronger rear differential {{to handle the}} increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with inboard disc brakes to reduce unsprung weight was chosen instead of the old E.N.V. unit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> unit used on the Jaguar E-Type.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} {{during the siege}} of Algeciras, his body <b>was</b> taken to <b>the</b> city of Burgos where he <b>was</b> sepulchered at <b>the</b> now {{destroyed}} Monasterio de San Francisco de Burgos. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place where his previous wife, the infanta Violante of Castile was also buried.|$|R
