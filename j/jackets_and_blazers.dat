5000|$|While pop singers such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera popularized {{the crop}} top for teeny boppers in the 1990s and early 2000s, others {{were making a}} crop top fashion {{statement}} for pregnant women. Certain members of the all-female musical groups All Saints and the Spice Girls wore crop tops on stage during their pregnancies. Since 2000, cropped <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blazers</b> have become more popular while the hemlines of shirts have mostly remained longer.

50|$|The brand {{consisted}} {{of a line of}} rugby shirts, polos, jackets, suits, dresses, outerwear and accessories, all with a distressed or embellished flair, as well as RRL signature Rugby Football shirts that could be customized by buying patches in-store.

Typically, there were also multiple luxury items in each line such as leather <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blazers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In clothing, single-breasted {{refers to}} a coat, jacket or similar garment having one column of buttons and a narrow overlap of fabric.

Single-breasted suit <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blazers</b> typically {{have two or three}} buttons (jackets with one or four buttons exist, but are not common), and a notch lapel. However, from the 1930s onwards, peaked lapels, often on a single button jacket, have been variably in fashion. The width of the lapels {{is one of the most}} changeable aspects of the jacket, and narrow peak lapels on single-breasted jackets became popular during the 2000s.|$|E

5000|$|Suit <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blazers</b> {{typically}} have {{one to four}} rows of buttons (each row containing two buttons), {{one or two of}} the rows functional.

Six-on-two and six-on-one (as shown in the picture on the right) are the common button stances, but others exist. Stylistically, double-breasted suit jackets usually have peaked lapels, and fasten left lapel over right lapel as usual for men's jackets.|$|E

30|$|Fashionable {{style is}} defined as a {{distinctive}} characteristic or way of expression. Style in clothing describes the lines that distinguish one form or shape from another (Kefgen and Touchie-Specht 1986). New styles were slowly but surely catching on initially through Hong Kong and the influence of its popular movies and TV dramas, and the newly opened up south and coastal areas (e.g., Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen). Jeans and t-shirts have marked a growing trend toward casual styles of clothing since the late 1980 s, a trend that was supported by an emerging interest in sports and outdoor activities. Besides professional sportswear such as the international brands of Nike, Adidas and Puma, casual wear and sportswear also emerged in everyday life. Tights and bikinis became acceptable and even popular, jumpers, <b>jackets,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blazers</b> all became good outerwear, and wool sweaters and down jackets turned into essential items for winter (Zhao 2013).|$|E
