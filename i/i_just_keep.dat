It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|According to Peter Shapiro of Relix, {{some fans}} of Phish debated {{whether or not}} there had been any {{references}} to the band before [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". While the band was mentioned by name in the season12 episode [...] "Lisa the Tree Hugger", there had not been any conscious attempts to reference the band before [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". This includes a scene in the season11 episode [...] "Saddlesore Galactica", which shows Duncan the diving horse hanging from a hoist; some Phish fans argued that the scene was a [...] "blatant" [...] reference to the cover of the band's seventh studio album, Hoist. [...] "That was a total coincidence", Jean said. [...] "It reminds me of the whole Wizard of Oz/Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon) hook-up. I haven't done it and I'm sure it works, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> thinking that it must be a coincidence. Before there was the invention of video, I don't know how Pink Floyd would have done a whole album to a movie." ...|$|E

In 1982, he published A Wild Sheep Chase, a critical success. Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, 1973, and A Wild Sheep Chase form the Trilogy of the Rat (a sequel, Dance, Dance, Dance, was written later but is not {{considered part of the}} series), centered on the same unnamed narrator and his friend, [...] "the Rat." [...] The first two novels were not widely available in English translation outside Japan until 2015, although an English edition, translated by Alfred Birnbaum with extensive notes, had been published by Kodansha as part of a series intended for Japanese students of English. Murakami considers his first two novels to be [...] "immature" [...] and [...] "flimsy," [...] and has not been eager to have them translated into English. A Wild Sheep Chase, he says, was [...] "the first book where I could feel a kind of sensation, the joy of telling a story. When you read a good story, you just keep reading.

2500|$|Because the {{composition}} and writing of BoA's songs is handled mostly by her staff, BoA has been criticized as being a [...] "manufactured pop star". In response to such criticism, BoA said that [...] "if one person were to force their own will on something, then things that should have gone right could easily go wrong" [...] and that she is [...] "not all that unhappy with the expression that [...] a manufactured star. In a way, that is true. Because SM Entertainment created the environment and all the surrounding conditions, [...] able {{to be successful in}} the way [...] now."

2500|$|Played by Art Carney; a New York City {{municipal}} sewer {{worker and}} Ralph's best friend (and upstairs neighbor). He is considerably more good-natured than Ralph, but nonetheless trades insults {{with him on}} a regular basis. Ed (typically called [...] "Norton" [...] by Ralph and sometimes by his own wife, Trixie) often gets mixed up in Ralph's schemes. His carefree and rather dimwitted nature usually results in raising Ralph's ire, while Ralph often showers him with verbal abuse and throws him out of the apartment when Ed irritates him. In most episodes, Ed is shown to be better-read, better-liked, more worldly and more even-tempered than Ralph, despite his unassuming manner {{and the fact that he}} usually lets Ralph take the lead in their escapades. Ed and Ralph both are members of the fictional Raccoon Lodge. ("An Emergency Meeting is an emergency meeting—never a poker game. An Executive Meeting, that's a poker game.") According to Entertainment Weekly, Norton is one of the [...] "greatest sidekicks." [...] Ed worked for the New York City sewer department and described his job as a [...] "Sub-supervisor in the sub-division of the department of subterranean sanitation, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> things moving along." [...] He served in the U. S. Navy, and used his G.I. Bill money to pay for typing school, but felt he was unable to work in an office because he hated working in confined spaces. The relatively few scenes set in the Norton apartment showed it to have the same layout as the Kramdens' but is much more nicely furnished. Though Norton makes the same weekly $62 salary as Ralph (about $555 in 2016 dollars), their higher standard of living might be explained by Norton's freer use of credit; at one point he admits to having 19 charge accounts. Like Ralph, Ed enjoys and is good at bowling and playing pool. Ed is the inspiration for Barney Rubble in The Flintstones. He's also the inspiration behind Yogi Bear (in terms of design, clothing, and mannerisms).|$|E
