5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

[...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

He later served as {{the offensive}} line coach for the NFL's Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts from 1982 to 1984 under Kush. Upon Kush's resignation to become {{head coach of the}} Arizona Wranglers of the United States Football League, Hal became the Colts' interim head coach for the final game of the 1984 season. The Colts lost the game 16–10 to the New England Patriots. He was an offensive line coach working with the guards and centers of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1985 to 1988. Hunter was the offensive line coach of the Cleveland Browns of the NFL in 1989 under coach Bud Carson and was nominated for Offensive Line Coach of the Year. He was then the Browns' special assistant to the head coach in 1990. After the firing of Carson in November 1990, Hunter was hired to be the Browns' offensive line coach by new head coach Bill Belichick on February 20, 1991. Hunter resigned {{at the end of the}} 1992 season, saying [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> through another year with [...]" ...|$|E

In the course of his detention, he was incarcerated in a cell at Camp Crame whose doors and windows were nearly completely sealed with plywood. Sarmiento nonetheless executed an affidavit where he defended the publication of the offending editorials in the exercise of free speech, press freedom, and the enjoyment of academic freedom. Sarmiento likewise refuse to recant his editorials. He wrote to his father, [...] "To back off now would be an abandonment of principles I believe in and a tarnish on my integrity as an individual. I do not believe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> with myself then." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Meyerbeer's {{popularity}} has faded, {{the fortunes of}} another French composer of the era have risen steeply {{over the past few}} decades. Yet the operas of Hector Berlioz were failures in their day. Berlioz was a unique mixture of an innovative modernist and a backward-looking conservative. His taste in opera had been formed in the 1820s, when the works of Gluck and his followers were being pushed aside in favour of Rossinian bel canto. Though Berlioz grudgingly admired some works by Rossini, he despised what he saw as the showy effects of the Italian style and longed to return opera to the dramatic truth of Gluck. He was also a fully-fledged Romantic, keen to find new ways of musical expression. His first and only work for the Paris Opéra, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), was a notorious failure. Audiences could not understand the opera's originality and musicians found its unconventional rhythms impossible to play. Twenty years later, Berlioz began writing his operatic masterpiece Les Troyens with himself rather than audiences of the day in mind. Les Troyens was to be the culmination of the French Classical tradition of Gluck and Spontini. Predictably, it failed to make the stage, at least in its complete, four-hour form. For that, it would {{have to wait until the}} second half of the twentieth century, fulfilling the composer's prophecy, [...] "If only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>live</b> till I am a hundred and forty, my life would become decidedly interesting". Berlioz's third and final opera, the Shakespearean comedy Béatrice et Bénédict (1862), was written for a theatre in Germany, where audiences were far more appreciative of his musical innovation.|$|E
