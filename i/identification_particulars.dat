40|$|<b>Identification</b> <b>particulars</b> were {{obtained}} for over 7000 men who were at some time between 1940 and 1974 exposed to vinyl chloride monomer {{in the manufacture of}} polyvinyl chloride. Approximately 99 % of these men have been traced and their mortality experience studied. The overall standardised mortality ratio, 75 - 4, shows a significant reduction compared with the national rates. Four cases of liver cancer were found. Two of these have been confirmed by a panel of liver pathologists as angiosarcoma and two as not angiosarcoma. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that cancers other than those of the liver are associated with exposure to vinyl chloride monomer. The two cases of angiosarcoma were found in men who had been exposed to high concentrations of the monomer although the second man died only eight years after first exposure. The industry in Great Britain has expanded considerably since the second world war with over 50 % of men having entered with the last decade. Conclusions drawn about the effect of vinyl chloride monomer on the mortality experience of men in this industry must consequently be tempered by the reservation that the full impact may not yet be in evidence...|$|E

40|$|India {{being the}} third largest economy of the world, more than two third of the total {{population}} lives in villages and started to consuming more quantity of energy in the recent years. Though the electricity consumption in the domestic sector has increased up to 22 per cent of the total electricity consumption, electricity consumption in villages is very less, since good number of villages in the rural system are not even electrified. In urban areas almost 90 percent of the household use electricity for lighting and just 10 percent use kerosene for the said purpose, whereas in the rural areas still more number of households use kerosene for lighting purposes. In this paper an attempt is made to analyze the domestic energy consumption for lighting in Jaipur city. Good amount of literature collected pertaining to domestic energy consumption for lighting purposes across the globe, analyzed thoroughly and presented. Further, a household survey was conducted among 684 households in Jaipur city by employing pre-tested schedule. The schedule has few variables including <b>identification</b> <b>particulars,</b> economic conditions, demographic pattern, domestic lighting appliances at the household level; and the energy consumption pattern. Further the collected data are analyzed and a multiple regression model was developed by considering the total electricity consumption as dependent variable ‘Y’ and the electrical appliances for lighting purposes, such as the number of incandescent bulbs, tube lights, CFL, and LED are considered as ‘X’ variables; and this study conclude with plausible findings and recommendations...|$|E
40|$|South Africa {{is faced}} {{by a huge}} problem of inequality, twenty years after the dawn of independence. Such inequalities have been {{addressed}} by policy intervention such as the social security and assistance of citizens through various classes of grants. One of the grants targeting {{children under the age}} of 18 years is the child support grant. However there are deserving children who have been left-out of mainstream social security through social exclusion. The study sought to investigate the problem of the social exclusion of children from the child support grant in the Nkonkobe municipality. Through the use of the Basic Needs Approach (BNA) to understand the need for any state/government to promote the social welfare of its citizens, the study took a triangulated research paradigm which used both quantitative and qualitative research approaches to collect data from forty respondents by way of a questionnaire survey. The study found out that, inter alia, poverty remains high in the Nkonkobe municipal area, there is rampant social exclusion in the area, the amount paid for the child support grant is little and that the effects of the withdrawal of the grant when the child reaches the age of 18 are unbearable to the child. Some of the recommendations which the study made in line with improved mainstream social security in relation to the child support grant are that, the government needs to improve information dissemination about grants to the populace, there should be mandatory policies to make sure all citizens have <b>identification</b> <b>particulars,</b> the government should be mobile and take services to the people and there should a consideration to review the amount paid for the child support grant upwards.

Erityisesti tutkittiin vasektomian, siviilisäädyn, ravinnon, tupakoinnin ja alkoholin vaikutusta. Aineisto kerättiin Mumbaissa Intiassa tapaus-verrokkitutkimuksena. Alkuperäiset tapaukset olivat Bombayn väestöpohjaiseen syöpärekisteriin ilmoitetut 594 eturauhasen syöpätapausta vuosilta 1998 2000. Kaksi verrokkia valittiin potilaan asuinalueelta. Verrokit ja elossa olevat potilaat tai kuolleen potilaan omaiset haastateltiin. Lopulliseen aineistoon hyväksyttiin 390 potilasta ja 780 verrokkia. Tutkittavien tekijöitten vaikutusta mitattiin vetosuhteina. Eturauhasen syöpävaara vasektomiaryhmässä oli 2 - 4 kertaa suurempi kuin ei-vasektomoiduilla. Suurentuneen vaaran uskottavuutta heikensivät huomattavasti valikoituneisuuteen ja haastattelun luotettavuuteen liittyvät tekijät. Miehillä, jotka olivat menneet yli 25 vuotiaina naimisiin oli myös suurentunut eturauhasen syöpävaara nuorempana naimisiin menneisiin verrattuna. Miehillä, jotka ilmoittivat syövänsä paljon hedelmiä ja vihanneksia, oli pieni eturauhasen syöpävaara. Muilla ravintotekijöillä, juomilla tai tupakoinnilla ei ollut vaikutusta eturauhasen syöpävaaraan. Vasektomian haitallisilla terveysvaikutuksilla olisi huomattavia seurauksia kehitysmaitten syntyvyyden säännöstelyyn ja väestöpolitiikkaan. Vasektomiaa koskevat tulokset tuleekin varmentaa hyvin suunnitelluilla epidemiologisilla tutkimuksilla Intiassa ja muissa kehitysmaissa. Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to find out the etiological factors for prostate cancer from a low risk population of a developing country. The specific aims were to assess the role of the following risk/protective factors: vasectomy, marital history, dietary habits, tobacco habits, and alcohol habits. Methods: Keeping the {{objectives of}} this study as the guidelines, a questionnaire was prepared for data collection. The questionnaire consisted of the following sections, 1. <b>Identification</b> <b>particulars</b> 2. Socio-demographic parameters 3. History of vasectomy 4. General dietary patterns 5. Tobacco and alcohol habits Included in this study were microscopically proved cases of prostate cancer diagnosed during 1998 to 2000 and registered by Bombay Population Based Cancer Registry (n= 594). The controls were healthy men belonging to the resident general population of Mumbai, India. Two controls for each case matched by age and place of residence were selected as the comparison group. The exposure history of the cases and controls were collected by structured face to face interviews. After exclusions, 390 cases and 780 controls were available for final analysis. The adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multiple logistic regression method. Results: Vasectomy has been emerged as a risk factor for prostate cancer. Compared with no vasectomy the OR for ever having undergone vasectomy was 1. 9 after controlling for age and other possible confounding factors. The risk for those who had a vasectomy before the age of 45 years was 2. 1 fold and those who had it at a later age (45 years or later) was 1. 8 fold compared to those who did not had a vasectomy. Also those who had completed more than 2 decades after had a vasectomy showed a 3. 8 fold risk for prostate cancer compared to those who did not had a vasectomy. Late marriage, that is, men who married at the age of 25 years or later, was associated with a 2. 5 fold risk for prostate cancer compared with those who married at younger ages, before the age of 25 years. The role of certain dietary factors including fruits and vegetables, fish, meat, coffee, tea and oil/fat intake on prostate cancer indicated that those who consumed more than 2 kilograms of fruits and vegetables in a week showed a protective effect for prostate cancer compared to those who consumed less than 2 kilograms of fruits and vegetables and the dose response was statistically significant, intake of fish, meat showed no statistically significant association with prostate cancer, consumption of non-alcoholic beverages like coffee, tea were not significantly associated with prostate cancer but high quantities of oil/fat consumption (more than 2 kilograms of oil/fat per month) showed an insignificant increased risk for prostate cancer. Tobacco smoking or tobacco chewing were not significantly associated with prostate cancer. Also there were no dose response relationships for number of bidi, cigarette smoked or time since start of these habits. Alcohol drinking (wine, whisky or toddy) did not show any statistically significant association with prostate cancer neither any dose response was observed for number of times drank or time since start of these habits. Conclusion: There are major public health and birth control implications on vasectomy increases the risk for prostate cancer. It is likely, however, that biases identified in this study result in high estimates of risk and the true risk due to vasectomy is substantially less than the estimated one. Due to the several limitations and possibilities for biases in this study, the evidence for the estimates obtained may not be a strong one. However, these results may give clues for further investigations and so prospective studies with good design and conduct are required for {{a better understanding of the}} etiology of prostate carcinogenesi...|$|E

To solve the problem, several physical and statistical model reduction methods are proposed. They are based on the stiffness matrix sparseness taking into account the physical properties of the manipulator elements and also on the heuristic selection of the practically non-identifiable parameters that employs numerical analyses of the parameter estimates. The advantages of the developed approach are illustrated by an application example that deals with the stiffness modeling of an industrial robot used in aerospace industry...|$|R
