This NOC also addresses other activities that are performed in support of salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> but do not require the application of a portable exhauster. Specifically this NOC analyzes the following three activities that have the potential for emissions. (1) Salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> (i. e., the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) under nominal tank operating conditions. Nominal tank operating conditions include existing passive breathing rates. (2) Salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> (the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) with use of a portable exhauster. (3) Use of a water lance on the waste to facilitate salt well screen and salt <b>well</b> jet <b>pump</b> installation into the waste. This activity is to be performed under nominal (existing passive breathing rates) tank operating conditions. The use of portable exhausters represents a cost savings because one portable exhauster can be moved back and forth between SSTs as schedules for salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> dictate.

40|$|The {{waste in}} tank 241 -C- 103 poses several {{health and safety}} risks and {{potential}} soil contamination caused by tank leaks. To {{minimize the risk of}} contaminating the soil beneath the tank, the pumpable waste liquids are planned to be removed by salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping.</b> In addition to aqueous liquids, this tank is unique because it also contains a layer of degraded PUREX solvent floating on the aqueous liquid. The following three options for removing and storing this separable phase organic solvent have been proposed and studied: transferring the organic solvent and pumpable aqueous liquids using existing salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> equipment and procedures to a double-shell tank (DST) for storage; removing most of the organic solvent using a skimmer <b>pump,</b> then salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> the remaining pumpable liquids to a different DST for storage; removing most of the organic solvent to an aboveground storage tank for eventual treatment or offsite transfer, and then salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> the remaining pumpable liquids to a DST for interim storage. As a result of evaluating these three options and a no pumping option, the recommended action is to transfer both the organic solvent and pumpable aqueous liquid to a DST for storage using existing salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> equipment. The evaluation considers the following criteria: public health and safety, worker safety, environmental compliance, engineering feasibility, and cost. The options compared these factors. Two key areas drove the selection of the recommended approach: the minimization of potential soil contamination from tank leaks caused the (interim stabilization by salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping)</b> options to be rated more highly than the no pumping option; and cost and implementation factors caused the transfer and storage to DST using existing tank farm salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> equipment option to rate higher than the skimming options. Other factors have only a second order effect on the selection process. Evaluation results are described in this report...|$|R

Samples were collected from 30 different residential <b>well</b> <b>pumps</b> with varying depth from 2 - 15 meters. The samples were divided into 2 groups based on the depth of <b>well</b> <b>pumps.</b> Group 1 is taken from 0 - 9. 9 meter depth and group 2 taken from 10 - 15 meter depth. Samples were tested with MPN (Most Probable Number) {{to determine the number}} of coliform bacteria. From 30 samples, 46. 67 % showed positive coliform.

40|$|This {{document}} {{serves as}} a notice of construction (NOC), pursuant {{to the requirements of}} Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246 - 247 - 060, and as a request for approval to construct, pursuant to 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 61. 96, portable exhausters for use on single-shell tanks (SSTs) during salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> and other activities. The reference to `other activities` throughout this NOC means those activities described in Appendix A. The use of portable exhausters represents a cost savings feature because one portable exhauster can be moved back and forth between SSTS as schedules for salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> or other activities dictate. A portable exhauster also could be used to simultaneously exhaust more than one SST during salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> or during performance of other activities. The primary objective of providing active ventilation to these SSTS is {{to reduce the risk of}} postulated accidents to remain within risk guidelines. It is anticipated that salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> will release gases entrapped within the waste as the liquid level is lowered, because of less hydrostatic force keeping the gases in place. Other activities also have the potential to release trapped gases by interrupting gas pockets within the waste. Hanford Site waste tanks must comply with the Tank Farms Safety Basis (OESH 1997) which requires that the flammable gas concentration be less than 25 percent of the lower flammability limit (LFL). The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) safety analysis indicates that the LFL might be exceeded in some tanks during certain postulated accident scenarios. Also, the potential for electrical (pump motor, heat tracing) and mechanical (equipment installation) spark sources exist. Therefore, because of the presence of ignition sources and the potential for released flammable gases, active ventilation might be required in some SSTS to reduce the `time at risk` while salt <b>well</b> <b>pumping</b> or performing other activities. Thirty tanks remain to be salt <b>well</b> <b>pumped.</b> Determination of which of the 30 tanks have the potential to exceed the 25 percent LFL is continuing as this NOC is submitted...|$|R
