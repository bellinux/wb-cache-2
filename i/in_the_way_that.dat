40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} islandness and island identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fiction of Cape Breton's Alistair MacLeod and Newfoundland's Wayne Johnston. Through careful readings of their fiction, with supplementary evidence culled from biographical and secondary sources, the thesis shows {{that their work}} is profoundly influenced by their childhood experiences; that these authors have been "imprinted" by growing up on an island; and that, as a result, both authors bear a strong island identity which inspires and infuses their writings. The thesis opens by introducing themes that pervade islandness, and proceeds to set MacLeod's and Johnston's fiction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the western traditions of island and regionalist literature, followed by a discussion of how identity is formulated. <b>In</b> three chapters <b>the</b> thesis explores the theme of boundedness: physically or geographically, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ocean's boundary defines a character, as evidenced primarily <b>in</b> Johnston’s <b>The</b> Colony of Unrequited Dreams and MacLeod’s "Island"; psychologically, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> childhood and family affect an individual growing up on an island, as evidenced primarily <b>in</b> Johnston's <b>The</b> Story of Bobby O’Malley and MacLeod’s "The Boat" and "The Lost Salt Gift of Blood"; and emotionally, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> social influences affect feelings of belonging and exile, as evidenced primarily <b>in</b> Johnston’s <b>The</b> Custodian of Paradise and MacLeod’s No Great Mischief.

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the revival}} of neo-Platonism Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's {{greatest}} works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars {{for the first time}} since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, would help pave the way for the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War the operas began to be {{performed}} in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the Selva morales and Missa e Salmi volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.|$|E

40|$|About the book: Emphasizing a performative and stage-centered approach, {{this book}} {{considers}} early modern European theater {{as an international}} phenomenon. Early modern theater was remarkable both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> it represented material and symbolic exchanges across political, linguistic, and cultural borders (both "national" and "regional") but also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> it enacted them. Contributors study various modalities of exchange, including the material and causal influence of one theater upon another, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of actors traveling beyond their own regional boundaries; generalized and systemic influence, such as the diffused effect of Italian comedy on English drama; the transmission of theoretical and ethical ideas about the theater by humanist vehicles; the implicit dialogue and exchange generated by actors playing "foreign" roles; and polyglot linguistic resonances that evoke circum-Mediterranean "cultural geographies. " In analyzing theater as a medium of dialogic communication, the volume emphasizes cultural relationships of exchange and reciprocity more than unilateral encounters of hegemony and domination...|$|R
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's three {{consecutive}} movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> that film had. The {{mood of the}} director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, {{with the possibility of}} redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths. He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new widescreen format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, The Hidden Fortress, is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on George Lucas's 1977 space opera, Star Wars.|$|E

Having recovered from his wounds, Manekshaw attended the 8th Staff Course at Command and Staff College, at Quetta, from 23 August to 22 December 1943.

On 30 October 1944, he received the local rank of lieutenant-colonel. Towards the end of World War II, after the Japanese surrender, Manekshaw was appointed to supervise the disarmament of over 60,000 Japanese prisoners of war (POWs).
