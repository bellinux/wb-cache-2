40|$|The {{leakage test}} program {{was one of}} such {{supporting}} technology programs structured to provide guidance to the Energy Efficient Engine High Pressure Turbine Component Design Effort. Leakage reduction techniques were identified and evaluated. Test models were used to simulate component leak paths and to evaluate leakage reduction techniques. These models simulated the blade/disk attachment, the vane inner platform attachment, and the vane outer platform attachment combined with the blade outer airseal. Disk blade attachment testing indicated that leakage in this area could be reduced to very low levels by paying careful attention to the tolerances along the contact surface between the blade vibration damper and the blade platform contact surface. The aim of <b>feather</b> <b>seal</b> testing was to achieve a goal for an effective leakage gap of one mil (. 001 inch) per inch of <b>feather</b> <b>seal</b> length. Results indicated that effective gaps even below the goal level were achievable by (1) maintaining close tolerances between feather seals and their slots to minimize end gaps and limit seal rotation, (2) avoiding <b>feather</b> <b>seal</b> overlap, and (3) minimizing <b>feather</b> <b>seal</b> intersections. W seals were shown to be effective leakage control devices. Wire rope, in its present state of development, was shown not {{to be an effective}} sealing concept for application to the component design...|$|E
40|$|Feather seals (also called slot seals) {{typically}} found in turbine stators limit leakage from the platform {{into the core}} cavities and from the shroud to the case. They are of various geometric shapes, yet all are contoured to fit the aerodynamic shape of the stator and placed as close as thermomechanically reasonable the powerstream flow passage. Oscillations engendered in the compressor or combustor alter the steady leakage characteristics of these sealing elements {{and in some instances}} generate flow instabilities downstream of the seal interface. In this study, a generic <b>feather</b> <b>seal</b> geometry was studied numerically by imposing an upstream harmonic pressure disturbance on the simulated stator-blade gap. The flow and thermal characteristics were determined; it was found that for high pressure drops, large fluctuations in flows in the downstream blade-stator gap can occur. These leakages and pulsations in themselves are not all that significant, yet if coupled with cavity parameters, they could set up resonance events. Computationally generated time-dependent flow fields are captured in sequence video streaming...|$|E

50|$|On 17 July 1709, Johann Baptist Farina {{registered}} {{as a new}} resident at Cologne town hall and on the 24th was granted free citizenship. In those days, this procedure was necessary for a settler {{to set up a}} private business. With the support of his uncle, {{who was a member of}} the Maastricht government, and the salesman Johann Maria Farina (real name Giovanni Maria Farina), Johann Baptist Farina (II) signed on 1 August 1709 a twelve-year contract to rent a building at the junction of the streets Großen Bottengassen and Goldschmidts, now known as Unter Goldschmidt.Johann Baptist and his brother-in-law, Franz Balthasar Borgnis, then founded 'Farina & Compagnie', which later developed into 'Gebrüder Farina & Comp.' (English: Farina Brothers and Co.) after Johann Maria Farina (I) and Carl Hieronymus Farina joined in 1714 and 1716. The Farina company sold a wide range of luxury items, such as lace, handkerchiefs, silk stockings, wigs, <b>feathers,</b> tobacco boxes, <b>sealing</b> wax and face powder that one would have expected to find in a shop run by Italians.|$|R
