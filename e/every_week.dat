40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} acromegaly is transsphenoidal surgery. In approximately 50 % of patients, however, a cure {{is not possible}} with surgery and alternatives are needed. Somatostatin analog therapy is the recommended first-line treatment in patients with such cases. Here we provide the first report of a high-dose lanreotide primary therapy in patients with acromegaly. Case presentation Six patients who were not suitable for surgery were given 60 mg of lanreotide (Autogel ®) <b>every</b> four <b>weeks.</b> All patients were German nationals and Caucasian. When the response of our patients was unsatisfactory, the dose was increased sequentially to 90 mg <b>every</b> four <b>weeks,</b> 120 mg <b>every</b> four <b>weeks,</b> 120 mg <b>every</b> three <b>weeks</b> and 180 mg <b>every</b> three <b>weeks.</b> Treatment duration was 12 to 24 months. In all cases, the lanreotide dose was 120 mg <b>every</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> or higher. In five of our patients, growth hormone (GH) levels were successfully reduced (in three patients GH Tumor shrinkage or degeneration was observed in the five responding patients. No drug-related adverse events were noted. Conclusions These results suggest that lanreotide at high doses of 120 mg <b>every</b> four <b>weeks</b> or more is an effective first-line therapy for patients with acromegaly that surgery alone cannot treat. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{define the}} maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of {{ifosfamide}} when given with G-CSF on an <b>every</b> other <b>week</b> schedule, and {{to define the}} MTD of edatrexate that can be given <b>every</b> two <b>weeks</b> with an intense schedule of ifosfamide. Patients and Methods. Forty-one patients with metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced sarcoma participated in this 2 -step phase I trial. The starting dose of ifosfamide was 10 gm/m[sup 2] given by continuous intravenous infusion over 4 days <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks.</b> When the MTD was defined, edatrexate, beginning at a dose of 40 mg/m[sup 2] intravenously <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks</b> was added in subsequent cohorts of patients. Results. Myelosuppression was the most prominent toxicity. Fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were observed {{in the majority of}} patients. Ifosfamide 12 gm/m[sup 2] given <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks</b> approached or exceeded the MTD. Edatrexate 100 mg/m[sup 2] could be given safety as an intravenous bolus with ifosfamide 10 gm/m[sup 2] <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks.</b> Therapeutic responses were observed in patients with measurable disease. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the feasibility of administering a dose-intense schedule of ifosfamide alone or ifosfamide with edatrexate that might be applied in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on "Mexican" lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swing.) during 2004 and 2005 seasons. The purpose of the {{present study was}} to investigate the effect of intermittent warming (IW) of the "Mexican" lime to reduce chilling injury (CI) during cold storage. Fruits were submitted for storage; at 5 °C or 12 °C continuously and at 5 °C with submitted to intermittent warming; at 12 °C for one <b>week</b> <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks,</b> at 20 °C for 48 h <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks,</b> at 12 °C for one <b>week</b> <b>every</b> 3 <b>weeks</b> and at 20 °C for 48 h <b>every</b> 3 <b>weeks.</b> The fruits were evaluated after 30 and 60 days plus 3 days at 20 °C. The obtained results revealed that fruits kept continuously at 12 °C did not show CI during storage periods. No visible symptoms of CI were observed in fruits until 30 days of storage but observed only after 60 days of storage at 5 °C. The incidence of CI was 82 – 84 % for fruits kept continually at 5 °C for both seasons, respectively. However, fruits intermittently warmed at 20 °C for 48 h <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks</b> did not show CI. Fruits kept at 20 °C for 48 h <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks</b> and at 20 °C for 48 h <b>every</b> 3 <b>weeks</b> had greener skin after 60 days of storage but fruits kept continuously at 12 °C showed degreeing after 30 days of storage in both seasons. Fruits stored continuously at 5 °C, warmed to 12 °C for one <b>week</b> <b>every</b> three <b>weeks</b> of storage at 5 °C and continuously at 12 °C had the highest weight loss. However, intermittently warmed fruits <b>every</b> two <b>weeks</b> of storage at 5 °C to 12 °C for one week or at 20 °C for 48 h had the lowest weight loss after 60 days of storage in both seasons. No differences were found in the fruit quality after 60 days of storage period among fruits kept at 5 °C and submitted to IW. Generally, the temperature of 5 °C can be used for "Mexican" lime during 30 days of cold storage without risk of CI. Intermittent warming (IW) had been shown to be effective in reducing CI. Fruits intermittently warmed at 20 °C for 48 h <b>every</b> 2 <b>weeks</b> had no injuries (CI), greener fruit skin fruit color, lowest weight loss and with no differences in the fruit quality after 60 days of storage periodCorresponding Author: Dr. Mohammed M.
