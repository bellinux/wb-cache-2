500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on {{all five}} {{original}} songs on Wrapped in Red, {{some of which}} were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season. She co-wrote the opening and title track, [...] "Wrapped in Red", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and Shane McAnally. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but usually I <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And he and I were like, 'Let's just try to write something for the record." [...] RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] by Mariah Carey. The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which Clarkson had selected for its saccharine content.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s before her death, Washington {{occasionally}} {{performed on the}} Las Vegas Strip. Tony Bennett said of Washington during a recording session with Amy Winehouse: [...] "She {{was a good friend}} of mine, you know. She was great. She used to <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> with two suitcases in Vegas without being booked. And she'd <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and put the suitcases down. And she'd say [...] "I'm here, boss". And she'd stay as long as she wanted. And all the kids in all the shows on the Strip would come that night. They'd hear that she's in town and it would be packed just for her performance". According to Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic: [...] " [...] was at once one of the most beloved and controversial singers of the mid-20th century – beloved to her fans, devotees, and fellow singers; controversial to critics who still accuse her of selling out her art to commerce and bad taste. Her principal sin, apparently, was to cultivate a distinctive vocal style that was at home in all kinds of music, be it R, blues, jazz, middle of the road pop – and she probably would have made a fine gospel or country singer had she the time. Hers was a gritty, salty, high-pitched voice, marked by absolute clarity of diction and clipped, bluesy phrasing..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daley {{had always}} been passionate about art, but {{according}} to Daley, he [...] "never had the talent to paint or draw at a high level." [...] He became an art collector. [...] In the early 1970s, Daley and his wife, Melba, opened their first studio. [...] In approximately 1974, they then opened the Daly Illustration Art Gallery in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Minneapolis. From 1974 until his death, Daley has owned and operated Daley Illustration Gallery located in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, 1300 Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. [...] The Daley Illustration Gallery has 500 original illustrations, {{making it one of}} the finest illustration painting collections in the world. [...] In a 1993 interview, Daley said, [...] "Some people <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> to talk football, but don't know much about painting." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Elbert Hubbard and {{the writer}} {{sat at the}} small table in The Pennsylvania Society rehashing mutual old time {{experiences}} in the west, particularly, relating tales. He had himself been adopted into the Sioux tribe, but recently. Memory may be slightly at fault, but as now recalled, {{there were a couple}} of champagne glasses, partly full, on the same table. The letter from Felix, apologizing for the delay (of repaying a $30 loan) and explaining how he had made a trip to Rapid City and found the letter which had lain in the post office for months, how he had corrected the address, got it on its way to discharge his obligation, this letter had <b>just</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon mail. The writer drew it from his pocket and handed it to Hubbard to read. When he had completed the reading, and asked a few pertinent questions about the author, he folded it and deliberately placed it in his own pocket, saying it would be the subject of a new A Message to Garcia which he was going to write. Before he had accomplished this planned project for the thrill and edification of his world-wide fraternity of readers, the RMS Lusitania took America's greatest modern writer and philosopher to the bottom of the sea on May 17, 1915." ...|$|E
