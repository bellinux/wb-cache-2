However, from the quantitative point of view, there are very few firms that switch import sources from non-members to RTA members when facing the introduction of RTA schemes...|$|R
5000|$|By February 1953, the Chinese {{government}} was attempting a military build-up in Tibet. Airfields could specifically {{be an advantage}} as Tibet could then {{be used as a}} refueling station between China and India—giving China the ability to fly long combat missions over India {{and to be able to}} target all of its northern cities. Additionally, as the highest geographical point, Tibet could maintain an aerial advantage over the region. A CIA information report dated July 31, 1953 reveals the CIA was closely monitoring Chinese projects in Tibet. The report notes that earlier that year Chinese soldiers [...] "attempted to build airfields at Lhasa," [...] the capital of the Tibet Autonomous region, and Gartok, now called Gharyarsa. However the Dalai Lama disapproved of the project and the soldiers ceased construction of the airfields. In May 1953, over 1,000 Chinese soldiers marched to the Chumbi Valley with five field artillery pieces. These soldiers increased Chinese presence in Tibet to approximately 20,000 soldiers—all mainly stationed in Chumbi Valley, Bartok, Rudog, and north of Lhasa. In October 1953, the Chinese government had placed travel restrictions in Tibet. This resulted in a huge <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> of wool forcing them to move westward. Around the same time, the Chinese were using Tibetan labor to create new roadways that would be controlled by the Chinese, which resulted in the Chinese controlling nearly all travel within Tibet. In December 1953 China communicated to the Indian Ambassador their position on Tibet; the Chinese gave nine demands to the Indian Ambassador. Their demands included that they would not tolerate any further Indian interest in Tibet and No objection must be made by India to Chinese construction of forts in Tibet near the Indian and Nepalese borders. Another of the demands stated that India must have a strong policy to abolish illegal activities of foreign agents working on the Indian side of the border.|$|E
30|$|The seminal partial {{equilibrium}} {{framework of}} Viner (1950) indentifies the principal implications of RTAs through the trade creation {{and the trade}} diversion effects. The trade creation effect implies that the removal (or reduction) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs) between RTA member countries leads {{to an increase in}} international trade flows between them, displacing less efficient domestic production. This effect generates positive welfare implications for the importing RTA member country. The trade diversion effect implies that the regional trade preferences induce a <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> from the more efficient RTA non-member country to the less efficient RTA member country. This effect results in negative welfare implications for the importing RTA member country.|$|E

40|$|Governments have {{recently}} become concerned about cross border shopping and smuggling {{because it can}} decrease tax revenue.

These arguments have been used to urge governments not to increase tax on tobacco products. The evidence suggests, however, that cross border shopping is not yet a problem in Europe and that smuggling is not of cheap cigarettes to expensive countries.

The results show that higher exports generally tend to benefit the workers who work in the exporting sectors.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} on {{the regional}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> flows in the Asia Pacific area {{suggest that some}} countries have developed strong bilateral trade links, while others obviously {{tend to be more}} closely linked towards trading partners outside the Asia Pacific area (Amelung (1990)). Moreover, empirical findings indicate that there are groups (clusters) of countries in the Asia Pacific area which - in relative terms - trade more intensively with the members of their group than with other countries of this area or the world. For instance, in the eighties there was a clear separation between a South East Asian group <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> partners comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and a group of North East Asian countries encompassing Korea, Taiwan, Japan, China, Hong Kong and the USA as a non-Asian nation. However, the cluster analysis does not explain why this pattern of regionalization emerges. In economic theory the regionalization <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> flows has been attributed to the. discrimination of countries through legal (El-Agraa (1988), Nienhaus (1987), p. 84) and natural trade barriers (Langhammer (1983), Deardorff (1987)). Following Viner's custom unions theory (Viner (1950)) a group of countries can negotiate preferential ?tariff treatment for their members, thus discriminating against non-member countries. Given such an institutional arrangement regional trade is expected to rise as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> creation and <b>trade</b> <b>diversion.</b> Moreover, regionalization <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> flows can be enhanced by differences in transport costs resulting from the spatial remoteness <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> partners. As Deardorff shows, these differentials may affect both the direction and the composition <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> since they constitute natural trade barriers. ...|$|R
