500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O!" [...] said he, {{wiping the}} tears of {{laughter}} from his eyes, [...] "it {{was all so}} funny, and every body was so happy--that--that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> my bereavement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forget,</b> {{but have}} some {{recollection}} that the allusion is to Mr. Heneage Finch's {{picture of a}} Lady with a Fan.--ED.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's such {{a damned}} {{long time since}} I heard it that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forget</b> it myself. But for thirty years now in the islands they've always called me Red." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; {{not that}} exactly--though <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forget</b> its exact purport now. It was merely--merely sharp, you know--ungenerous, I might say. But really my memory does not enable {{me to speak}} decidedly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, Herky, <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> {{to return}} your hat," [...] I said, {{removing}} the wide sombrero. It {{had a wonderful}} band made of horsehair and a buckle of silver with a strange device.|$|E
60|$|As luncheon {{proceeded}} <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> {{my fears}} in {{admiration for the}} child's pluck. Her sensible, observant conduct delighted me, and I no longer doubted her fitness for any social position to which she might be raised.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{good deal}} of it I don't understand," [...] he said, [...] "but I read every word, and that's the main thing. That story about Joseph and his brother was so int'resting <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> about the Judgment Day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will call}} you Frank, {{if you will}} allow me. The use of Christian names is, I think, {{pleasant}} and hardly common enough among us. <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forget</b> my own boy's name because the practice has grown up of calling him by a title." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgotten</b> that enigmatical {{message of}} Poirot's, but now my curiosity was aroused afresh.|$|R
6000|$|... "’Pon my soul," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "I {{have been in}} so many—looking for Captain Rogers—that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forget</b> the last, but I have just tramped from London, two hundred and eighty odd miles, for the {{pleasure}} of seeing your damned ugly figure-head again; and now I’ve found it, I’m going to stay. Give me some money." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> that I {{was hungry}} or thirsty, for the fever of killing was upon me, and my one {{hope was that}} we might draw them {{two or three times}} more in order to give the villainous brutes such a lesson in blood-letting as they had never learned before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, Charley, it is {{all right}} now; but you see I was {{thinking}} {{so much of my}} sister and of her life, that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> what a good old bear it is, and you don't know how pleased I am that you have spoken as you have done." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MAMMA,--This morning I got a {{delightful}} haul: your {{letter of the}} fourth (surely mis-dated); papa's of same day; Virgil's Bucolics, very thankfully received; and Aikman's Annals,[5] a precious and most acceptable donation, for which I tender my most ebullient thanksgivings. <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> to drink my tea and eat mine egg.|$|E
60|$|Non. <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> my own great belly. If {{he should}} {{discover}} that too! [Claps his hat before it.|$|R
60|$|Fail. O, {{one thing}} <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> to tell you; {{one of us}} two must ever be near Sir Timorous.|$|R
60|$|In another we {{had passed}} the wretched dog, and <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgotten</b> why it was that I had taken the horse and hogspear.|$|R
60|$|Soon I {{began to}} feel myself quite at home with him, and to enjoy my dinner with a greatly-added zest. Indeed, in {{listening}} {{to some of his}} quaint recitals of adventures at foreign hotels, <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> to watch for the advent of the lady and gentleman for whom I had been looking out so eagerly only a few minutes before.|$|E
60|$|The few wax tapers gave but {{light enough}} to find the way from goblet to mouth. As for Reverie's wine, I ask no other, for it had the poppy's scarlet, and overcame weariness so subtly <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> these were the hours of sleep we spent in waking; forgot, too, as if of the lotus, all thought of effort and hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one little}} thing <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> to tell you," [...] she said, very softly, very slowly, very clearly. [...] "I do love you. I have never loved {{you so much}} as right now. After our dozen years you've bowled me over at last. And I was bowled over from the beginning, {{although}} I did not know it. I have {{made up my mind}} now, once and for all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that, Clyffurde," [...] {{once more}} broke in de Marmont, {{and this time}} more vehemently than before. [...] "When you speak like that <b>I</b> could <b>almost</b> <b>forget</b> our friendship." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgotten</b> the Huns. <b>I</b> saw Maude {{gazing at}} them with {{a new kind of}} terror. And when we sat at home that evening they still haunted her.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, uncle, <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgotten</b> about it, but {{you know}} I've been so much engaged {{during the last few}} days in visiting my old friends and college companions, that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait! <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> the horns!" [...] cried Sam, and he darted {{back into}} the building, to {{reappear}} {{a few seconds later}} with several long tin horns. Into the automobile piled the boys, and then, with a loud sounding of the horn, Tom turned on the power, and the machine started off in the direction of Hope, soon reaching the spot where the automobile had gone into the river.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next day}} we were all so busy that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> the {{incident}} of the previous evening. We girls were up in the sewing room putting the last touches to the wedding gown. Eliza tried it and her veil on and was standing so, in all her silken splendour, when a letter was brought in. I guessed by her blush who was the writer. I laughed and ran downstairs, leaving her to read it.|$|E
6000|$|... "A lot of cracked hickory nuts!" [...] {{declared}} Tommy. [...] "I {{just knew}} that they were meant for me, and when I was sure that the way was clear, I flew over there. They tasted so good that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> about Farmer Brown's boy, when I just happened to look in the window. You know those windows are made of some queer stuff that looks like ice and isn't, and that you can see right through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgotten.</b> Yes, {{it was one}} of {{the things}} which I had called to tell you. Sir Algernon Jones has {{resigned}} at Tangier. There is a vacancy there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, about Sir Louis; a {{very bad}} sort of fellow, isn't he? Drinks--eh? I knew his father a little. He was a rough diamond, too. I was once down in Northamptonshire, about some railway business; let me see; <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forget</b> whether <b>I</b> was with him, or against him. But I know he made sixty {{thousand}} pounds by one hour's work; sixty thousand pounds! And then he got so mad with drinking that we all thought--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, Ned!" [...] cried Tom, {{suddenly}} leaping {{out of bed}} {{and beginning}} to dress in haste; [...] "why, it's Christmas morning! <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgot.</b> A Merry Christmas to you, my boy!" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{knew that}} those who formed that circle of painted forms but a short {{distance}} away were deciding whether we be put to torture immediately, or reserved for some especial time of rejoicing, and there grew upon me such a fascination as is sometimes brought about by keenest peril, until <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> the desperate situation as I watched those who held our fate in their hands, trying to discover from the expression on their hideous faces what might be the result of the conference.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; with a {{love that}} should {{complete}} my disgrace--that should finish my degradation. But I had not heard of this Florence Burton; and, Harry, that night I was happy in my bed. And in that next week when you were down there for that sad ceremony, I was happy here, happy and proud. Yes, Harry, I was so proud when I thought you still loved me--loved me {{in spite of my}} past sin, that <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> that I was polluted. You have made me remember it, and I shall not forget it again." ...|$|E
60|$|In my {{surprise}} <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> the Mexican. Then I {{thought that if}} Dick were there the Mexican {{would be likely to}} have troubles of his own. I remembered Dick's reputation as a fighter. But suppose I did not find Dick at the sawmill? This part of the forest was probably owned by private individuals, for I couldn't imagine Government timber being cut in this fashion. So I tied Hal and the pony amidst a thick clump of young pines, and, leaving all my outfit except my revolver, I struck out across the slash.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> {{the most}} {{material}} point, which is, that his majesty's sanction {{must first be}} obtained, and the university proposed have power to confer degrees, &c., and other academical privileges.|$|R
6000|$|... "P.S. <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgotten</b> to tell you, {{that in the}} signal-book {{you will}} find a more {{particular}} description of our prison, where it stands, and a drawing of the grounds, etc." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{tell her}} about the cannon that was discharged, first, and about the ball that I heard. <b>I</b> had <b>almost</b> <b>forgot</b> that adventure, which was a very {{remarkable}} one, was it not, Biddy?" ...|$|R
