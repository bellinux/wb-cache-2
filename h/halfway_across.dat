5|$|At {{daylight}} a reconnaissance by No. 1 Squadron aircraft reported three British armoured cars <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the Esdraelon Plain {{on their}} way to Afulah, a cavalry brigade at Lejjun and two brigades just entering the plain advancing on a broad front. The 5th Cavalry Division had ordered the 14th Cavalry Brigade to Afulah. This brigade reached the Afulah to Nazareth road at about 05:30, and at 07:15 after attacking a German or Ottoman force, the 20th Deccan Horse captured Afulah railway station and about 300 prisoners. The division's artillery, which had moved through the Abu Shusheh pass during the morning, rejoin the 5th Cavalry Division at Afulah later in the day.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for acquiring {{the shape of}} realworld objects with complex isotropic and anisotropic reflectance. Our method estimates the local normal and tangent vectors at each pixel in a reference view from a sequence of images taken under varying point lighting. We show that for many real-world materials and a restricted set of light positions, the 2 D slice of the BRDF obtained by fixing the local view direction is symmetric under reflections of the <b>halfway</b> vector <b>across</b> the normal-tangent and normal-binormal planes. Based on this analysis, we develop an optimization that estimates the local surface frame by identifying these planes of symmetry in the measured BRDF. As with other photometric methods, a key benefit of our approach is that the input is easy to acquire and is less sensitive to calibration errors than stereo or multi-view techniques. Unlike prior work, our approach allows estimating the surface tangent {{in the case of}} anisotropic reflectance. We confirm the accuracy and reliability of our approach with analytic and measured data, present several normal and tangent fields acquired with our technique, and demonstrate applications to appearance editing...|$|R
60|$|There {{was quite}} a nice taxi on the rank {{at the bottom of}} the hill. The driver, a pleasant-looking young man in a white cap, seemed to have been waiting for her in particular; he met her timid {{invitation}} <b>halfway</b> and came <b>across</b> the road to her and jumped down and opened the door. He took her instructions as though they were after his own heart, and right in front of her as she sat was a kind of tin cornucopia full of artificial flowers that seemed like a particular attention to her. His fare was two and eightpence and she gave him four shillings. He seemed quite gratified by her largesse, his manner implied he had always thought as much of her, from first to last their relations had been those of sunny contentment, and it was only as she ascended the steps of Lady Beach-Mandarin's portico, that it occurred to her that she now had insufficient money for an automobile to take her home. But there were railways and buses and all sorts of possibilities; the day was an adventure; and she entered the drawing-room with a brow that was beautifully unruffled. She wanted to laugh still; it animated her eyes and lips with the pleasantest little stir you can imagine.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the terms}} agreed in December 1974, the talks between the Rhodesian {{government}} and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen {{to adhere to the}} accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government, placed <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, {{on the opposite side of}} the carriage, would be able to attend without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975.|$|E
5|$|Fleet {{exercises}} in 1934 {{were carried out}} in the Bay of Biscay, followed by a fleet regatta in Navarino Bay off Greece. In 1935, the ship returned to Britain for the Jubilee Fleet Review for King George V. In August 1935, Royal Sovereign was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles Ramsey. The ship served as a training vessel until 2 June 1937, when she was again placed in reserve for a major overhaul. This lasted until 18 February 1938, after which she returned to the 2nd Battle Squadron.

The development of the biomass sorghum hybrid seed industry is contingent {{on the use of}} cytoplasmic male sterility. Within sorghum, there are several different cytoplasmic male sterility systems and it is important to determine early in development if cytoplasm will affect agronomic performance or composition characters. Thus, if there is a difference, then the best system can be deployed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if cytoplasm per se influences agro-nomic performance of biomass sorghum using a set of iso-cytoplasmic hybrids. Three hybrid genotypes were produced in three different cytoplasms (A 1, A 2, and A 3) for a total of nine hybrids. These hybrids were evaluated for plant height, biomass yield, and biomass composition in three Texas environments (Weslaco, College Station, and <b>Halfway)</b> in 2010. <b>Across</b> environments, significant differences existed among hybrids for both agronomic and compositional traits, but cytoplasm per se had no effect on any measured trait. Since cytoplasm did not effect on hybrid performance, any of the tested cytoplasms (A 1, A 2, and A 3) can be deployed in hybrid biomass sorghums...|$|R
5|$|Nkomo {{remained}} unchallenged at {{the head}} of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Robert Mugabe, a former teacher from Mashonaland who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa's delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat {{on opposite sides of the}} frontier. The conference, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976.|$|E
5|$|The incisors {{are large}} and ungrooved. Their enamel is orange, but paler on the lowers. The {{orientation}} of the upper incisors is opisthodont, with the cutting edge oriented backwards.

5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north {{to the mouth of}} the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula is located on the eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast to the mouth of the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and to the mouth of Port Bay.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three hundred yards away, at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th Sudanese.|$|E

The southern bank of the Cumberland River at Mill Springs was a bluff and a strong defensive position, whereas the northern bank was low and flat. Zollicoffer chose to move most of his men to the north bank where they would be closer to nearby Union troops, incorrectly assuming that it was more defensible. Both Crittenden and Albert Sidney Johnston ordered Zollicoffer to relocate south of the river, but he could not comply because he had insufficient boats to cross the unfordable river quickly and was afraid his brigade would be caught by the enemy <b>halfway</b> <b>across.</b>|$|E

At one point about <b>halfway</b> <b>across,</b> the commander of the 16th Alabama ordered his regiment to halt; Adams ordered the 33rd to stop, as well. The two regiments resumed their advance after about ten minutes or so, though in the darkness they now had to deal with stragglers firing on them from behind, as well as the enemy shooting at them to their front. One incident of friendly fire claimed the life of Lieutenant Alfred Moore: he was accidentally shot in the neck from behind by a straggler, who was roundly cursed by his comrades and ordered to cease fire. A few companies of the 33rd began to fall back, but Adams quickly corralled them and got them back into the fight. With the attack beginning to stall, artillery batteries were brought up in the darkness together with supporting troops under Brigadier General John Jackson; these finally drove the Federals back, with the 33rd Alabama crossing their breastworks on {{the far side of the}} field, and heading straight for the nearby 6th Indiana.|$|E
25|$|On USC's next possession, Leinart {{drove his}} team into Texas territory, {{this time to}} the 25-yard line, before {{throwing}} an interception to Texas free safety Michael Griffin, {{who appeared to be}} out of the play but ran <b>halfway</b> <b>across</b> the field before making a leaping catch and barely staying in-bounds in the end zone. The turnover ended a second Trojans' drive with USC in scoring position. On the following Texas drive, Young connected with wide receiver Limas Sweed, who caught eight balls for 65yards on the day, for a key first down. Young then led his team with his legs, capping the drive by running 10yards before throwing a lateral pass to open running back Selvin Young, who ran for 12 more for the touchdown. The lateral, made after Young's knee had touched the ground, was not reviewed because of issues with the replay equipment. The game continued with a failed extra-point attempt by Texas, which, not knowing of the equipment issues, appeared to rush the kick to get the play off before the prior play could be reviewed. The NCAA football-officiating coordinator later asserted that Young's knee had been down, and expressed confusion about how the call had been handled.|$|E
