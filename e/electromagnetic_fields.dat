5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E

Guidelines place the limit for safe continuous exposure between 100μT and 200μT.

Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E

The external <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> is exponentially decaying with time. Under the same initial conditions, flow evolution with and without the external <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> is compared. It was found that the production of particles was enhanced when the external <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> was present. As the strength of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> increased, more particles were produced. Enhancement is greater at the high transverse momentum than at the low transverse momentum. In addition, the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> also modifies the elliptic flow and the modification is related to the mass and charge of the particles. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that all living things produce. This helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{positive}} charge in ions {{is achieved by}} stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed is related to either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E

The electromagnetic continuous casting experiments for Incoloy 800 H superalloy were successfully conducted and the billets (0. 1 m × 0. 1 m × 1. 2 m) were obtained.

The low frequency (5 Hz) <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field</b> which is applied in the second cooling region can improve the internal quality; the region of the equiaxed grain increases from 2. 45 % (without <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field)</b> to 41. 45 % (with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>field).</b> Furthermore, macro- and micro-segregation are suppressed and the TiN inclusion number is decreased as well...|$|R
