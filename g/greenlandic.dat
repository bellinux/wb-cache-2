5|$|From the Danish {{colonization}} in the 1700s to {{the beginning}} of <b>Greenlandic</b> home rule in 1979, <b>Greenlandic</b> experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing <b>Greenlandic</b> with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.|$|E
5|$|When {{adopting}} {{new concepts}} or technologies, <b>Greenlandic</b> usually constructs new words made from <b>Greenlandic</b> roots, but modern <b>Greenlandic</b> has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language {{has been written}} in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because {{of a number of}} sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in <b>Greenlandic</b> literacy, which is now {{among the highest in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|From 1851 to 1973, <b>Greenlandic</b> {{was written}} in a {{complicated}} orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and {{in the years following}} it, <b>Greenlandic</b> literacy received a boost.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greenlandic</b> is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In <b>Greenlandic</b> the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into <b>Greenlandic</b> as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E
5|$|Kalaallisut and {{the other}} <b>Greenlandic</b> dialects belong to the Eskimo–Aleut family and {{are closely related to}} the Inuit {{languages}} of Canada and Alaska. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of <b>Greenlandic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{descriptions}} of <b>Greenlandic</b> {{date from the}} 1600s, and {{with the arrival of}} Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first <b>Greenlandic</b> dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether <b>Greenlandic</b> has noun incorporation. This is because <b>Greenlandic</b> does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, <b>Greenlandic</b> does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. <b>Greenlandic</b> has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that <b>Greenlandic</b> does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how <b>Greenlandic</b> forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greenlandic</b> {{phonology}} distinguishes itself phonologically {{from the}} other Inuit languages {{by a series of}} assimilations.|$|E
5|$|In {{this section}} the {{examples}} {{are written in}} <b>Greenlandic</b> standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.|$|E
5|$|The company saw its {{activity}} curtailed as {{the mines}} at Ivittuut (1987) and Maamorilik (1990) closed operation, {{leading to a}} recession in the <b>Greenlandic</b> economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of <b>Greenlandic</b> {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit to the length of a <b>Greenlandic</b> word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E
5|$|While {{the status}} of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some {{scholars}} have claimed that <b>Greenlandic</b> has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers. However, at least for literary <b>Greenlandic,</b> these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics {{that can be used to}} refer to the future via the strategies just described.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greenlandic</b> distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for {{person and}} number of subject and object {{as well as for}} mood. Nouns inflect for {{possession}} and for case. Particles do not inflect.|$|E
5|$|Orto Ignatiussen (voice) as Aningaaq, a <b>Greenlandic</b> Inuit {{fisherman}} who intercepts one of Stone's transmissions. Aningaaq {{also appears}} in a self-titled short, {{written and directed by}} Gravity co-writer Jonás Cuarón, which depicts the conversation between him and Stone from his perspective.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Greenlandic</b> {{language}} uses case {{to express}} grammatical relations between {{participants in a}} sentence. Nouns are inflected {{with one of the}} two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Greenlandic</b> {{language}} {{was brought to}} Greenland {{with the arrival of}} the Thule people in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Verbal {{derivation}} {{is extremely}} productive, and <b>Greenlandic</b> employs {{many hundreds of}} derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.|$|E
5|$|Besides running {{scheduled}} services and government-contracted flights to most {{villages in the}} country, the airline also supports remote research stations, provides charter services for tourists and Greenland's energy and mineral-resource industries and permits medivac during emergencies. Air Greenland has seven subsidiaries, an airline, hotels, tour operators, a travel agency specialized in <b>Greenlandic</b> tourism and the Arctic Umiaq Line, an unprofitable but government-subsidised ferry service.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greenlandic</b> is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|Located in a {{historical}} building near the harbor, the Sisimiut Museum specializes in <b>Greenlandic</b> trade, industry and shipping, with artifacts based on ten years of archaeological research and excavations of the ancient Saqqaq culture settlements near the town, offering an insight into {{the culture of the}} region of 4,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the possessive {{agreement}} suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs {{in a number of}} instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that <b>Greenlandic</b> has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{specimen}} {{of the black}} dogfish was collected near Julianehåb in Greenland and described by Danish zoologist Johannes Reinhardt in his 1825 Ichthyologiske bidrag. Reinhardt gave it the name Spinax fabricii in honor of missionary and naturalist Otto Fabricius, who pioneered the study of <b>Greenlandic</b> fishes. German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle, in their 1839–41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, created the new genus Centroscyllium for this species.|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland A/S, {{also known}} as Greenlandair, is the flag carrier airline of Greenland, jointly owned by the SAS Group (37.5%), the <b>Greenlandic</b> Government and the Danish Government. It {{operates}} a fleet of 32 aircraft, including 1 airliner used for transatlantic and charter flights, 9 fixed-wing aircraft primarily serving the domestic network, and 22 helicopters feeding passengers from the smaller communities into the domestic airport network. Flights to heliports in the remote settlements are operated on contract {{with the government of}} Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Grønlandsfly also {{purchased}} {{its first}} jet aircraft, a Boeing 757–200 which began operation in May 1998. The airliner was named Kunuunnguaq {{in honour of}} the <b>Greenlandic</b> explorer and ethnologist Knud Rasmussen, whose bust decorates in the terminal of Kangerlussuaq hub. The airliner allowed the company to run the profitable Kangerlussuaq–Copenhagen route directly, without affiliates or a layover in Iceland. Thus, in 1999, the airline served 282,000 passengers, nearly triple the number {{at the end of}} the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|Since 2011, the <b>Greenlandic</b> {{national}} broadcaster Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR) {{has attempted}} to gain EBU membership and thus participate independently in the Eurovision Song Contest. However KNR cannot obtain EBU membership due to the autonomous country not being independent from the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland has broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 on tape delay. On 4 May 2017, {{it was announced that}} Greenland would broadcast the 2017 contest final on delay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Greenlandic</b> Government and the SAS Group are {{the largest}} {{shareholders}} of the airline, owning a 37.5% stake each. The Danish Government owns the remaining 25% of the stock. The Ministry of Housing, Infrastructure, and Transport oversees {{the development of the}} transport industry in Greenland and controls Mittarfeqarfiit, the airport authority in Greenland. Between them, they control mandatory services, airport taxes, pricing policies, maritime connections and tourism development, effectively allowing Greenland Home Rule to control the company in spite of the other stakeholders.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{officers}} and scientific staff were Americans (first mate Hubbard Chester, second mate William Morton, and astronomer and chaplain R.W.D. Bryan) and Germans (chief scientist and surgeon Emil Bessels and meteorologist Frederick Meyer). The seamen were mostly German, as was chief engineer Emil Schumann. In addition to the 25officers, crew, and scientific staff, Hall brought Inuit interpreter and hunter Ebierbing, his wife Tookoolito, and their child. A <b>Greenlandic</b> aboriginal named Hans Hendrik, his wife Merkut and three children also joined the expedition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greenlandic</b> prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
5|$|Tourist {{facilities}} in Sisimiut include several youth hostels and hotels, such as Hotel Sisimiut with Restaurant Nasaasaaq, and Seaman's Home, and a conference center. The other restaurant of note is the Misigisaq Restaurant, {{located at the}} harbor. It is the only Chinese restaurant {{in the country and}} it uses <b>Greenlandic</b> ingredients cooked in the Chinese style. The town has a heated open-air swimming pool, which is supported on stilts so that the heat does not melt the permafrost. Several camping sites are located in Sisimiut valley and near the Kangerluarsunnguaq bay. During winter, a ski lift operates {{at the foot of the}} Alanngorsuaq mountain, at the base of the northern slopes of Nasaasaaq.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his <b>Greenlandic</b> girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greenlandic</b> verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E
25|$|Greenland {{adopted the}} Act on Banknotes in Greenland in 2006 {{with a view}} to {{introducing}} separate <b>Greenlandic</b> banknotes. The Act entered into force on 1 June 2007. In the autumn of 2010, a new <b>Greenlandic</b> government indicated that it did not wish to introduce separate <b>Greenlandic</b> banknotes and Danmarks Nationalbank ceased the project to develop a <b>Greenlandic</b> series. Still, Greenland continues to use Danish kroner as sole official currency.|$|E
25|$|Inuit speak Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, and <b>Greenlandic</b> {{language}}s, which {{belong to}} the Inuit-Inupiaq branch of the Eskimo–Aleut language family.. The <b>Greenlandic</b> languages are divided into: Kalaallisut (Western), Inuktun (Northern), and Tunumiit (Eastern).|$|E
25|$|Tunumiit oraasiat, the Tunumiit {{language}}, (or Tunumiisut in <b>Greenlandic,</b> often East <b>Greenlandic</b> {{in other}} languages), is the dialect of eastern Greenland. It differs sharply from other Inuit language variants and has roughly 3000 speakers according to Ethnologue.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{recordings}} of this music are done since 1905. This traditional <b>Greenlandic</b> music is performed also today.|$|E
25|$|Both Atlamál and Atlakviða are {{referred}} to as <b>Greenlandic</b> poems in the Codex Regius. Most scholars believe Atlakviða to be older than the Norse colony in Greenland and reject a <b>Greenlandic</b> origin for that poem. Atlamál, on the other hand, is believed to be of an age consistent with composition in Greenland. Moreover, some aspects of the poem itself are suggestive of Greenland. In particular one of Kostbera's ominous dreams has a realistic description of a polar bear. The grim tone of the poem is also consistent with what is known of the Greenland settlement. The relatively mean conditions of the chieftains in the poemthe Niflungar, for example, have only 10 retainershave also been taken as strengthening the case for an origin in <b>Greenlandic</b> culture.|$|E
