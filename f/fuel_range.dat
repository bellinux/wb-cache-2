50|$|Usually {{trawlers}} have {{a single}} engine, though twin-engine installations are also available from some builders. They have a large fuel capacity. <b>Fuel</b> <b>range</b> is normally 1,500-3,000 miles on smaller vessels, even greater for those over 45 ft in length. When combined with the slower speeds of a displacement hull, these features give such vessels far greater range and economy than similarly sized planing boats. A large engine room under the main cabin is another feature of true cruising trawlers. Many also include a diesel generator of 5-20 kW to power domestic appliances, bow thrusters, dinghy cranes, and similar equipment.|$|E

50|$|In Dubai, {{the terrorists}} asked the tower to supply water, food, medicine, newspapers, {{and to take}} away the rubbish. Captain Jürgen Schumann was able to {{communicate}} the number of hijackers on board as well as specifying that they were two men and two women. In an interview with journalists, this information was revealed by Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed, then Minister of Defence. The hijackers learned about this-possibly from the radio-causing Mahmud to threaten to kill Schumann. The aircraft remained on the ground at Dubai all through the day and night. The following morning Mahmud threatened to start shooting hostages if the aircraft was not refuelled and the Dubai authorities finally agreed. In the meantime, both Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski, the West German minister responsible for handling the hijacking, and Colonel Ulrich Wegener, commander of the elite German anti-terrorist squad GSG 9, had arrived in Dubai to try to persuade the government to agree to let GSG 9 commandos into Dubai to storm the aircraft. However, after permission was granted for GSG 9 commandos to storm the aircraft, SAS and GSG 9 senior operatives insisted on additional combat exercise and dry-runs on an adjacent airstrip. Reports suggest up to 2720 minutes (or 45 hours) of supplementary training was conducted whilst based in Dubai (over a period of 80 hours). While Wegener was considering his options, the Landshut had completed its refuelling and at 00:20 (17 October) it took off, heading for Salalah in Oman, where landing permission was once again denied, and a course to Aden in South Yemen, at the limit of their <b>fuel</b> <b>range,</b> was established.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a novel four-step {{process for the}} {{production}} of jet and diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>range</b> alkanes from hemicellulose extracts derived from northeastern hardwood trees. The extract is representative of a byproduct that could be produced by wood-processing industries such as biomass boilers or pulp mills in the northeastern U. S. The hemicellulose extract tested in this study contained mainly xylose oligomers (21. 2 g/l xylose after the acid hydrolysis) as well as 0. 31 g/l glucose, 0. 91 g/l arabinose, 0. 2 g/l lactic acid, 2. 39 g/l acetic acid, 0. 31 g/l formic acid, and other minor products. The first step in this process is an acid-catalyzed biphasic dehydration to produce furfural in yields up to 87 %. The furfural is extracted from the aqueous solution into a tetrahydrofuran (THF) phase which is then fed into an aldol condensation step. The furfural-acetone-furfural (F-Ac-F) dimer is produced in this step by reaction of furfural with acetone in yields up to 96 % for the F-Ac-F dimer. The F-Ac-F dimer is then subject to a low-temperature hydrogenation to form the hydrogenated dimer (H-FAF) at 110 – 130 °C and 800 psig with a 5 wt% Ru/C catalyst. Finally the H-FAF undergoes hydrodeoxygenation to make jet and diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>range</b> alkanes, primarily C 13 and C 12, in yields up to 91 %. The theoretical yield for this process is 0. 61 kg of alkane per kg of dry xylose derived from the hemicellulose extract. Experimentally we were able to obtain 76 % of the theoretical yield for the overall process. We estimate that jet and diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>range</b> alkanes can be produced from between $ 2. 06 /gal to $ 4. 39 /gal depending on the feed xylose concentration, the size of the biorefinery, and the overall yield. Sensitivity analysis shows that the prices of raw materials, the organic-to-aqueous mass ratio in the biphasic dehydration, and the feed xylose concentration in the hemicellulose extract significantly affect the product cost...|$|E
