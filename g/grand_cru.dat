5|$|For each vintage, the CIVC {{rated the}} villages of the area based {{on the quality of}} their grapes and vineyards. The rating was then used to {{determine}} the price and the percentage of the price that growers get. The <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90–99% ratings while Deuxième Crus received 80–89% ratings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> {{wines are}} {{produced}} {{from the small}} number of the best vineyard sites in the Côte d'Or, as strictly defined by the AOC laws. These Cru wines make up 2% of the production at 35 hl/ha, and are generally produced in a style meant for cellaring, and typically need to be aged a minimum of five to seven years. The best examples can be kept for more than 15 years. <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> wines will only list the name of the vineyard as the appellation - such as Corton or Montrachet - on the wine label, plus the <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> term, but not the village name.|$|E

50|$|Wines {{allowed the}} {{national}} seal can also carry three additional quality designations: Vin classé, Premier <b>Cru</b> or <b>Grand</b> Premier <b>Cru,</b> {{which have been}} used since 1959. These designations are awarded the individual wine after tasting by an official committee, which rates the wines on a 20-point scale.|$|R
25|$|The {{village of}} Gevrey-Chambertin (jehv ray sham ber tan) is {{noted for its}} {{full-bodied}} red wines, particularly those from one of its nine <b>grand</b> <b>cru</b> vineyards-Le Chambertin, Chambertin-Clos de Beze, Mazis-Chambertin, Chapelle-Chambertin, Charmes-Chambertin, Mazoyeres-Chambertin, Griotte-Chambertin, Latricieres-Chambertin and Ruchottes-Chambertin. The village of Morey-St-Denis (maw ree san d'nee) is noted for it full-bodied red wines, particularly those from one of it five <b>grand</b> <b>cru</b> vineyards-Clos de la Roche, Clos St. Denis, Clos des Lambrays, Clos de Tart and Bonnes Mares which it shares with the village of Chambolle-Musigny. Chambolle-Musigny (shom bowl moo sih nyee) is noted for the more elegant style of wines comes from its <b>grand</b> <b>cru</b> vineyards of Bonnes Mares and Musigny {{as well as its}} several high quality premier crus.|$|E

50|$|Grand Millésime Brut (Vintage, {{latest is}} 2000). 56% Chardonnay and 44% Pinot noir from <b>grand</b> and premier <b>cru</b> vineyards. In the 1980s, the blend was 60% Pinot noir and 40% Chardonnay.|$|R
50|$|Fleur de Champagne Brut 1er cru - 70% chardonnay and 30% pinot noir; from <b>Grand</b> and Premier <b>Cru</b> {{vineyards}} {{from the}} Grande Vallée de la Marne, the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs. Duval-Leroy's most famous cuvée and signature champagne. First released in 1911.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{being made}} {{primarily}} from the same grape, pinot noir, winemaking styles in the Cote de Nuits is far from monolithic. The individual style of the producer or negociant and the decisions they make at {{each step of the}} winemaking process — beginning with the sorting table as they grapes arrive from the harvest — will affect the resulting quality of the wine immensely. It is this reason, along with the varied and complex ownership of most <b>grand</b> and premier <b>cru</b> vineyards, that most wine experts put more weight on the reputation of the producer and the vintage year than on the vineyard name when it comes to evaluating all Burgundy wine-the Cote de Nuits not excluded.|$|R
25|$|Pinot gris {{is one of}} the {{so-called}} noble grapes of Alsace, along with Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Muscat, which may be used for varietal Alsace <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> AOC and the late harvest wines Vendange Tardive and Sélection de Grains Nobles.|$|E
25|$|Rules {{for the red}} Burgundy appellations, from {{regional}} to <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> level, generally {{allow up}} to 15% of the white grape varieties Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris to be blended in, {{but this is not}} widely practiced today.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Grüner Veltliner {{has seen}} an uptick in {{interest}} following {{the results of}} a 2002 wine tasting organized by Masters of Wine Jancis Robinson and Tim Atkin.

50|$|The charity auction been {{arranged}} annually since 1859, {{taking place on}} the third Sunday in November amid a three-day festival devoted to the food and wines of Burgundy called Les Trois Glorieuses. The charity is preceded by a black tie dinner at the Clos de Vougeot on day one and followed by the lunch La Paulée de Meursault on day three. The Domaine des Hospices de Beaune is a non-profit organisation which owns around 61 ha of donated vineyard land, much of this classified <b>Grand</b> and Premier <b>cru.</b> With bidding by professional and private buyers, the barrels, from 31 cuvées of red wine and 13 of white wine, attain prices usually well {{in excess of the}} current commercial values, although the results give some indication of the trend in expected bulk wine prices for the vintage {{from the rest of the}} region.|$|R
25|$|The {{village of}} Vougeot (Voo joe) {{is known for}} its large <b>grand</b> <b>cru</b> {{vineyard}} Clos de Vougeot and the full bodied wines it produces. The village of Vosne-Romanee (vone roh mah nay) is known for the rich, velvet textured wines produced in its six <b>grand</b> <b>cru</b> vineyards-Romanée-Conti, La Tâche, Richebourg, La Romanée, Romanée-St. Vivant and La Grand Rue. The village of Flagey-Echezeaux (flah jhay eh sheh zoe) is essentially a hamlet of Vosne-Romanee that contains the grand crus of Grands Echézeaux and Echézeaux. The Cote de Nuits takes its name from the village of Nuits-St-Georges (nwee san johr'j) which contains no grand crus but several highly esteemed premier crus such as Les Vaucrains and Les Saints-Georges that produces earthy red wines.|$|E
25|$|Like most <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> {{vineyards}} in Burgundy {{ownership of}} the vines on Corton-Charlemagne is spread out among several growers with some doing estate bottling while other selling their portion of the crop to négociants who combine it with the produce of other parcels to make a single Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northwest}} corner of the Côte de Beaune, Pernand-Vergelesses produces about 30,000 cases, 75% red. The commune contains 34.3ha of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> Corton-Charlemagne (see Aloxe-Corton below), and five Premier Crus (57ha), of which Ile de Vergelesses is the most notable. There are 228.3 ha of vineyards in total.|$|E
25|$|Corton-Charlemagne is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) and <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> {{vineyard}} {{for white}} wine in Côte de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. It {{is located in}} the communes of Aloxe-Corton, Pernand-Vergelesses and Ladoix-Serrigny with Chardonnay being the only permitted grape variety. Around 300,000 bottles of white wine are produced each year in the appellation.|$|E
25|$|Rarely will a {{producer}} use oak for both fermentation and maturation. <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> and Premier Cru wines {{are most likely}} to see oak: proponents believe that they have necessary structure and enough extract to avoid being overwhelmed by oak influence. While there are style differences among producers, rarely is basic AOC Chablis or Petit Chablis oaked.|$|E
25|$|Burgundy {{is home to}} some of {{the most}} {{expensive}} wines in the world, including those of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Domaine Leroy, Henri Jayer, Emmanuel Rouget, Domaine Dugat-Py, Domaine Leflaive and Domaine Armand Rousseau. However, some top vintage first growth Bordeaux wines and a few iconic wines from the New World are more expensive than some <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> class Burgundies.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{producers}} are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC {{if they wish}} to do so. Thus, a wine from a <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> vineyard may be sold as a Premier Cru from that vineyard's village, a Premier Cru wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold at a lower price, so this is only practiced when something is to be gained overall in the process. One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in a <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as a Premier Cru at a lower price. Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold.|$|E
25|$|At harvest time, AOC {{regulations}} stipulate grapes for <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> vineyard must {{be picked}} {{with a potential}} alcohol level of at least 11 percent, at least 10.5 percent for Premiers Crus and 9.5 percent for AOC Chablis vineyards. Yields in Grands Crus must be limited to 3.3 tons per acre (45 hectoliters per hectare) with a 20% allowance for increased yields. There is no official regulation {{on the use of}} mechanical harvesting, but most <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> producers prefer hand picking because human pickers tend to be more delicate with the grapes and can distinguish better between ripe and unripe bunches. Over the rest of the Chablis region, mechanical harvesting was used by around 80% of the vineyards {{at the turn of the}} 21st century. The traditional style of vine training in Chablis is to have the vine trained low to the ground for warmth with four cordons stretching out sideways from the trunk.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 at the Paris Exposition Universelle, the Comité d'Agriculture de Beaune tasked Dr. Jules Lavalle with coming up with a similar {{classification}} of the vineyards of the Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune for the 1862 International Exhibition in London. The history of the tête de cuvée and making wine from a single vineyard estate was more established in the Côte de Nuits than Côte de Beaune which was reflected in Lavalle's defining over 20 vineyards in the Côte de Nuits worthy of cru for red wines while the Côte de Beaune had only one exceptional vineyard. Lavalle's classification would serve as foundation for the official establishment of <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> and premier cru in the 1930s as Appellation d'origine contrôlée or AOCs. Today there are 24 <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> vineyards in the Côte de Nuits clustered around six villages and more than 100 premier cru vineyards throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|Zhao is a {{well-known}} wine lover and has a passion for winemaking. On 21 December 2011, French newspaper Sud-Ouest reported that Zhao had bought Château Monlot, a Saint-Émilion <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru,</b> at 4 million euro. On 16 September 2012, Zhao Wei is admitted into the Jurade de Saint-Émilion. After 4 years of work, in October 2015, the winery launched the Bordeaux wine brand in the Chinese mass market. The online shop offers both high end and affordable wine selections.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other wine {{regions of}} France (such as Bordeaux), {{winemaking}} in the Cote de Nuits exist {{on a very}} small scale. The typical domaine estate produces from 50 to 1,000 cases of wine a year, {{in contrast to a}} Bordeaux chateau which often makes more than 20,000 cases annually. Vineyards in the area are highly fragmented, with multiple owners each owning pieces of a family. A producer may own only 2 to 3 rows of vines in a vineyard which they could either produce as a separate wine or blend with the production of other similarly small holdings in other vineyards in the region. These blended wines will generally take on a larger scale designation of a village or district-level wines. Those producers who keep the production separate and unblended (such as for a <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> or Premier cru level wine) will make several batches of very small quantities of wine that can fetch high prices due to demand for their limited supply. A third option is to sell the grapes or wine to a negociant who may be able to purchase similar lots from the same vineyard to produce more cases of that <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> or Premier cru level wine.|$|E
25|$|Almost all Alsace wine is {{produced}} {{under one of}} the region's three AOC designations—Alsace, Alsace <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> and Crémant d'Alsace. Unlike most other French wine regions, there exists no Vin de pays designation for Alsace. This means that wines that do not qualify for AOC status have to be sold as simple Vin de table de France. This happens in some instances when producers wish to use other grape varieties in their wine, like Domaine Zind-Humbrecht which sells its cuvée Zind, a blend of 65% Chardonnay and 35% Auxerrois.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{efforts have been}} made to {{identify}} which vineyards in the Barolo zones produce the highest quality of wine. Inspired by the prestige and high prices charged for <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> bottlings of Burgundy wine, Barolo producers began separating their holdings into individual vineyard lots and labeling the wines with these single vineyard designations. The practice became so extensive that some producers were doing single vineyard bottlings and charging high prices on all their holdings, regardless of whether the particular vineyard quality merited such a practice.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, vines {{were grown}} on 15,298 {{hectares}} (37,800 acres) in 119 villages in Alsace, and 111.3 million litres of wine was produced, corresponding to 148.4 million bottles of 750 ml, generating 478.8 million euro in revenue. Of the vineyard surface, 78% was classified {{for the production}} of AOC Alsace wines, 4% for AOC Alsace <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru,</b> and 18% for AOC Crémant d'Alsace. About 90% of the wine produced is white. 25% of the production is exported, and the five largest export markets for still Alsace wine in terms of volume are Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as <b>grand</b> <b>cru.</b> The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too thin to support vines.|$|E
25|$|Some of the winemakers {{producing}} those hard, dense wines {{would use}} some of small segments of white grapes grown in the Côte de Nuits as a softening blend {{in a manner similar}} to how white grapes were historically used in Chianti. While for most of its history, the Côte de Nuits had been firmly associated with red grape varieties, the 16th and 17th century saw an increase in plantings of white grape varieties, like Chardonnay and Fromenteau. White grapes continue to be found scattered throughout the area, including a notable white Chambertain, until the mid 19th century when nearly all premier and <b>Grand</b> <b>cru</b> vineyards became completely dedicated to pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|Located {{near the}} 47th {{parallel}} north, the Cote de Nuits {{is one of}} the northernmost regions to produce premium quality red wines. However, this northerly location brings with it a lot of vintage variation from year to year. From winter time hail, spring time frost and cool autumns that may bring devastating rains that impede ripening and harvest, the quality of each vintage can be highly variable. The vineyards of the Cote de Nuits are planted on east and southeast facing slopes that receive the most opportune sun exposures with vineyards designated as premier and <b>grand</b> <b>cru</b> almost always planted on this ideal aspect at elevations between 800–1000ft (250–300 m).|$|E
25|$|The vines {{are located}} on the higher ground of a hilltop that {{stretches}} between the Burgundian villages of Ladoix-Serrigny and Pernand-Vergelesses. The slopes planted with the most valuable vineyards face south-east on the hilltop, with the land gradually sloping downwards towards the major French highway Route 74. The red wine appellation of Corton covers {{the lower part of}} the hill with the areas for Corton and Corton-Charlemagne partially overlapping. Furthermore, there is a third <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> appellation on the Corton hill, Charlemagne, that may be used for white wine produced from the En Charlemagne lieu-dit. However, as En Charlemagne is only 0.28 hectares in size, production is limited and usually blended with grapes from the other lieu-dits of Corton-Charlemagne.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials {{were built in}} these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch {{or the end of}} the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy's <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E
25|$|Alsace wine or Alsatian wine (in French: Vin d'Alsace) (German: Weinbau in Elsass) is {{produced}} in the Alsace region in France and is primarily white. Because of its Germanic influence, {{it is the only}} Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée region in France to produce mostly varietal wines, typically from similar grape varieties to those used in German wine. Along with Austria and Germany, it produces some of the most noted dry Rieslings in the world as well as highly aromatic Gewürztraminer wines. Wines are produced under three different AOCs: Alsace AOC for white, rosé and red wines, Alsace <b>Grand</b> <b>Cru</b> AOC for white wines from certain classified vineyards and Crémant d'Alsace AOC for sparkling wines. Both dry and sweet white wines are produced.|$|E
