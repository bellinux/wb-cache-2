40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach in}} the field of personal radio-frequency (RF) dosimetry is the use of a body worn electromagnetic probe (i. e. personal RF body worn dosemeter) to record personal exposure to RF fields. Using such a dosemeter mounted on the body, an individual&# 039;s exposure could be recorded at the time and place that it occurs. This would fulfil an important criterion for epidemiological and other studies into the relationship between RF exposures and health effects in humans. The relationship between a dosemeter measurement and quantities that characterise human exposure to RF fields, such as the spatially averaged <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> and the whole body average specific absorption rate (SAR), is not well understood nor been rigorously quantified. This thesis tackled the problem of determining the relationship by employing computational modelling and statistical simulations to generate distributions of the fields close to the surface of realistic human body models. These fields are proxies for measurements made with an ideal, isotropic responding, body worn personal RF dosemeter (or simply dosemeter). It focussed on exposures occurring remote (in the far-field) from microwave antennas such as those associated with mobile and wireless base-stations, TV and other typically fixed radio transmitters. Exposures from RF transmitters worn on or in close proximity to the body were not the subject of this study. Initial computational modelling using single plane waves with arbitrary incident angles and polarisation revealed the extent and nature of the distribution of electromagnetic fields close to the surface of a body. Results indicated that a dosemeter measurement could lead to an over or under-estimation of the <b>exposure</b> <b>field.</b> Other factors affecting the close fields were also investigated to quantify their impact. Additional plane wave modelling found that dosemeter measurements could be used to estimate the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> or the whole body averaged SAR with similar levels of uncertainty. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to provide statistical information concerning the relationship between dosemeter measurement of the field close to the body and the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> and whole body averaged SAR. Exposures to RF fields were modelled using statistics that describe radio wave propagation in outdoor and indoor multipath environments at 450, 900 and 2100 MHz. Correction factors and associated standard deviations derived from the output of simulations can be applied to measurements made with actual, physical dosemeters to determine estimates of both <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> and whole body averaged SAR...|$|E
40|$|Most {{process window}} {{analysis}} applications {{are capable of}} deriving the functional focus-dose workspace available to any set of device specifications. Previous {{work in this area}} has concentrated on calculating the superpositioned optimum operating points of various combinations of feature orientations or feature types. These studies invariably result in an average performance calculation that is biased by the impact of the substrate, reticle and exposure tool contributed perturbations. Many SEM’s and optical metrology tools now provide full-feature profile information for multiple points in the <b>exposure</b> <b>field.</b> The inclusion of field spatial information into the process window analysis results in a calculation of greater accuracy and process understanding because now the capabilities of each exposure tool can be individually modeled and optimized. Such an analysis provides the added benefit that after the exposure tool is characterized, it’s process perturbations can be removed from the analysis to provide greater understanding of the true process performance. Process window variables are shown to vary significantly across the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> of the scanner. Evaluating the depth-of-focus and optimum focus-dose at each point in the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> yields additional information on the imaging response of the reticle and scan-linearity of the exposure tool’s reticle stage.

40|$|PLEASE NOTE THAT AN UPDATED VERSION OF THIS RESEARCH IS AVAILABLE AS WORKING PAPER 350 IN THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON BIOSTATISTICS WORKING PAPER SERIES ([URL] In {{environmental}} epidemiology and related problems in environmental statistics, it is typically not practical to directly measure the exposure for each subject. Environmental monitoring is employed with a statistical model to assign exposures to individuals. The {{result is a}} form of exposure misspecification that can result in complicated errors in the health effect estimates if the exposure is naively treated as known. The exposure error is neither “classical” nor “Berkson”, so standard regression calibration methods do not apply. We decompose the health effect estimation error into three components. First, the standard errors are too small if the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> is correlated, independent of variability in estimating the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> parameters. Second, the standard errors are too small because they do not account for variability in estimating the <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> parameters. Third, there is a bias from using approximate <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> parameters in place of the unobserved true ones. We outline a three-stage correction procedure to account separately for each of these errors. A key insight is that we can account for {{the second part of the}} error (sampling variability in estimating the exposure) by averaging over simulations from the part of the posterior exposure surface that is informative for the outcome. This amounts to averaging over samples of the posterior exposure model parameters, a procedure that we call “parameter simulation”. One implication is that it is preferable to use a parametric correlation model (e. g., kriging) rather than a semi-parametric approximation. While the latter approach has been found to be effective in estimating mean exposure fields, it does not provide the needed decomposition of the posterior into informative and non-informative components. We illustrate the properties of our corrected estimators in a simulation study and present an example from environmental statistics. The focus of this paper is on linear health effect models with uncorrelated outcomes, but extensions to generalized linear models and correlated outcomes are possible...|$|E

The study is accomplished by using a technique combining the uniform asymptotic theory of diffraction and the finite-difference time-domain method, suitable to characterize human exposure in realistic urban environments at a reasonable computational cost. The different exposure conditions examined are analyzed to highlight the problems related to compliance assessment procedures in complex exposure scenarios and to suggest some possible solutions. A comparison of the results obtained in these scenarios with those computed neglecting {{the presence of the}} room walls (free-space situations) evidences that, under certain conditions, average <b>exposure</b> <b>field</b> levels and specific absorption rates (SARs) in the realistic environments can be higher than in free space, thus demonstrating that compliance assessment carried out in free space can yield nonconservative results. As concerns implications of field nonuniformities, typical of realistic urban environments, on SAR values, the results show that the whole-body averaged SAR is related to the average field value, provided the averaging procedure is appropriately chosen to cover all the volume occupied by the subject (V(S)) and not only a vertical surface. Local SAR values, instead, show a more complex relation with the <b>exposure</b> <b>field,</b> such that considering only the V(S) -averaged field value for compliance assessment might lead to an underestimation of the real exposure level, while using the peak of the field in V(S) leads to a remarkable overestimation...|$|E

The component resulting from secondary internally scattered radiation is much smaller in magnitude than the external and primary internal scatter radiation. The primary internal scatter radiation can be seen as independent of the thickness of lead used for shielding [66].

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to characterize the distribution, variability and determinants of exposures to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields in environments where no information was previously available, and to advance the methodology of exposure estimation. The thesis {{is divided into three}} related papers. The first paper reports a study of personal ELF <b>field</b> <b>exposure</b> measurements of 465 randomly selected workers in an electrical utility. By job category, arithmetic mean magnetic <b>field</b> <b>exposures</b> ranged from 0. 09 to 2. 36 $ mu$T (electric fields: 2. 5 to 400 V/m). ELF magnetic <b>field</b> <b>exposures</b> were highest for substation workers, hydroelectric generating station operators and cable splicers; electric fields were highest for forestry workers, equipment electricians and distribution linemen. Most alternative indices of exposure were highly correlated with the arithmetic or the geometric means (r $ ge$ 0. 8). Job category explained half of the total variance in logarithms of weekly magnetic and electric field means. The second paper reports a method developed to estimate past ELF <b>field</b> <b>exposures</b> of the electric utility workers. The present intensities and durations of exposures for tasks were measured, then separately extrapolated to the past based on information from interviews with long-service personnel at the utility. From reconstructed time weighted average (TWA) <b>exposures,</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> were estimated to have increased most over time for substation and distribution-line jobs; the increase for electric fields was less than for magnetic. The method is applicable to other exposures where monitoring records allow calculation of the intensity and duration of exposures for tasks and estimates of past intensities and durations of exposures for these tasks can be obtained. In the third paper, the methodology developed in the occupational setting was applied to a study of personal <b>exposures</b> to ELF <b>fields</b> among 365 randomly selected Canadian children. Overall, the arithmetic mean total magnetic field was 0. 121 $ mu$T (electric field: 14. 4 V/m), with magnetic fields highest in Quebec and lowest in Alberta. Magnetic fields were highest at home during the day. Measurements were at their lowest at night but provided the highest correlation with total magnetic <b>field</b> <b>exposure</b> (r =. 91).
