50|$|The current {{prospects}} {{for economic growth}} in Mexicali rely on <b>in-bond</b> and <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> (maquiladoras), which come due to low wages and loose worker right laws, include companies like, Selther, Daewoo, Mitsubishi, Honeywell, Paccar, Vitro, Skyworks Solutions, CareFusion, Bosch, Price Pfister, Gulfstream, United Technologies Corporation, Kenworth and Kwikset.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{international}} management has, until recently, largely ignored how {{human resources management}} (HRM) systems in overseas subsidiaries are designed and how design impacts performance. In addition, {{there is virtually no}} research comparing the HRM systems in Japanese and Western affiliates. In an attempt to begin to address this important issue, this chapter presents the results of a study of Japanese and American maquiladoras (<b>in-bond</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>plants)</b> in Mexico. This chapter examines the relative influence of parent company strategy, strategic role of the affiliate, parent company administrative heritage, and host country environment on the HRM systems in eight maquiladoras, four Japanese and four American, located in Tijuana, Mexico. Using a contingency framework, this chapter also describes the fits between each maquiladora's HRM system and its internal and external environments. Finally, it identifies the resulting impact of these fits on performance, both at the individual employee and affiliate levels...|$|R
40|$|The Mexican <b>in-bond</b> <b>assembly,</b> or {{maquiladora}} manufacturing sector, {{has taken}} {{its fair share of}} lumps in recent years. Collectively, such obstacles have contributed to periodic employment declines in this industry. A major factor at the turn of this century was ongoing de-regulation of the Chinese economy during a multi-year period of congressional gridlock in Mexico City. In general, predictions of the demise of the maquiladora industry in Mexico {{have turned out to be}} premature. However, this industry remains hampered by excessive red tape and fiscal uncertainty. Unfortunately, these facotrs also cause the Mexican economy as a whole to perform at less than full capcity. ...|$|R
