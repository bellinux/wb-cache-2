Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we {{know who they are}} and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

50|$|According to co {{director}} Joey Figueroa:Usually a lot {{of people}} will do a biog documentary and they don't have their subject fully on board. We had John Milius on board from the get-go.

And, obviously, if you've seen the film, you know what happens, so that changed the entire dynamic of how this documentary got made. Originally Milius was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be our driving force in this picture and that totally got derailed. And we had to find this voice now, because we have to hear him speak, obviously.

5000|$|OK, {{sit down}} and pay attention. We're only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> once. William Gibson, National Public Radio, December 9, 1992. The work was premiered on December 9, 1992, at The Kitchen, an art space in Greenwich Village, New York City. The performance—known as [...] "The Transmission"—consisted of the public {{incomplete}} reading of the poem by illusionist Penn Jillette, recorded and simultaneously transmitted to several other cities. The poem was inscribed on a sculptural magnetic disk which had been vacuum-sealed until the event's commencement, and was reportedly (although not actually) programmed to erase itself upon exposure to air. Contrary to numerous colourful reports, neither this disk nor the diskettes embedded in the artist's book were ever actually hacked in any strict sense.|$|E
5000|$|The {{movie was}} shot in Louisiana over 55 days in the Caddo Lake area outside Shreveport. Hill:We were very aware that {{people were going to}} see it as a metaphor for Vietnam.

The song [...] "Parlez Nous à Boire," [...] sung during the scene in the Cajun village {{at the end of the}} film, was performed by Cajun musician Dewey Balfa. The film includes many actors, including Fred Ward and Peter Coyote, who had one of their first big roles here.|$|E

5000|$|Despite Bukhaidze’s {{failure to}} {{identify}} Oleg Melnikov, a statement made by Girgvliani's girlfriend, Tamar Maisuradze, hinted at Melnikov's possible involvement. She claimed that Melnikov left the café, under the pretext {{to buy a}} cigarette, immediately after Bukhaidze and Girgvliani went out. He allegedly returned only after around 40 minutes, with Maisuradze <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> was {{explained by the fact}} that he had travelled to a distant supermarket after being unable to buy the cigarettes he wanted at a nearby shop.

5000|$|Some {{criticism}} {{was directed at}} the relative shortness of the game's campaign and rather abrupt concluding moments, with GameSpot stating that [...] "such brevity and a dissatisfying conclusion might be more forgivable if a third Penumbra was on the way, but this sudden finale is a bit annoying given {{that this is the}} end of the line for the series." [...] Adventure Gamers also commented on the game's length, commenting that many [...] "will not relish how short it is", although <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> [...] "isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as a certain momentum is maintained throughout, but may give those considering paying in full pause for thought." ...|$|R

[...] Four days later he also said, [...] "There is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship, or any other kind of improper relationship." [...] Clinton then appeared on national television on January 26 and stated: [...] "Listen to me, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." [...] However, after it was revealed that investigators had obtained a semen-stained dress as well as testimony from Lewinsky, Clinton changed tactics and admitted that an improper relationship with Lewinsky had taken place: [...] "Indeed I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible."Faced with overwhelming evidence, he apologized to the nation, agreed to pay a $25,000 court fine, settled his sexual harassment lawsuit with Paula Jones for $850,000 and was temporarily disbarred, for a period of five years, from practicing law in Arkansas and before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was not tried for perjury in a court. However, he did admit to [...] "testifying falsely" [...] in a carefully worded statement as part of a deal to avoid indictment for perjury.|$|E

Bigeard stated in his defense that Ighilahriz's claim she had been tortured by him was part of a [...] "network of lies - destroying everything that remains decent in France", waged by the same left-wing intellectuals whom Bigeard blamed for undermining the French will to win in Algeria. Bigeard always denied having engaged in torture himself, but he also maintained that the use of torture against the FLN had been a [...] "necessary evil". The Canadian historian Barnett Singer came to Bigeard's defense, writing that Ighilahriz was a terrorist whose account was full of [...] "fabrications" [...] and Bigeard was off hunting the FLN in the bled at the time she was held by the 10th Parachute Division in late 1957.|$|E

The talk will have three parts, two of which are related, and the other being directly related to the other two only in that it talks about nonholonomic mechanics.

This is then necessarily restricted to systems with simple Lagrangians (i. e., kinetic energy minus potential energy), and constraints which are linear in the velocities. The two related parts of the talk, about the Gibbs-Appell equations and nonlinear variational principles, deal with a more general class of systems...|$|R
