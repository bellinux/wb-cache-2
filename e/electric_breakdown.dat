50|$|The crux of this device, {{invented by}} NKF in Delft in 1964, {{is that the}} bore of the elastic body is {{narrower}} than {{the diameter of the}} cable. In this way the (blue) interface between cable and stress-cone is brought under mechanical pressure, so that no cavities or air-pockets can be formed between cable and cone. <b>Electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> in this region is prevented in this way.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, the {{explanations}} for the light emission have favored electrical discharges. The first ideas have been about the charge separation in cavitation bubbles, which {{have been seen as}} spherical capacitors with charges at the center and the wall. At the collapse, the capacitance decreases and voltage increases until <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> occurs. A further suggestion was a charge separation by enhancing charge fluctuations on the bubble wall, however, a breakdown should take place during the expansion phase of the bubble dynamics. These discharge theories have to assume that the emitting bubble undergoes an asymmetric collapse, because a symmetric charge distribution cannot radiate light.|$|E

From the kinetic () -curves, the breakdown voltage () values are estimated, {{as well as}} the frequency and amplitude of oscillations of formation voltage () at different current densities. The surface of the aluminum specimens was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Data on topography and surface roughness parameters of the electrode after <b>electric</b> <b>breakdowns</b> are obtained as a function of anodization time. The electrode surface of anodic films, formed with different current densities until the same charge density has passed (2. 5 [*]C[*]cm− 2), was assessed. Results are discussed on the basis of perceptions of avalanche mechanism of the breakdown phenomena, due to the injection of electrons and their multiplication in the volume of the film...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper will}} be {{discussed}} the issue of non-destructive testing of silicon solar cells structure. The fabricated devices generally exhibit lots of different imperfections that limit the ability to apply new composite materials and technological approaches. We demonstrate high sensitive electrical noise measurement philosophy with strictly non-destructive character {{in order to identify}} defects physical nature. Main parameters in the view are excess leakage current and electric noise, live-time and reliability reduction and finally decreasing of conversion efficiency. Here will be presented relations between the specimen transport characteristic and electric noise generated in consequence of the local <b>electric</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in the affected regions. In addition, we are able to show that fracture-based defects are attended by the low intensity light emission especially in visible and deep infrared wavelength range. Nevertheless, optical activity physical nature is in a question. For this reason we will present also measurement of optical spectra radiation and optical intensity vs. voltage bias and temperature to introduce different defect phenomena interpretation...|$|R

Without such a construction the electric field will concentrate {{at the end of}} the earth-conductor as shown in figure 2.Equipotential lines are shown here which can be compared with the contour lines on a map of a mountainous region: the nearer these lines are to each other, the steeper the slope and the greater the danger, in this case the danger of an <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown.</b> The equipotential lines can also be compared with the isobars on a weather map: the denser the lines, the more wind and the greater the danger of damage.|$|E
5000|$|At {{one point}} a small slice {{is cut out}} of the center conductor, {{therefore}} a capacitor is formed and low frequencies are blocked. This kind of capacitor has the advantage that it is nearly invisible to higher frequencies. To pass frequencies down to 1 MHz the capacitance has to be increased. A dielectric like NPO multiplies the capacitance by a factor of 65. The thickness of the capacitor has to be minimal without leading to <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> in the dielectric, this means to avoid any peaks in the electric field and this means smooth electrodes with rounded edges and a dielectric protruding between the electrodes (doorknob design). A stack of capacitors can be used, but every capacitor needs access {{to the surface of the}} inner conductor, because if it's hidden behind another capacitor the high frequencies won't see it, because the electric field needs a lot of time to travel through a dielectric with a high dielectric constant ...|$|E
50|$|A {{lightning}} channel {{with all its}} branches and its electric currents behaves like a huge antenna system from which electromagnetic waves of all frequencies are radiated. Beyond a distance where luminosity is visible and thunder can be heard (typically about 10 km), these electromagnetic impulses are the only sources of direct information about thunderstorm activity on the ground. Transients electric currents during return strokes (R strokes) or intracloud strokes (K strokes) are the main sources for the generation of impulse-type electromagnetic radiation known as sferics (sometimes called atmospherics). While this impulsive radiation dominates at frequencies less than about 100 kHz, (loosely called long waves), a continuous noise component becomes increasingly important at higher frequencies. The longwave electromagnetic propagation of sferics takes place within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide between the Earth's surface and the ionospheric D- and E- layers. Whistlers generated by lightning strokes can propagate into the magnetosphere along the geomagnetic lines of force. Finally, upper atmospheric lightning or sprites, that occur at mesospheric altitudes, are short-lived <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> phenomena, probably generated by giant lightning events on the ground.|$|E
40|$|The steady {{increase}} of the know extrasolar planets broadens our knowledge {{and at the same}} time, reveals our lack of understanding. The habitability of a planet depends, amongst other things, on the exposure of the planetary surface to radiation, how clouds form and which effect clouds have on the composition and on the electric state of the gas from which they form. We have studied the formation of mineral clouds (Fig. 1) on planetary atmospheres using a kinetic approach which allows us to predict the size distribution and material composition of the cloud particles. Using theses results we have investigated whether such clouds can be charged and under which conditions an <b>electric</b> field <b>breakdown</b> of the ambient gas, such as lightning or other transient luminous events, may occur. Our results suggest that different intra-cloud discharge processes dominate at different heights inside a cloud. We discuss the efficiency of <b>electric</b> field <b>breakdowns</b> and the electron enrichment (Fig. 2) to be expected in extrasolar atmospheres...|$|R

50|$|An {{electret}} is {{a stable}} dielectric material with a quasi-permanently embedded {{static electric charge}} (which, due to the high resistance of the material, will not decay for time periods of up to hundreds of years) and/or a quasi-permanently oriented dipole polarization. The name comes from electron (Greek word for amber) and magnet and was coined by Oliver Heaviside in 1885; drawing analogy {{to the formation of}} a magnet by alignment of magnetic domains in a piece of iron. Historically, electrets were made by first melting a suitable dielectric material such as a polymer or wax that contains polar molecules, and then allowing it to re-solidify in a powerful electrostatic field. The polar molecules of the dielectric align themselves to the direction of the electrostatic field, producing a dipole electret with a permanent electrostatic 'bias'. Modern electrets are usually made by embedding excess charges into a highly insulating dielectric, e.g. by means of an electron beam, a corona discharge, injection from an electron, <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> across a gap or a dielectric barrier, etc.|$|E

The JADA contributes procurement of dc- 1 MV ultra-high voltage (UHV) components such as a- 1 MV dc generator, a transmission line and a- 1 MV insulating transformer. The dc UHV insulation has been carefully analyzed since dc long pulse insulation {{is quite different}} from conventional ac insulation. Voltage sharing varies from capacitive distribution to resistive one during long pulse dc application. Electric field distribution for multi-layer (oil/paper composites) insulation structure of the transformer has been investigated for a long pulse dc up to 3600 s. The insulation structure has been designed and the overall dimensions of the dc UHV components have been finalized.

40|$|The {{presence}} of space charge {{will lead to}} distortion of electric field distribution within the dielectric material, resulting electric field enhancement in certain region of the dielectric. The electric field enhancement could cause material degradation, even premature failure. In this paper the simulation of charge dynamics in polyethylene based on the observed negative differential mobility {{has been carried out}} using the bipolar charge injection model. Assuming that the maximum electric field governs the breakdown event in the material, the simulation results show that the applied <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> strength is thickness dependent during a ramping breakdown test. The thickness dependent breakdown strength has been experimentally observed and widely reported in literatures but the mechanisms have never been fully explained. Our model indicates that the space charge formation and its movement within the material are responsible for the effect of sample thickness on <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown.</b> Accumulation of positive charge in the region near to the anode leads to a local high field, which may initiate the breakdown when it reaches the breakdown strength of the material. Our recent experimental observations of space charge dynamics up to breakdown in different thick samples strongly support the influence of space charge on <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{electrical}} power has consistently risen over time, {{whether it be}} to support the development and expansion of cities or because traditional approaches to societies solutions are being replaced by their electrical equivalent. The automotive industry is beginning to introduce more electric, greener vehicles. The aviation industry is also being challenged with the same issues. Whatever the motivation, this rising demand for power is always facilitated by employing higher and higher voltage levels. It is well understood that if the voltage is too high for a given air gap, <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> will occur. this effect is exacerbated by increases in altitude, resulting in constant challenges in aviation to satisfy the contradictory demands for smaller/lighter compact solutions against the biggest possible air gaps necessary to prevent <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown.</b> An experimental curve by Louis Karl Heinrich Friedrich Paschen was developed, which relates the voltage at which <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{would be expected to}} that of the product of gas pressure (p) and distance (d). The aviation industry does not use this curve directly as alternate guidance documents are used. These documents are extremely conservative, sometimes overly so, as will be seen in the thesis. Mathematical attempts have been provided to try and explain the Paschen curve, based on Townsend Primary and secondary ionisation. However, the variable 'pd' does not get explicitly linked and a type of mathematical fudge becomes incorporated. This thesis attempts to provide a theory of the minimum <b>electric</b> <b>breakdown</b> curve and fundamentally link he 'pd' product. by experimental validation of the theory, with the accepted standards included. A basis for challenging these standards may result and prevent potential over engineering in the future in this continually challenging environment. This theory will then go on to explain arc formation by providing a treatment to a paradox that occurs at the point of breakdown...|$|E
