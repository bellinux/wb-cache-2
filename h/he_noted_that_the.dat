5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{concurring opinion}} that {{argued that the}} Indian tribes have a {{stronger}} claim on inherent sovereign powers than do individual states. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Indian tribes governed themselves since before Columbus arrived, and that most states never governed themselves outside of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E

5|$|Although both Malaysia and Singapore {{had agreed}} to respect and accept the ICJ's decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking {{permission}} to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rules of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would {{wait to see what}} new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
5|$|In a World Tomorrow episode {{broadcast}} on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia {{not to sell}} arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain, and in July, shortly before Rajab's arrest, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made the struggle against the monarchy more difficult because US support, accompanied by the support, or silence, of the international community, was seen as giving the green light for repression and attacks on human rights defenders.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
2500|$|In 1576, {{the son of}} Johan Rantzau, Henrik Rantzau, {{also writes}} about {{the war and the}} fate of <b>the</b> flag. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flag was in a poor {{condition}} when returned.|$|R
50|$|Stefan Verkovich, folklorist from Bosnia, <b>noted</b> in 1889 <b>that</b> {{there were}} 28 Bulgarian houses in Krepeni. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land is fertile {{and the local}} people are engaged in farming and vineyards.|$|R
50|$|He then {{addressed}} what {{he regarded}} as more up-to-date papers, DC Thompson's tuppenny bloods. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stories were shorter and faster paced {{and tend to}} be dominated by a single figure.|$|R
5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> much higher tooth count and row of crests {{on top of the}} snout suggested otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the roughly}} eight parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a {{combination}} of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. Leguat stated that Newton's parakeet was abundant during his stay. It was still common when Tafforet visited in 1726, but when Alexandre Pingré mentioned it in 1761, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bird had become scarce. It was still present on southern islets off Rodrigues (Isle Gombrani), along with the Rodrigues parrot. After this point, much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for livestock.|$|E
5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants {{to move to the}} cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} first {{mentioned}} as Borovo in an Ottoman registry from the latter 15th/early 16th century, with 153 registered male inhabitants. The village {{has also been}} mentioned (as Borova) by the Austrian geologist Ami Boué, who visited the Balkans between 1836-1838. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way from Dospat to Kato Nevrokopi goes through Borova. <b>He</b> further <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> village has been visited earlier by the Frenchman Vikenel.|$|R
50|$|Christopher A. Born {{compliments}} {{the development}} of Narutos setting calling it a fun fictional pastiche. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hidden leaf villages represent, for <b>the</b> Japanese, places <b>that</b> are safe and protected against major threats.|$|R
50|$|In his memoirs, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Circus of Dr. Lao was {{conceived}} in Tientsin during 1929. After the Army, {{he worked as}} an editor for the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, Arizona from 1930 to 1970.|$|R
5|$|The ICJ's {{decision}} is final and {{not subject to}} appeal. Nevertheless, in June 2008 Rais Yatim stated that Malaysia had renewed its search for the letter written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rules of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced.

5|$|Croatia {{suffered}} heavy {{military and}} civilian casualties. The Croatian side initially reported 1,798 killed in the siege, both soldiers and civilians. Croatian general Anton Tus later stated that about 1,100 Croatian soldiers were killed, and 2,600 soldiers and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek, according to Tus. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fighting was so intense that losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties from that year. According to figures published in 2006 by the Croatian Ministry of Defence, 879 Croatian soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000 to 5,000 dead across eastern Slavonia. The 204th Vukovar Brigade lost over 60 percent of its strength in the battle. Croatian officials have given figures of 2,000 killed, 800 missing, 3,000 taken prisoner and 42,852 made refugees in eastern Slavonia as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{published}} his findings in a 1906 {{volume of the}} Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, in which he drew comparisons between the site and two Cornish stone circles that he had recently surveyed, Fernacre and Stannon stone circle. He proffered {{the suggestion that the}} circle had been the site of cremations, with the cremated human remains then being buried within the nearby tumuli. In August 1909, Gray returned to the site {{for the first time in}} nine years. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the ling and whortleberry bushes around the site were more stunted than they had previously been.|$|E
50|$|Jebb mostly follows Strabo in his analysis. Accordingly, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Selloi, {{the prophets}} of Zeus, were also called tomouroi, which name derived from Mount Tomares. Tomouroi {{was also a}} variant reading found in the Odyssey.|$|R
50|$|Stefan M. Audrey {{describes}} the Japanese Red Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) {{as the main}} left-wing terrorist organizations in Asia, although <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> LTTE later transformed into a nationalist terrorist organization.|$|R
5000|$|Most famously, Thornton then {{examines}} the function {{and impact of}} foreign currency exchanges on money. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> expansion of paper money in an economy causes a [...] "drain" [...] of gold out of a country.|$|R
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian was {{not called}} during the 1960–61 Australian season, but his {{performances}} were ineffective {{and he was}} repeatedly hampered by injuries. In particular, a strained achilles tendon restricted his speed and penetration, particularly in the lead-up to the opening Test. Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests, taking two wickets at 117.00 and scoring 12 runs at 6.00; {{he was unable to}} complete either match, sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures. These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three other Tests. During the summer, Meckiff's bowling was passed by Col Egar, who later ended his career. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> umpire had told him there was little point in changing his action.|$|E

The domain registrar changed the name server of the website without telling Eiland-Hall; after contacting the registrar, he was permitted to return to his original name server. In an interview with Gawker on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall remarked that Beck's attorneys contacted the registrar of the domain, his hosting provider, as well as the company which housed the servers for his website. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hosting provider informed him they would not cooperate with the requests from Beck's lawyers unless they received a court order.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu {{praised the}} gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those {{not used to}} action games, with further praise going to the control scheme. Computer and Video Games, reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera. The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level of challenge. In contrast, Fitch found combat repetitive, criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented {{when compared to other}} similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles. Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> normal melee combat lacked sophistication when compared to other titles available at the time. Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat repetitive. Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that repetitive enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience. Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available control scheme had advantages and drawbacks related to them. Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat repetitive and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} a swan, and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.|$|E
