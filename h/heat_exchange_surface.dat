50|$|A {{steam boiler}} evaporates liquid water to form steam, or gaseous water; and {{requires}} frequent replenishment of boiler feedwater for the continuous production of steam required by most boiler applications. Water is a capable solvent, and will dissolve {{small amounts of}} solids from piping and containers including the boiler. Continuing evaporation of steam concentrates dissolved impurities until they reach levels potentially damaging to steam production within the boiler. Without blowdown, impurities would reach saturation levels and begin to precipitate within the boiler. Impurity concentrations are highest where steam is being produced near <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Precipitation {{would be expected to}} occur in the form of scale deposits on those <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Scale deposits thermally insulate <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surfaces</b> initially decreasing the rate of steam generation, and potentially causing boiler metals to reach failure temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{urgency of}} theme is {{substantiated}} {{and the basic}} directions of studies are determined. Is substantiated the mechanism {{of the process of}} the concentration of liquid media by freezing moisture, that is determined in essence by the conditions for the migration of the molecules of water to the frontal surface of crystallization and their incorporation into the crystal structure of ice. It is shown that the regime of freezing moisture is characterized by the temperature of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surface,</b> which receives heat of crystallization of moisture, by the speeds of displacement and with the surface area of the contact of the being transferred heat media, by form and by the concentration of the dissolved substances of product. The process of heat exchange between the surface of crystallization and the workable technological medium is described.

An increase in the initial content of dry matter in the cherry juice at constant temperature of boiling refrigerant in the vaporizer of the freezing out installation nonlinearly reduces the specific quantity of ice, which was being formed on the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surface.</b> A change in the boiling point of refrigerant also causes a nonlinear increase in the specific quantity of ice, frozen out on the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surface.</b> The obtained curves of the rate of growth in the icy phase make it possible to isolate the sections of the crystallization of the moisture, which has different nature of connection with the solute.

Temperature differences may discourage establishment of thermophilic populations in intermittently operated facilities; and intentional short term temperature spikes may periodically kill less tolerant populations.

40|$|Recuperators {{are very}} useful heat {{exchangers}} that recover waste heat from products of combustion (poc) in a furnace stack {{and give them}} back to the heating operation in the form of preheated combustion air for the burners. Since part of the chemical energy in our purchased fuel must first be used to raise the air and fuel to flame temperature, the use of preheated air leaves more heat for transfer to the furnace load, or permits reduction of overall fuel consumption. Also, this heat-recycling affords a good relationship, time-wise, between the need for input and the availability of hot flue gases for air preheating. Unlike the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surface</b> of waste heat boilers, however, recuperators re gas-to-gas heat exchangers that can overheat and develop hot spots because the only coolant to protect the heat exchanger material is the air being heated. Air is a good insulator and therefore a poor coolant; whereas the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surface</b> of a waste heat boiler is backed by a good coolant-water-with a high latent heat, making it very forgiving. The flow of air coolant through a recuperator diminishes as the burner input is turned down to lower firing rates. But, the furnace temperature, and therefore the flue gas temperature, stays at about the same level. Although the flow of hot poc is reduced, the net effect is that <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>surface</b> temperature rises, often above the limit of its materials.
