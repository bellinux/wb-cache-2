40|$|Action-at-a-distance electrodynamics - {{alternative}} approach to field theory - {{can be extended}} to cosmological models using conformal symmetry. An advantage {{of this is that}} the origin of arrow of time in electromagnetism {{can be attributed to the}} cosmological structure. Different cosmological models can be investigated, based on Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory, and only those models can be considered viable for our universe which have net <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> electromagnetic interactions i. e. forward direction of time. This work evaluates quasi-steady-state model and demonstrates that it admits <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> and not advanced solution. Thus QSSC satisfies this necessary condition for a correct cosmological model, based on action-at-a-distance formulation.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory for charge and spin current between two canted {{magnetic}} leads flowing through a quantum dot with an arbitrary local interaction. For a noncollinear magnetic configuration, we calculate equilibrium and nonequilibrium current biased by voltage or temperature difference or pumped by magnetic dynamics. We {{are able to}} explicitly separate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium contributions to the current, both {{of which can be}} written in terms of the <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> Green's function on the dot. Taking the specific example of a single-level quantum dot with a large on-site Coulomb interaction, we calculate the total spin current near the Kondo regime, which we find to be generally enhanced in magnitude as compared to the noninteracting case.

40|$|We compute numerically the <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> Green's {{functions}} for conserved currents in the shear channel of a (2 + 1) -dimensional field theory at non-zero temperature and density. This theory {{is assumed to}} be holographically dual to a non-extremal, electric Reissner-Nordstr AdS 4 black hole with planar horizon. Using the holographic description we obtain results for arbitrary frequencies and momenta and survey the detailed structure of these correlators. In particular, we demonstrate the `repulsion' and `clover-leaf crossing' of their poles and stress the importance of the residues at the poles beyond the hydrodynamic regime. As a consistency check, we show that our results agree precisely with existing literature for the appropriate quasinormal frequencies of the bulk theory. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|We {{present a}} new, simple method for calculating the scalar, electromagnetic, and {{gravitational}} self forces acting on particles {{in orbit around}} a Kerr black hole. The standard ``mode-sum regularization'' approach for self-force calculations relies on a decomposition of the <b>full</b> (<b>retarded)</b> perturbation field into multipole modes, followed by {{the application of a}} certain mode-by-mode regularization procedure. In recent years several groups have developed numerical codes for calculating black hole perturbations directly in 2 + 1 dimensions (i. e., decomposing the azimuthal dependence into $m$-modes, but refraining from a full multipole decomposition). Here we formulate a practical scheme for constructing the self force directly from the 2 + 1 -dimensional $m$-modes. While the standard mode-sum method is serving well in calculations of the self force in Schwarzschild geometry, the new scheme should allow a more efficient treatment of the Kerr problem.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the bulk motion of a {{classical}} extended charge in flat spacetime. A formalism developed by W. G. Dixon {{is used to}} study how the details of such a particle's internal structure influence its equations of motion. We place essentially no restrictions (other than boundedness) on {{the shape of the}} charge, and allow for inhomogeneity, internal currents, elasticity, and spin. Assuming that the particle interacts with its <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> self-field, many of these systems are found to be affected by large self-force and self-torque effects beyond the standard Lorentz-Dirac one. These are particularly significant when the particle's charge and current densities become comparable to each other (in the center-of-mass frame). If one instead assumes that charges can only interact with their radiative self-field, then the Lorentz-Dirac equation is found to be generic whenever the dipole moment and spin are sufficiently small...|$|R

The <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> {{electromagnetic}} force experienced by swift electrons moving parallel to planar boundaries is revisited, for both metallic and dielectric targets, with special emphasis on the consequences in electron microscopy experiments. The focus is placed on the sign of the transverse force experienced by the electron beam as a function of the impact parameter. For point probes, the force is found to be always attractive. The contribution of the induced magnetic field and the causality requirements of the target dielectric response, given by the Kramers-Kronig (K-K) relations, prove to be crucial issues at small impact parameters. For spatially extended probes, repulsive forces are predicted for close trajectories, in agreement with previous works. The force experienced by the target is also explored, with the finding that in insulators, the momentum associated to Cherenkov radiation (CR) is relevant at large impact parameters. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the bulk motion of a {{classical}} extended charge in flat spacetime. A formalism developed by W. G.

We place essentially no restrictions (other than boundedness) on the shape of the charge, and allow for inhomogeneity, internal currents, elasticity, and spin. Even if the angular momentum remains small, many such systems are found to be affected by large self-interaction effects beyond the standard Lorentz-Dirac force. These are particularly significant if the particle's charge density fails to be much greater than its 3 -current density (or vice versa) in the center-of-mass frame. Additional terms also arise in the equations of motion if the dipole moment is too large, and when the `center-of-electromagnetic mass' is far from the `center-of-bare mass' (roughly speaking). These conditions are often quite restrictive. General equations of motion were also derived under the assumption that the particle can only interact with the radiative component of its self-field. These are much simpler than the equations derived using the <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> self-field; as are the conditions required to recover the Lorentz-Dirac equation.

40|$|The main text is {{presented}} in four parts. In chapter 2, we develop a phenomenological theory of voltage induced torques in magnetic tunnel junctions. The reciprocal of this effect and spin-transfer torque can pump charge into an attached circuit when the magnet precesses. We calculate the resulting change in impedances due to this pumping {{as a function of}} applied magnetic field and thickness of tunneling spacer. Because the impedances due to voltage and current pumping are qualitatively distinct under variation of the magnetic field, we suggest that this measurement could be used as experimental differentiation between these effects. In chapter 3 we study magnetic Josephson junctions wherein spin polarized Ohmic and supercurrent exert a torque on the magnetic layer. As a result, there is a nonlinear dynamic interplay between the magnetic order parameter and the phase of the superconducting parameter. This results in a modified stability diagram for both the magnet and superconductor. In particular, we find a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical current on the applied magnetic field and current. When the temperature is raised above the superconducting critical temperature, the leads become metallic and the equations of motion coincide with those of chapter 3. In contrast to the monodomain models studied in other chapters, chapter 4 examines the effects of micromagnetics on the thermal stability of a typical MRAM bit. In addition to noting that a finite stiffness parasitically effects bit stability, we find that domain-wall nucleation and propagation is the dominant mode of thermal bit flipping. Finally, in chapter 5 we derive a nonequilibrium expression for spin current between two magnetic leads biased by voltage, temperature or spin. The interaction on the dot is left general and the equation for current can be written {{as a function of the}} <b>full</b> <b>retarded</b> Green's function on the dot. We apply this methodology to a dot with large on-site Coulomb interaction...|$|R

We have studied women in families ascertained because of a mentally <b>retarded</b> <b>full</b> mutation relative and determined their age of menopause, serum hormone levels in premenopausal individuals and the outcome of any pregnancies. Survival analysis was used as a measure of menopause and demonstrated a significant decrease in age of menopause in premutation carriers compared with their full mutation carrier and normal relatives. Serum FSH was also raised in premutation carriers, although oestradiol, inhibin A and inhibin B were not significantly different. However, we did not find an excess of dizygous twins or pregnancy loss/trisomies, both of which are associated with aging ovaries.

40|$|We {{present data}} on 4 mentally retarded brothers, 2 {{of whom were}} dizygotic twins with {{congenital}} hypotonia, constipation, head size disproportionately large for length or height, and a combination of minor anomalies suggestive of FG syndrome. These brothers have a mentally <b>retarded</b> <b>full</b> sister with similar minor anomalies and an older half-brother with the Martin-Bell syndrome. The mother is mentally retarded; 4 of 7 individuals are positive for fragile X, but all have a CGG expansion ranging from 0. 2 - 2 to 4 kb. Although the phenotype is not completely typical of the FG syndrome and the coincidence of the FMR 1 mutation and segregation of the MCA/MR phenotype are highly unlikely, the FMR 1 mutation may affect morphogenesis more extensively and differently than the Martin-Bell syndrome does to effect an FG syndromelike phenotype in certain families.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{humidity}} {{on the film}} stability of Bovine Lipid Extract Surfactant (BLES) is studied using the captive bubble method. It is found that adsorbed BLES films show distinctly different stability patterns at two extreme relative humidities (RHs), i. e., bubbles formed by ambient air and by air prehumidified to 100 % RH at 37 °C. The differences are illustrated by the ability to maintain low surface tensions at various compression ratios, the behavior of bubble clicks, and film compressibility. These results suggest that 100 % RH at 37 °C tends to destabilize the BLES films. In turn, the experimental {{results indicate that the}} rapidly adsorbed BLES film on a captive bubble presents a barrier to water transport that <b>retards</b> <b>full</b> humidification of the bubble when ambient air is used for bubble formation. These findings necessitate careful evaluation and maintenance of environmental humidity for all in vitro assessment of lung surfactants. It is also found that the stability of adsorbed bovine natural lung surfactant (NLS) films is not as sensitive as BLES films to high humidity. This may indicate a physiological function of SP-A and/or cholesterol, which are absent in BLES, in maintaining the extraordinary film stability in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Increased histone {{acetylation}} {{has been}} correlated with increased transcription, and regions of heterochromatin are generally hypoacetylated. In investigating the cause-and-effect relationship between histone acetylation and gene activity, we have characterized two yeast histone deacetylase complexes. Histone deacetylase-A (HDA) is an ≈ 350 -kDa complex {{that is highly}} sensitive to the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Histone deacetylase-B (HDB) is an ≈ 600 -kDa complex that is much less sensitive to trichostatin A. The HDA 1 protein (a subunit of the HDA activity) shares sequence similarity to RPD 3, a factor required for optimal transcription of certain yeast genes. RPD 3 {{is associated with the}} HDB activity. HDA 1 also shares similarity to three new open reading frames in yeast, designated HOS 1, HOS 2, and HOS 3. We find that both hda 1 and rpd 3 deletions increase acetylation levels in vivo at all sites examined in both core histones H 3 and H 4, with rpd 3 deletions having a greater impact on histone H 4 lysine positions 5 and 12. Surprisingly, both hda 1 and rpd 3 deletions increase repression at telomeric loci, which resemble heterochromatin with rpd 3 having a greater effect. In addition, rpd 3 deletions <b>retard</b> <b>full</b> induction of the PHO 5 promoter fused to the reporter lacZ.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} the {{transformation}} in research methods which occurred in a large U. S. pharmaceutical firm {{as a result of the}} biotech revolution. This transformation is inconsistent with the hypothesis that technological revolutions make existing firms obsolete and consistent with our wealth-maximization hypothesis that valuable assets (like delivery know-how) will not be wasted if technological change in part of the organization is necessary to remain competitiveness. While the transformation was achieved through a various methods, the primary route was hiring new personnel who had the new technology and incorporating them into the existing structure. While the technological transformation has been profound, biotechnology applications in this large incumbent firm are more likely to be combined with other techno- logies than in the new biotechnology firms (NBFs) which use biotechnology for both discovery and production of new therapeutic entities. This difference in emphasis may result in value-enhancing synergies because of the related knowledge which makes for more effective applications of the new technologies, but it could <b>retard</b> <b>full</b> adoption of biotechnology. It appears that this firm was somewhat slower than the dedicated biotech firms to adopt the new techno- ogy, but once the decision was made to transform the technological identity of the firm massive resources were provided to recruit the human capital required to make it happen. The incumbent firms were slow to adopt biotechnology, but made great strides in the 1980 s in increasing their share of all commercial ties to the star scientists as well as their share of patents. ...|$|R
