It can support the optimization of the AO, GLAO and MCAO systems running at the focus of the ground-based telescopes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Geologic CO₂ {{sequestration}} is {{a climate}} change mitigation strategy that prevents CO₂ emissions to the atmosphere by capturing CO₂ gasses from large point source emissions streams and then pressurizing and pumping the supercritical-state CO₂ into underground geologic storage reservoirs. Once underground, CO₂ is prevented from buoyant migration to the surface by various trapping mechanisms, {{one of which is}} capillary trapping. Capillary trapping is a secure trapping mechanism that immobilizes CO₂ on relatively short timescales; accurate prediction and optimization of capillary trapping of CO₂ is crucial to ensure the safety and success of a sequestration operation.

The experiments {{show that in}} a model with no endogeniety the pooled ols estimator of the I(1) regressor is sqr(n) T consisten and asymptotically normal and the estimator of the I(0) regressor is sqr(NT) consistent and asymptotically normal. If a correlation between the I(1) regressor and the regression disturbance is introduced,both estimators are inconsistent fro small n but sqr(nT) consistent and asymptotically normal for large n amd T. When an individual random effect {{is added to the}} basic model the results for the I(0) regressor coefficient do not alter,whereas the estimator of the I(1) regressor loses in efficiency and becomes sqr(NT) consistent and asymptotically normal. ...|$|R

However there may be adverse consequences for student and demonstrator privacy. This paper presents a distributed marks-collection system we have built. It captures marks in situ in the laboratory from about 650 students enrolled over two units. The web-based system, constructed using the Teachers' and Learners' Collaborascope software, has proved highly robust. We also <b>d</b> iscuss our <b>investigations</b> into privacy concerns.
