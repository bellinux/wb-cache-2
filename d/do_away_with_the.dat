5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} {{of the strength of}} his position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him of the need to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Manuel Azaña Díaz and Indalecio Prieto {{worked to}} unify the left and combat its extreme {{elements}} in {{what would become the}} Popular Front; this included staging of large, popular rallies,. Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after two significant scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, president Niceto Alcalá Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, and called elections. Zamora had become disenchanted with Robles's obvious desire to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> republic and establish a corporate state, and his air of pride. He was looking to strengthen a new center party in place of the Radicals, but the election system did not favour this. Manuel Portela Valladares was thus chosen to form a caretaker government in the meantime. The Republic had, as its opponents pointed out, faced twenty-six separate government crises. Portela failed to get the required support in the parliament to rule as a majority. The government was dissolved on 4 January; the date for elections would be 16 February.|$|E

5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that {{by the time it was}} to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Acosta ran for sheriff of Los Angeles County against Peter J. Pitchess, and {{received}} more than 100,000 votes. During the campaign, he was jailed for two days for contempt of court.

25|$|Since this {{provision}} {{went into effect}} in late 1998, all the Presidents serving in office during this period have determined moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front.

In response, members of Congress have begun to include language to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> President's exclusivity in making the determinations or flat-out remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.|$|E

25|$|During this war, {{the area}} was mostly {{sympathetic}} the Liberation Army of the South as was the rest of Guerrero; however, fighting was mostly done in the state’s central valleys. The major effect {{of the war was}} the redistribution of land and the institution of the ejido system afterwards, with the aim of giving “campesinos” (peasant farmers) lands that could not be taken away from them. However, their formation did not <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old caciques, which still exerted considerable influence. One example of this was Silvestre Mariscal, who controlled the municipality of Atoyac starting in 1914.|$|E
25|$|Houston's Indian {{policy was}} to disband the vast {{majority}} of the regular Army troops, but muster four new companies of Rangers to patrol the frontier. Houston ordered the Rangers to protect the Indian lands from encroachment by settlers and illegal traders.

Under Houston's policies, Texas Rangers were authorized to punish severely any infractions by the Indians, but they were never to initiate such conflict. When depredations occurred to either side, the troops were ordered to find and punish the actual perpetrators, rather than retaliating against innocent Indians simply because they were Indians.|$|E
25|$|Anna is {{featured}} as Nina's sub-boss {{in the original}} Tekken game and did not become a playable character until the console version of the game.

In Tekken 5 her sub-boss is Lee Chaolan, and she is also a sub-boss for Craig Marduk. She is also the final boss of Death by Degrees.

When BEST decided to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> double-deckers for operational reasons recently, public protests and sentiment forced it to continue with the service. A move to colour all its buses saffron from red in 1997 also drew in criticism, resulting in the red colour being retained. Bus drivers and conductors have come in for praise in the media for their service during the 2005 Mumbai floods, when they ensured that all the stranded passengers were dropped safely to their respective destinations. A total of 900 buses were damaged.|$|E
25|$|Following November 1919 elections, Iorga {{became a}} member of the Senate, {{representing}} the Democratic Nationalists. Although he resented the universal male suffrage and viewed the adoption of electoral symbols as promoting political illiteracy, his PND came to use a logo representing two hands grasping (later replaced with a black-flag-and-sickle). The elections seemed to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old political system: Iorga's party was third, trailing behind two newcomers, the Transylvanian PNR and the Poporanist Peasants' Party (PȚ), with whom it formed a parliamentary bloc supporting an Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet. This union of former rivals also showed Iorga's growing suspicion of Brătianu, whom he feared intended to absorb the PND into the National Liberal Party, and accused of creating a political machine. He and his disciples were circulating the term politicianism ("politicking"), expressing their disappointment for the new political context.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s {{there were}} tighter {{restrictions}} on road steam haulage, including speed, smoke and vapour limits and a 'wetted tax', where the tax due was {{proportional to the}} size of the wetted area of the boiler; this made steam engines less competitive against domestically produced internal combustion engined units (although imports were subject to taxes of up to 33%). As a result of the Salter Report on road funding, an 'axle weight tax' was introduced in 1933 in order to charge commercial motor vehicles more for the costs of maintaining the road system and to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> perception that the free use of roads was subsidising the competitors of rail freight. The tax was payable by all road hauliers in proportion to the axle load and was particularly restrictive on steam propulsion, which was heavier than its petrol equivalent.|$|E

25|$|Hard {{felt hats}} {{are made by}} {{specialised}} craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița {{and may have been}} introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide brimmed hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and felt hats with broad brims up to 60cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. Hats with 40cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and Muntenia. Felt hats with hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry. Wide brimmed felt hats with a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear felt hats with very small brims, the present day fashion tending to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brim altogether.|$|E

500|$|By June 1971, some Democratic {{senators}} {{opposed to}} the war wanted to limit the renewal to a one-year extension, while others wanted to end it immediately; Gravel reiterated {{that he was one}} of the latter, saying, [...] "It's a senseless war, and one way to do away with it is to <b>do</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> draft." [...] A Senate vote on June 4 indicated majority support for the two-year extension. On June 18 Gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation, defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation. The first filibuster attempt failed on June 23 when, by three votes, the Senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since 1927.|$|E
