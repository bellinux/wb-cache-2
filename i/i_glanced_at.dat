2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Mabane. His {{confirmation}} {{was swift}} and decisive.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Lady Angela. She {{was looking}} white and troubled.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> this {{question}} rather {{to express a}} detachment than a view.|$|R
6000|$|... "We rather thought," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> Richard and Ada, who entreated me {{with their}} eyes to speak, [...] "that perhaps {{she was a little}} unmindful of her home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have an {{impending}} engagement," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office, [...] "that renders me rather uncertain of my time. At once, I think." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Sir Henry. He, too, had {{coloured}} {{up to the}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the latter}} deferentially {{as he stood}} looking out of window.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him, {{surprised}} at the question. He {{was staring at the}} English shore.|$|E
6000|$|So we met and passed, <b>I</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> them idly {{and guiding}} my horses {{to the side}} of the road. When there were perhaps ten yards between us I heard Lady Blanche cry: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} here, is {{modestly}} brooding behind a damp apron pendent from a clothes-line. As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> him <b>I</b> become--but I don't know why--vaguely reminded of Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth, and Dover. When we get out, my respected fellow-constable Sharpeye, addressing Mr. Superintendent, says: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> across <b>at</b> the girl. She was {{watching}} her uncle with distressed face.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the figure}} of our {{commander}} in the boat ahead, and took courage.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Major Colfax, but for {{the life}} of me I could make nothing of his look.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the paper}} with open pleasure, but the other checked me as I began to speak.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> around <b>at</b> {{the little}} army of {{servants}} moving noiselessly about on all sides.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> appealingly <b>at</b> the judge. He was adamant. 'Answer as counsel directs you, witness,' he said, sternly.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> said (<b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> Joe, {{who stood}} looking on, motionless), that I {{supposed}} I could come directly.|$|R
60|$|She {{said this}} with such great {{significance}} that Ada and <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> one another, foreseeing something more.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{a thought}} struck me. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the clock in}} my study. It wanted ten minutes of twelve.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the serene}} face looking upward, {{and thought it}} was the stars that made it seem so noble.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> jealously <b>at</b> Mary Cavendish, but {{she seemed}} quite undisturbed, the {{delicate}} pallor of her cheeks did not vary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>glancing</b> up <b>at</b> my companion, [...] "that {{was surely}} the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?" ...|$|R
40|$|I have {{discussed}} the four methods of ancient philosophy namely demonstration, division, resolution, and composition. But first, <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> logic, which "discovers the principles of medical treatment". Method in pathology discovers "the affected parts of the body" and nosology, "the symptoms of diseases and their causes". In therapeutics, method "discovers drugs appropiate to specific diseases". The leader in all things pertaining to method is Hippocrates...|$|R
60|$|As {{the drag}} drew {{up in the}} {{enclosure}} near the grand stand <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the card to see the entries.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his {{daughter}} standing behind him; {{she was watching}} my face anxiously, and made a slight inclination with her head.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> it. The warrant now {{stipulated that}} Madame la Vicomtesse de Lavedan should bear her husband company in his exile.|$|E
60|$|The letter rustled {{slightly}} in her hand. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> the flimsy blackened pages whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic, incomprehensible {{to the experience}} of Western Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Florence pleases me--and I take a {{paternal}} {{interest to}} our young friend," [...] <b>I</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> Stanmer. [...] "I {{have become very}} fond of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Clear enough,” <b>I</b> answered, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> the {{sunshine}} which streamed down the open companion-way. “Fair westerly breeze, {{with a promise}} of stiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> her, {{and she was}} {{regarding}} me with {{an expression}} of blissful disregard for any meaning I was seeking to convey.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{conscious}} of an inexpressible relief and of the profoundest interest. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the great portrait. [...] "Mr Bowater?" [...] I repeated.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> my {{opponent}} {{out of the}} corner of my eyes. The man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought this}} was queer. <b>I</b> had <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the Want column of a Newville {{newspaper}} and had noted that moulders were wanted in several places.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{no one is}} dead," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> {{his black}} dress. He too {{looked down at the}} crape round his hat and replied-- ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> the new patent leathers which I was wearing. [...] "How on earth--" [...] I began, but Holmes {{answered}} my question {{before it was}} asked.|$|R
