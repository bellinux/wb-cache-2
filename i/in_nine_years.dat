Smythe did not want to see the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup <b>in</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years.</b> The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E

Gannon steered Stockport away from the drop zone, winning eight of the last 15 league games – when the side had only managed to win nine games throughout {{the whole of the}} 2010–11 campaign – to finish 16th in the final table. Gannon again focused on youth development, inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead, Cameron Darkwah, Danny Hattersley and Ian Ormson into the starting eleven.

Internacional became the first Brazilian side to lift the trophy <b>in</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years.</b> The 2008 competition saw Boca Juniors win their fourth title to become joint leaders for most international titles won by a club in a last hurrah on the international scene. LDU Quito won their second international title as they thumped Internacional 6–0 on points and 4–0 on goal aggregate to win their first ever title. LDU Quito then successfully defended their title in 2010 against Estudiantes. They became the third team to successfully defend the title.|$|E
