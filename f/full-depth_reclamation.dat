40|$|<b>Full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (FDR) with {{or without}} various {{stabilizers}} has been successfully used as a rehabilitation strategy in California since 2001. Long-term field monitoring {{on a number of}} FDR projects using foamed asphalt with portland cement as the stabilizer combined with a comprehensive laboratory study resulted in the preparation of guidelines and specification language for this rehabilitation strategy in 2008. However, the design criteria were essentially empirical in line with California design procedures for this level of rehabilitation project. Recently, there has been growing interest in the use of cement, engineered emulsion, and no stabilizer <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> strategies in addition to foamed asphalt, and in the use of mechanistic design in a greater range of rehabilitation projects. Consequently, the research initiative was extended to a second phase to include accelerated load testing on an instrumented test track constructed with these four different FDR strategies to gather data for the development of performance models that can be included in mechanistic-empirical rehabilitation design procedures.

40|$|Currently, MnDOT {{pavement}} design recommends granular equivalency, GE = 1. 0 for non-stabilized <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (FDR) material, which {{is equivalent to}} class 5 material. For stabilized <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (SFDR), there was no guideline for GE at the time this project was initiated (2009). Some local engineers believe that GE of FDR material should be greater than 1. 0 (Class 5), especially for SFDR. In addition, very little information is available on seasonal effects on FDR base, especially on SFDR base. Because it is known from laboratory studies that SFDR contains less moisture and has higher stiffness (modulus) than aggregate base, {{it is assumed that}} SFDR should be less susceptible to springtime thawing. Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests were performed on seven selected test sections on county roads in Minnesota over a period of three years. During spring thaw of each year, FWD testing was conducted daily {{during the first week of}} thawing in an attempt to capture spring thaw weakening of the aggregate base. After the spring thaw period, FWD testing was conducted monthly to study base recovery and stiffness changes through the seasons. GE of SFDR was estimated using a method established by MnDOT using FWD deflections, and the GE of SFDR is about 1. 5. The value varies from project to project as construction and material varies from project to project. All the materials tested showed seasonal effects on stiffness. In general, the stiffness is weaker in spring than that in summer and fall. Department of Civil Engineering, University of Minnesota; Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E

40|$|<b>Full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (FDR) is {{routinely}} carried out for rehabilitation of roads through the pulverization process. The primary stabilizers currently used in TxDOT districts for FDR are cement, lime, and fly ash.

For lab testing, base materials are retrieved from the site way before pulverization. The change in gradation due to pulverization can significantly impact the base strength and stiffness. ^ Phase I of this study consisted of an extensive laboratory study to determine the impact of changes in gradation on the desired stabilizer content of a base material. It was found that the change in gradation indeed impacts the properties of the mix and should be considered in the design stages of FDR. ^ In Phase II, the ways to address the impact of pulverization was investigated and reported through extensive laboratory tests and field observations. Recommendations for improving the quality of the pulverized materials are included in this report. ...|$|E

Stabilized <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (SFDR) is a pavement rehabilitation method in which distressed asphalt {{is mixed with}} a stabilizer to form a base for new asphalt.

This research investigates the relationship between SFDR properties and overall pavement performance, through which the desirable properties of SFDR materials can be determined. Material tests for creep compliance, Poisson’s ratio, tensile strength, dynamic modulus, and fracture energy were performed on SFDR samples from four roadways. The results were used to model the pavements using MEPDG and MnPAVE software. The rutting predictions were compared to the field measurements and parametric analysis was conducted to determine the effect of the dynamic modulus on the lifetime and reliability of the pavement. It was found that MEPDG can accurately predict rutting while MnPAVE is ideal for parametric and reliability analyses of SFDR pavements...|$|E
40|$|The {{stiffness}} of the subgrade, determined from FWD testing {{was found to}} be adequate for FDR-FA projects. The thickness of the HMA, based on GPR and core measurements {{was found to be}} thicker than that typically appropriate for FDR-FA over approximately 60 percent of the project. Recycling more than 0. 85 ft. of HMA will usually result in problems in achieving compaction throughout the recycled layer and consequently pre-milling of the excess material may be required. A life-cycle cost analysis indicated that the FDR-FA alternative designed using CalME (HMA thickness of 0. 25 ft.) had the lowest life-cycle cost of the four alternatives assessed ($ 9. 1 m). The FDR FA alternative designed using the Caltrans R-value method (HMA thickness of 0. 4 ft) had the highest life-cycle cost ($ 10. 9 m) compared to the other alternatives. The two mill-and-overlay options (mill 0. 2 ft. /overlay 0. 4 ft. and mill 0. 33 ft. /overlay 0. 3 ft.) had life-cycle costs of $ 10. 6 M and $ 10. 2 M, respectively <b>Full-depth</b> <b>reclamation,</b> foamed asphal...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study on <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (FDR) of pavements with foamed asphalt {{has been completed}} for the California Department of Transportation by the University of California Pavement Research Center. A literature review revealed that very little research had been carried out on the reclamation of thick asphalt pavements (multiple overlays over a relatively weak base or subgrade). A mechanistic sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify key variables {{in the design of}} recycled pavements consisting primarily of recycled asphalt pavement. The findings of this analysis and the literature review were used to formulate a work plan for laboratory and field studies to address issues specific to recycling these thick asphalt pavements. A number of FDR projects were observed {{during the course of the}} study. Material was collected for a comprehensive laboratory investigation, which identified a number of key issues pertaining to mix design, including appropriate test methods for California, preparation of specimens (mixing moisture content and aggregate temperature), asphalt binder selection, target asphalt and active filler contents, aggregate gradations (fines content), specimen curing, and the interpretation of results. Visual assessments and Falling Weight Deflectometer testing were also carried out on selected projects at regular intervals. The study concluded that FDR with foamed asphalt combined with a cementitious filler is an appropriate pavement rehabilitation option for California. Projects should be carefully selected with special care given to roadside drainage. Appropriate mix and structural design procedures should be followed, and construction should be strictly controlled to ensure that optimal performance and life are obtained from the pavement. The following recommendations are made: 1) FDR with foamed asphalt combined with a cementitious filler should be considered as a rehabilitation option on thick, cracked asphalt pavements on highways with an annual average daily traffic volume not exceeding 20, 000 vehicles. The technology is particularly suited to pavements where multiple overlays have been placed over relatively weak supporting layers, and where cracks reflect through the overlay in a relatively short time. Higher traffic volumes can be considered provided that adequate strength and durability can be achieved with the in-place materials. Alternatively, the recycled layer can be used as a subbase under a new base layer. 2) Project selection, mix design, and construction should be strictly controlled to ensure that optimal performance is obtained from the rehabilitated roadway. 3) <b>Full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> with asphalt emulsions and partial-depth reclamation with asphalt emulsions and foamed asphalt should also be evaluated, and guidelines prepared for choosing the most appropriate technology for a given set of circumstances.

40|$|Recycling part {{or all of}} the {{pavement}} materials in an existing road during reconstruction is an attractive construction alternative. When reconstructing roads surfaced with hot mix asphalt (HMA), the HMA, underlying base, and a portion of the existing subgrade often are pulverized to form a new base material referred to as recycled pavement material (RPM). Compacted RPM is overlain with a new HMA layer to create a reconstructed or rehabilitated pavement. This process {{is often referred to as}} <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation.</b> Similarly, when an unpaved road with a gravel surface is upgraded to a paved road, the existing road surface gravel (RSG) is blended and compacted to form a new base layer that is overlain with an HMA surface. Recycling pavement and road materials in this manner is both cost effective and environmentally friendly. However, recycled base materials may contain asphalt binder, fines, and/or other deleterious materials that can adversely affect strength and stiffness. To address this issue, chemical stabilizing agents can be blended with RPM or RSG. Use of industrial material resources for stabilization (e. g., cementitious coal fly ash) is particularly attractive in the context of sustainability. The purpose of this study was to develop a practical method to design local roadways using stabilized RPM or SRSG as the base layer and Class C fly ash as the stabilizing agent. The design method was developed in the context of the “gravel equivalency” (GE) design methodology employed for local roads in Minnesota. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E

However, {{the lack of}} mechanicsbased material testing procedures and performance-based specifications limit the use of FDR processes. First, the FDR design and construction process are presented, then, a literature review focusing on FDR research is completed, and a survey is conducted to obtain relevant information regarding current FDR practices in Minnesota. Next, Indirect Tensile Test (IDT) and Dynamic Modulus Test in IDT mode testing is performed on four FDR materials: Field mixed, Lab compacted; Lab mixed, Lab compacted; FDR with cement additive; and FDR with graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) additive. Two curing times are used to determine how physical properties change over time. Test results are used to perform simulations in MnPAVE software and a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). Laboratory observations indicate that cement additive reduces predicted life and increases critical cracking temperature with {{a slight increase in}} cost; GNP additive reduces predicted life but also reduces critical cracking temperature with a significant cost increase; Lab mixed samples performed better than Field mixed, suggesting that field methods could be improved; and curing has a positive effect on the FDR materials with cement and GNP additives [...] for both materials, the dynamic modulus increase, and the GNP samples also had a slight increase in tensile strength.

40|$|Highway {{agencies}} in Iowa are {{challenged by the}} imbalance between available financial resources for pavement maintenance and {{the growing number of}} roads that are due for major rehabilitation or reconstruction. Funding priority is usually given to those roads {{that are part of the}} National-Highway-System (NHS). Rural low-volume roads (LVR) are usually not included in the NHS and may be managed by state highway authorities, counties, or townships. These LVRs provide accesses to the areas that are less populated; and, are sometimes allowed to deteriorate to a poor condition due to lack of funding for rehabilitation. Highway agencies are interested in holding strategies that are more aggressive than preventative maintenance but not as extensive as rehabilitation, to improve such roadways. The Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) constructed test sections using ten holding strategy treatments to aid in the development of appropriate guidelines. Holding strategy treatments used various combinations of thin asphalt layers, surface treatments, and in-place recycling technologies, including cold in-place recycling (CIR) and <b>full-depth</b> <b>reclamation</b> (FDR). This dissertation presents a comprehensive study on these test sections based on various engineering criteria, including cost and life expectancy, and functional and structural performance measures. The current implementation of the technologies that were incorporated into the holding strategies was also reviewed. The findings in these studies show that the concept of holding strategy can be successfully achieved by selecting treatments that use a combination of various widely used thin hot mix overlays, thin surface treatments, and in-place recycling technologies.

40|$|<b>Full-Depth</b> <b>Reclamation</b> (FDR) is a {{cost-effective}} rehabilitation treatment for deteriorated pavements. However, when using asphalt emulsion based rehabilitation techniques {{one of the}} most challenging aspects of FDR is determining when traffic can be returned to the rehabilitated pavement surface. Since asphalt emulsion mixtures need ample time for curing, they cannot be sealed with a surface layer until the water has evaporated from the rehabilitated layer. It is often not possible to keep the road closed until all of the water has evaporated and the surface layer is placed, therefore, at some point the traffic needs to be returned to the rehabilitated surface. Determining when this point occurs, however, is still unclear. A laboratory raveling test run on Superpave Gyratory Compactor prepared samples simulates the raveling that can occur on the newly recycled pavement, and will be used in conjunction with inexpensive, simple tests {{that can be used in}} the field by agencies and contractors to determine if traffic can be released without causing damage to the rehabilitated pavement surface. Three mix designs were analyzed and used in conjunction to produce the emulsion and foam samples used in the testing. An optimum emulsion content was found and used to produce all of the samples. Based on a review of literature and an evaluation of practicality, four tests are recommended to be modeled for field use: British Pendulum Tester, Dynamic Friction Tester, a field-scale cohesiometer, and a rebound tester. The in-house testers were put through numerous tests on asphalt emulsion and asphalt foam samples. It was decided that of all of the testers, the one that showed the most potential was the Sweep Tester. Alterations to improve the devices were stated after all of the testing was completed...|$|E
