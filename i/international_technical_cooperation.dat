5000|$|The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) {{was created}} by Royal Decree 1527/1988, of 11 November, through the {{integration}} of several self-governing agencies and other organizational units of the Foreign Ministry. It was last restructured in 2001, with the incorporation of the Directorate-General for Cultural and Scientific Relations. The Agency's origins date back to 1946, with {{the foundation of the}} Institute of Hispanic Culture. The first significant change to its structure was made in 1976, when a Presidency was established as its highest governing body. In 1977, it was restructured {{for the first time and}} given a new name: the Ibero-American Centre for Cooperation, together with new responsibilities and powers in the field of cooperation. From then on, the term [...] "cooperation" [...] became the organization’s hallmark, in its name and in all of its activities.The Hispanic Library dates back to the initial period of the 1940s and 1950s, as do the organization's publications under the name Ediciones de Cultura Hispánica. Both have fostered a major effort in disseminating Spanish culture, to which their holdings and catalogues bear witness. Before AECI was born, this fruitful work was enhanced by the incorporation of the Félix María Pareja Islamic Library. The Colegio Mayor (student residence) Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe was inaugurated in 1954, as a foundation of the Institute of Hispanic Culture, and as a residence for Spanish and Ibero-American university students. This institution complemented the organization’s policy regarding grants for the higher education of those countries' future leaders and professionals, and it has been open uninterruptedly to this day. Much later, with AECI, the Colegio Mayor Nuestra Señora de África was created. Today, they are both managed by the Colegios Mayores Foundation, and presided over by the State Secretariat for International Cooperation and for Ibero-America.Two other self-governing bodies were also consolidated and integrated into AECI at the time of its creation: the Spanish Arab Institute of Culture (IHAC), which had been functioning since 1954, and had been provided with a legal and operational structure in an Act of 13 February 1974, also as a self-governing institution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the National Commission and the Cooperation Office with Equatorial Guinea (1981). In 1977, the Institute of Hispanic Culture was renamed the Ibero-American Cooperation Centre (CIC), and underwent a significant change to its basic organizational structure, with a President and a Director-General, and the creation of new organizational units: Documentation and Planning and Research, Cultural Cooperation, Economic Cooperation, and Technological and Industrial Cooperation; in other words, with a clear focus on development cooperation. Its new name would not last for long—in 1979, the organization became known as the Institute for Ibero-American Cooperation (ICI), and its purpose was set forth as being Spanish Cooperation with Ibero-America. In this reorganization, the associations, centres and Institutes of Hispanic Culture in Ibero-America, which had been attached institutions since the Organization's inception, were eliminated.In 1985, a new organizational structure was approved for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, involving the creation of the State Secretariat for International Cooperation and for Ibero-America (SECIPI), under which fell the self-governing bodies Institute for Ibero-American Cooperation and Spanish Arab Institute of Culture. The following reported directly to the SECIPI: the Directorates-General for Cultural Relations, for <b>International</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Cooperation,</b> and for International Economic Relations, as well as the Office and National Cooperation Committee for Equatorial Guinea.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the current {{processes}} of <b>international</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> for environmental protection in Mexican municipalities. To meet this objective, the paper is divided into five sections. The first introduces the subject and describes the role that has been playing <b>international</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{in the definition of}} environmental policy in Latin America. The second provides {{a review of the literature}} on globalization and its effects on these cooperative efforts. The third, examines the changes in Mexican municipalities’ cooperation with international agencies that have been established for the implementation of environmental programs. The fourth, through a case study methodology, describes an experience of <b>international</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the northeastern state of Tlaxcala, which analyzes the actions of environmental management in Españita and Hueyotlipan municipalities. The inputs of this analysis are from an exercise of environmental policy evaluation. Finally, the fifth section provides a series of reflections and other elements to the analysis. Within these, highlights the finding that the organization of specific local development programs are becoming increasingly remote technical cooperation focused on inputs. Instead, it is taking a new approach based on the specific purpose of cooperation, for the present case is related to environmental management. ...|$|E

Links this to an evaluation of the staff development from which the Robert Gordon University School of Information and Media has benefited during its involvement in the ‘LISTEN’ Joint European Project during its three year life (1994 – 97). Explains the position which the School of Information and Media was in when the planning for this project commenced about 5 years earlier; outlines the purposes of staff development in the school, and points to those which are intended to develop the individual, and those which are related to the broader needs of the school and the university. Presents an analysis of the aims of <b>international</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> activities, and matches them against the aims of staff development as a framework within which to evaluate the impact on staff development of Project ‘LISTEN’. Identifies individual and institutional benefits in terms of staff development, and notes its impact on the profile of the school. Points to a number of outstanding issues, particularly the need for continuing cooperation after the end of a project; whether technical cooperation activities should be maintained through further institutional leadership or could be led independently by staff who have been effectively developed; and the limited number of schools engaged in cooperative activities...|$|E
