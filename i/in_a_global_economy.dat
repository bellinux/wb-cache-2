Defenders of the decision have responded that it simply began bringing the U.S. more in line with international arbitration practice, helping American companies compete <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>economy.</b> One, Alan Rau, has also argued that it is justified not just by the Arbitration Act but by general principles of contract law.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all {{employing}} entities {{and labor}} unions {{have a duty to}} treat employees equally, without discrimination based on [...] "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." [...] There are separate rules for sex discrimination in pay under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Additional groups with [...] "protected status" [...] were added by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. There is no federal law banning all sexual orientation or identity discrimination, but 22 states had passed laws by 2016. These equality laws generally prevent discrimination in hiring, terms of employment, and make discharge because of a protected characteristic unlawful. There is no federal law against unjust discharge, and most states also have no law with full protection against wrongful termination of employment. Collective agreements made by labor unions and some individual contracts require people are only discharged for a [...] "just cause". The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 requires employing entities give 60 days notice if more than 50 or one third of the workforce may lose their jobs. Federal law has sought to reach full employment through monetary policy and spending on infrastructure.
