40|$|Abstract. Reaction-sintered {{silicon carbide}} (RS-SiC) is a {{promising}} material for optical components used in space, or molds for precision glass lens {{because of its}} excellent properties. For processing of RS-SiC, diamond tools are utilized because RS-SiC is difficult-to-machine material due to its high hardness. In that case, subsurface damage (SSD) and scratches are inevitably introduced on the processed surface, and they deteriorate the qualities of products. To resolve these issues, we proposed a complex machining technique named anodic oxidation assisted process (AOAP), in which localized anodic oxidation and removal of the oxidation layer by <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> were combined, for figuring <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> of RS-SiC without introducing any scratches and SSD. The <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> tool used in AOAP has a lower hardness than that of RS-SiC, but higher than that of the oxidation products. It is possible to figure the objective shape and polish the surface by changing the conditions including the oxidation time, the composition of electrolyte, the configuration of the cathode electrode, applied voltage, and so on. In our previous study, we found that RS-SiC was oxidized efficiently by anodic oxidation with various electrolytes such as phosphoric acid, ultrapure water, and a mixture of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide.

50|$|A {{practical}} example is as follows. An aircraft maker contracts with a vendor to make parts. A certain {{grade of steel}} is specified for the part because it is strong enough and hard enough for the part's function. The steel is machinable although not free-machining. The vendor decides to mill the parts. The milling can achieve the specified roughness (for example, ≤ 3.2 µm) {{as long as the}} machinist uses premium-quality inserts in the end mill and replaces the inserts after every 20 parts (as opposed to cutting hundreds before changing the inserts). There is no need to add a second operation (such as <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing)</b> after the milling as long as the milling is done well enough (correct inserts, frequent-enough insert changes, and clean coolant). The inserts and coolant cost money, but the costs that <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> would incur (more time and additional materials) would cost even more than that. Obviating the second operation results in a lower unit cost and thus a lower price. The competition between vendors elevates such details from minor to crucial importance. It was certainly possible to make the parts in a slightly less efficient way (two operations) for a slightly higher price; but only one vendor can get the contract, so the slight difference in efficiency is magnified by competition into the great difference between the prospering and shuttering of firms.|$|R

30|$|The {{value of}} μ showed no {{significant}} difference {{with the type of}} metal tool surface finishing (<b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing)</b> when a load within the elastic range was applied to an OD wood sample. However, when a load of magnitude over the consolidated range was applied to the OD wood, the values of μ for the two metal tool surface finishes were significantly different, with an approximately twofold higher μ for the metal surface finished by grinding than that finished by polishing. These results suggest that the influence of the metal tool surface finishing condition on μ is associated with the deformation characteristics of the wood.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{distortion}} due to <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> {{increases with}} the aspect {{ratio of the}} part (diameter to thickness ratio). To a first order, glass strength increases as the cube of the thickness. Thick lenses at 4:1 to 6:1 aspect ratios will flex much less than high aspect ratio parts, such as optical windows, which can have aspect ratios of 15:1 or higher. The combination of surface or wavefront error precision requirements and part aspect ratio drives the degree of back support uniformity required, especially during the higher down pressures and side forces during polishing. Optical working typically involves a degree of randomness that helps greatly in preserving figure-of-revolution surfaces, provided the part is not flexing during the grind/polish process.|$|R

40|$|In {{the world}} of rail travel, {{unplanned}} track maintenance constitutes disruption and negatively impacts customer satisfaction. To maintain railway networks {{it is necessary to}} plan maintenance before it becomes critical, preferably by at least a year.

However, the harder material surface textures demonstrated a better control over friction among the ground surfaces. Although the effect of roughness on friction was less significant when compared to textures, the harder material roughness showed better correlations when compared to the softer material roughness...|$|R

This {{is the first step in}} research directed toward the combination of a pre-finishing process (ductile <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing)</b> with ion figuring to produce finished ceramic mirrors.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{various kinds of}} surface textures were {{attained}} on the steel plates. Roughness of the textures was varied using various <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> methods. The surface textures were characterized in terms of roughness parameters using an optical profilometer. Then experiments were conducted using an inclined pin-on-plate sliding apparatus to identify the role of surface texture and its roughness parameters on coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation. In the experiments, a soft polymer (polypropylene) {{was used for the}} pin and hardened steel was used for the plate. Experiments were conducted at a sliding velocity of 2 minis in ambient conditions under both dry and lubricated conditions. The normal load was varied from 1 to 120 N during the tests. The morphologies of the worn surfaces of the pins and the formation of a transfer layer on the steel plate surfaces were observed using a scanning electron microscope. Based on the experimental results, it was observed that the transfer layer formation and the coefficient of friction along with its two components, namely adhesion and plowing, were controlled by the surface texture of the harder mating surfaces and were less dependent of surface roughness (R(a)) of the harder mating surfaces. The effect of surface texture on the friction was attributed to the variation of the plowing component of friction for different surfaces. Among the various surface roughness parameters studied, the mean slope of the profile, Delta(a), was found to most accurately characterize variations in the friction and wear behavior.

40|$|The {{potential}} advantages of using electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for nondestructive evaluation of metal parts {{have been known}} for some time. Recently a generically new EMAT has been perfected which can generate and receive horizontally polarized shear (SH) wave andle beams. SH waves offer considerable advantages over SV waves for inspecting metal parts of complex shape: 1) they reflect specularly from planes containing the direction of particle displacement, 2) they can be generated in any direction lying· in the saggital plane with equal efficiency, and 3) SH wave transducers inherently discriminate against Raleigh, L and SV waves. These advantages make SH waves particularly useful for weldment inspection. A brassboard system was assembled for locating natural and simulated flaws in thick MIG welds, and a new technology for placing controllable defects in weld deposits was developed. It was then shown that the SH-wave inspection system was capable of producing an accurate map of the controllable defects introduced into the weld deposit. The ultrasonic map compared well with the notes taken by the welder and contained considerably more detail than the radiographic map. The inspection was performed at 1. 7 MHz with the SH wave beam axis inclined at approximately 38 ° with respect to surface normal.

40|$|Today's {{composites}} {{may contain}} high amounts of nanofillers. Objectives: To characterize composite dust {{to determine whether}} possibly hazardous respirable (< 5 µm) dust particles may be released upon <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> composites. We hypothesized that upon grinding/polishing, the filler particles would remain well embedded in the resin matrix and that no respirable dust would be released. Methods: Standardized blocks of polymerized composite were ground with a diamond bur; and dust was collected on 1 -µm pore-size filters and weighed. The released dust was also quantified and ultra-morphologically characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Both (microfilled) hybrid composites (Z 100, 3 M ESPE; Gradia Anterior, GC), and (hybrid-) nanocomposites (Filtek Supreme, 3 M ESPE; Tetric EvoCeram, Ivoclar, Vivadent; CeramX, Dentsply; Premise, Kerr; Herculite XRV Ultra, Kerr) were tested. Results: Gravimetrical analysis revealed that all composites released appreciable amounts of respirable dust, with air concentrations from 7 - 32 mg/m 3 immediately after grinding the composites. In addition, electron microscopic analysis revealed that composites may also release high amounts of particles smaller than 1 µm and even 100 nm. The ratio of dust particles smaller than 1 µm to those larger than 1 µm ranged between 3 : 1 to 9 : 1. The respirable fraction of the composite dust most often consisted of multiple fillers in the resin matrix, but also of single nanofillers. Conclusion: Contemporary composites may release small respirable dust particles. Dentists should be urged to always wear protective masks, and to use water coolant during the <b>polishing</b> <b>or</b> removal of composites. However, more research is necessary to determine possible health hazards of the released composite dust. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Micro milling is {{recognized}} as one of the most versatile machining processes to fabricate micro components and micro features [1], due to the advantages including wide material choices, true 3 D micro geometry machining capability, high accuracy, low cost and environmentally friendliness [2 – 5]. Recently, micro milling has been employed to fabricate the microfluidic devices [6 – 10]. Microfluidic channels are the important part of micro-chemical devices, which is widely being used in microelectronic and biomedical applications. The characteristic scale of microfluidic channels is generally between a few to several hundred microns, and micro-milling has a very high superiority in such scale machining. Tool diameters are down-scaled in micro milling, unfortunately the surface roughness is not down-scaled in micro milling, this is mainly due to the fact that cutting edge radius and machining dynamics such as tool runout are not down-scaled and they are similar to those in conventional milling. Therefore, the relative surface roughness, i.e., the ratio of surface roughness to the machined feature size, is believed to be larger in micro milling. Research has shown that the wall roughness and micro topography can significantly affect the flow and drag along the microfluidic channel path [11], and microreactors often need to control the flow pattern to achieve enhanced mixing, to achieve enhanced mass transfer, and improve the reaction rate. And on the other hand, design and control of wall roughness and micro topography has become an effective means of micro-flow control [12 – 14]. In addition, the micro features size produced by micro milling makes the subsequent finishing processes, e.g., <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing,</b> expensive <b>or</b> even impossible. Therefore, modelling surface generation in micro-milling is significant and it provides a theoretical basis the design and manufacture of micro-fluidic channels.|$|R

40|$|Intraoral {{adjustments}} {{are often}} necessary after {{the insertion of}} ceramic restorations. Chairside-milled restorations essentially require an additional polishing. This is normally realized with fine grit burs and multi-step, matched polishing systems. A clinical evaluation {{of the quality of}} the polished surface is hardly possible, as the condition of the gloss doesn´t provide us with sufficient information about the quality of the polishing procedure. In this dissertation, a feldspar ceramic was treated to manual and to machine processing using three different press-on forces (0. 5 N; 1 N; 2 N). This press-on force was determined and chosen after having conducted literary research. Considerably higher forces may also occur. In the range of a realistic, clinically performed pressure, which occurs during intraoral <b>grinding</b> <b>or</b> <b>polishing,</b> testing equipment has been developed. With this testing equipment, it was possible to treat ceramic specimens under constant conditions. Consequently, a comparison of defined press-on force and manual polishing was evaluated and so too was the efficiency of the polishing systems. Soflex discs were excluded from the study. All of the polishing systems are suitable for polishing ceramic surfaces in a clinically adequate manner. The achievable reduction of the roughness is comparable to a glazing. Despite a few exceptions, the roughness of the specimens treated by the testing equipment is lower than the results of the manual polishing. This was assumed by the hypothesis and is confirmed in accordance to literature. Using manual polishing procedure, results can be achieved, which allow efficient high gloss polished surfaces in the oral cavity. This is a major consideration for the CAD/CAM systems when a machine-milled surface has to be polished after the insertion. Even after the occlusal adjustments of glazed ceramic surfaces, intraoral polishing is still required. As to whether the recommended press-on force conducted by the manufacturers was provided optimally could not be considered in this study and should be subjected to further investigation. It is also possible that the configuration of the spray pattern or the intensity of the cooling may also have an impact on the efficiency of the roughness reduction and thermal stress. Further experiments could be interest with regards to these factors as well. Significant differences concerning overall roughness could be determined when taking a close look at the polishing systems. The Soflex discs were able to provide the smoothest surface, but only via manual polishing. These discs use Al 2 O 3 -based grits over the course of four different steps.

Roughness is the attribute of a surface that can be defined as a collection of small surface unevennesses that can be identified optically or detected mechanically which do not result from the surface’s shape and their size depends on a material type as well as on undergone processing. The most often utilised roughness parameters are: Ra - mean distance value of the points on the observed profile from the average line on the sampling length, and Rz - difference between arithmetic mean height of the five highest peaks and arithmetic mean depth of the five deepest valleys regarding to the average line on the length of the measured fragment. In practice, roughness parameters are most often defined for surface elements that require relevant manufacturing <b>or</b> processing through <b>grinding,</b> founding <b>or</b> <b>polishing</b> in order to provide the expected surface roughness. To measure those parameters for the produced elements profilometers are used. In this paper the authors present an alternative approach of determining and utilising such parameters. Instead of the utilising methods based on sampling length measurement, roughness parameters are determined on the basis of point clouds, that represent a surface of rough concrete, obtained through terrestrial laser scanning. The authors suggest using the surface roughness parameter data acquired in this way as a supplementary data in the condition assessment (erosion rate) of surfaces being a part of engineering constructions made of concrete...|$|R
