5|$|The major {{transport}} interchange at Waterloo comprises London Waterloo, Waterloo East, Waterloo tube station, {{and several}} bus stops. There {{are more than}} 130 automated ticket gates on the station concourse, along with another 27 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> below.|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 179th Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. Later in the 1980s, {{the station was}} renovated and modernized; {{as part of the}} renovation, the IND-style purple tile band was removed from the station walls, and a design with intertwining blue and orange stripes was added. During a further upgrade that occurred by about 2000, elevators were installed in the station to make it ADA-accessible. The elevators were opened around 2005. Starting in August 2007, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along Hillside Avenue above the station, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system.|$|E

50|$|After 18 {{months of}} {{construction}} and $1.25 million <b>in</b> expenditures, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> officially {{opened to the}} public on December 1, 1925. Traveling a distance of slightly over one mile, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> connected <b>the</b> intersection of Beverly and Glendale Blvds <b>in</b> Westlake with <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> Terminal Building at the corner of Fourth and Hill Streets <b>in</b> downtown. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> cars were powered by a new substation - Toluca No. 51 - which was constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yard adjacent to the tunnel portal.|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s, {{when the}} New York City Subway {{was at an}} all-time low, {{following}} the general trend of a decrease in ridership, the amount of passengers using the Union Turnpike station decreased by 2,700,000 passengers. As part of the MTA's 1975–1981 transit program, station lighting at Kew Gardens was improved. In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b>|$|E
50|$|Announcing on <b>the</b> Bach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Facebook and Twitter pages {{where and}} when he would appear {{on the day of}} performances, Henderson’s work {{attracted}} attention from various media and musicians, notably an October 2010 video piece by CNN’s Tawanda Scott entitled “He’s playing to save the music,” and an endorsement on Facebook by jazz saxophonist Brandon Marsalis. Henderson continued this intensive campaign of performances, often appearing two to three times a week, throughout 2010, 2011, and the earlier months of 2012, after which he continued to give Bach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> performances but scaled back somewhat in frequency.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> 1894 <b>the</b> {{toll-free}} Tower Bridge {{opened a}} few hundred yards downriver, causing a drop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway's</b> income. <b>In</b> 1897, Parliament passed an Act authorising the sale of the tunnel to the London Hydraulic Power Company (LHPC) for £3,000, and <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> closed to pedestrian traffic in 1898.|$|R

5|$|Both entrances {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. They are {{intended}} to stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, {{as well as}} graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{stations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{system have}} mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and {{proceed to the}} correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{decision}} to withdraw tram services in London {{and replace them with}} buses, the station closed just after 12.30am on 6 April 1952. Much of <b>the</b> station remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disused <b>subway</b> but there is no public access. In 2004 it was expected that redevelopment work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>subway</b> would probably obliterate what remains exist.|$|R
50|$|Gateway Newstands {{operates}} 65 locations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Toronto <b>subway</b> system since <b>the</b> mid-1990s. Competitors to Gateway Newstands {{accused the}} Toronto Transit Commission (the operator of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system) of sole-sourcing.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> 2017, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{system was}} officially {{put in a}} state of {{emergency}} after a series of derailments, track fires, and overcrowding incidents.|$|R
5|$|The {{projects}} ran out {{of funding}} due to the 1975–1976 New York City fiscal crisis, along {{with the fact that}} the MTA did not have a consistent funding source (its five-year Capital Programs were implemented in 1982 due to further decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> after 1975–1976). Expected to be completed by the mid-1970s and early 1980s, lines for the Program for Action had to be reduced or canceled altogether due to the crisis. Because of the fiscal crisis, the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street lines, the only two complete lines to be built under the program, were truncated and delayed, and there were plans to abandon the expansions altogether.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the only}} subway station serving the island of Broad Channel, which is located in Jamaica Bay. The island only has about 3,000 residents, and as a result, this is the least-used station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system not {{counting}} the closed Cortlandt Street station. However, this station serves an important role. It is the transfer point between the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which runs to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street, and the A train, which runs through Brooklyn and Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|At Carroll Street, {{the express}} tracks ramp up {{to rejoin the}} local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street. East of Fourth Avenue station towards Park Slope, the tracks become a subway once again. Past 7th Avenue, the local tracks diverge, curving south to 15th Street and Prospect Park West, while the express tracks take a direct route beneath Prospect Park. This {{is one of two}} places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> where the express tracks diverge from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. The express tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and Prospect Avenue, running on a lower level under Prospect Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, the last stop of the original IND service.|$|E

50|$|The closest tube {{station is}} South Kensington, {{linked to the}} museums by <b>the</b> South Kensington <b>Subway,</b> a tiled tunnel beneath Exhibition Road {{constructed}} <b>in</b> 1885. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> was originally intended {{to go as far}} as the Royal Albert Hall, but the construction of the Imperial Institute meant the tunnel emerged at the Science Museum where it exits onto Exhibition Road. Originally only opened during exhibitions in South Kensington, it was opened to the public free of charge <b>in</b> 1908. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> is Grade II listed.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1996, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{station at}} Hermanstraẞe was finally {{completed}} so people have now a {{direct access to}} the Berlin S-Bahn one stop after Leinestrasse.|$|R
5|$|By contrast, {{when the}} 63rd Street Subway opened, {{there were fewer}} service changes. The B and Q trains and the JFK Express were {{extended}} from 57th Street/Sixth Avenue in Manhattan to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Queens; the JFK Express would be eliminated {{less than six months}} later in 1990. The 2001 opening of the 63rd Street Connection resulted in more major service changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system, such as the reroute of the B and Q train away from the 63rd Street tunnel, the introduction of F express service between Queens Boulevard and the tunnel, the truncation of G service to Court Square during weekdays, and the creation of the V train to cover the portions of the IND Queens Boulevard Line that were formerly served by the F and G trains.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> The proposal would tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and for married couples with incomes above $1 million. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} Mott Avenue station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system, {{despite the fact}} that the station had become part of the subway system just two decades earlier. From 2009 to 2012, a $117 million renovation took place on the station, replacing the 1950s design of the station house with metallic facades and a dome enclosure, and upgrading several features including staircases and employee areas. Elevators from the station house to the platforms were added, as were yellow tactile warning strips on the platform edges, making the station ADA-accessible. A glass artwork titled Respite was installed as part of the MTA's Arts for Transit program. The renovated station was unveiled on May 11, 2012.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, {{she made}} her second {{documentary}} entitled So Far from India, which is a fifty-two-minute film that followed an Indian newspaper dealer living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> of New York, while his pregnant wife {{waited for him to}} return home. This film was recognized as a Best Documentary winner at the American Film Festival and New York’s Global Village Film Festival.|$|R

5|$|Lyle spots {{an unknown}} person {{running away from}} them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and the team follows. When the group {{approaches}} {{the spot where the}} train lost power, Melnick starts crying out in pain. Visible electrical flashes start destroying the skin on his left arm. Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E
5|$|The first {{member of}} the group to join S.M. Entertainment's {{training}} system was Jessica in 2000, after she and her sister, Krystal Jung, were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a family vacation. That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears. Seohyun, the group's youngest member, was scouted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 2005 <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> line of <b>the</b> {{lower part}} was reopened between Piscinola-Scampia (interchange with Naples Metro line 1) to Mugnano. Then, in 2009, it was {{extended}} to Aversa.|$|R

40|$|In {{this text}} I try {{to point out}} certain {{characteristics}} of a subway system by examining its urban furniture and operational factors.
