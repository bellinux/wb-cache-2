40|$|The "mother" {{hypothesis}} {{is one of}} the main adaptive explanations of human menopause. It postulates that reproductive cessation constitutes a strategy that has been selected for during human evolution because mothers at older ages might maximize their fitness by investing resources in the survival and reproduction of their living children rather than by continuing to reproduce. This study provides a test of this hypothesis. <b>Fertility</b> <b>functions</b> that maximize fitness are built into a model incorporating the fact that the survival of females during the rearing period is a major determinant of their children's survival. Results are given according to different scenarios of increase with mothers' age of maternal mortality risk and risk of stillbirth and birth defects (on the assumption that these females do not experience menopause). Different estimates of the effect of a mother's death on her child's survival were also incorporated. Finally, a population genetics framework allows us to estimate selection on these optimal <b>fertility</b> <b>functions.</b> To determine whether or not these <b>fertility</b> <b>functions</b> show a menopause, three criteria are discussed: the rapidity of fertility decline, if any; the magnitude of selection on menopause compared with a nonmenopausal strategy; and the selection on survival during post-reproductive life. Our results show that menopause and subsequent post-reproductive life are significantly advantageous when two conditions are satisfied: a marked increase in stillbirth and risk of birth defects as well as in maternal mortality with mother's age...|$|R

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{recombination}} resulting from λ plac 5 transduction were investigated in strains of Escherichia coli K- 12 that use the RecE or RecF recombination pathways. In a RecBC pathway strain, F 42 lac recombination with λplac 5 is 20 - to 50 -fold higher than chromosomal lac times λplac 5 recombination, and this recombination enhancement is largely dependent on constitutive expression of F 42 lac <b>fertility</b> <b>functions.</b> Here, {{it was observed that}} F 42 lac <b>fertility</b> <b>functions</b> do not effect the ability of F 42 lac to recombine with λplac 5 in a RecE or RecF pathway strain. Therefore, the enhancement observed in a Rec+ (or RecBC pathway) strain is directly dependent on the recBC gene product. The end product of recombination between λplac 5 and either F 42 lac or chromosomal lac in RecE and RecF pathway strains was monitored by scoring for addition and substitution transductants. It was observed that the percentage of addition transductants was lower in all cases for RecE and RecF pathway strains as compared with RecBC pathway or a recB strain. It is concluded that the introduction of sbcA or sbcB into a recB strain produces a change in recombination mechanism that is reflected {{in the nature of the}} end product of recombination...|$|R

30|$|Infertility {{is related}} with the {{presence}} of leiomyomas; therefore, conservative surgical management is needed to preserve <b>fertility</b> <b>function</b> post myomectomy. For conservative surgical management, different techniques have been proposed such as myomectomy, myomembolization, focused ultrasound technique [5] and cryomyolysis [6]. Myomectomies can be performed via open approach (laparotomy) or endoscopic approach (hysteroscopy or laparoscopically) [7, 8]. <b>Fertility</b> <b>function</b> post myomectomy is difficult to assess, and very heterogeneous data have been published regarding pregnancy rates [7 – 10]. In case of successful pregnancy, there are reports showing increased complication rates of uterine rupture during labour especially after laparoscopic myomectomy [9, 10]. Other studies could not confirm these findings [11, 12]. In view of the small number of case series regarding laparoscopic myomectomy and pregnancy rates, we have undertaken a retrospective audit of 59 consecutive cases for the treatment of infertility where the laparoscopic myomectomy was performed using single knots in one layer closure in order to assess the post-operative pregnancy rates.|$|E

In this contribution we provide a fully developed nonparametric estimation theory of both local mean density and local Bartlett spectra of a locally stationary Hawkes process.

For such processes, we introduce the concept of age pyramid which evolves according to immigration and births. The virtue if this approach that combines an intensity process definition and a branching representation is that the population age pyramid keeps track of all past events. This is used to compute new distribution properties for a class of linear Hawkes processes with general immigrants which generalize the popular exponential <b>fertility</b> <b>function.</b> The pathwise construction of the Hawkes process and its underlying population is also given...|$|E

We study this process in the special case where the <b>fertility</b> <b>function</b> is exponential so that the process is entirely described by an underlying Markov chain, which includes the constraint variable. Some conditions on the parameters are established to ensure the ergodicity of the chain. Moreover, scaling limits are derived for the integrated point process.

40|$|Abstract: Vitamin E {{is found}} in high {{quantities}} in vegetable oils. Although vitamin E has multiple functions in humans and animals, its key function is protecting cells from oxidative damage. Since its discovery, several {{studies have demonstrated that}} vitamin E deficiency causes impaired fertility in humans and lab animals. However, the effects of vitamin E deficiency or of its supplementation on the fertility of farm animals, particularly on poultry, are less well studied. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the effects of dietary vitamin E on the fertility of poultry species is needed {{in order to understand the}} beneficial role of vitamin E in the maintenance of sperm and egg qualities. Based on the observations reviewed here, we found that a moderate amount of vitamin E in poultry diet significantly protects semen/sperm qualities in male birds and egg qualities in female birds via decreasing the lipid peroxidation in semen/sperms and eggs. This review provides an overall understanding of the effects of dietary vitamin E on <b>fertility</b> <b>functions</b> in poultry species...|$|R

We combined data from an extant N deposition gradient (4. 3 – 7. 3 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) from semiarid areas of Spain and a field experiment in central Spain to evaluate N deposition effects on soil <b>fertility,</b> <b>function</b> and cyanobacteria community. Soil organic N did not increase along the extant gradient. Nitrogen fixation decreased along existing and experimental N deposition gradients, a result possibly related to compositional shifts in soil cyanobacteria community.

Soil organic C content, C:N ratios and the activity of β-glucosidase decreased along the extant gradient in most locations.

40|$|The {{normal habitat}} of enteric {{bacteria}} is largely anaerobic. Expression {{of the three}} characteristic properties of R-plasmids, drug resistance, vegetative replication, and fertility, was therefore studied in Escherichia coli K- 12 during anaerobiosis. Replication and drug resistance functions were not altered in the 45 R-plasmids studies, whereas the expression of fertility varied considerably among different R-plasmids during anaerobiosis. The R-plasmids could be divided into three groups, one showing a strong, the second a moderate, and the third little or no reduction of fertility by anaerobiosis. Plasmid-determined sensitivity to F-, N-, and I-specific phage, respectively, was well, although not absolutely, correlated with each of three groups mentioned. Anaerobiosis-aerobiosis appears to change the fertility of type F R-plasmids by influencing the degree of repression of their <b>fertility</b> <b>functions</b> such as the formation of sex pili. Although the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline were unaltered by anaerobiosis, sulfonamide {{was found to be}} four- to eightfold less active under this condition in both resistant and sensitive strains.

This conservative management could be carried out even in patients with borderline ovarian tumour associated with non-invasive peritoneal implants (if complete resection of peritoneal disease has been performed). When facing persistent infertility after this conservative surgery, ovarian induction or an in-vitro procedure could be proposed in patients with an early-stage disease, though the number of attempts must be limited.

SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: Since GPxs have recently been reviewed under various aspects, we here focus on novel findings considering their diverse physiological roles exceeding an antioxidant activity. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: GPxs are involved in balancing the H(2) O(2) homeostasis in signalling cascades, e. g. in the insulin signalling pathway by GPx 1; GPx 2 plays a dual role in carcinogenesis depending on the mode of initiation and cancer stage; GPx 3 is membrane associated possibly explaining a peroxidatic function despite low plasma concentrations of GSH; GPx 4 has novel roles in the regulation of apoptosis and, together with GPx 5, in male <b>fertility.</b> <b>Functions</b> of GPx 6 are still unknown, and the proposed involvement of GPx 7 and GPx 8 in protein folding awaits elucidation.
