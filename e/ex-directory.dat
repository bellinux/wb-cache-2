He hated using the telephone and kept his number <b>ex-directory,</b> changing it if anybody else discovered it. Given his dislike of the telephone, he communicated by post, including letters hiring and firing members of his band.|$|E

He revealed in 2007 that after his series of investigative articles on Scientology for the Evening Argus in the 1990s, he was subjected {{to what he calls}} a [...] "vicious smear campaign" [...] including defamatory leaflets, threatening letters and faxes and an attempt to find his <b>ex-directory</b> telephone number.|$|E
5000|$|A number {{offering}} a directory enquiries service {{allowing people to}} request to be put through to a mobile phone number was established in June 2009. 118 800 proved to be controversial, however, when {{it was revealed that}} it was making available 15 million mobile numbers that it had bought from market researchers. Its website was suspended within weeks of its launch so that the company could re-engineer the site to enable the large number of <b>ex-directory</b> requests to be handled more efficiently.

Seized documents included 13,343 requests for confidential information from 305 journalists [...] In 2007 the information commissioner [...] "berated the police and PCC over their feeble prosecution and condemnation, respectively, of a range of offences, from garnering <b>ex-directory</b> numbers to hacking into the police national computer." ...|$|E
50|$|Ipsos MORI's {{research}} is conducted via {{a wide range}} of methodologies, especially computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), as well as face-to-face and internet surveys. Telephone surveys use a method called random digit dialing (Ipsos MORI being exempt from the Telephone Preference Service as it only blocks telephone calls that involve selling). This system basically uses randomly generated, but area-specific, telephone numbers. This is the preferred method for telephone samples as <b>ex-directory</b> households are included thus not biasing the sample in any way. Ipsos MORI are able to lawfully use this technology as they use it for research purposes as opposed to sales and advertising.|$|E
50|$|Prestel Mailbox {{numbers were}} {{generally}} {{based upon the}} last 9 digits of the user's telephone number, without spaces or punctuation. For example the Prestel Mailbox number for Prestel Headquarters which had the telephone number 01-822 3231 would be simply 018223231 12, while that for a user in Manchester with telephone number 061-412 2345 would be 614122345. In keeping with the established telephone number practice, but unlike the convention with today's internet mailboxes, Prestel Mailbox numbers were published by default, and were available via the Prestel computers in a dedicated directory accessible from page *486#. On request, <b>ex-directory</b> mailbox numbers were available, usually employing a dummy telephone number format such as the series 01999nnnn, and later the series 01111nnnn.|$|E
5000|$|Changing direction, Phipps first joined <b>Ex-Directory,</b> {{this was}} then {{followed}} by a short period with a band called The Secret. Phipps then joined Random Hold, a band he had already worked with {{a year or two}} before. Random Hold composed of David Rhodes, Bill MacCormick, David Ferguson, and Pete Phipps were described by a music journalist as [...] "disco orientated rock", and by Nina Myskow in The Sun as a band to watch for as [...] "Their music shows talent, menace, originality and brains. A dynamic combination". The band produced several singles in this period including [...] "Montgomery Clift" [...] and albums The View From Here (1980) and Burn the Buildings (1981). Phipps also continued to record with Glitter Band colleagues pursuing solo identities, such as with John Springate on the album Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is, by Gerry Shephard and Peter Oxendale.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Telephone {{surveys have}} been used widely in public health {{research}} internationally and are being increasingly used in Ireland and the U. K. Methods This study compared three telephone surveys conducted {{on the island of}} Ireland from 2000 to 2004, examining study methodology, outcome measures and the per unit cost of each completed survey. We critically examined these population-based surveys which all explored health related attitudes and behaviours. Results Over the period from 2000 to 2005 the percentage of calls which succeeded in contacting an eligible member of the public fell, from 52. 9 % to 31. 8 %. There was a drop in response rates to the surveys (once contact was established) from 58. 6 % to 17. 7 %. Costs per completed interview rose from € 4. 48 to € 15. 65. Respondents were prepared to spend 10 – 15 minutes being surveyed, but longer surveys yielded poorer completion rates. Respondents were willing to discuss issues of a sensitive nature. Interviews after 9 pm were less successful, with complaints about the lateness of the call. Randomisation from electronic residential telephone directory databases excluded all <b>ex-directory</b> numbers and thus was not as representative of the general population as number generation by the hundred-bank method. However the directory database was more efficient in excluding business and fax numbers. Conclusion Researchers should take cognisance of under-representativeness of land-line telephone surveys, of the increasing difficulties in contacting the public and of mounting personnel costs. We conclude that telephone surveying now requires additional strategies such as a multimode approach, or incentivisation, to be a useful, cost-effective means of acquiring data on public health matters in Ireland and the U. K. </p...|$|E
