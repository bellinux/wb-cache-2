5|$|The Dove Street Festival of Lights – Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local {{family on the}} street adopted their {{daughter}} and wanted to dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light tunnel effect. Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E

25|$|Fluid {{particles}} are subject only to pressure {{and their own}} weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases {{it can only be}} because the fluid on that section <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.|$|E

25|$|Hartelius, Caplan and Rardin {{conducted}} {{a retrospective analysis}} of definitions of transpersonal psychology. They found three dominant themes that define the field: beyond-ego psychology, integrative/holistic psychology, and psychology of transformation. Analysis suggested that the field <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> an early emphasis on alternative states of consciousness to a more expanded view of human wholeness and transformation. This development has, according to the authors, moved the field closer to the integral approaches of Ken Wilber and Post-Aurobindonian theorists.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{conventional}} International Date Line {{is a relatively}} recent geographic and political construct whose exact location <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> time to time depending {{on the needs of}} different interested parties.

In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that {{the conventional}} International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the halakhic date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.|$|E

25|$|Leather tanning and the {{exploitation}} of coal seams made valuable contributions to the economy of Kirkburton for several centuries. The last tannery closed in the 1830s. Coal mining grew in importance with {{the increased use of}} steam for pumping water and by 1850 there were 20small pits in the township. The remains of a number of mines and bell pits can be seen, including the former St Helen's Colliery on Moor Lane in Highburton. In {{the latter half of the}} 19thcentury there were more than 30pits operating around Kirkburton employing more than 300men. The last colliery closed about 70years ago. One old-established industry, which <b>has</b> <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> the village, was the manufacture of edge tools and shovels, which was introduced in the mid-18thcentury.
