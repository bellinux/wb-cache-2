5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Dumbo in October 1941, the U.S. entered World WarII. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce {{instruction}} films for the military such as Four Methods of <b>Flush</b> <b>Riveting</b> and Aircraft Production Methods. Disney also met with Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury, and agreed to produce short Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds. Disney also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Facewhich won an Academy Awardand the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 <b>flush</b> <b>riveting</b> was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E

50|$|A <b>flush</b> <b>rivet</b> is used {{primarily}} on external metal surfaces where good appearance and {{the elimination of}} unnecessary aerodynamic drag are important. A <b>flush</b> <b>rivet</b> takes advantage of a countersink hole; they are also commonly referred to as countersunk <b>rivets.</b> Countersunk or <b>flush</b> <b>rivets</b> are used extensively on the exterior of aircraft for aerodynamic reasons as it not allow to raise the drag while installed.

50|$|Two years later, Gregor was {{employed}} by the Canadian Car and Foundry and designed FDB-1 biplane fighter. Despite being an advanced and innovative design, incorporating all-metal construction with <b>flush</b> <b>riveting,</b> retractable undercarriage and a sleek shape, the FDB-I was overtaken by events and, after being {{unable to find a}} buyer, was lost in a fire in 1945.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the existing <b>flush</b> <b>rivet</b> inspection criteria and inspection methods to establish a norm for commercial <b>flush</b> <b>riveted</b> joints. Studies were made of thirty-four <b>flush</b> <b>riveted</b> joint load deformation curves to obtain their general characteristics and to establish some correlation of yield load as defined in ANC- 5 and as defined in Report on <b>Flush</b> <b>Riveted</b> Joint Strength by ARC Rivet and Screw Allowables Subcommittee (Airworthiness Project 12). The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of rivet diameter joint set, is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values. It was concluded from the countersunk rivet data that permanent set based on rivet diameter is a more reasonable yield criterion than permanent set based on an arbitrary constant. ...|$|R
50|$|The Doodlebug {{is a low}} wing, {{conventional}} geared aircraft. The {{wings are}} partially <b>flush</b> <b>riveted.</b> The fuselage is fabric covered welded steel tube, with wooden stringers. The firewall mounted fuel tank holds 12.5 gallons of fuel, with 25 gallons capacity with tip tanks.|$|R
50|$|The {{semi-monocoque}} design {{is made from}} <b>flush</b> <b>riveted</b> aluminum sheet. The rudder is covered with doped aircraft fabric. Its 14.12 m span, semi-tapered wing employs a Wortmann FX-60-17A11-182 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to an FX-60-126 at the wing tip. The wing has an area of 11 m2 and mounts top surface Schempp-Hirth-style air brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Polen Special is a low-wing {{monoplane}} with retractable conventional landing gear. The retractable gear is {{hydraulically operated}} from a T-33 sequencing valve with electric powered gear doors. The fuselage and wings are all aluminum with <b>flush</b> <b>riveting.</b> The ailerons and elevators use push-pull tubes, with cable {{control for the}} rudders. The aircraft is specifically designed to fly at high altitude on IFR routes with the pilot using supplemental oxygen to achieve maximum speed with the turbocharged engine.|$|E
50|$|In March 1941, Disney invited {{over three}} dozen {{different}} representatives of various national defence industries to a lunch meeting, {{in an attempt}} to solicit work from them. He followed this luncheon with formal letters offering work “For national defence industries at cost, and without profit. In making this offer, I am motivated solely by a desire to help as best I can in the present emergency.” Four Methods of <b>Flush</b> <b>Riveting</b> (1941) was first training film that was commissioned by Lockheed Aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk <b>flush</b> <b>rivets</b> for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} rivet heads greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly riveted joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead rivets were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the countersunk heads formed in the driving of the rivets filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the rivets protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the rivet heads had to be removed in order to obtain <b>flush</b> <b>rivets.</b> A number of requests have been received for a description of the tool used to mill off the protruding portion of the rivet heads. This report contains assembly and detail drawings of the latest flush-rivet milling tool used at the NACA Structures Research Laboratory. Figure 6 shows the tool in operation. This tool is quite satisfactory for 1 / 8 -inch rivets, but a more powerful motor is recommended for use with larger rivets...|$|R

5000|$|The Seversky Aircraft Company, {{which in}} 1939 {{changed its name}} to Republic, {{constructed}} a range of private venture, one-off variants of its P-35 design, featuring different powerplants and enhancements, designated AP-2, AP-7, AP-4 (which flew after the AP-7), AP-9, XP-41. The series included a carrier-based version designated the NF-1 (Naval Fighter 1) that was also built. The most significant of these was the AP-4, which served as the basis for future Seversky/Republic aircraft. It featured fully retractable landing gear, <b>flush</b> <b>riveting,</b> and, most significantly, a Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC2G engine with a belly-mounted turbo-supercharger, producing [...] and good high-altitude performance. The turbo-supercharger had been refined by Boeing as part of the development program for the B-17 Flying Fortress, and the improved performance it offered was of great interest to other aircraft manufacturers.|$|E
