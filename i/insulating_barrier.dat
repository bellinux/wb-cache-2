50|$|Packages for {{microwave}} frequency devices {{are arranged to}} have minimal parasitic inductance and capacitance in their leads. Very-high-impedance devices with ultralow leakage current require packages that do not allow stray current to flow, and may also have guard rings around input terminals. Special isolation amplifier devices include high-voltage <b>insulating</b> <b>barriers</b> between input and output, allowing connection to circuits energized at 1 kV or more.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of cheap}} {{components}} {{was an important}} contributor to the unit's cost. A common failure mode was with the switch contacts, {{making it impossible to}} switch the calculator off. Due to the use of switch contacts made of nickel coated with tin, rather than the gold, an oxide layer would be smeared across the <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier</b> after repeatedly using the switch.|$|E

40|$|We analyze an {{interplay between}} the {{proximity}} effect and quantum interference of electrons in hybrid structures superconductor-normal metal-superconductor which contain several <b>insulating</b> <b>barriers.</b> We {{demonstrate that the}} dc Josephson current in these structures may change qualitatively due to quantum interference of electrons scattered at different interfaces. In junctions with few conducting channels mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent are significant and its amplitude can be strongly enhanced due to resonant effects. In the many channel limit averaging over the scattering phase effectively suppresses interference effects for systems with two <b>insulating</b> <b>barriers.</b> In that case a standard quasiclassical approach describing scattering at interfaces by means of Zaitsev boundary conditions allows to reproduce the correct results. However, in systems with three or more barriers the latter approach fails even in the many channel limit. In such systems interference effects remain important in this limit as well. For short junctions these effects result in additional suppression of the Josephson critical current indicating the tendency of the system towards localization. For relatively long junctions interference effects may [...] on the contrary [...] enhance the supercurrent {{with respect to the}} case of independent barriers. Comment: 14 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
50|$|The Josephson {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} of supercurrent—i.e. a current that flows indefinitely long without any voltage applied—across a device known as a Josephson junction (JJ), which consists of two superconductors coupled by a weak link. The weak link can consist of a thin <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier</b> (known as a superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction, or S-I-S), a short section of non-superconducting metal (S-N-S), or a physical constriction that weakens the superconductivity {{at the point of}} contact (S-s-S).|$|E
5000|$|The DC Josephson effect {{had been}} seen in {{experiments}} prior to 1962, but had been attributed to [...] "super-shorts" [...] or breaches in the <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier</b> leading to the direct conduction of electrons between the superconductors. The first paper to claim the discovery of Josephson's effect, {{and to make the}} requisite experimental checks, was that of Philip Anderson and John Rowell. These authors were awarded patents on the effects that were never enforced, but never challenged.|$|E
50|$|Before Josephson's prediction, it {{was only}} known that normal (i.e. non-superconducting) {{electrons}} can flow through an <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier,</b> by means of quantum tunneling. Josephson {{was the first to}} predict the tunneling of superconducting Cooper pairs. For this work, Josephson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973. Josephson junctions have important applications in quantum-mechanical circuits, such as SQUIDs, superconducting qubits, and RSFQ digital electronics. The NIST standard for one volt is achieved by an array of 20,208 Josephson junctions in series.|$|E

The crucial steps to protect the oxide <b>insulating</b> <b>barriers</b> and avoid side-wall redepositions (which may lead to short circuits) are developed, and important design considerations of the mask patterns and the device geometric structures are elaborated.

50|$|Generally SONOS is {{very similar}} to {{standard}} double polysilicon flash, but hypothetically offers higher quality storage. This is due to the smooth homogeneity of the Si3N4 film compared with polycrystalline film which has tiny irregularities. Flash requires the construction of a very high-performance <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier</b> on the gate leads of its transistors, often requiring as many as nine different steps, whereas the oxide layering in SONOS can be more easily produced on existing lines and more easily combined with CMOS logic.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{excitons}} in a semiconductor have a {{very short}} lifetime due to the close proximity of the electron and hole. However, by placing the electron and hole in spatially separated quantum wells with an <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier</b> layer in between so called 'spatially indirect' excitons can be created. In contrast to ordinary (spatially direct), these spatially indirect excitons can have large spatial separation between the electron and hole, and thus possess a much longer lifetime. This {{is often used to}} cool excitons to very low temperatures in order to study Bose Einstein condensation (or rather its 2 dimensional analog).|$|E
50|$|The {{developmental}} {{trends of}} interface relay technology suggest {{the use of}} opto-isolator as the prevailing design principle of interface relays. An opto-isolator can be implemented {{in terms of an}} LED and a phototransistor (or photothyristor or a photodiode) or a lamp and a photoresistor. An example of an opto-electronic interface relay is shown in the figure. The transparent high voltage <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier</b> provides galvanic isolation of the circuits under the difference of potentials up to 5-7 kV. For higher voltages, they use an optical fiber, the length of which (depending on the voltage level) can take from dozens of centimeters to several meters.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for a phase qubit in an SIFIS junction, {{consisting}} of bulk superconductors (S), a proximity-induced ferromagnet (F), and <b>insulating</b> <b>barriers</b> (I). The qubit state is constituted by 0 and π phase {{states of the}} junction, in which the charging energy of the junction leads to the superposition of the two states. The qubit is operated by the gate voltage applied to the ferromagnet, and insensitive to the decoherence sources existing in other superconducting qubits. We discuss a scalable scheme for qubit measurement and tunable two-qubit coupling. Comment: 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5000|$|A Josephson {{junction}} is {{a tunnel}} junction, made of {{two pieces of}} superconducting metal separated by a very thin <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier,</b> about 1 nm in thickness. The barrier is thin enough that electrons, or in the superconducting state, Cooper-paired electrons, can tunnel through the barrier at an appreciable rate. Each of the superconductors {{that make up the}} Josephson junction is described by a macroscopic wavefunction, as described by the Ginzburg-Landau theory for superconductors. The difference in the complex phases of the two superconducting wavefunctions is the most important dynamic variable for the Josephson junction, and is called the phase difference , or simply [...] "phase".|$|E

50|$|According to {{the laws}} of {{classical}} electrodynamics, no current can flow through an <b>insulating</b> <b>barrier.</b> According {{to the laws}} of quantum mechanics, however, there is a nonvanishing (larger than zero)probability for an electron {{on one side of the}} barrier to reach the other side (see quantum tunnelling). When a bias voltage is applied, this means that there will be a current, and, neglecting additional effects, the tunnelling current will be proportional to the bias voltage. In electrical terms, the tunnel junction behaves as a resistor with a constant resistance, also known as an ohmic resistor. The resistance depends exponentially on the barrier thickness. Typical barrier thicknesses are on the order of one to several nanometers.|$|E

The analysis of the dependence of current on temperature and film thickness allows a distinction of two cases: imperfect and perfect dielectrics. In the former case the mechanism for electron transport is field ionisation of trap-type states at low temperatures and thermal ionisation of this states at higher temperatures.
