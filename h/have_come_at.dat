5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence {{so far from the}} main centres of broch-building is something of a mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> the hands of the Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E

5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E
5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club would have to move to a new stadium five miles away in Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> the perfect time, as, only {{a few days after the}} Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E

25|$|The {{return trip}} to Brazil in 2014 could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a worse {{time from the}} Club's perspective, having been placed under a {{transfer}} embargo for taking out a loan of £100,000 from the PFA on 3 June. On 15 August, City paid of the PFA loan and lifted the transfer embargo that came with it. Later that day, City announced Graham Cummins as their first signing of the summer. On 21 August, Christian Ribeiro became City's second and final summer signing. City were later able to permanently sign loanees Ryan Harley, David Noble and Alex Nicholls; whilst also adding Clinton Morrison and Tom McCready to the squad.|$|E
25|$|Sadly, the {{conditions}} of Ælfgifu's return to fortune remain unclear. It would have been important to know, for instance, how and what on terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. As noted earlier, a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the other holdings were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E

500|$|In November 2009, it was {{reported}} that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the official EastEnders website and in a feature ("Script Peek") where Phil is quoted as saying, [...] "I know exactly what makes her tick" [...] before adding [...] "I've wriggled off her hook so many times. She's already picturing me standing in the dock" [...] in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, [...] "Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a foot out of place all those years ago and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil." [...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I’d just finished a year’s run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice – so it couldn’t <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a better time."

500|$|Quisling {{began to}} {{familiarise}} {{himself with the}} international fascist movement, attending the 1934 Montreux Fascist conference in December. For his party, the association with Italian fascism could not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a worse time, so soon after headlines of illegal Italian incursions into Abyssinia. On his return trip from Montreux, he met Nazi ideologue and foreign policy theorist Alfred Rosenberg, and though he preferred to see his own policies as a synthesis of Italian fascism and German Nazism, {{by the time of}} the 1936 elections, Quisling had in part become the [...] "Norwegian Hitler" [...] that his opponents had long accused him of being. Part of this was due to his hardening anti-Semitic stance, associating Judaism with Marxism, liberalism and, increasingly, anything else he found objectionable, and part as a result of Nasjonal Samling's growing similarity to the German Nazi Party. Despite receiving an unexpected boost when the Norwegian government acceded to Soviet demands to arrest Leon Trotsky, the party's election campaign never gained momentum. Although Quisling sincerely believed he had the support of around 100,000 voters, and declared to his party that they would win an absolute minimum of ten seats, Nasjonal Samling managed to poll just 26,577, fewer than in 1933 when they had fielded candidates in only half the districts. Under this pressure, the party split in two, with Hjort leading the breakaway group; although fewer than fifty members left immediately, many more drifted away during 1937.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} rivalries in women's tennis is the one between Janković and fellow Fed Cup teammate and Serbian compatriot Ana Ivanovic. They have met 12 times, with Ivanovic leading 9–3 overall. Seven of their eleven meetings <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> important stages of tournaments, while two <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> Grand Slam tournaments; Janković trails in both categories 1–6 and 0–2 respectively. Both players were touted as future top players following their breakthrough in 2007 and 2008, however, both have since underperformed on the WTA Tour and dropped out of the Top 10 in contrasting circumstances. Matches between Janković and Ivanovic are often given the nickname [...] "The Battle of Serbia". Since the end of 2008, both have struggled at the Grand Slams, with Janković only being able to reach the semi-finals of the 2010 French Open and the quarter-finals of the 2013 French Open and Ivanovic the quarter-finals of the 2012 US Open and 2014 Australian Open, and the semi-finals of the 2015 French Open.|$|E
