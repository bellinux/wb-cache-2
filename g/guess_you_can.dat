500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. [...] I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 3, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that actor Jorge Garcia {{would be making}} a cameo appearance in an upcoming Fringe episode. Garcia, who previously starred as Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes from J.J. Abrams' Lost, appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter {{at the start of}} the episode. Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, [...] "He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say he's obsessed. And this particular point in time where the episode of Fringe starts, time is fleeting and he's just... under the gun." [...] On his character's possible reappearance, Ruck commented, [...] "I think not... Technically yes , but probably not." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 2002, at UFC 40, {{nearly four}} years after the {{confrontation}} at UFC 19, Shamrock returned to the UFC to fight Ortiz in a title match for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight {{for the first time and}} cut too much weight, weighing in at 201lbs, 4lbs under the 205lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion; [...] "Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter. I was not intimidated by him, but I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say I was a little bit afraid." ...|$|E

6000|$|Babbitt {{shook off}} the affectionate clasp--Sheldy liked to hold hands {{for a long}} time--and snarled, [...] "Well, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>can</b> run the show without me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G'day." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked into}} her face with a pretended anxiety. [...] "Oh, I don't know," [...] she said, with a little scorn. [...] "I <b>guess</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stand it, I can." ...|$|R
2500|$|LSU had 266 {{yards of}} total {{offense in the}} game and Rice {{compiled}} 144. Passing contributed to only 48 yards between both teams as the rainy conditions forced them to stick to the running game. Cannon gained 53 yards on nine carries as the game's leading rusher. The performance by LSU impressed the pollsters, who ranked the team fifteenth after being unranked prior to the game. Coach Dietzel said in the locker room after the game:"It was gratifying to score a victory over a team coached by a man that I respect as much as coach Neely. We made mistakes Saturday night [...] we made up for them in hustle and desire. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sum up what I feel about these boys in four words...I'm proud of them. I do believe that the condition of the playing field and adverse weather conditions prevented either team from finding out their true strength or weaknesses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, {{who seemed}} to {{recognize}} that protests would be useless, [...] "it's quite a long journey. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Mr. Van Reinberg assented, [...] "but the fact's {{there all}} the same. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stay where you are, Mr. Courage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't {{be no one}} else," [...] Jacob Carey said, [...] "as I can see. What do you say, Hiram Powlett? I {{should say}} no one could make a nearer <b>guess</b> than <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> seeing as {{they say it was}} your Ruth as first found it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will toss up a coin," [...] said Walt, [...] "and if <b>you</b> <b>guess</b> right, Glutts, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{take your}} choice of sides, and {{whichever}} side you or Jack Rover select, that side you must stick to from start to finish." ...|$|R
6000|$|Elsa {{laughed a}} very bitter laugh. [...] "Spare your breath," [...] she said, [...] "for if you swore {{it before the}} face of the {{recording}} Angel I would not believe you. Remember that you are the man who betrayed your brother and your benefactor, and then <b>guess,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> what worth I put upon your words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've begun quite satisfactorily," [...] {{said the}} corporal, [...] "and there's {{nothing more to}} be done to-night. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> quit and have supper, boys." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert awarded Best Worst Movie 3 out of 4 {{stars and}} said, [...] "The lesson, I <b>guess,</b> is that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{only be the}} flavor of the month for about 30 days, {{sometimes}} 31. Troll 2 was February." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now for the hotel, {{and there}} I will see if I can't get you fellows some dry clothing," [...] said Bert. [...] "I <b>guess</b> each of <b>you</b> <b>can</b> wear {{one of my}} suits. You are both about my size." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get {{any kind}} you want," [...] {{answered}} his chum. [...] "But don't use it when it's too cold, or the steel will {{stick to your}} skin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{got to get}} somebody, somehow," [...] murmured {{the oldest}} Rover boy. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get New York City, can't you?" [...] he asked, with a faint smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on," [...] said Dan. [...] "Dad don't {{ever let}} me swear, but I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> 'Fore we go ahead, I {{want you to}} say hope you may die if you're lying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks; I <b>guess</b> there's nothing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. Talk {{to these}} frightened girls while I go see what's {{to be done}} with that thick-skulled robber," [...] he replied, and, telling the girls that there was no more danger, he went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've {{no use for}} a {{hotel at}} Green River. Sometimes a rancher comes in for his mail and a survey party jumps off. I <b>guess</b> that's all. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> stop at the post office. The man who keeps it runs a small store." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The first sane {{step was}} to throw myself {{at the feet of}} the King: King said, 'Are you content with me? You see I have kept my word!' I took my Brother by the hand; and entreated the King to restore him his friendship. This scene was so touching, it drew tears from the eyes of everybody. I then {{approached}} the Queen. She was obliged to embrace me, the King being close opposite; but I remarked that her joy was only affected."--Why then, O Princess? <b>Guess,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> the female humors of her Majesty!-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} uncle will say," [...] said Earl. [...] "He {{has gone to}} Dawson, and won't be back before Monday or Tuesday. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stay here till that time." ...|$|E

I can't <b>guess</b> what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly {{have to say to}} me which cannot be said before a third person. However, it wouldn't be civil, I suppose, to say 'No' in my place. You know it's my business to wind up the hall-clock at ten every night. If you choose to come and help me, the chances are that we shall have the hall to ourselves. Will that do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, The Guardian {{film critic}} Peter Bradshaw and Roger Ebert both gave the film mildly {{positive}} reviews. While noting, [...] "Many moviegoers {{are likely to}} like the film less than the discussion it drags them into," [...] Ebert opined, [...] "The crucial difference between Manderlay and the almost unbearable Dogville is not that Trier's politics have changed, but that his sense of mercy for the audience has been awakened." [...] Peter Bradshaw claimed that Manderlay [...] "is a wind-up, but an effective wind-up," [...] and wrote of von Trier's Land of Opportunities trilogy, [...] "My <b>guess</b> is <b>you</b> <b>can</b> throw away {{the first and third}} movies and keep this one." ...|$|R
