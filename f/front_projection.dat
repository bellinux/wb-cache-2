5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the <b>front</b> <b>projection</b> effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), <b>front</b> <b>projection</b> was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E

We {{establish}} {{tools to}} facilitate the computation and application of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra (DGA), a Legendrian-isotopy invariant of Legendrian knots and links in standard contact three-space.

We use our techniques to distinguish between several previously indistinguishable Legendrian knots and links. 1...|$|R

500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI).

500|$|<b>Front</b> <b>projection</b> {{had been}} used in smaller {{settings}} before 2001, mostly for still photography or television production, using small still images and projectors. The expansive backdrops for the African scenes required a screen [...] tall and [...] wide, far larger than {{had been used}} before. When the reflective material was applied to the backdrop in [...] strips, variations at the seams of the strips led to visual artifacts; to solve this, the crew tore the material into smaller chunks and applied them in a random [...] "camouflage" [...] pattern on the backdrop. The existing projectors using [...] transparencies resulted in grainy images when projected that large, so the crew worked with MGM's special effects supervisor Tom Howard to build a custom projector using [...] transparencies, which required the largest water-cooled arc lamp available. The technique was used widely in the film industry afterwards until it was replaced by blue/green screen systems in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Hancock-Wirt-Caskie House, {{also known}} as The William Wirt House, is a {{historic}} home located in Richmond, Virginia.

In 1816, William Wirt (1772-1834) purchased the house and lived there until 1818, when he moved to Washington as Attorney General of the United States under James Monroe. Formerly serving as the headquarters of the Richmond Chapter of the American Red Cross, the house is now a private residence. The last business to occupy this house was the law firm of Bowles and Bowles. The house bears a strong resemblance to Point of Honor in Lynchburg, Virginia.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{singularities}} of the isotropic {{skeleton of a}} Weinstein manifold in relation to Nadler's program of arboreal singularities. By deforming the skeleton via homotopies of the Weinstein structure, we produce a Morse-Bott* representative of the Weinstein homotopy class whose stratified skeleton determines its symplectic neighborhood. We then study the singularities of the skeleta in this class and show that after {{a certain type of}} generic perturbation either (1) these singularities fall into the class of (signed Lagrangian versions of) Nadler's arboreal singularities which are combinatorially classified into finitely many types in a given dimension or (2) there are singularities of tangency in associated <b>front</b> <b>projections.</b> We then turn to the singularities of tangency to try to reduce them also to collections of arboreal singularities. We give a general localization procedure to isolate the Liouville flow to a neighborhood of these non-arboreal singularities, and then show how to replace the simplest singularities of tangency (those of type Σ^ 1, 0) by arboreal singularities.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{the use of}} machine vision in the massive bubble recognition process, which supports the validation of boiling models involving bubble dynamics, as well as nucleation frequency, active site density {{and size of the}} bubbles. The two algorithms presented are meant to be run employing quite standard images of the bubbling process, recorded in general-purpose boiling facilities. The recognition routines are easily adaptable to other facilities if a minimum number of precautions are taken in the setup and in the treatment of the information. Both the side and <b>front</b> <b>projections</b> of subcooled flow-boiling phenomenon over a plain plate are covered. Once all of the intended bubbles have been located in space and time, the proper post-process of the recorded data become capable of tracking each of the recognized bubbles, sketching their trajectories and size evolution, locating the nucleation sites, computing their diameters, and so on. After validating the algorithm’s output against the human eye and data from other researchers, machine vision systems have been demonstrated to be a very valuable option to successfully perform the recognition process, even though the optical analysis of bubbles has not been set as the main goal of the experimental facility...|$|R
