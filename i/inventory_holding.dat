50|$|This {{viewpoint}} {{shows the}} largest {{variations in the}} different models. The main decision variables are quantity-related (production quantity, order quantity, number of options, etc.), but sometimes prices are also decision variables. The parameters can be either constant or stochastic. The most common parameters are related to costs: fixed (ordering or setup) cost, production cost and <b>inventory</b> <b>holding</b> cost. These are optional; many models disregard fixed or <b>inventory</b> <b>holding</b> costs. There exist numerous other parameters: prices for the different contracts, salvage value, shortage penalty, lead-time, etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{motive to}} <b>hold</b> <b>inventories</b> purely {{in the hope}} of {{profiting}} from a price increase is called the speculative motive. This motive has received considerable attention in the literature. However, existing studies do not have a clear implication for how large it is quantitatively. This paper incorporates the speculative motive for <b>holding</b> <b>inventories</b> into an otherwise standard real business cycle model and finds that empirically plausible parameterizations of the model result in an average inventory stock to output ratio that is virtually zero. For this reason, we conclude that the quantitative magnitude of the speculative role for <b>holding</b> <b>inventories</b> in this model is quite small. This suggests the possibility that the study of aggregate economic phenomena can safely abstract from inventory speculation. Business cycles; Inventories...|$|R

5000|$|The {{economic}} production quantity model (also {{known as}} the EPQ model) determines the quantity a company or retailer should order to minimize the total inventory costs by balancing the <b>inventory</b> <b>holding</b> cost and average fixed ordering cost. The EPQ model was developed by E.W. Taft in 1918. This method {{is an extension of}} the economic order quantity model (also {{known as the}} EOQ model). The difference between these two methods is that the EPQ model assumes the company will produce its own quantity or the parts are going to be shipped to the company while they are being produced, therefore the orders are available or received in an incremental manner while the products are being produced. While the EOQ model assumes the order quantity arrives complete and immediately after ordering, meaning that the parts are produced by another company and are ready to be shipped when the order is placed. [...] In some literature, [...] "economic manufacturing quantity" [...] model (EMQ) is used for [...] "economic production quantity" [...] model (EPQ). Similar to the EOQ model, EPQ is a single product lot scheduling method. A multiproduct extension to these models is called product cycling problem.|$|E

30|$|Since DCMS and PP {{decisions}} are interrelated {{and may not}} be handled sequentially (Safaei and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam 2009; Defersha and Chen 2008 b), some of the PP attributes such as <b>inventories</b> <b>holding</b> and outsourcing of parts are incorporated to the extended model. The effects of incorporated design features on improving the performance of a DCMS have been also illustrated by (Kia 2014). For example, regarding the number of formed cells as decision variable can considerably improve the performance of a CMS by reducing forming cell cost. Furthermore, machine depot can be effective in improving the performance of a DCMS by reducing machine overhead cost and configuring cells more usefully because of removing idle machines from cells. Additionally, production planning decisions have been shown as improving strategies by satisfying high-volume demands because of leveling machine utilization in different periods. It is worth mentioning, because of the dynamic nature of PP problems, the integration of the CMS and PP makes the problem very complex and computationally hard.|$|R
40|$|Zero {{inventory}} (ZI) and {{the related}} concepts of Just in Time and Kanban are innovative and powerful means to improve production efficiency. This paper applies these concepts to a series facility production system and, in particular, identifies which facilities will never <b>hold</b> <b>inventory</b> irrespective of product demand. Pinpointing beforehand that certain facilities will have no inventory can simplify such strategic decisions as facility design, site location, and space utilization, plus it eases production scheduling. Next, a procedure is developed which increases the number of facilities that will never <b>hold</b> <b>inventory.</b> This procedure implements the ZI philosophy of cutting set up costs to increase efficiency. The results of this paper impact three major areas of production research: (1) strategy and planning [...] -by detecting beforehand facilities that need never <b>hold</b> <b>inventory</b> irrespective of demand; (2) operations [...] -by simplifying day to day production scheduling; and (3) productivity improvement [...] -by cutting set up costs to enhance efficiency. inventory/production: just-in-time, facilities/equipment: planning, networks/graphs: applications...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{strategic}} role of inventory in a sequential two-period procurement setting, where the supplier's {{capacity in the}} first period is limited and the retailer has the option to <b>hold</b> <b>inventory.</b> We compare the equilibrium under a dynamic contract, where the decisions are made {{at the beginning of each}} period, and a commitment contract, where the decisions for both periods are made at the beginning of the first period. We show that there is a critical capacity level below which the outcomes under both types of contracts are identical. When the first period capacity is above the critical level, the retailer <b>holds</b> <b>inventory</b> in equilibrium and the inventory is carried due to purely strategic reasons; as capacity increases, so does the strategic role of inventory. The supplier always prefers lower capacity than the retailer, and the difference between supplier-optimal and supply-chain optimal capacities, and the corresponding profits, can be significant. Finally, we find that the retailer's flexibility to <b>hold</b> <b>inventory</b> is not always good for the participants or for the channel. Copyright Â© 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{additional}} variables, such as size and liquidity, influence the imbalanceâreturn relation. Adverse selection effects, e.g., are presumably weaker for large firms and liquid stocks due to better analystsâ coverage (Huang etÂ al. 2012,Â p.Â  9584) or a stronger presence of informed traders (Kyle 1985,Â pp.Â  1317 â 1320). However, the impact of liquidity on <b>inventory</b> <b>holding</b> effects is still unclear. On the one hand, <b>inventory</b> <b>holding</b> effects could be stronger for illiquid stocks because liquidity providers face difficulties in offloading undesired inventories (Jiang etÂ al. 2011,Â p.Â  475). On the other hand, stronger herding may lead to amplified <b>inventory</b> <b>holding</b> effects for highly liquid stocks (see Keim and Madhavan 1995,Â p.Â  385 or Bailey etÂ al. 2006,Â p.Â  14).|$|E
