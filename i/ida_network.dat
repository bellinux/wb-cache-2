40|$|Summary. Accelerograms {{from the}} <b>IDA</b> <b>network</b> have been {{processed}} to obtain 2193 multiplet locations (apparent centre frequencies) for the funda-mental spheroidal modes J 5 -oS 43. Great circles connecting the 72 source-receiver pairs {{provide a good}} sampling of the Earth’s major tectonic regions, although the distribution of their poles is biased to high latitudes. Estimates of the degenerate eigenfrequencies, corrected for this bias, are significantly greater than Gilbert & Dziewonski’s values for 1 > 10. The differences between the observed degenerate eigenfrequencies and those calculated for radial reference models display jumps between and oSll and between oSls and oS 19 that cannot be explained by radial Earth structure or random noise processes; we attribute these jumps to Coriolis coupling between oSl and oq+ The RMS relative scatter in the multiplet location measurements, corrected for noise, decreases from about 1. 4 x for 1 Q 10 to about 0. 8 x for 1 = 40 and is evidently caused by aspherical heterogeneities in the Earth’s crust and mantle. Corrections for hydrostatic ellipticity signifi...|$|E
40|$|The Global Digital Seismograph Network (GDSN), which {{consists}} of the Seismic Research Observatories, the Abbreviated Seismic Research Observatories, and the Digital World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network stations, and the International Deployment Accelerometers (<b>IDA)</b> <b>network,</b> which is operated by the University of California, produce digital seismic data in overlapping bands from short to tidal periods. GDSN and IDA data are available through national and regional data centers, the GDSN data on network-day tapes and the IDA data on bimonthly network tapes. The digital waveforms are being used in research applications that benefit from the high resolution and wide dynamic range of the data, and the ease and speed with which large volumes of digital data can be processed. The usefulness of the data is being enhanced by special processing techniques that overcome some of the constraints of band-limited recording. GDSN improvements under study include an increase in short-period bandwidth, addition of horizontal short-period recording, and the recording of very long-period signals at SRO stations. Several additional stations with borehole seismometers are planned, possibly with satellite data telemetry to the United States. However, in the future, the most likely source of new GDSN data is through the acquisition of digital data from independently operated national and regional networks that are being installed or contemplated in several countries, including the United States...|$|E
40|$|Spectra of mantle Rayleigh waves {{recorded}} on the <b>IDA</b> <b>network</b> are inverted {{to determine the}} seismic moment tensor of the 9 June 1980 California-Mexico Border earthquake, the 29 July 1980 Vanuatu Islands earthquake, and the 9 July 1980 Santa Cruz Islands earthquake. Examinations are made to correct for phase velocity lateral heterogeneity and source process time. A simple regionalization (stable continent, tectonic region, young ocean, and old ocean) improves results of the linear inversion, but the phase correction is not large enough, and the discontinuous change of phase velocity across the boundary between regions causes an artificial rapid change in apparent phase velocity {{as a function of}} azimuth. Therefore, a more detailed but gradual representation of the lateral heterogeneity is desirable to correct for the propagation effect in the linear inversion. A source process time which consists of the nondirectional part of the apparent duration of main faulting and the delay time of the faulting from initial break is estimated by a phase analysis of Rayleigh waves. The source process time is generally proportional to the seismic moment on the log-log scale, but some earthquakes deviate considerably from the general relation. Therefore, the measurement of the source process time should be made before the moment tensor inversion. The phase errors introduced by the lateral heterogeneity and source process time may cause a bias to low scalar moment...|$|E

40|$|The source {{mechanism}} {{of a large}} (M_s = 7. 2) earthquake {{that occurred in the}} oceanic plate at the junction of the Tonga—Kermadec trench systems with the aseismic Louisville ridge is found by inverting long-period vertical-component Rayleigh waves recorded by the <b>IDA</b> <b>network.</b> The solution is an almost-pure normal fault, on a plane striking roughly parallel to the trench axis, with seismic moment of 1. 7 × 10 ^(27) dyn cm, and thus is among the ten largest documented shallow normal-fault earthquakes. A point-source depth of 20 km for the event is resolved by modeling teleseismic body waves; the actual rupture may have extended deeper, to 30 or 40 km. The earthquake was a multiple event, consisting of two sources separated by 16 s. A rupture velocity of 3. 5 km s− 1 is inferred. The earthquake can be interpreted as tensional failure in the shallow portion of the downgoing plate caused by the gravitational pull of the slab. The Louisville ridge may be creating a local degree of decoupling of the oceanic plate from the overriding plate, and/or a zone of extension within the slab, which could enhance the effect of the gravitational forces in the shallower part of the downgoing plate. In particular, the earthquake could be associated with the break-up of the leading seamount of the ridge, which is currently right at the trench. Alternatively, the earthquake may have been caused by stresses associated with the bending of the plate prior to subduction...|$|E
40|$|The teleseismic {{records of}} three strong {{earthquakes}} which inflicted heavy damage {{and loss of}} many thousands of lives in northeastern Iran during 1978 and 1979 are analyzed. The observed R_ 2 and R_ 3 phases of the 16 September 1978 Tabas earthquake across the <b>IDA</b> <b>network</b> are inverted to derive the gross source parameters of the main shock. The synthetic seismograms computed for the inferred source model are compared with observations. The agreement is generally good at most of the stations. However, unexpected asymmetrical observations at ESK, CMO, KIP, and PFO stations cannot be explained by directivity alone. Possible factors responsible for these observations may include regional heterogeneities or the departure of fault plane from simple planar geometry. The resulting focal mechanism agrees with nearly pure reverse mechanism with a NW-SE strike. The seismic moment estimate for this earthquake is about 1. 5 × 10 ^(27) dyne-cm (M_w = 7. 4). The seismic moment of the same earthquake obtained from long-period P-wave observations at six WWSSN stations is smaller than the above estimate {{by a factor of}} 2. Starting with the geologic field data of the Qainat earthquakes of 14 and 27 November 1979, the R_ 2 and G_ 2 phases on the ultra-long-period instruments at Pasadena and Berkeley are analyzed to estimate their seismic source moments. The estimated values are 1. 0 × 10 ^(26) dyne-cm for the 14 November and 8. 0 × 10 ^(26) dyne-cm for the 27 November 1979 events. Their corresponding moment magnitudes are 6. 6 and 7. 2, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The seismic {{moment and}} source {{orientation}} of the 8 November 1980 Eureka, California, earthquake (Ms = 7. 2) are determined using long-period surface and body wave data obtained from the SRO, ASRO, and <b>IDA</b> <b>networks.</b> The favorable azimuthal distribution of the recording stations allows a well-constrained mech-anism {{to be determined by}} a simultaneous moment tensor inversion of the Love and Rayleigh wave observations. The shallow depth of the event precludes determination of the full moment tensor, but constraining Mzx = May = 0 and using a point source at 16 -km depth gives a major double couple for period T = 256 sec with scalar moment Mo = 1. 1 • 1027 dyne-cm and a left-lateral vertical strike-slip orientation trending N 48. 2 °E.

40|$|The 22 June 1977 (Mw = 8. 2) Tonga {{earthquake}} has {{the longest}} rupture duration ever reported for a normal fault event. The 150 -km depth range spanned by aftershocks {{of the earthquake}} is also unusually large. There has been substantial controversy over both the depth and duration of faulting for this great event, obscuring its tectonic significance. We study the source process of the Tonga event using long-period Rayleigh waves recorded by the Global Digital Seismo-graph Network (GDSN) and International Deployment of Accelerometers (<b>IDA)</b> <b>networks.</b> For a standard assumption of a Haskell source, a total duration of 84 -+ 4 sec is obtained using a least-squares inversion method. We introduce {{the use of the}} spectral amplitude as a weighting factor in measuring the misfit between the data and a given source finiteness model, which reduces the scatter and improves the resolution of source duration determined from data ranging in period from 150 to 300 sec. Using a more realistic shape for the source-time function in the inversion (drawing upon results from body-wave analysis) reveals a much longer (165 -sec process time) component of the source process of the Tonga earthquake. The fundamental mode Rayleigh waves do not resolve any horizontal source directivity. However, the centroid depth of the earthquake is well resolved as 96 km with 90 per cent confidence range (93, 104 km). The estimated error in the depth determination due to the uncertainties in the source finiteness and earth models is only a few kilometers. The results indicate that the rupture of the earthquake excited long-period seismic waves at depths somewhat greater than the 70 to 80 km depth range where the primary body-wave radiation occurred, favoring rupture on the steeply dipping plane of the focal mechanism. The fundamental mode Rayleigh waves with periods longer than 150 sec cannot resolve vertical extent of the faulting; however, additional information from body-wave and free oscillation analyses indicates a vertical fault extent of about 50 km with a frequency-dependent variation in seismic radiation with depth...|$|R

40|$|The depths {{and source}} {{mechanisms}} of nine large shallow earthquakes were determined from long-period (150 to 300 s) Rayleigh waves {{recorded by the}} Global Digital Seismograph Network (GDSN) and International Deployment of Accelerometers (<b>IDA)</b> <b>networks.</b> We inverted the data set of complex source spectra for a moment tensor (linear) or a double couple (nonlinear). By solving a least squares problem, we obtained the centroid depth or {{the extent of the}} distributed source for each earthquake. The depths and source mechanisms of large shallow earthquakes determined from long-period Rayleigh waves depend on the models of source finiteness, wave propagation, and excitation. We tested various models of source finiteness, Q, group velocity, and excitation in the determination of earthquake depths. In order to determine the depth of large earthquakes from long-period surface waves, source-finiteness effects must be corrected using adequate models. The depth estimates obtained using the Q model of Dziewonski and Steim (1982) and the excitation functions computed for the average ocean model of Regan and Anderson (1984) are considered most reasonable. Dziewonski and Steim's Q model represents a good global average of Q determined over a period range of the Rayleigh waves used in this study. Since most of the earthquakes studied here occurred in subduction zones, Regan and Anderson's average ocean model is considered most appropriate. Our depth estimates are in general consistent with the Harvard centroid-moment tensor (CMT) solutions. The centroid depths and their 90 % confidence intervals (numbers in parentheses) determined by the Student's t test are Colombia-Ecuador earthquake (December 12, 1979), d = 11 km (9, 24 km); Santa Cruz Island earthquake (July 17, 1980), d = 36 km (18, 46 km); Samoa earthquake (September 1, 1981), d = 15 km (9, 26 km); Playa Azul, Mexico, earthquake (October 25, 1981), d = 41 km (28, 49 km); El Salvador earthquake (June 19, 1982), d = 49 km (41, 55 km); New Ireland earthquake (March 18, 1983), d = 75 km (72, 79 km); Chagos Bank earthquake (November 30, 1983), d = 31 km (16, 41 km); Valparaiso, Chile, earthquake (March 3, 1985), d = 44 km (15, 54 km); Michoacan, Mexico, earthquake (September 19, 1985), d = 24 km (12, 34 km) ...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} {{an outcome of}} the author’s own {{reflections}} and efforts {{to come to terms}} with his experience working as the National Project Coordinator of the Industrial Cluster Development Program of an international donor agency in Pakistan, the IDA, for more than 8 years between 2001 and 2009. Thus, the author seeks to answer two interrelated questions in this thesis: a) How did the IDA interventions affect SME networks in the Lahore garments and Sialkot football clusters in Pakistan? b) Why did the IDA-supported SME networks in these clusters continue or discontinue after the IDA withdrew from both clusters? In this thesis, it is argued that a very limited number of empirical studies have addressed the subject of private sector development aid in industrial clusters in developing countries. In particular, very few studies aim at studying the sustainability of donor-financed interventions in industrial clusters in the Global South. Two articles in the thesis are dedicated to extending the very limited existing work on this topic. Both articles – the first on the Lahore garments cluster and the second on the Sialkot football manufacturing cluster in Pakistan – seek to analyze how the IDA’s interventions affected the long-term sustainability of SME networks present in both clusters. In the case of the Lahore garments cluster, the <b>IDA</b> supported two <b>networks</b> in the cluster.

The shallow depth of the event precludes determination of the full moment tensor, but constraining M_(zx) = M_(zy) = 0 and using a point source at 16 -km depth gives a major double couple for period T = 256 sec with scalar moment M_(0) = 1. 1 · 10 ^(27) dyne-cm and a left-lateral vertical strike-slip orientation trending N 48. 2 °E. The choice of fault planes is {{made on the basis of}} the aftershock distribution. This solution is insensitive to the depth of the point source for depths less than 33 km. Using the moment tensor solution as a starting model, the Rayleigh and Love wave amplitude data alone are inverted in order to fine-tune the solution. This results in a slightly larger scalar moment of 1. 28 · 10 ^(27) dyne-cm, but insignificant (< 5 °) changes in strike and dip. The rake is not well enough resolved to indicate significant variation from the pure strike-slip solution. Additional amplitude inversions of the surface waves at periods ranging from 75 to 512 sec yield a moment estimate of 1. 3 ± 0. 2 · 10 ^(27) dyne-cm, and a similar strike-slip fault orientation. The long-period P and SH waves recorded at SRO and ASRO stations are utilized to determine the seismic moment for 15 - to 30 -sec periods. A deconvolution algorithm developed by Kikuchi and Kanamori (1982) is used to determine the time function for the first 180 sec of the P and SH signals. The SH data are more stable and indicate a complex bilateral rupture with at least four subevents. The dominant first subevent has a moment of 6. 4 · 10 ^(26) dyne-cm. Summing the moment of this and the next three subevents, all of which occur in the first 80 sec of rupture, yields a moment of 1. 3 · 10 ^(27) dyne-cm. Thus, when the multiple source character of the body waves is taken into account, the seismic moment for the Eureka event throughout the period range 15 to 500 sec is 1. 3 ± 0. 2 · 10 ^(27) dyne-cm...|$|R

Various models {{employed}} in greenhouse gases are either to determine the causative factors responsible for emission, forecast emission or to optimize. Integrating these models would reduce the limitations of individual models to better assess possible greenhouse mitigation.

The current work offers a different technique based on an integrated model utilizing the functions of Index Decomposition Analysis (<b>IDA),</b> Artificial Neural <b>Network</b> (ANN) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) composed of activity, structure, intensity and energy-mix as inputs responsible for CO 2 emission.

40|$|Source {{mechanisms}} of 26 large shallow earthquakes are determined {{in terms of}} a double-couple point source with a correction for the nondirectional part of source finiteness by using P-wave first motions and long-period Rayleigh wave spectra recorded on WWSSN, <b>IDA,</b> and GDSN <b>networks.</b> The combined use of both data sets allows us to determine the double-couple mechanism uniquely in most cases. Constrained linear moment tensor inversion (M_(xz) = M_(yz) = 0) correctly determines the strike of the fault, but fails to estimate the dip, and underestimates the scalar moment. All thrust events along the deep-sea trenches analyzed in this study show nodal planes which dip perpendicular to the trench axis at an angle shallower than 45 °. The fit to data of the double-couple inversion is comparable to that of the constrained moment tensor inversion. Using the phase spectra of surface waves we can detect a slow source process with an accuracy of about 10 to 20 sec...|$|R
