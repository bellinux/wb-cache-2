'The film was {{about a man who}} thinks he has committed murder; Thompson also wrote the screenplay, based on his own play, <b>Double</b> <b>Error.</b> In the words of Thompson's Screenonline profile [...] "this well structured film went largely unnoticed but contained many of the themes which were to characterise Lee Thompson's work: a good person's struggle with their conscience, an external force of evil, and an out-of-character moment of violence which has long-term consequences. Believing people can [...] "commit crimes without being criminals", he sought to make his audiences condone or at least understand behaviour that they would normally condemn." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ferry favours {{the opinion}} that Voyager misjudged the {{manoeuvring}} room she had. He claims that the destroyer knew where she was in relation to Melbourne and that the turn to starboard then reversal to port {{was intended to be}} a [...] "fishtail" [...] manoeuvre. Voyager was to swing out wide of the carrier, then turn back towards her, cross the stern and assume her position without having to do a loop. However, insufficient time was allowed for Voyager to get clear of Melbourne before turning back to port, so instead of passing behind Melbourne, the destroyer passed in front. Ferry's theory eliminates the need for a <b>double</b> <b>error</b> in the communications signals, and the need for all on the destroyer's bridge to have such a vastly incorrect assumption of where Voyager was in relation to the carrier.|$|E

60|$|An {{incident}} {{which occurred}} {{immediately after the}} action did much to rob the British of {{the fruits of the}} victory. Artillery had pushed up the moment that the hill was carried, and had unlimbered on Smith's Nek between the two hills, from which the enemy, in broken groups of 50 and 100, could be seen streaming away. A fairer chance for the use of shrapnel has never been. But at this instant there ran from an old iron church on the reverse side of the hill, which had been used all day as a Boer hospital, a man with a white flag. It is probable that the action was in good faith, and that it was simply intended to claim a protection for the ambulance party which followed him. But the too confiding gunner in command appears to have thought that an armistice had been declared, and held his hand during those precious minutes which might have turned a defeat into a rout. The chance passed, never to return. The <b>double</b> <b>error</b> of firing into our own advance and of failing to fire into the enemy's retreat makes the battle one which cannot be looked back to with satisfaction by our gunners.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Brandeis. The new actor was Brandeis, a Bavarian {{captain of}} artillery, {{of a romantic}} and adventurous character. He had served with credit in war; but soon wearied of {{garrison}} life, resigned his battery, came to the States, found employment as a civil engineer, visited Cuba, took a sub-contract on the Panama canal, caught the fever, and came (for {{the sake of the}} sea voyage) to Australia. He had that natural love for the tropics which lies so often latent in persons of a northern birth; difficulty and danger attracted him; and when he was picked out for secret duty, to be the hand of Germany in Samoa, there is no doubt but he accepted the post with exhilaration. It is doubtful if a better choice could have been made. He had courage, integrity, ideas of his own, and loved the employment, the people, and the place. Yet there was a fly in the ointment. The <b>double</b> <b>error</b> of unnecessary stealth and of the immixture of a trading company in political affairs, has vitiated, and in the end defeated, much German policy. And Brandeis was introduced to the islands as a clerk, and sent down to Leulumoenga (where he was soon drilling the troops and fortifying the position of the rebel king) as an agent of the German firm. What this mystification cost in the end I shall tell in another place; and even in the beginning, it deceived no one. Brandeis is a man of notable personal appearance; he looks the part allotted him; and the military clerk was soon the centre of observation and rumour. Malietoa wrote and complained of his presence to Becker, who had succeeded Dr. Stuebel in the consulate. Becker replied, [...] "I {{have nothing to do with}} the gentleman Brandeis. Be it well known that the gentleman Brandeis has no appointment in a military character, but resides peaceably assisting the government of Leulumoenga in their work, for Brandeis is a quiet, sensible gentleman." [...] And then he promised to send the vice-consul to [...] "get information of the captain's doings": surely supererogation of deceit.|$|E
60|$|This rude {{handling}} of accepted commonplace is always {{one of the}} most interesting features in Rousseau's polemic. It was of course a characteristic of the eighteenth century always to take up the ethical and high prudential view of whatever had to be justified, and Rousseau seems from this point to have been successful in demolishing arguments which might hold of Greek tragedy at its best, but which certainly do not hold of any other dramatic forms. The childishness of the old criticism which attaches the label of some moral from the copybook to each piece, as its lesson and point of moral aim, is evident. In repudiating this Rousseau was certainly right.[350] Both the assailants and the defenders of the stage, however, commit the <b>double</b> <b>error,</b> first of supposing that the drama is always the same thing, from the Agamemnon down to the last triviality of a London theatre, and next of pitching the discussion in too high a key, as if the effect or object of a stage play in the modern era, where grave sentiment clothes itself in other forms, were substantially anything more serious than an evening's amusement. Apart from this, and in so far as the discussion is confined to the highest dramatic expression, the true answer to Rousseau is now a very plain one. The drama does not work in the sphere of direct morality, though like everything else in the world it has a moral or immoral aspect. It is an art of ideal presentation, not concerned with the inculcation of immediate practical lessons, but producing a stir in all our sympathetic emotions, quickening the imagination, and so communicating a wider life to the character of the spectator. This is what the drama in the hands of a worthy master does; it is just what noble composition in music does, and there is no more directly moralising effect in the one than in the other. You must trust to the sum of other agencies to guide the interest and sympathy thus quickened into channels of right action. Rousseau, like most other controversialists, makes an attack of which the force rests on the assumption that the special object of the attack is the single influencing element and the one decisive instrument in making men had or good. What he says about the drama would only be true if the public went to the play all day long, and were accessible to no other moral force whatever, modifying and counteracting such lessons as they might learn at the theatre. He failed here as in the wider controversy on the sciences and arts, to consider the particular subject of discussion in relation to the whole of the general medium in which character moves, and by whose manifold action and reaction it is incessantly affected and variously shaped.|$|E

50|$|ECC DIMMs {{are those}} that have extra data bits {{which can be used}} by the system memory {{controller}} to detect and correct errors. There are numerous ECC schemes, but perhaps the most common is Single Error Correct, <b>Double</b> <b>Error</b> Detect (SECDED) which uses an extra byte per 64-bit word. ECC modules usually carry a multiple of 9 instead of a multiple of 8 chips.|$|E
50|$|There is no evidence, however, {{for either}} of these two identifications. The subject of the {{painting}} is indicated as being 59 years old in 1639 and would, therefore, have been born about 1580, thereby ruling out both Williams and Clarke. Asher proposes that the dates on the painting are a mistake for 1659, but he advances no rationale for how such a curious <b>double</b> <b>error</b> could have come about.|$|E
50|$|To remedy this shortcoming, Hamming codes can be {{extended}} by an extra parity bit. This way, {{it is possible to}} increase the minimum distance of the Hamming code to 4, which allows the decoder to distinguish between single bit errors and two-bit errors. Thus the decoder can detect and correct a single error {{and at the same time}} detect (but not correct) a <b>double</b> <b>error.</b> If the decoder does not attempt to correct errors, it can detect up to three errors.|$|E

50|$|Some vendors, {{including}} Intel, use {{the term}} lockstep memory to describe a multi-channel memory layout in which cache lines are distributed between two memory channels, so {{one half of the}} cache line is stored in a DIMM on the first channel, while the second half goes to a DIMM on the second channel. By combining the single error correction and <b>double</b> <b>error</b> detection (SECDED) capabilities of two ECC-enabled DIMMs in a lockstep layout, their single-device data correction (SDDC) nature can be extended into double-device data correction (DDDC), providing protection against the failure of any single memory chip.|$|E

40|$|Present {{microsatellite}} experiments {{generate a}} significant amount of data. Microsatellite on-board computers shall have large mass memory to store data while the satellite is not in ground visibility. Space radiation affects high-density memories destroying stored data (single event upset- SEU). Error Detecting and Correcting Circuit (EDAC) by adding some circuit and memory may detect and correct these errors. However, this strategy requires a large number of components. So that, microsatellite constraints of mass, power and volume lead to a software approach to protect memory against errors mainly induced by space radiation. A proposed technic uses software that implements Hamming code to protect the data memory. A comparison between the Reed-Solomon method and the proposed technic is also presented. This new approach detects single and <b>double</b> <b>errors,</b> corrects single errors and logs events by dividing the data memory into blocks of 256 words with 32 bits, nine of them used to check.

50|$|In {{perhaps the}} most-harshly worded critique, British philosopher Jeremy Weate, {{writing in the}} journal African Identities, critiques the textual {{approach}} of On the Postcolony and of postcolonial theory more broadly. He argues that postcolonial theory is “presently trapped within a self-referential inscriptive paradigm” that cannot recognize non-textual phenomena. On the Postcolony lacks a coherent and clearly defined theoretical position, he maintains, instead occupying “an ambiguous (and ambivalent) space somewhere between post-structuralism and existential phenomenology” which results in a “theoretically confused” project “devoid of productive existential engagement.” Weate also takes issue with {{what he sees as}} Mbembe’s erasure of intellectual predecessors and contemporaries (like Hountondji), which he traces partly to “an overreliance on a specific understanding of the intellectual” which erases everyday and grassroots resistance and results in an attempt to “theorise... effectively from a blank slate.” Although Weate concedes that On the Postcolony’s “partially occluded phenomenological/Deleuzian influence” provides a path forward for critical theory, he ultimately condemns the book as “doomed to failure” because “it commits the <b>double</b> <b>error</b> of attempting to erase the past completely, as well as not providing any substantive ground for further development.” In a response published in the same journal, Mbembe describes Weate’s critique as “probably one of the least imaginative and most misleading rejoinders to the book,” disputing Weate's assertions and philosophical understanding of his book.|$|E
