5|$|Since Catarina was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Three people were confirmed to have perished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Although Ivan was a {{powerful}} storm at landfall, its effects were relatively minor compared to the storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. Agricultural industries sustained the most severe damage, as thousands of animals drowned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Total damage was estimated at $9.6million (1997 USD; $13.1million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm.|$|E
5|$|On August5, Hurricane Connie {{began to}} become an {{apparent}} threat to the northeastern Caribbean Islands, with maximum winds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> reaching 125mph (205km/h). The National Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for Barbuda, Saba and Antigua. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were placed on hurricane alert as warnings were possible later that day.

5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E
5|$|The {{strongest and}} most notorious {{tropical}} {{system of the}} season was the second tropical cyclone, which peaked as a Category3 hurricane. The storm devastated southwestern Louisiana in early August, especially Cameron Parish, leaving 34fatalities and approximately $5million (1918USD) in damage. In late August, the season's third tropical storm damaged portions of coastal North Carolina, causing up to $15,000 in damage. Although the fifth tropical storm or its extratropical remnants caused only minor impacts on land in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada, 21people drowned after two ships were caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was first}} {{seen by the}} ship Addie Barnes on August19 in the western Atlantic Ocean, about midway between the southeastern Bahamas and Bermuda. It headed northwestward, causing heavy rains and damage to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but remained offshore. It turned northeastward and made landfall near Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Several vessels were struck by the hurricane. The American brig Bainbridge capsized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> off Hatteras early on August21 {{with the loss of}} 80lives. The sole survivor was picked up by the South Boston on the evening of August22. The ship American Congress encountered this hurricane on August22 off Georges Bank. On August23, the Minor was wrecked {{on the south side of}} St Paul Island, off the northeastern tip of Nova Scotia. Two ships, including the Ashburton recorded a barometric pressure of , the lowest in relation to the storm.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the mountainous}} {{northern}} Barlavento Islands, Fred produced gusty winds and downpours; São Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h)—the highest recorded wind speed from the hurricane. Rainfall on that island was moderate, peaking at 3.5in (90mm) at Juncalinho. Many old trees were uprooted, a few landslides took place, and several villages lost power on that island. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked {{the roof of}} a church in the village of Cabeçalinho. In Ribeira Brava, São Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farm, leaving several families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carriçal, similar effects were felt as torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of São Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortelã, was lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Damage to property and agriculturein particular banana and sugarcaneon the island reached CVE$50million ($500,000).|$|E
5|$|At noon on 9 February, while {{cruising}} independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off {{the coast}} of Nevis. Upon approach it was evident that the vessel was flying American colors, and Constellation attempted to move closer to investigate. The frigate was the French L'Insurgente under Michel-Pierre Barreaut. Approaching L'Insurgente, Truxtun signaled her to discern her nationality, first displaying British signals followed by the American signals. L'Insurgente replaced the American colors with the French and fired a gun, the purpose of which was unclear. Truxtun claimed L'Insurgente's shot was fired to windward to signal a fight, while Barreaut claimed he ordered the shot fired to leeward to signal that he wished to communicate. Regardless, Barreaut mistook the Constellation for a British warship and fled toward the Dutch islands of Saba and Sint Eustatius to escape, while Truxtun gave chase. By 1:30p.m. both ships had sailed into a gale. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> L'Insurgente was damaged and lost her main topmast. Constellation came through unscathed and continued to close on Barreaut.|$|E
5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> {{related to the}} small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E
