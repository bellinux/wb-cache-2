5|$|Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers {{opening on}} March 14, 1998, {{making it the}} world's first Dive Coaster. The trains <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of coaster are {{relatively}} short consisting of two to three cars. Bolliger & Mabillard have recently begun to also use floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience. As of May 2016, ten Dive Coasters have been built, with the newest being Valravn at Cedar Point.|$|E
5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice {{recorder}} was recovered from the wreckage and the data recorded found to be intact and usable. Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of flight and one had not been installed.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{and profits}} grew {{year-on-year}} {{during the early}} 1950s. The prepayment from the government was repaid in 1952. For a short time, VAT imported and marketed clearing tractors produced by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Although there was demand <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of vehicle, they sold poorly because their price was considered inconsistent with their technical quality; only a few units were delivered in 1953.|$|E

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club {{was founded}} by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed {{standard}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of terrier. The club was formed {{with the aim of}} promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E

5|$|The coaster's seven trains {{double the}} {{capacity}} of the traditional El Loco ride from 4 seats per train to 8 seats per train. The trains are articulated {{in such a way that}} the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the head rest. These speakers are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are harnessed to the ride through the use of lap bars. The front of each car features a pulsing LED Green Lantern logo while the back of each car features the Green Lantern oath. All of these operational and thematic characteristics are new <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of ride and were developed specifically for this coaster.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{originally}} operated at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky from 1997 to 2009, {{where it}} was known as Chang. Upon opening in 1997, it set world records <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of coaster in height, drop, speed, length and number of inversions. The introduction of the ride caused Kentucky Kingdom to achieve record attendance levels. After Six Flags abandoned Kentucky Kingdom in 2009, the ride was relocated to Six Flags Great Adventure. The ride debuted in 2011 as Green Lantern, replacing the former Great American Scream Machine roller coaster.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, {{one of the}} 707s transported 300 Australian Army {{personnel}} in two flights to Namibia {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines. On 29October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time. No.33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In China, the {{art form}} has been known by many other names in {{different}} times and places. The earliest Chinese name {{was a combination of}} the Xipi and Erhuang melodies, and was called Pi Huang. As it increased in popularity, its name became Jingju or Jingxi, which reflected its start in the capital city, Jing, and the form of the performance, Xi. From 1927 to 1949, Beijing was known as Beiping, and Peking opera was known as Pingxi or Pingju (Traditional 平劇, Simplified 平剧) to reflect this change. Finally, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing, and the formal name of Beijing theatre in Mainland China was established as Jingju. The Taiwanese name <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of opera, Guoju, national theatre style, reflects disputes over the true seat of the Chinese government.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E

5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of vehicle.|$|E
