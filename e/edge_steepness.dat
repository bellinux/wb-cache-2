40|$|Short {{wavelength}} filtering {{based on}} the anti-guide property of a depressed-index core photonic crystal fiber is studied. A type of fiber filter is formed by adding a depressed-index domain {{to the core of}} an index-guiding photonic crystal fiber. The dependencies of normalized cutoff wavelength and <b>edge</b> <b>steepness</b> on the structural parameters of the fiber filter are investigated. A better quality of cutoff (lower <b>edge</b> <b>steepness),</b> a larger normalized cutoff wavelength and a wider range of normalized cutoff wavelength can be realized by increasing the relative cladding air-hole diameter. Fiber filters with the normalized cutoff wavelength (cutoff wavelength/pitch) covering ∼ 0. 0514 to 0. 5 and the <b>edge</b> <b>steepness</b> below 5 % (industry standard) are demonstrated numerically. In addition, bending effect and problem caused by the existence of the photonic bandgap mode which may influence the feasibility of the filtering mechanism are considered.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{operation of a}} photon scanning tunneling microscope with an atomic force microscope is presented. The use of standard atomic force silicon nitride cantilevers as near-field optical probes offers the possibility to combine the two methods. Vertical forces and torsion are detected simultaneously with the optical near field, which allows a comparison between topography and the optical signal. Images of an optical thin film (indium tin oxide) and a Langmuir-Blodgett layer (pentacosa diynoic acid) show absorption contrast with a lateral resolution of about 30 nm (based o­n <b>edge</b> <b>steepness),</b> which is well below the diffraction limi...|$|E
40|$|Flow past {{a single}} small planar or {{three-dimensional}} roughness {{mounted on a}} smooth surface is investigated theoretically for various <b>edge</b> <b>steepnesses,</b> the oncoming pla-nar motion being within a boundary layer or other near-wall shear. Nonlinear edge properties at large Reynolds numbers largely control the flow responses at the three-dimensional roughness wing-tips and the impacts of separation(s), among other fea-tures. From analysis and computation, criteria are found for the generation of non-linear upstream influence, downstream influence and separations, for two- and three-dimensional roughnesses, as well as wing-tip separations. In particular, it is predicted that with a severe edge (e. g. a 90 forward-facing step) {{the ratio of the}} upstream separation distance over the roughness edge height is a constant times Re 1 = 4 W in two dimensions, the constant being approximately 0 : 142 and the Reynolds number ReW being based on the roughness edge height and the incident velocity slope at the sur-face. In three dimensions ReW is multiplied by sin, as expected physically, where is the tangent angle of the roughness planform. The ratio prediction above is very general, applying not only for any incident shear flow, but also for any front-edge geometry. Other separation and reattachment properties, extensions and a compar-ison with an experiment, are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collected}} on the spectral characteristics of the LANDSAT- 4 and LANDSAT- 4 backup thematic mapper instruments, the protoflight (TM/PF) and flight (TM/F) models, respectively, are presented and analyzed. Tests were conducted on the instruments and their components to determine compliance with two sets of spectral specifications: band-by-band spectral coverage and channel-by-channel within-band spctral matching. Spectral coverage specifications were placed on: (1) band edges - points at 50 % of peak response, (2) band <b>edge</b> slopes - <b>steepness</b> of rise and fall-off of response, (3) spectral flatness - evenness of response between edges, and (4) spurious system response - ratio of out-of-band response to in-band response. Compliance with the spectral coverage specifications was determined by analysis of spectral measurements on the individual components contributing to the overall spectral response: filters, detectors, and optical surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Pleiades {{images are}} {{distributed}} with 50 cm ground sampling distance (GSD) {{even if the}} physical resolution for nadir images is just 70 cm. By theory this should influence the effective GSD determined by means of point spread function at image edges. Nevertheless by edge enhancement the effective GSD can be improved, but this should cause enlarged image noise. Again image noise can be reduced by image restoration. Finally even optimized image restoration cannot improve the image information from 70 cm to 50 cm without loss of details, requiring a comparison of Pleiades image details with other very high resolution space images. The image noise has been determined by analysis of the whole images for any sub-area with 5 pixels times 5 pixels. Based on the standard deviation of grey values in the small sub-areas the image noise has been determined by frequency analysis. This leads to realistic results, checked by test targets. On the other hand the visual determination of image noise based on apparently homogenous sub-areas results in too high values because the human eye {{is not able to}} identify small grey value differences – it is limited to just approximately 40 grey value steps over the available gray value range, so small difference in grey values cannot be seen, enlarging results of a manual noise determination. A tri-stereo combination of Pleiades 1 A in a mountainous, but partially urban, area has been analyzed and compared with images of the same area from WorldView- 1, QuickBird and IKONOS. The image restoration of the Pleiades images is very good, so the effective image resolution resulted in a factor 1. 0, meaning that the effective resolution corresponds to the nominal resolution of 50 cm. This does not correspond to the physical resolution of 70 cm, but by <b>edge</b> enhancement the <b>steepness</b> of the grey value profil...|$|R

40|$|The {{efforts in}} today’s {{technology}} to produce highly functional devices on ever decreasing dimensional scales demand new production techniques {{in the field}} of micro technology. The required micro components cannot be produced with mechanical tools. Instead, micro mechanical components with a height of up to several millimeter and a sub-micron lateral resolution are manufactured by lithography using x-rays. The required x-ray radiation needs to have a high penetration depth, a high intensity and a high parallelism. These demands are met by synchrotron radiation sources. Within the course of this thesis a dedicated deep x-ray lithography beamline is planned and constructed at the synchrotron radiation facility DELTA at the Technische Universität Dortmund. After beamline commissioning including beam characterization measurements, test wafers are exposed at the new beamline. The generated structures are investigated after chemical development concerning <b>edge</b> <b>steepness,</b> structure fidelity, and sidewall roughness...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the neural}} code of cultured {{neuronal}} networks {{may help to}} forward our understanding of human brain processes. The most striking property of spontaneously firing cultures is their regular bursting activity, a burst being defined as synchronized firing of groups of neurons spread throughout the entire network. The regularity of bursting may change gradually with time, typically being stable over hours (Stegenga et al. 2008). Cultured cortical networks composed of many thousands of neurons show bursting behavior starting {{from the end of}} the first week in vitro. Bursts can be characterized by both intraburst parameters (burst shape, maximum firing rate, leading and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>steepness,</b> etc.) and interburst parameters (statistics, stability of burst rates) (Van Pelt et al. 2004; Wagenaar et al. 2006). Not only the temporal burst characteristics develop with time. Also, spatial burst propagation patterns, socalled ‘’burst waves’’, change with age of the network...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{external}} cavity diode laser setup using two identical, commercially available interference filters operated {{in the blue}} wavelength range around 450 nm. The {{combination of the two}} filters decreases the transmission width, while increasing the <b>edge</b> <b>steepness</b> without a significant reduction in peak transmittance. Due to the broad spectral transmission of such interference filters compared to the internal mode spacing of blue laser diodes, an additional locking scheme, based on Hänsch-Couillaud locking to a cavity, has been added to improve the stability. The laser is stabilized to a line in the tellurium spectrum via saturation spectroscopy, and single-frequency operation for a duration of two days is demonstrated by monitoring the error signal of the lock and the piezo drive compensating the length change of the external resonator due to air pressure variations. Additionally, transmission curves of the filters and the spectra of a sample of diodes are given. Comment: improved manuscript (accepted for publication in Applied Physics B, 2016...|$|E
40|$|The {{carried out}} {{experimental}} investigations of LIA- 30 accelerator injection {{system as well}} as the new data on standard operation modes testing in bremsstrahlung pulse generation made it possible to take a new view of electrophysical processes taking place in the accelerating track. In spite of success achieved in searching for optimal acceleration conditions – namely, limitation of <b>edge</b> <b>steepness</b> and amplitude of injection current pulses, definition of the program of forming voltage pulses that accelerate electrons etc. – there still remains to acute the task of decreasing lateral oscillations of high-current relativistic electron beam along the track as a whole and especially in cathode-anode gap where the influence of longitudinal magnetic field irregularities is most evident. When the magnetic field is limited in the track what is related to technical potentialities, the oscillations decrease in the injection system equipped with a two-beam cathode. Moreover, this process of electron beam acceleration becomes more stable even under conditions of parameter changes in the accelerator subsystem operation...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} extent to which {{potential}} vorticity gradients affect the vertical propagation of planetary-scale Rossby waves {{on the edge of a}} stratospheric polar vortex and their eventual nonlinear saturation and breaking. Using two different numerical modeling approaches, it is shown that wave propagation and wave breaking are significantly reduced when the potential vorticity gradients at the vortex edge are anomalously weak. The efficiency of the first model, based on high-resolution contour dynamics, permits a full exploration of the parameter space of wave forcing amplitude and <b>edge</b> <b>steepness.</b> A more realistic primitive equation model in spherical geometry both confirms the contour dynamics results and highlights some direct implications for stratospheric modeling in more comprehensive models. The results suggest that stratospheric models using horizontal resolutions of spectral T 42 or less may significantly underestimate the vertical propagation and breaking of planetary waves, and may consequently misrepresent such important stratospheric processes as the mean meridional circulation, sudden warmings, and the mixing of chemically distinct polar and midlatitude air. 1...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{frequency}} response and {{changes to the}} dielectric and optical parameters due to annealing temperature variation (200 – 500 °C) of sol–gel derived CuCoOx thin film coatings were investigated. The optical constants such as absorption coefficient, band-gaps, Urbach energy, complex refractive index, complex dielectric constants, optical dispersion parameters, and energy loss functions were determined from reflectance data analysis recorded in the ultraviolet to near-infrared (190 – 2200 nm) range. The absorption coefficient and the broadening of absorption <b>edge</b> (<b>steepness</b> parameter), energy band-gaps, Urbach energy, loss tangent and energy loss functions decreased {{with the increase in}} annealing temperatures.

40|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunospot (ELISPOT) assay {{was originally}} {{developed for the}} detection of individual antibody secreting B-cells. Since then, the method has been improved, and ELISPOT is used for the determination of the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interferon (IFN) -γ, or various interleukins (IL) - 4, IL- 5. ELISPOT measurements are performed in 96 -well plates with nitrocellulose membranes either visually or by means of image analysis. Image analysis offers various procedures to overcome variable background intensity problems and separate true from false spots. ELISPOT readers offer a complete solution for precise and automatic evaluation of ELISPOT assays. Number, size, and intensity of each single spot can be determined, printed, or saved for further statistical evaluation. Cytokine spots are always round, but because of floating edges with the background, they have a nonsmooth borderline. Resolution is a key feature for a precise detection of ELISPOT. In standard applications shape and <b>edge</b> <b>steepness</b> are essential parameters in addition to size and color for an accurate spot recognition. These parameters need a minimum spot diameter of 6 pixels. Collecting one single image per well with a standard color camera with 750 × 560 pixels will result in a resolution much too low to get all of the spots in a specimen. IFN-γ spots may have only 25 µm diameters, and TNF-α spots just 15 µm. A 750 × 56...|$|E
40|$|There are {{differences}} {{in the behavior of}} wide passband edge filters with short wavelength passbands and of those with long wavelength passbands. The bandwidth of the pass band is here defined by the longest wavelength in the band divided by the shortest wavelength. This is virtually unlimited {{in the case of a}} long wave pass filter. However, it is significantly limited in the case of the usual approach of using quarter wavelength layer thickness stacks for short wave pass filters. This limitation is encountered because the third and higher harmonics of the blocking band appear at the short wavelength position where the quarter wave optical thicknesses of the layers for the blocking band stack of layers become three (3) quarter waves, 5, 7, 9, etc., at the wavelength of that harmonic. It appears that bandwidths of over 2 start to have increasingly higher reflection losses, and bandwidths of 2. 5 become virtually impractical for QWOT stacks. When band-passes broader than about 2 are needed for edge filters with a short wave passband, recourse to rugate-like designs is needed. Such designs can be achieved with only two homogeneous materials by employing the concept of the Herpin approximation, although many layers may be required. The influence of the indices of refraction of the materials, number of layers, and design approach on the bandwidth, average reflectance in the passband, band <b>edge</b> <b>steepness,</b> blocking density, and “squareness ” at the transition from the pass to blocking band are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKettle {{holes are}} glacially created, small, shallow, depressional {{wetlands}} collecting their water from internal or closed catchments in young moraine landscapes. Their water body {{is defined by}} having a maximum of 1 ha in extent. Mostly they undergo a wet-dry circle. In North-East Germany, kettle holes are widely spread, mostly on arable land. They are characterised by large differences in hydroperiod (HP), size, shape and <b>edge</b> <b>steepness.</b> They also have a high potential for both, geomorphic structural diversity and biological species diversity. However, kettle holes are subject to pollution, drainage and structural reduction that result from intensive land use practices. Although kettle holes in Germany are protected by law, protection strategies are not specific enough {{with respect to the}} variability of kettle holes, especially of HP. Therefore, the study objective was to characterise hydrogeomorphic (HGM) kettle hole types to create a basis for a decision support system with regard to the selection of the type dependent conservation and management measures. In three agricultural landscapes in North-East Germany, geomorphological and hydrological variables of 268 kettle holes (HP, shore overflow tendency, depth, area, form, shore width and slope) {{as well as those of}} their catchments (area, wetland to catchment area ratio, relief) were investigated from 1993 to 2003. By statistical analysis of datasets of 144 kettle holes, 10 HGM kettle hole types were defined. The basic types are “silted fen type” and “open-water type”. Basic subtypes of the latter type are “storage type”, “shore overflow type” and “puddle type”. Differences in spreading of kettle hole types in dependency on landscape relief were found...|$|E
