What's on TV {{announced}} the storyline in June 2009. About {{the beginning of the}} storyline, [...] "Hannah has gone off the rails of late, but even she manages to outdo herself when she and Darren tie the knot after a particularly boozy night in Denmark". Holy Soap said the wedding will leave fans [...] "stunned" [...] and described the pair as [...] "odd". Dawson said, regarding the sudden marriage, that [...] "Darren doesn’t suddenly fall in love with Hannah or vice-versa. It's just one of those mad, crazy things you do when you’ve had far too many drinks and your life is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mess. They both regret it. They get home and their friends and families are horrified – especially Hannah's family".|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{returned}} to acting in 2012 with appearances in three action films. Beckinsale {{first appeared in}} the action thriller Contraband. She had a supporting role as the wife of Mark Wahlberg's character, a former criminal who gets forced back into a life of crime after his family members are threatened. The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, Reykjavík-Rotterdam. The San Francisco Chronicle felt Beckinsale was [...] "stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character." [...] The Hollywood Reporter stated that [...] "Beckinsale, her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches, has little to do but be supportive, worried and, eventually, besieged." [...] Entertainment Weekly felt that the [...] "woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation" [...] while Variety found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale's character disturbing. The film had a production budget of $25million and has grossed over $96million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Zoth said episode 20, {{in which}} [...] "Akane finally snaps", {{was one of}} his most {{expected}} parts from the story. [...] Zoth also said, [...] "Akane has grown as a character, and a detective, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavy-handed move, she’s shown transforming into Kogami in Ginoza's eyes". Similarly, Bamboo Dong said, [...] "No longer the dull and meek woman she was for over half the series, [...] now confident and capable, doling out commands that are instantly followed and respected by her comrades". Dong said Akane is an appealing main character who is [...] "worth paying attention to, and her presence on screen is the perfect complement to the much more complex side characters that populate the show". Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku said he found Akane more interesting than Kogami because her overall development. In anticipation for the movie, IGN writer Miranda Sanchez expected to see more interactions between Kogami and Akane due to Psycho-Pass 2 lacking that. However, she noted this bond was not fully explored. Jacob Chapman enjoyed her interactions with Kogami in the role such as one dialogue where Akane starts comparing Kogami with the late villain Makishima. Alexandria Hill from Otaku USA [...] also praised the first interactions between these two characters for its action as it contrasted the heavy use of dialogue in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|A former driver suggested, to The Times, that a {{blackout}} was a possibility, {{due to the}} erratic shift {{patterns that}} the drivers had to adhere to. He {{also said that the}} vending machine at the tram depot was stocked only with energy drinks, and that [...] "Nobody is ever fully awake; I was always <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> daze and that is because the way the shifts work doesn't allow the drivers to get a regular sleep pattern." [...] Following this, multiple sources reported on a video apparently showing a different driver struggling to stay awake at the controls. The driver concerned was suspended pending an investigation into the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the [...] "softer side" [...] to Clare that emerged: [...] "she does genuinely care for [...] When he turns against her, {{it turns into a}} bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state and hands her a Christianity leaflet. [...] actually sits and tries to pray". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever scratched the surface with [...] " [...] and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, [...] "I leave Albert Square {{in the back of a}} Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [...] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!" [...] She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, [...] "I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point." [...] In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year or so. She added, [...] "but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see." ...|$|E
