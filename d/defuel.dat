40|$|In {{the context}} of {{defining}} protocols for the fueling or <b>defueling</b> of composite material hydrogen pressure tanks, {{it is crucial to}} not exceed certain temperature limits. 85 °C during fuelings is the upper boundary that the gas temperature should not exceed during the refueling of hydrogen cars in the standard SAE J 2601 - 2014. In the same manner, usual <b>defueling</b> recommendations suggest that the lower gas temperature boundary is- 40 °C. The project HyTransfer, an FCH JU funded pre-normative research project, aims at showing that setting these two limits on the wall temperature rather than on the gas temperature permits to diminish operational constraints and therefore obtain a significant improvement of the overall costs for fueling and <b>defueling.</b> In this context, the paper will show both for fueling and <b>defueling,</b> how the temperature of the tank wall can be estimated. The analysis of this temperature will be based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), experimental results and simple thermodynamical modeling. When analyzing the gas and wall temperature differences, it is first necessary to distinguish between cases with homogeneous and cases with heterogeneous gas temperature. Therefore, the paper will first show indicators of temperature disparities in the gas, followed by analyses of the gas and wall temperature differences by splitting the analysis in two cases: homogeneous and heterogeneous gas temperature. When the gas temperature can be considered as homogeneous, one can show how the wall temperature is reduced to the correct determination of the heat exchange parameter between the gas and wall. In {{the context of}} heterogeneities of temperature in the gas (fueling at low speed and <b>defueling</b> in general), the paper will provide correlations linking the gas and wall temperature differences to simple tank geometry parameters and fueling or <b>defueling</b> conditions. In the end, the problem of the determination of hot or cold spots in the tank wall will have been fully covered and reduced to the computation of a thermodynamical modeling combined with correlations so that highly time-demanding computations such as 3 D CFD are not mandatory.

40|$|The Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is {{a design}} concept for a central station-type [1500 MW(e) ] Fluoride salt–cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR) that is {{currently}} undergoing development by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the US. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Reactor Concepts program. FHRs, by definition, feature low-pressure liquid fluoride salt cooling, coated-particle fuel, a high-temperature power cycle, and fully passive decay heat rejection. The overall goal of the AHTR development program is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of FHRs as low-cost, large-size power producers while maintaining full passive safety. The AHTR is approaching a preconceptual level of maturity. An initial integrated layout of its major systems, structures, and components (SSCs), and an initial, high-level sequence of operations necessary for constructing and operating the plant is nearing completion. An overview of {{the current status of}} the AHTR concept has been recently published [1], and a report providing a more detailed overview of the AHTR structures and mechanical systems is currently in preparation. This report documents the refueling components and processes envisioned at this early development phase. The report is limited to the refueling aspects of the AHTR and does not include overall reactor or power plant design information. The report, however, does include a description of the materials envisioned for the various components and the instrumentation necessary to control the refueling process. The report begins with an overview of the refueling strategy. Next a mechanical description of the AHTR fuel assemblies and core is provided. The reactor vessel upper assemblies are then described. Following this the refueling path structures and the refueling mechanisms and components are described. The sequence of operations necessary to fuel and <b>defuel</b> the reactor is then discussed. The report concludes with a discussion of the levels of maturity of the various SSCs to provide guidance for future technology developments.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{increasing}} demand for {{energy and the}} effect on climate change {{are some of the}} big drivers in support of the nuclear renaissance. A great amount of energy is spent on studies to determine the contribution of nuclear power to the future energy supply. Many countries are investing in generation III and IV reactors such as the Westinghouse AP 1000 because of its passive cooling system, which makes it attractive for its safety. The pebble bed high temperature gas cooled reactors are designed to be intrinsically safe, {{which is one of the}} main drivers for developing these reactors. A pebble bed reactor is a high temperature reactor which is helium–cooled and graphitemoderated using spherical fuel elements that contain triple–coated isotropic fuel particles (TRISO). The success of its intrinsic safety lies in the design of the fuel elements that remain intact at very high temperatures. When temperatures significantly higher than 1600 °C are reached during accidents, the fuel elements with their inherent safety features may be challenged. A pebble bed reactor has an online fuelling concept, where fuel is circulated through the core. The fuel is loaded at the top of the core and through gravity, moves down to the bottom where it is unloaded to either be discarded or to be re–circulated. This is determined by the burnup measuring system. By circulating the fuel spheres more than once through the reactor a flattened axial power profile with lower power peaking and therefore lower maximum fuel temperatures can be achieved. This is an attractive approach to increase the core performance by lowering the important fuel operating parameters. However, the circulation has an economic impact, as it increases the design requirements on the burnup measuring system (faster measuring times and increased circulation). By adopting a multi–pass recycling scheme of the pebble fuel elements it is shown that the axial power peaking can be reduced The primary objective for this study is the investigation of the influences on the core design with regards to the number of fuel passes. The general behaviour of the two concepts, multi–pass refuelling and a once–through circulation, are to be evaluated with regards to flux and power and the maximum fuel temperature profiles. The relative effects of the HTR–Modul with its cylindrical core design and the PBMR 400 MW with its annular core design are also compared to verify the differences and trends as well as the influences of the control rods on core behaviour. This is important as it has a direct impact on the safety of the plant (that the fuel temperatures need to remain under 1600 °C in normal and accident conditions). The work is required at an early stage of reactor design since it influences design decisions needed on the fuel handling system design and <b>defuel</b> chute decay time, and has a direct impact on the fuel burnup–level qualification. The analysis showed that in most cases the increase in number of fuel passes not only flattens the power profile, but improves the overall results. The improvement in results decreases exponentially and from ten passes the advantage of having more passes becomes insignificant. The effect of the flattened power profile is more visible on the PBMR 400 MW than on the HTR–Modul. The 15 –pass HTR–Modul design is at its limit with regards to the measuring time of a single burnup measuring system. However, by having less passes through the core, e. g. tenpasses, more time will be available for burnup measurement. The PBMR 400 MW has three <b>defuel</b> chutes allowing longer decay time which improves measurement accuracy, and, as a result could benefit from more than six passes without increasing the fuel handling system costs. The secondary objective of performing a sensitivity analysis on the control rod insertion positions and the effect of higher fuel enrichment has also been achieved. Control rod efficiency is improved when increasing the excess reactivity by means of control rod insertion. However, this is done at lower discharge burnup and shut down margins. Higher enrichment causes an increase in power peaking and more fuel–passes will be required to maintain the peaking and temperature margins than before. Master...|$|E
