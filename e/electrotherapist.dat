40|$|The present article {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on the electrotherapy treatment for voice disorders from the mid- 18 th century to World War I (1914 – 1918) and the post 1970 s reappearance of such therapies. The reappearance of electrotherapy as treatment for voice disorders in the past 20 years has been heralded as a major breakthrough. In light of our reading of the scientific literature of the 19 th century, it can be shown to repeat many of the presuppositions of <b>electrotherapists</b> of that time. The current resurgence of interest and research in electrical stimulation of the larynx is buoyed by technological innovations analogous to those in the 19 th century. Although the current state of research has enhanced our understanding of vocal fold physiology, it does not necessarily provide a new therapeutic approach as a survey of the most recent literature shows...|$|R

Hippocrates and Herodotus advised {{the use of the}} sun's rays. There is ample evidence from Roman times in Britain that heat treatment was used, and many of the spas of England and the Continent have their origin in the Roman expansion Not so many years ago rubbing and beating with bones fashioned to a suitable shape were methods of producing an erythema or skin reaction, with histamine release by friction. With the discovery of electricity further interest was aroused, and from this developed the era of electro-medical treatment. Twenty years ago, when I first interested myself in the subject of physical therapy, many of the British workers, known as <b>electrotherapists,</b> were mostly interested in treatment by electrical means...|$|R
