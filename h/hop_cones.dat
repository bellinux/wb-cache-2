50|$|Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid {{derived from}} a plant type III PKS, and is {{synthesized}} in the glandular trichromes of <b>hop</b> <b>cones.</b> L-Phenylalanine serves as the starting material, which is converted to cinnamic acid by the PLP-dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and loaded onto Coenzyme A (CoA) by 4-coumarate CoA ligase to yield 4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl CoA, the starter unit for PKS extension. This molecule is extended three times with malonyl CoA, cyclized through a Claisen condensation, and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone (chalconaringenin). This intermediate {{has the potential to}} form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure. In the case of xanthohumol, a prenyltransferase called Humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 (HlPT-1) attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the DXP pathway. HlPT-1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant. Finally, an O-methyltransferase methylates a phenol substituent using S-adenosyl methionine. Total syntheses of xanthohumol and derivatives have been achieved, though extraction from hops remains a primary source.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityThis study {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} water stress levels on the yield, quality, water use efficiency and grower returns of drip irrigated native spearmint and four subsurface drip irrigated hop cultivars: Mt. Hood, Columbus, Chinook and Willamette. For native spearmint, stress levels were applied at different times during the growing periods. For hops, each stress level was applied throughout the growing season. The field experiments were carried out for two years at the Washington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser WA. Mint results showed that biomass production decreased with increasing water stress as is expected. However, mint oil yield and quality {{were not significantly different}} across treatments. This suggests that deficit irrigating native spearmint might enhance oil accumulation. This is further supported by the observed increase in oil concentration as water stress increased. A number of mint production costs were affected by the reduction in applied water thus reducing the total mint production costs. Since oil yields were similar across treatments, revenues were not significantly affected. This resulted into increase in net farm income. Also, water stress improved the water use efficiency in native spearmint. Hop results showed that the dried <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> yield decreased with increasing water stress in all the cultivars. The <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> quality however did not change significantly across treatments. In the full year of production, water stress improved water use efficiency in hop production across all the cultivars. In the Yakima Valley, reduction in amount of water applied only affects the cost of pumping of the irrigation water which is minimal when compared to the total cost of producing hops. The yield reductions due to applying less water to hops caused reductions in revenues that were higher than the savings in the cost of producing hops due to pumping less water. This decreased the net farm income. The study observed how the subsurface drip irrigation system coupled with scientific irrigation scheduling can substantially reduce hop water use. This study also provides production functions for irrigation optimization of native spearmint and four hop cultivars. Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, "The Evaluation of the Quality of Hops from Traditional and Non-traditional Growing Areas", {{the quality}} of three {{varieties}} of <b>hop</b> seed <b>cones</b> (Saaz, Sladek and Kazbek) from a non-traditional hop-growing region was analyzed and the data used for comparison. The primary aim {{of the study was}} to determine if there is a possibility of growing quality hops in a region that is not considered a hop-growing region. The hops that were tested were harvested in 2015 from a private hopfield located in Obora near Tábor. This hopfield is owned and managed by Ing. Martin Novák. Mechanical and chemical analysis was carried out on samples from Obora. The main goal of the analysis was to determine the alpha and beta acid content of the <b>hop</b> seed <b>cones</b> harvested there. Samples were analyzed with EBC 7. 7 (HPLC). Alpha acid content of the tested samples in Saaz hops was 4. 06 % w/w, in Sladek 7. 14 % w/w and in Kazbek 4. 67 % w/w. The content of beta acids in Saaz hops was 3. 16 % w/w, in Sladek 3. 93 % w/w and in Kazbek 4. 51 % w/w. The collected data was then compared to published data for hops grown in traditional hop-growing regions.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Alpha acids {{are found}} in the lupulin glands of <b>hops</b> <b>cones.</b> These acids have no {{bitterness}} of their own, but can be isomerized and subsequently hydrogenated to form bitter iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids respectively. Current literature values for the detection thresholds of iso-α-acid and tetrahydroiso-α-acid in lager beer have been reported using American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) method 679, a method commonly used to find detection thresholds of various compounds. ASTM method 679 is currently described as a “rapid method” and was a forerunner to ASTM method 1432, the current standard method for finding human detection thresholds. It has been argued that ASTM method 679 is statistically weaker than ASTM method 1432, as a group threshold found using ASTM method 679 is based on an individual “best estimate threshold” found using only one ascending series of 3 -altrnative forced choice (3 -AFC) presentations per panelist. The group threshold found using ASTM method 1432 is based on individual thresholds that are determined using data from 6 ascending series of 3 -AFC presentations per panelist, the principle being that test repetition will help nullify moment-to-moment panelist variation. However, test repetition takes time, and the lack of repetition required for ASTM method 679 makes the method quicker and simpler to implement than ASTM method 1432. Current literature detection threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer have not been found using ASTM method 1432. The primary objective of the research presented in this paper was to use the current ASTM standard method to determine updated threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer. The secondary objective of this research was to compare threshold results from the same data set using ASTM method 679 and ASTM method 1432 to evaluate whether these methods provide statistically similar results. Findings showed that implementation of ASTM method 679 to find individual thresholds did produce results that were not statistically different from individual results found using ASTM method 1432. All group thresholds except the Day 1 tetrahydroiso-α-acid threshold found using ASTM 679 were also statistically in agreement with group thresholds obtained using ASTM method 1432. Beta acids, like alpha acids, {{are found in}} the lupulin glands of <b>hops</b> <b>cones.</b> Beta acids oxidize to form bitter compounds. Beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids {{have been found to be}} miticidal against varroa mites, parasitic mites that feed off of and damage honeybees and bee larva. Though beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids are FDA-declared GRAS substances, and will have no ill-effects on honey consumers, bees may transfer the bitter acids to their honey. Detectable levels of these bitter substances could lead to consumer rejection of honey from hives treated with beta acids or tetrahydroiso-α-acids. In a second experiment discussed in this thesis, the detection thresholds of beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids were found in light clover honey. A method for the extraction and quantification of beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in beer and wort was modified and verified for the extraction and quantification of hops acids in honey. This method combined with group threshold data obtained in this experiment can be used in an industrial setting to determine whether the concentrations of beta acids and/or tetrahydro-iso-α-acids that may have been transferred to honey are above or below the human detection threshold...|$|R

The model computes the soil water balance using the dualKcapproach, thus partitioning crop evapotranspiration (ETc) into crop transpiration, ground covertranspiration and soil evaporation. Calibration and validation were performed using TDR soil watercontent measurements, which produced small root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0. 012 to 0. 015 cm 3 cm− 3. The initial, mid-season and end-season basal crop coefficients (Kcb) that allow com-puting hop transpiration were respectively 0. 16, 0. 97 and 0. 83.

40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease and atherosclerosis progression is significantly increased after menopause, {{probably due to the}} decrease of estrogen levels. The use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for prevention {{of cardiovascular}} disease in older postmenopausal failed to meet expectations. Phytoestrogens may induce some improvements in climacteric symptoms, but their effect on the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The reduction of cholesterol accumulation at the cellular level should lead to inhibition of the atherosclerotic process in the arterial wall. The inhibition of intracellular lipid deposition with isoflavonoids was suggested as the effective way for the prevention of plaque formation in the arterial wall. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was to investigate the effect of an isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation on atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women free of overt cardiovascular disease. One hundred fifty-seven healthy postmenopausal women (age 65 ± 6) were randomized to a 500 mg isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation containing tannins from grape seeds, green tea leaves, <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> powder, and garlic powder, or placebo. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (cIMT) were evaluated at the baseline and after 12 months of treatment. After 12 -months follow-up, total cholesterol decreased by 6. 3 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (p = 0. 011) and by 5. 2 % in placebo recipients (p = 0. 020); low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 7. 6 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (p = 0. 040) and by 5. 2 % in placebo recipients (non-significant, NS); high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 3. 4 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (NS) and by 4. 5 % in placebo recipients (p = 0. 038); triglycerides decreased by 6. 0 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (NS) and by 7. 1 % in placebo recipients (NS). The differences between lipid changes in the isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation and placebo recipients did not reach statistical significance (p > 0. 05). Nevertheless, the mean cIMT progression was significantly lower in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients as compared to the placebo group (6 μm, or < 1 %, versus 100 μm, or 13 %; p < 0. 001 for the difference). The growth of existing atherosclerotic plaques in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients was inhibited by 1. 5 -fold (27 % versus 41 % in the placebo group). The obtained results demonstrate that the use of isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation in postmenopausal women may suppress the formation of new atherosclerotic lesions and reduce the progression of existing ones, thus promising new drug for anti-atherosclerotic therapy.

It can be found at: [URL] management is an important aspect of control of powdery mildew diseases and may influence the intensity of fungicide applications required to suppress disease. In hop, powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera macularis) is most damaging to cones when infection occurs during bloom and the juvenile stages of cone development. Experiments were conducted over 3 years to evaluate whether fungicide applications could be ceased after the most susceptible stages of cone development (late July) without unduly affecting crop yield and quality when disease pressure was moderated with varying levels of basal foliage removal. In experimental plots of ‘Galena’ hop, the incidence of leaves with powdery mildew was similar whether fungicides were ceased in late July or made in late August. Disease levels on leaves were unaffected by the intensity of basal foliage removal, whereas the intensity of basal foliage removal interacted with the duration of fungicide applications to affect disease levels on cones. Similar experiments conducted in large plots of ‘Tomahawk’ hop in a commercial hop yard similarly found no significant impact on disease levels on leaves from either the duration of fungicide applications or intensity of basal foliage removal. In contrast, on cones, application of fungicides into August had a modest, suppressive effect on powdery mildew. There was also some evidence that the level of powdery mildew on cones associated with fungicide treatment was influenced by the intensity of basal foliage removal. When fungicide applications ceased in late July, there was a progressive decrease in the incidence of cones with powdery mildew with increasing intensity of basal foliage removal. Removing basal foliage two to three times allowed fungicide applications to be terminated in late July rather than late August without diminishing disease control on cones, yield, or cone quality factors. Thus, this study further establishes that fungicide applications made during the early stages of <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> development have the strongest effect on suppression of powdery mildew on cones. The additive effect of fungicide applications targeted to the periods of greatest cone susceptibility and canopy management to reduce disease favorability may obviate the need for fungicide applications later in the season.

40|$|The {{activity}} of vitamin E, total content of tocols {{and the content}} of individual isomers: α-tocopherols, β-tocopherols, γ-tocopherols and δ-tocopherols was monitored in samples of <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> of the world-important Saaz variety. Hop cone samples originated from hop-breeding area Tršice, Czech Republic. The method used for the determination of vitamin E in barley was modified and used for this quantitative analysis. The results indicate that monitored characteristics are influenced by the year of harvest (2010 or 2011) but also by the age of hop-gardens (hop bucks). High values of vitamin E activity (up to 67. 79 mg. kg− 1) and total content of tocols (up to 76. 31 mg. kg− 1) in <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> are worth further attention from the viewpoint of alternative use of hops...|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} testing ten various plyometric exercises on overall performance during jumping examined by EMG, power, and ground reaction force (GRF). Of the ten exercises, the single-leg <b>cone</b> <b>hops,</b> box jumps, tuck jumps, and two-legged vertical jumps produced the highest EMG values, alluding to greater motor recruitment. Power was examined in dumbbell jumps, depth jumps, countermovement jumps, squat jumps, and tuck jumps which all produced the higher power scale readings. In terms of athletic performance and training, the plyometric movements that utilize total body vibration produced an overall increase in performance output. A recent study examined two groups using the same plyometric protocol in combination with weight training, one using high loads and the other utilizing small loads, and similar decreases in power were found. This shows that the plyometric exercises themselves had a greater effect in the decrease in power output rather than the type of weight training.|$|R
40|$|Hop {{market and}} beer {{industry}} {{have always been}} of secondary relevance in Italy as compared to grape and wine sector. Hence, hop cultivars and the information for growing hops have been generated almost entirely from the major hop production countries. Identifying cultivars that perform well in Mediterranean environments is therefore essential to successfully start hop cultivation and breeding activity in this new growing region. To evaluate the intraspecific diversity of hop in Central Italy, 20 female hop genotypes with different origin were screened during three growing seasons (2013 - 2015) in an experimental <b>hop</b> yard. <b>Cones</b> yield, plant height and crop phenology were evaluated to determine which cultivars were best suited to the Mediterranean climate. Moreover, given the rising interest {{for the development of}} local beers with distinguishing aroma, a sensory analysis was performed and beers flavoured with locally produced and imported cones were compared. A significant diversity among cultivars was found for all parameters investigated. The results indicated that weather condition during flowering and development of cones markedly affected yield and plant height. Cones yield was negatively correlated with thermal time (r=– 0. 5, P< 0. 05) to harvest and positively with plant height (r= 0. 56, P< 0. 05). Cascade, Hallertauer Magnum, Hersbrucker Spa t and Yeoman showed the best adaptability to the Mediterranean growing conditions as they were the top-performing cultivars across the three years. Sensory analysis evidenced the importance of cultivar selection as determining factor for flavouring properties of beers. In general, results showed that the origin of cones strongly affected the mouth feel of beers. More complex and appreciated aroma profiles were identified for beers flavoured with local <b>cones</b> than those <b>hopped</b> with commercial products...|$|R
40|$|Commercial <b>hops,</b> {{the dried}} <b>cones</b> of the <b>hop</b> vine (Lupulus humul-us), contain two {{antibacterial}} agents, lupulon and humulon. Methods of prep-aration of the compounds, their chemical struc-tures, and their inhibitive action against Gram-positive bacteria {{have been known}} for many years; nevertheless, their antibiotic properties have been largely ignored in relation to animal infections. Their relatively high content in such an accessible source, together with the availability of simple methods for their isolation, prompted {{a survey of the}} antibiotic spectra of the substances. Lupulon and humulon were supplied to Dr. H. H. Anderson of the University of California Medical School for the determination of their activity toward Myco-bacterium tuberculosis. The ensuing demonstra-tion by Chin et al. (1) that lupulon inhibits the growth of a virulent strain of this pathogen in vitro and exerts a pronounced effect on experi-mental tuberculosis infections in mice has quick-ened interest in the microbiological, pharmaco-logical, and therapeutic investigation of these agents. The Western Regional Research Laboratory has been engaged recently in the determination of the antibiotic spectra of lupulon and humulon, development of methods by which substantial quantities of each can be readily prepared, deter-mination of a number of their physical and chemi-cal properties, preparation of certain derivatives, and development of methods of assay.
