50|$|Eurostat {{carries out}} {{information}} {{visits to the}} National Statistical Institutes forming part of the European Statistical System. Based on assessment reports by Eurostat, the <b>Directorate-General</b> for <b>Budget</b> (DG BUDG) of the Commission may notify to the Permanent Representative of the Member State concerned required corrections and improvements {{in the form of}} reservations on the country's GNI data. Payments are made monthly by member states to the commission. Own resources payments are made monthly as they are collected, but monthly instalments of VAT- and GNI-based returns are based upon the budget estimates made for that year, subject to later correction.|$|R
50|$|In March 2000 the European Commission {{approved}} {{a white paper}} on reform {{that led to a}} major change in the way the Commission was managed. These changes included recommendations for each department to establish an effective internal control system. To support the implementation of the internal controls the <b>Directorate-General</b> for <b>Budget's</b> Central Financial Service developed a control self-assessment process. This first control self-assessment identified several areas for improvement in internal control across the Commission most notably the need to implement a more systematic approach to risk management. The outcome of this first self-assessment was the implementation of the requirement for every Directorate General to perform a control and risk self-assessment annually.|$|R
30|$|Although {{one would}} usually {{consider}} proficient speakers as leaders of a language, {{since they are}} the ones that are more likely to use the language more frequently and thus exert a larger impact in shaping it, the situation might not be as clear-cut in the case of Min. As mentioned above, due to the strong influence of the official language Mandarin, the average Min proficiency and frequency of use are on a drastic decline, especially among younger speakers (<b>Directorate-General</b> of <b>Budget</b> 行政院主計總處 2013; Huang 黃宣範 1993; The United Daily News Group Poll Center 聯合報系民意調查中心 2002). As a consequence, high-level young talkers are drastically outnumbered by their mid- and low-level counterparts and might thus lose their critical impact on the language. If this trend is left to itself without any intervention, young mid-level talkers might become the ones that are taking the lead in shaping the language, since unlike their low-level counterparts, they still use Min on a daily basis. Future studies are necessary in order to observe whether this trend is going to be realized as predicted.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are to establish {{a link between the}} concept of green national product and that of CGE modeling, and demonstrate empirically the existence of significant differences between the value of conventional GNP and that of Green GNP. We first derive theoretically the framework of Green GNP under two different definitions, SEEA and ENRAP, taking into account pollution and pollution prevention activities. Then, we employ a 28 -sector static CGE model for Taiwan to assess the effects of the policy of mandatory reduction in air pollution emission on Taiwan’s macroeconomic variables as well as sectoral resource allocation. The social accounting matrix used by the CGE model is compiled {{on the basis of the}} 1997 national income data (aggregates) and 1996 input-output data (structure). The model is then supplemented by the pollution generation coefficients, the emission coefficients and the abatement costs, which are computed from the Trial Compilation of Green National Product prepared by the <b>Directorate-General</b> of <b>Budgeting,</b> Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS). Three kinds of air pollutants are considered: Sulfu...|$|R
30|$|The {{conservative}} {{attitude of}} Mix and, {{to a lesser}} extent, Chiang, was quite interesting and intriguing, as it did not quite follow Ang’s 洪惟仁 (2003, 2012) predictions for young Min speakers’ /dz/ realization in specific and was incongruent with other studies regarding young speakers’ Min phonology in general (e.g., Li 李淑鳳 2010; Hsu 許慧如 2016). One surmises that this {{might have to do}} with a potential sampling bias due to the current distribution of Min speakers. Although all of the speakers recruited in this study showed adequate fluency in Min for carrying out daily conversations in the language and performing the paragraph-reading task smoothly, Min usage and Min fluency of the younger generation at large are in fact on the decline (<b>Directorate-General</b> of <b>Budget,</b> Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan 行政院主計總處 2012; The United Daily News Group Poll Center 聯合報系民意調查中心 2002). Therefore, young speakers who are still relatively fluent in Min nowadays {{are likely to be more}} conscious about and supportive of Min preservation, and might thus be more conservative in Min usage than their average peers who are less fluent in the language, and speakers of the same age ten or even 20  years ago. This conservative attitude might potentially be the reason why the Chiang and Mix speakers had higher-than-expected [Z] and/or [G] realizations.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Between 1980 and 1992, the {{enormous}} changes in {{economic development in}} Taiwan had significant impacts on the island 2 ̆ 7 s labour market. Examples of these changes include the island 2 ̆ 7 s almost legendary and meteoric economic growth, the maintenance of essentially full employment, an increase of around 116 per cent in real labour earnings, considerable upgrading of the educational qualifications of the labour force as a whole, a sustained and systematic shift {{in the composition of}} the labour force from agriculture into manufacturing and services and occupational upgrading (defined as the expansion of the share of the labour force in the better occupations, {{at the expense of the}} lesser occupations). The main purpose of this chapter is to provide in-depth analysis of these and other underlying changes in the Taiwanese labour market, with the main focal point being, on the one hand, the linkages between the employment and earnings structures, whilst on the other, the changes in the education and qualification levels and the new occupational structure of the island 2 ̆ 7 s labour force. Our econometric analysis is based upon a dataset taken from the Manpower Utilization Surveys (MUS) produced by the <b>Directorate-General</b> of <b>Budget,</b> Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) in Taiwan, covering the years 1980 to 1992. The data for 1993 is not used in this chapter, despite being available to us, essentially because the occupation codes adopted after 1992 were incompatible with those of the earlier years...|$|R

The EU budget is an important tool that puts EU policies into practice. It finances actions that Member States cannot fund on their own or which they can fund more economically by pooling their resources. The EU budget is adopted through a democratic procedure: it is prepared by the European Commission (the EU’s executive body) and is then discussed and agreed by the Council of the EU (representing EU Member States, including Malta) and by the European Parliament (where the democratically elected Maltese representatives sit). Once adopted, the budget is then managed either jointly by the EU Member States and the Commission, or directly by the Commission. In practice, 80 % of the EU budget is managed by national or regional governments. Through grants, loans and other forms of financing, the EU budget provides financial support to hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries such as students, scientists, NGOs, SMEs, towns and regionsN/...|$|R
30|$|The variety {{found in}} /dz/ {{realization}} {{in this study}} was much like what was observed in Chuang and Fon (2017) and more. In addition to the already reported [Z], [G], [L], [D], and [R], there were also speakers that used [V] and Ø. Although the latter two were contributed by single speakers only, it is worth noticing that the speaker that contributed [V] produced three tokens of it, indicating its within-talker robustness. Therefore, it is unclear whether the occurrence of [V] was merely due to idiosyncrasy, or it was a newly rising variant and the talker specificity found here was in fact a result of sampling error. On the other hand, Ø was more likely to be random inadvertence, as there was only one token observed. At any rate, the wide spectrum of variants for /dz/ realization found in this study implies that /dz/ realization in Taiwan Min is currently in a volatile state among young speakers, regardless of gender. Although this is more in line with Chuang and Fon’s (2017) view, it is in stark contrast with most earlier studies [cf. Ang 洪惟仁 (2003, 2012), Chen 陳淑娟 (1995), Chen 陳雅玲 (2010, 2012), Khng 康韶真 (2014)], in which only [Z], [G], and [L] were observed. One suspects that the current findings might have been due to a serious decline in proficiency among young Min speakers (<b>Directorate-General</b> of <b>Budget</b> 行政院主計總處 2013; The United Daily News Group Poll Center 聯合報系民意調查中心 2002). As speakers become less proficient in the language, they might become less certain about how a particular phoneme should be realized, resulting in larger variability. If this is the case, then one would expect even larger variability to be observed for future generations to come. Alternatively, the wide variety of /dz/ realization might have stemmed from a new surge of sound change that was motivated by the articulatorily demanding /dz/ (Ang 洪惟仁 2012; Ohala 1983). Specifically, the two main classical realization categories of /dz/, [Z] and [G], did not have any phonemic correspondences in Mandarin, the most predominant language among young Min speakers nowadays (Huang 黃宣範 1993). As a consequence, in addition to adopting [L], /dz/ might be forced to further evolve into something that is even more “Mandarin-friendly”. The inclusion of [R] could be deemed as part of this process. More studies would be needed in order to provide a longitudinal documentation of the development of /dz/ realization.|$|R
