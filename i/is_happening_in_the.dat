25|$|In 1941, Burnham {{wrote a book}} {{analyzing}} the development of economics and society as he saw it, called The Managerial Revolution: What <b>is</b> <b>Happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World. The book was included in Life Magazine's list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944.|$|E

25|$|Past the Wallula Gap the OWL is {{identified}} with the Wallula Fault Zone, which heads towards the Blue Mountains. The Wallula Fault Zone is active, but whether that {{can be attributed to}} the OWL is unknown: it may be that, like the Yakima Fold Belt, it is a result of regional stresses, and is expressed only in the superficial basalt, quite independently of what ever <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement rock.|$|E
25|$|In {{trying to}} {{appreciate}} how the quarter-wave plate transforms the linearly polarized light, {{it is important}} to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate what <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the quarter-wave plate merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} these {{multiple}} firings from multiple areas {{to be combined}} into a specific extrinsic event, there must be help from the dorsal thalamus. It is not proven whether the dorsal thalamus is the primary organizer, but it does fit the specific profile for collecting neuronal activity and rapidly coordinating between what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain and outside of it. The space {{in and around the}} dorsal thalamus, the thalomocortical area, is able to generate fast voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations which allow it to react quickly to received messages. The types of channels that cover this area are presumed to be GABAergic. Since sensory awareness needs to be quick, the threshold for sodium and potassium in this area is quite low.|$|E

25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E
500|$|A test or {{marker of}} this state of {{existence}} is where [...] "right and wrong", socially popular [...] "truths or untruths", everyday morality, and whatever <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world makes no difference to the monk, where after abandoning the [...] "truths and untruths, one abandons that by which one abandons". The individual is entirely driven by his soul, which he sees to be the Brahman.|$|E
500|$|A word, phrase or {{topic that}} is {{mentioned}} at a greater rate than others {{is said to}} be a [...] "trending topic". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users, or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic. These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world and what people's opinions are about it.|$|E

The inability {{to relate to the}} characters reduced the desire to read.|$|R

500|$|President Barack Obama {{spoke to}} the debate between Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter. Obama said, [...] "I think that {{the reason that the}} {{organizers}} used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting that no one else's lives matter ... rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> African American community that's not happening in other communities." [...] He also said [...] "that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{you listen}} to the Sex Pistols, to [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] and [...] "Bodies" [...] and tracks like that, what {{immediately}} strikes you is that this is actually happening. [...] This is a bloke, with a brain on his shoulders, who is actually saying something he sincerely believes <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, saying it with real venom, and real passion. [...] It touches you and it scares you; it makes you feel uncomfortable. [...] It's like somebody saying [...] "The Germans are coming! [...] And there's no way we're gonna stop 'em! ...|$|E
500|$|I, the Supreme {{is mostly}} {{composed}} of real texts by or about Francia. These range from personal memoirs by historical Paraguayan figures to passages from books written by Europeans in Paraguay at the time. [...] They are arranged by a 'Compiler' whose footnotes {{tell the story}} of how the book was put together. The body of the novel is composed of a polemical collection of versions of Paraguayan history. The first text is what the Supreme dictates to his assistant Patiño, about what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present. This includes the constant abuses Francia heaps upon Patiño and their attempts to discover the authors of a pasquinade, found nailed {{to the door of the}} Asunción Cathedral, that falsely announces Francia's death and burial arrangements. It is mostly Francia's vulgar rambling, including accusing meek Patiño of attempting to usurp him. The author of the pasquinade is never discovered in spite of their high scrutiny.|$|E

500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> news media. I just thought that this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Lim {{expressed}} concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 {{that would allow}} magistrates to hear what are called [...] "first mentions" [...] through video conferencing. A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that {{they were allowed to}} complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and {{will be able to see}} what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are about}} 200 minigames {{included}} in WarioWare: Smooth Moves, an amount similar to previous WarioWare titles. Abe determined which minigames were included after each team member wrote down an idea {{on a piece}} of paper and sent it to him. The minigames were inspired by [...] "very original, everyday life issues". To offer a different visual style for each minigame, developers were asked to make their own design for the minigame that they were working on. During development, one of the game's basic concepts was to [...] "make a different taste for every single game". The only rule that Abe imposed on the minigame designs was for the developers to make it instantly obvious as to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minigames. The Wii Remote's speaker is used in the game to [...] "add a greater sense of feel". For example, in one microgame, the player must bounce a tennis ball on a racquet. When the ball touches the racquet, the Wii Remote's speaker emits a bouncing sound and a rumble to [...] "add a very strong reality to the game". The game mostly forgoes the Wii nunchuk attachment and functions strictly with the Wii Remote. Its visual presentation is similar to [...] for the Nintendo GameCube, and it does not run in widescreen mode.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing a}} new script, Rucka tries {{to follow the}} world-building model used by William Gibson in Neuromancer and provide {{information}} about the environment through context instead of exposition. His biggest struggle is delivering details while maintaining a proper narrative pace. He sometimes self-censors [...] "exceptionally dark" [...] material {{because he does not}} want to make Lark draw it. After Lark receives a new script, the collaboration between them is [...] "immediate and constant". Lark questions Rucka about characterization and the direction of the story, resulting in rewrites and a better final product. Rucka says Lark intuitively knows what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story even when it isn't clearly scripted. Rucka and Lark have an ongoing conversation about how to show the injustice in the way Forever is treated without being complicit in it themselves. For example, medics must remove Forever's clothes to treat her wounds. Lark wanted to avoid sexualizing the images, but also avoid being [...] "coy" [...] by simply blocking parts of her body with another character's arm. The script gives Lark no direction for aspects like architecture, clothing, or vehicle design. Designing these technical details involves research into prototype technology and takes almost as long as drawing the actual pages for the comics. The time required to create the sets is the primary reason Lark sometimes falls behind schedule.|$|E

5000|$|Verbs that <b>are</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current moment <b>are</b> usually {{conjugated}} in this tense, {{though some}} verbs will be conjugated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent past tense.
