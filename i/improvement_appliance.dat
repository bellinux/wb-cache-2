The present study estimates the potential of demand-side management efficiency improvement targeted at (1) short-term efficiency improvement (agricultural pump rectification) that can provide immediate relief, and (2) long-term efficiency <b>improvement</b> (<b>appliance</b> standards such as AC and refrigerator, new agricultural pump purchase and pump replacement) for Gujarat state in India. The methodology includes the calculation of cost of conserved energy for each technology, which works out to be (- 1. 18) Â US$ cents/kWÂ h for new agriculture pump sets, 1. 03 Â US$ cents/kWÂ h for refrigerators and 5. 21 Â US$ cents/kWÂ h for air conditioners. The price of power varies around 1. 13 Â US$ cents to 12. 1 Â cents/kWÂ h in Gujarat. The annual energy savings from the selected energy-efficient technologies are approximately 8767 Â GWÂ h {{over a period of}} 10 Â yr, while the estimated peak power savings are about 1814 Â MW, large enough to eliminate one-fourth of the state's electricity shortages.

40|$|Abstract—The {{continued}} {{growth of the}} web places ever increasing performance demands on web site front-end appliances. In many cases, these appliances have to forward network traffic to and from web servers at transport and application levels utilizing complete TCP/IP stack processing, which could easily make the front-end appliance a bottleneck for a web site. This paper describes four novel optimizations of the TCP/IP stack processing for a TCP forwarding appliance: acknowledgement aggregation, fast path for incoming packets, double allocation avoidance in TCP module, and packet reuse. These optimizations are applicable for different throughputs and MTU sizes on the forwarding path when traditional approaches for performance improvements, such as TCP splicing, could not be applied. These optimizations are implemented in context of a web booster appliance that modifies web site traffic to decrease {{the cost of the}} network processing on a web server. These four optimizations, applied together with device driver polling, result in four-fold <b>improvement</b> in <b>appliance</b> throughput compared to a base case. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this work was the {{development}} of an IGBT PS full-bridge inverter of 100 kW and 50 kHz where the switching sequence was modified in order to improve its reliability in industrial applications like induction heating where a large number of cycles are required. The modified PS inverter is a cost-effective solution that incorporates the following <b>improvements.</b> Home <b>appliances</b> represent a substantial part of the residential energy consumption. For this reason the efficiency of the power converter is a key design aspect, as it defines not only the environmental impact but also the final appliance performance and reliability. This paper describes an induction heating system of 100 kW and 50 kHz for industrial applications, which uses a novel control scheme based on a PS IGBT full-bridge SRI that allows us to improve its reliability significantly by increasing the lifetime of the IGBTs. To achieve this, the inverter should always perform zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation and the impact of the turn-off switching losses in the temperature increase of the IGBT junction should be as low as possible.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} space heating energy efficiency and two related but distinct measures; greenhouse mitigation, and peak demand. The historic role of Melbourne’s space heating provides an opportunity to assess whether improvements in energy efficiency lead to sustained reductions in energy consumption or whether rebound factors “take back” efficiency gains in the long run. Despite significant and sustained <b>improvements</b> in <b>appliance</b> efficiency, and the thermal efficiency of new building fabrics, the per-capita heating energy consumption has remained remarkably stable over the past 50 years. Space heating efficiency is bound up with notions of comfort, sufficiency and lifestyle, and the short-run gains from efficiency become incorporated into {{a new set of}} norms. It is this evolution of cultural norms that reconciles the contradiction between the short-run gains from efficiency measures, with the efficiency rebound that becomes evident over the long-term.

In this period no significant trends towards a lower energy intensity were found {{and there is no}} indication of dematerialisation of consumption patterns. Between 1995 and 2030 private expenditures will increase by 120 % to 180 % per person. In 1995 the energy requirement per person was 103 GJ. Between 1995 and 2030 the energy requirement per person due to private consumption will increase by 30 % to 60 %. If the growth of the population is also included, this increase will be 54 % to 75 % in 35 years time.

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{adhesive}} potential, the mechanics implicated in adhesive failure, {{and the effect}} on the enamel of four brands of lingual brackets. Methods: One hundred sixty premolars and four types of commercially available lingual brackets (STB, ORG, Magic, and Stealth) were selected. Forty brackets per manufacturer were used, half bonded directly and half indirectly. Each of these bonding groups was further subdivided: 10 brackets were bonded without treatment, while the other 10 were sandblasted. Thus, a total of four groups were created for each type of bracket: (a) sandblasted and directly bonded, (b) sandblasted and indirectly bonded, (c) not sandblasted and directly bonded, and (d) not sandblasted and indirectly bonded. Immediately after bonding, each bracket was tested for adhesion strength, and each appliance was then examined via electron microscopy to calculate the ARI. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant difference among the four bracket types; a general <b>improvement</b> in lingual <b>appliance</b> mechanical features provoked by sandblasting, albeit with some exceptions; and no significant effect of bonding method on the degree of bond strength. The ARI revealed that the most common area of adhesion crisis was at the adhesive-bracket interface. Conclusion: Overall, STB brackets performed better, and sandblasting proved to be an efficient way of improving the mechanical features of lingual brackets. Bonding technique, on the other hand, did not seem to exert a great influence on bonding success, and the bracket-adhesive interface was identified as the area most prone to failure...|$|R

By 2013, China has developed and implemented 52 Energy Efficiency Standards (EES) and 28 mandatory energy labels {{for a wide}} range of domestic, commercial, and selected industrial equipment. However, despite of the large number of standards issued, big challenges remain with how to ensure the standards keep up with the dynamic evolvement of technologies and appliance market after they enter effect.

40|$|In 2001 energy {{consumption}} in the U. S. household sector was 6 percent higher than in 1980 (13 percent if weather-adjusted). During this same time period, the number of households increased by almost 31 percent. Clearly, U. S. households, on average, seem to be using energy more efficiently {{than they did in}} 1980. This paper looks at two decades of energy–intensity trends. Energy intensity measures are often used as a measure of energy efficiency and its change over time. However, energy-intensity indicators may mask structural and behavioral changes. Energy intensity measurement is often {{the best we can do}} with available data. Without a structural and behavioral context, the indicators can be misleading as a measure for energy efficiency. Using data from the series of Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Surveys, this paper first takes a look at the trends for energy intensity using the most aggregated measure, household energy per real dollar of personal disposable income and then looks at trends using three common demand indicators, energy per household, energy per household member, and energy per square foot. If energy intensity is measured using total site energy, each of the three measures listed earlier for total energy, was lower in 2001 than in 1980 -even after adjusting for the effects of weather. Next the paper looks at an example of structural changes, a change in the mix of energy used and its effect on energy-intensity trends. The paper then looks at other underlying factors affecting the trends in energy intensity. These factors include energy-efficiency <b>improvements</b> such as <b>appliance</b> standards and demand-side management programs. Other factors discussed are those leading to structural changes including: changes in housing unit type; household size and location, as well as the behavioral effects of income growth...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify robust technology and policy options which achieve substantial reductions in electricity demand in China's Shandong Province. This research utilizes a scenario-based approach to identify sensible and feasible energy efficiency and load reduction strategies. The research consists of technical analyses through the development of an hourly load simulation model to study the time and temperature sensitive impacts on electricity demand growth by different demand-side management (DSM) scenarios and a policy analysis to formulate policy priorities based on the socio-economic and environmental realities in China. This bottom-up comprehensive study helps inform decision-making given the technological, consumption and socio-economic conditions in large-scale electricity grid systems of Shandong and China, thus preferred DSM strategies are identified, and sensible policy recommendations are made with respect to Shandong province and China as a whole. This study developed a computer-based modeling tool for peak-load based electric demand analysis and long-term projections. (cont.) The model simulates disaggregated hourly electric loads by end-user types with temperature-sensitive load simulation capability, which takes into account time use patterns, life-style and behavioral factors, distributed consumption behaviors of electricity users, appliances and equipment utilization patterns, environmental factors, and industrial structural and operational parameters. The simulation and scenario based research methodology provides a comparative basis, and dynamic insights to electricity demand in areas when limited generation and consumption information is available, which is especially appropriate for electricity sector studies in developing countries. The research showed that demand side management strategies could result in significant reduction in the peak loads as well as the total electricity consumption in Shandong. (cont.) The results of the technical analysis concluded that (1) temperature sensitive load makes up the fastest growing demand within the entire consumption profile; (2) implementation of building energy efficiency strategies demonstrates the largest energy saving potential; (3) implementation of appliances standards, has limited effects on energy saving; (4) load management strategies to induce changes in consumption behaviors also shows great potential, however, they are difficult to estimate; and (5) urbanization policies also have a strong impact on electricity consumption. The recommended DSM policy priorities are based on the energy-saving potentials of the DSM strategies, which are listed in priority order: (1) improvement of building technology, (2) management of new installation first (3) management of temperature sensitive loads, (4) implementation of behavioral and load management strategies, (5) better management of urbanization policies (6) promotion of aggressive industrial motor substitution measures & industrial structural changes, and (6) <b>improvement</b> of <b>appliance</b> efficiency. (cont.) This research also formulated integrated DSM policy recommendations to the Chinese government that are centered by the development of coordinated DSM policy framework, and that are based upon the current technological, managerial and institutional capacities of Chinese industry and governmental agencies. The details include moving away from the traditional utility centered IRP/DSM framework, developing a robust energy efficiency services industry, setting correct DSM priorities and implementing them, developing and upgrading the domestic energy efficiency product industry, and engaging end-user participation. The thesis recognized the barriers and difficulties in the policy implementation and stressed the importance of continuous adaptation and institutional learning in the implementation process. by Chia-Chin Cheng.
