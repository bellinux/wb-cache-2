50|$|After a BC derailment, CN {{introduced}} <b>ditch</b> <b>lights,</b> lights {{mounted on}} or {{just below the}} anti-climbers on the front pilot of a locomotive. These are used to make trains more visible at grade-crossings, and to give better visibility around curves. Since then, <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> have become standard features on all North American locomotives.|$|R

25|$|The lights {{fitted to}} diesel {{locomotives}} vary {{from country to}} country. North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) {{and a pair of}} <b>ditch</b> <b>lights.</b> The latter are fitted low down at the front and are designed to make the locomotive easily visible as it approaches a grade crossing. Older locomotives may be fitted with a Gyralite or Mars Light instead of the <b>ditch</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R

50|$|Basic {{locomotive}} decoders provide {{control of}} speed and direction while supplemental function decoders control headlights, <b>ditch</b> <b>lights,</b> or movable non-traction components such as remote-controlled pantographs.|$|R
50|$|A new {{electric}} {{parking brake}} has been added with brake wheel {{on the left side}} of the long hood. <b>Ditch</b> <b>lights</b> have also been added to the rear during rebuilding.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{mainline}} qualifications, RM 31 {{has been}} fitted with an events recorder, train radio, and <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> at either end. These are recessed into the railcar's front fairings {{so as not to}} detract from the original character of the railcar.|$|R
50|$|Many railroads used Mars {{lights on}} a variety of locomotives, both steam and Diesel. Mars Lights are no longer used by railways, having been {{replaced}} by <b>ditch</b> <b>lights,</b> with the exception of some passenger carriers, such as Chicago's Metra. They are still used on fire fighting apparatus, and are available from Tri Lite / Mars, located in Chicago, Illinois.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States and in {{countries}} following United States practices, a locomotive {{must have a}} bright headlight and <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> (two lights located below the headlight), a working bell, and a whistle or horn that must be sounded four times (long-long-short-long), similar to the signal for the International Morse Code letter [...] "Q", as the train approaches the crossing.|$|R
50|$|Cores for the {{locomotives}} {{come from}} CPs fleet of EMD SD40-2s and SD40-2Fs. The frames, trucks, and internal components are reused while a new (standard) cab, designed and constructed by EMD, and a fuel tank is built new for each unit. With the increased emissions requirements, the locomotives feature flared radiators {{similar to those}} on the EMD SD45 to house additional cooling equipment. The locomotives have a snoot nose to house additional electronics, and all lighting {{with the exception of}} the headlights and <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> are LED.|$|R
50|$|The {{model was}} {{significantly}} re-engineered following the sixth run, and re-released in September 2009 {{at a new}} retail price of $275 per unit. Engines of runs seven and above include speaker enclosures within the chassis, working marker and <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> (with a manual switch under the fuel tank) and a modified coupler attachment system with the coupler box opening filled in. Austrains was also involved {{in the production of}} non-motored NR class models in N scale, sold to guests on Great Southern Rail's services as souvenirs.|$|R
50|$|GP20C-ECOs {{use just}} enough rebuilt {{components}} to designate them a rebuild. The GP20C-ECOs feature a new frame, fuel tank, long hood, and cab with CP providing trucks, prime mover, and alternator (along {{with many other}} smaller components), mainly from retired CP GP9s, that are rebuilt and reused in the locomotives. The units resemble a GP60's long hood and feature a snoot nose, which set the cab back slightly on the frame {{to make room for}} the additional length. As with the SD30C-ECOs, the GP20C-ECOs have all-LED lighting with the exception of the headlights and <b>ditch</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Former Conrail {{locomotives}} can {{be spotted}} by recognizing phase differences in engine models and numbering. Other spotting details can be inconsistent, but can include {{a number of}} the following: red marker lights, Leslie model RS3L or RS5T air horns (only a few original horns remain. Many have been replaced by K5LAs), former Conrail SD40-2s ride on Flexicoil [...] "C" [...] trucks and have anti-climbers, <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> mounted beneath the anti-climber, headlights above the cab (vs. CSX's standard practice of nose mounted headlights on all wide-nose GE units), and modified [...] "Bright Future" [...] paint with battery box faces painted yellow (instead of black or blue).|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Metro-North {{took over}} {{operations}} from Conrail and {{embarked on a}} capital improvement program that included the installation of cab signals on its main lines. 34 cars were sent to Morrison-Knudsen for a rebuild to be equipped with cab signals with another 34 cars getting a lighter rebuild in house. The remainder of the fleet was retired leaving Metro-North with 68 active 1100 series ACMU cars. The non-cab signal equipped cars were referred to as [...] "B cars" [...] and used {{in the middle of}} trainsets. ACMUs were restricted from operating to Brewster North in later years because the ACMUs were never fitted with the FRA required <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> for operation over grade crossings, per a 1997 mandate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Morrison-Knudsen was {{contacted}} by the Maryland Transit Administration to assemble a fleet of GP40s for use on MARC. They entered service in 1994. GP40WH-2s are equipped with a Cummins head-end power generator. The Federal Railroad Administration exempted these units from the [...] "triangular light pattern" [...] rule because the engines were ordered with Gyralites before the mandatory use of <b>ditch</b> <b>lights.</b> All but one have been retired following the completion of an order for new MP36 locomotives. MARC only retains one GP40WH-2 (No. 68), for emergencies and track work. Several unit were leased to the MBTA for a time, but are all now out of service and later returned to MPI. CSX bought one unit for use on maintenance trains, numbered 9969. The remaining GP40WH-2 units were rebuilt into MP32PH-Q units for SunRail.|$|R
500|$|The {{longevity}} of the F40PH {{has led to}} numerous conversions, rebuildings, and remanufacturings. Several transit agencies lengthened their locomotives to include a separate HEP generator. These were designated F40PH-2C where Cummins generators were employed and F40PH-CAT where Caterpillar generators were used. The F40PH-2C was considerably heavier than the standard design, weighing [...] The F40PH-2D, employed by Via Rail, had special customizations for operating in Canada, including <b>ditch</b> <b>lights.</b> Metra's last 30 locomotives, designated F40PHM-2, were built with a sloped cab similar to the EMD F59PHI and experimental EMD F69PHAC. The streamlined appearance acquired the nickname [...] "Winnebago. Speno's four locomotives, designated F40PH-2M, were delivered without turbochargers, limiting power output to [...] The five EMD GP40 locomotives Morrison-Knudsen rebuilt for Tri-Rail in 1988 were designated F40PHL-2. Progress Rail rebuilt 41 Metra units with remanufactured engines, rebuilt traction motors and microprocessor traction control. These have been designated the F40PH-3.|$|R
25|$|To {{cope with}} {{increasing}} ridership, the MTA announced in August 2008 {{the acquisition of}} 13 Kawasaki bi-level passenger cars from VRE, originally scheduled {{to be placed in}} service by November 2008. The first units were placed in service in mid-January 2009 on the Brunswick line. The MTA has announced that all 13 cars will be placed in service on the Brunswick Line to replace the aging ex-Metra gallery cars. These units have seats with a slightly different design facing towards the center of the cars (as opposed to facing the ends as on the original MARC cars). The ex-VRE cab cars (7855–7858) also use conventional <b>ditch</b> <b>lights</b> as opposed to the gyra lights used on the original MARC III cab cars. The $22million purchase is a 10% increase in fleet size from 122passenger cars. However, due to an increase in ridership, the ex-Metra cars have remained in service along the Brunswick Line and the ex-VRE cars operate across all 3 lines.|$|R

50|$|DG 772/DG 2255 {{was saved}} by the Diesel Traction Group in 1983. In 1988, 772 was repainted into the {{traditional}} NZR red with larch yellow nose stripes on {{the noise of the}} loco (as it was introduced) for the Ferrymead 125 celebrations, during which it hauled its first excursion train with DE 511 to Springfield and return. During the early 1990s, it also hauled a few more excursion including on the Otago Central Railway and on the Midland Line. In 1995, 772 was then placed on loan to the Weka Pass Railway to cover for their DG 770 while it was out of service for repairs. It was then placed into storage between mid to late 1990s, the loco was place into storage until 2002 when it was decided to overhaul the locomotive to current mainline standards. as part of this, the locomotive's Westinghouse A7EL brake system was replaced by the newer 26L system, and it was fitted with <b>ditch</b> <b>lights,</b> a VHF radio and an events recorder to allow it to run on the main line. The overhaul was completed in 2009, just in time of the 125th anniversary of the Otago Central Railway. Before it was sent south for the anniversary, the 'DG' was leased to the Weka Pass Railway for running-in purposes. The loco has ran several excursions since then, as well it has been occasionally been seen running on the Ferrymead Railway at the Ferrymead Heritage Park.|$|R
2500|$|Conrail {{was divided}} between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation in 1999, with all {{remaining}} locomotives having been repainted, but ex-CR units can be spotted. CR units had similar {{features such as}} [...] "Bright Future" [...] blue paint, flashing <b>ditch</b> <b>lights,</b> and Leslie RS-3L horns. Another key spotting feature is ditchlights mounted under the locomotive's front deck. This is a preference different from Norfolk Southern, who orders their locomotives with the lights above the deck. Marker lights, or class lights, were also a preference of Conrail. Most Conrail engines still have marker lights on CSX, while NS opted to remove them. All Conrail locomotives that went to CSX were re-painted into CSX colors. All of the Conrail units owned by NS have been either repainted or retired, as the last unit in 'Big Blue' being NS 8312, was retired. Conrail was the only railroad to receive EMD SD80MACs (the Chicago North & Western were originally supposed to receive SD80MACs with marker lights, but when that railroad merged with Union Pacific, the order was rescinded) and were separated evenly between CSX and NS. Conrail had a different scheme for these locomotives and also the SD70MAC, with a large white, cone shaped line on the front, bearing [...] "Conrail Quality". The SD70MACs weren't fitted with marker lights, {{as it would be}} useless when given to NS and CSX. This goes along with the standard-cab SD70, Conrail's final order of locomotives, as they were in Norfolk Southern's preferred numbering (the 2500 series).|$|R

50|$|At {{approximately}} 2 a.m. on September 3, 1965, Norman Muscarello was hitchhiking to his parents' home in Exeter along Highway 150. Muscarello, 18, {{had recently}} {{graduated from high}} school and was about to leave for service in the United States Navy. He had been visiting his girlfriend at her parents' home in nearby Amesbury, Massachusetts; since he did not own a car, he would catch a ride to and from his girlfriend's home. However, at that time of night there was little traffic on the highway, and as he walked he noticed five flashing red lights in some nearby woods. The lights illuminated the woods and a nearby farmhouse. (The farm belonged to the Dining family, who were not at home at the time.) The lights soon moved towards him, and Muscarello became terrified and dived into a <b>ditch.</b> The <b>lights</b> moved away and hovered near the Dining farmhouse before going back into the woods. Muscarello ran to the farmhouse, pounded on the door and yelled for help, but no one answered. When he saw a car coming down the road, he ran into the road and forced it to stop.
