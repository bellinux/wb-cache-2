During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told you that you have to prove <b>it...</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a terrorist... you have to prove <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are an innocent man and why you are sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For how is <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend {{is included in the}} memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

So which one is <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are selling?...Well, it's really both." [...] According to Andy Rubin, the emphasis of Google Play arose after Google learned that customers buy into an application [...] "ecosystem" [...] when purchasing tablets, unlike phones where hardware is the primary determining factor.

Android 5.0 ("Lollipop") was released for the Nexus7 WiFi edition in November 2014, although users reported that the update rendered the tablet very slow. Some of the issues with Android 5.0 have reportedly been addressed in an Android 5.0.2 update. In March 2015, the Nexus 7 was upgraded to Android 5.1, which fixes the lagging issues. But some users reported that the update did not fix performance problems.|$|E

500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, {{and was one of the}} reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

For that sacrament which you receive is made what it is by the word of Christ. But if the word of Elijah had such power as to bring down fire from heaven, shall not the word of Christ have power to change the nature of the elements? ... Why do you seek the order of nature in the Body of Christ, seeing that the Lord Jesus Himself was born of a Virgin, not according to nature? It is the true Flesh of Christ which was crucified and buried, this is then truly the Sacrament of His Body. The Lord Jesus Himself proclaims: [...] "This Is My Body." [...] Before the blessing of the heavenly words another nature is spoken of, after the consecration the Body is signified. He Himself speaks of His Blood. Before the consecration it has another name, after it is called Blood. And you say, Amen, that is, It is true.

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
2500|$|Palm Beach {{was to be}} the {{terminus}} of the Flagler railroad, {{but during}} 1894 and 1895, severe freezes hit all of Central Florida, whereas the Miami area remained unaffected, causing Flagler to rethink his original decision not to move the railroad south of Palm Beach. The fable that Julia Tuttle, one of two main landowners in the Miami area along with the Brickell family, sent orange blossoms to Flagler to prove to him that Miami, unlike the rest of the state, was unaffected by the frost is untrue. The fact is, that Mrs. Tuttle wired Mr. Flagler to advise him that [...] "the region around the shores of Biscayne Bay is untouched by the freezes." [...] Mr. Flagler sent his two now famous in Florida history lieutenants, James E. Ingraham and Joseph R. Parrott, to investigate and they brought boxes of truck (produce) and citrus back to Mr. Flagler, who then wired Mrs. Tuttle, asking, [...] "Madam, what is <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> propose?" [...] To convince Flagler to continue the railroad to Miami, both Julia Tuttle and William Brickell offered half of their holdings north and south of the Miami River to Mr. Flagler. [...] Mrs. Tuttle added [...] for shops and yards if Mr. Flagler would extend his railroad to the shores of Biscayne Bay and build one of his great hotels. [...] An agreement was made and contracts were signed. On September 7, 1895, the name of Flagler's system was changed from the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway Company to the Florida East Coast Railway Company and incorporated. On April 15, 1896, track reached Biscayne Bay, the site of present-day downtown Miami. At the time, it was a small settlement of less than 50 inhabitants. When the town incorporated, on July 28, 1896, its citizens wanted to honor the man responsible for the city's development by naming it Flagler. He declined the honor, persuading them to retain its old Indian name, Miami. The area was actually previously known as Fort Dallas after the fort built there in 1836 during the Second Seminole War. To further develop the area surrounding the Miami railroad station, Flagler dredged a channel, built streets and The Royal Palm Hotel, instituted the first water and power systems, and financed the town's first newspaper, the Metropolis. Flagler was a great visionary and he can be credited {{for the development of the}} entire east coast of Florida. Yet he lacked vision on at least one issue: he felt that Miami would never be more than a fishing village.|$|E
