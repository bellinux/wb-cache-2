5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, <b>Eastern</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pine),</b> spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{habitats}} {{are found}} within the parks. Originally {{most of the land}} was forested with large <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pines,</b> but was denuded by loggers. [...] Most of the vegetation today is second-growth forest, with some sections dominated by maples and basswoods and others by <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pines.</b> [...] Drier areas support oak savanna while wetter areas bear floodplain forest. The driest hilltops even support prickly pear cactus. Early successional species take hold on the exposed basalt rocks. Over 400 species of ferns and flowering plants have been catalogued in the Wisconsin park.|$|R
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with several pine species, particularly <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine,</b> and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a disjunct distribution, and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout {{the range of the}} host tree. The mushroom is edible, although opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus species, including the closely related S.decipiens, although the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine,</b> and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
50|$|The lakeshore {{is covered}} in a pine-oak forest. <b>Eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> are dominant, with red pines {{clustered}} atop the sandstone cliffs along the water's edge. The hardwoods are a mix of white, red, and black oaks.|$|R

50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{this part}} of the Mille Lacs Uplands is still recovering from 19th century human industry and forest fires. The forest was logged, and around the quarry the ground was stripped bare. Today middle-successional species like birch and aspen are more prevalent than the Norway and <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> that would have originally dominated the area.|$|R
5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, a mutualistic relationship {{where the}} fungus forms a sheath {{on the surface}} of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis, while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, the area surrounding the lake consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal. Much of the area is similar to Pennsylvania in climate, vegetation and wildlife. The lake is near the southern limit for Eastern hemlock and <b>Eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. Forests surrounding the lake contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Painted Trillium, which grows near Rhododrendron. Boulderfields near Sosebee Cove include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
50|$|Jacobsburg Enivronmental Education Center {{is home to}} {{the only}} {{remaining}} old-growth forest in the Lehigh Valley. The Henry's Woods section of the park is a largely virgin forest. Ecologists note the lack of large <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> in what is otherwise a stand of old growth deciduous trees and eastern hemlock. The trees are up to 130 feet in height.|$|R
25|$|Small groves or {{individual}} specimens of old growth <b>Eastern</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pines</b> are found across {{the range of}} the species in the USA, including in Ordway Pines, Maine; Ice Glen, Massachusetts; and Adirondack Park, New York. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced old field ecological succession. The tall stands in Mohawk Trail State Forest and William Cullen Bryant Homestead in Massachusetts are examples.|$|R
5000|$|The Forrest H. Dutlinger Natural Area is a {{protected}} area in Clinton County, Pennsylvania {{that includes a}} 158 acre old-growth forest of Eastern Hemlock, American Beech, Black Cherry, Sugar Maple, and Northern Red Oak. There are also <b>Eastern</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pines,</b> but a few were selectively logged around 1900. The largest tree is an Eastern Hemlock, 43 in diameter at breast height and 112 ft tall.|$|R
5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with <b>Eastern</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pine.</b> The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} to tell the difference between the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American {{slippery}} Jack (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> {{and can be found}} where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores {{on the underside of the}} cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S.americanus may be the same species as S.sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{have their}} roots {{in the ground and}} their trunk and {{branches}} extended towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it. In India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk. Democracy started in North America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their weapons under the Tree of Peace, an <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus). In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of Eden.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the {{construction}} and maintenance of the huge number of ships required to build and defend the British Empire left few trees in Britain suitable for use as large spars. <b>Eastern</b> <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> from colonial New England were superior timber for the single-stick masts and booms of the day. To maintain Britain's naval and trading advantage, laws were passed in North America to protect selected <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> for British shipbuilding. British success in the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) were {{due in large part}} to the control of the seas by the Royal Navy.|$|R

Nine of fifteen Scotch pines died within 4 months of nematode infection {{or during the}} winter and early spring following infection. A single <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> and shortleaf <b>pine</b> died. No jack pines died. A single Scotch pine control died, apparently the result of natural nematode infection. No other controls died. Mean oleoresin flow did not differ among nematode-inoculated jack and shortleaf pines and their respective controls. Oleoresin flow in nematode-inoculated <b>eastern</b> <b>white</b> and Scotch <b>pines</b> was significantly lower than in their controls.

5000|$|One goal {{of looking}} at overall tree shape {{is to find a}} method of {{determining}} overall tree volume using a minimum of measurements and a generalized volume formula. The simplest method to achieve this is to model the entire trunk with one application of a solid. Application of one form to the whole tree has been discussed {{as a way to get}} a quick volume approximation. But, the method is unlikely to produce an accurate result. [...] Given the general form changes from the base to top of the tree and the pattern of change in form factor over time, a predictive model was developed and applied to a variety of trees in New England where volume estimates were made based upon measurements tree height, girth at breast height, girth at root flair, and assigned values for form factor (taper), and a flare factor. For young to mature <b>Eastern</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pines,</b> applying the cross-sectional area at trunk flare with full tree height in the cone formula almost always overstates the fully modeled volume. Similarly, using the cross-sectional area at breast height with full tree height in the cone formula usually understates the volume. These values provide an upper and lower bound for actual volume for younger trees. Old-growth pines can develop a columnar form, and if they have only a modest root flare, the actual trunk volume can exceed the volume as estimated by the upper bound formula. In an analysis of 44 trees, including 42 <b>Eastern</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pines,</b> one <b>Eastern</b> Hemlock, and a single Tuliptree, the average of the upper and lower-bound volumes as compared to the modeled volume shows that the average divided by the modeled volumes is 0.98 with a standard deviation of 0.10. The volumes of 34 trees fall within the hypothetical upper and lower-bound calculations.|$|R
