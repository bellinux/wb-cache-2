50|$|The term All-On-4 {{refers to}} “All” teeth being {{supported}} “on four” dental implants, a surgical and technique prosthodontics1 2 procedure for total {{rehabilitation of the}} edentulous patient or for patients with badly broken down teeth, decayed teeth or compromised teeth due to gum disease. It consists of the rehabilitation of either edentulous or dentate maxilla and/or mandible with <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> by placing four implants in the anterior maxilla, where bone density is higher. The four implants support a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> with 10 to 14 teeth and it is placed immediately, typically within 24 hours of surgery.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} major {{disciplines}} within dental technology. These are <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> including crowns, bridges and implants; removable prosthesis, including dentures and removable partial dentures; maxillofacial prosthesis, including ocular prosthesis and craniofacial prosthesis; and orthodontics and auxiliaries, including orthodontic appliances and mouthguards.|$|E
30|$|The implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{showed the}} highest complication-free {{survival}} rate in our study. It {{was reported that}} the veneering material’s chipping/fracture {{is the most common}} type of prosthetic complication for <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> [31, 32]. Pjetursson et al. reported that veneer fracture was observed in 13.5 % of <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> after at least 5 -year functioning [33]. In the present study, approx. 76 % of the <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> were not veneered (metal occlusal surface), resulting in the lower complication rate after 25  years of functioning.|$|R
30|$|This {{study is}} to compare the two {{different}} techniques used in the labeling of implant-based <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses,</b> using the square code and using microchip labeling techniques, {{taking into account the}} properties of an ideal prosthetic labeling technique. Sixty implants <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> were produced, 30 for each group. Square codes were created on the lingual bands of implants <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> which are the samples of the group that were labelled by using square code, and microchips were placed in the implant abutments of the samples in the group that were labelled with the microchip.|$|R
30|$|Medical {{records were}} reviewed, and the patient-related {{parameters}} of age, gender, smoking habit, {{the date of}} implant surgery, and {{the date of the}} prosthesis setting were collected. The information of implant (length, diameter, type), site of implantation, width of keratinized mucosa, and additional pre- and/or post-implant surgery (i.e., bone augmentation, soft tissue management) was also collected. The types of prostheses were classified into implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses,</b> tooth implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses,</b> and implant-supported overdentures.|$|R
50|$|Bone cement {{has proven}} {{particularly}} useful because specific active substances, e.g. antibiotics, {{can be added}} to the powder component. The active substances are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much active substance is in the cement matrix but how much of the active substance is actually released locally. Too much active substance in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is weakened by a high proportion of active substance in the cement. The local active substance levels of industrially manufactured bone cements that are formed by the use of bone cements that contain active substances are approximate (assuming that there is no incompatibility) and are significantly below the clinical routine dosages for systemic single injections.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess and}} compare patient {{satisfaction}} and oral health-related {{quality of life}} (OHQOL) in patients treated with implant-supported overdentures and complete implant fixed prostheses. From a database of patients who had undergone implant treatment over a 6 -year period, a study population of 62 patients was identified; every patient had at least four implants placed in one edentulous arch and was restored with either an overdenture or a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Patients were examined and a self-administered, structured multiple-response questionnaire, including the Oral Health Impact Profile- 14 measurement tool and a patient satisfaction survey, {{was used to evaluate}} patient-centered treatment outcomes. Generally, patient satisfaction was very high in both the implant overdenture and <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> groups, although the subjects in the overdenture group, who had mostly maxillary prostheses, reported significantly lower overall satisfaction and lower satisfaction with chewing capacity and esthetics. In just three categories [...] cost, satisfaction with treating doctor, and ability to perform oral hygiene measures [...] the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> group was less satisfied than the removable overdenture group, but the difference was not significant. Similarly, the overall OHQOL was high, although patients receiving a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> demonstrated significantly lower psychologic discomfort and psychological disability compared to the overdenture group. Among all patients who had similar numbers of implants placed, those who received an implant overdenture were less satisfied and had lower OHQOL than the patients who had a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Since patient and dentist preferences influenced the type of prosthesis provided, it is likely that subjective, patient-related factors are major determinants of satisfaction and treatment outcomes...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 106 {{prostheses}} {{were applied to}} 92 patients. Nine prostheses were single crowns, 17 prostheses were implant-supported overdentures, and the other 80 <b>prostheses</b> were multiunit <b>fixed</b> partial dentures. Thirty-seven of the multiunit fixed partial dentures were splinted with natural teeth as an abutment (i.e., tooth implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses).</b> With respect to the materials of the occlusal surface, 21 of the <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> were veneered with porcelain, and the other 68 were made from dental alloys (Au-Pt or Au-Ag-Pd alloys).|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two {{different}} labelling methods, namely, microchip and square code, which can be used in implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses.</b>|$|R
30|$|It is {{not always}} {{possible}} for patients to store implant or dental company information. However, access to this information would be beneficial to dentists (Mohan et al. 2012). It is possible to acquire this information by labelling implant abutments or crowns. Although several previous studies have explored prosthetic labelling, most have focused on removable dentures. In addition, few studies have investigated the labelling of implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses.</b> In our study, we demonstrate {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of labelling implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> using microchip and QR code techniques.|$|R
40|$|A {{completely}} edentulous {{patient has}} few treatment options in conventional dentistry. <b>Fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is often preferred {{as the first}} treatment option. Oral rehabilitation for a patient with loss of alveolar bone and soft tissue presents a challenge to clinicians. Replacing teeth with dental implants requires extensive planning. It is a paradigm shift for the patient to adjust to completely fixed set of teeth from edentulism. Planning treatment steps and designing of the implant supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> are primarily important {{to respond to the}} esthetic and functional requirements of a fully edentulous patients 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports a}} {{clinical}} case of prosthetic rehabilitation {{of a patient}} with a totally edentulous maxilla using a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> supported by six implants, but modified by {{the inclusion of a}} removable gingival veneer retained with attachments. This alternative provides a rehabilitation model as functional and comfortable as the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> enhancing facial aesthetics (reestablishing lip support) and phonetics and facilitating patient access for proper peri-implant hygiene and prosthesis cleaning. We concluded that implant-supported fixed maxillary restorations, modified by the inclusion of a removable gingival veneer, come as a great alternative in cases of severe maxillary alveolar ridge atrophy...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{investigation}} is elaboration of the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> occlusive surface individual simulation method on {{a basis of}} the tooth occlusive surface age change study. Materials and Methods. A three-dimensional contact scanner of the ″Roland DG Corporation″ firm, model ″PIX- 4 ″ was used in work. A scanning of {{the upper and lower}} jaw diagnostic plaster model 60 pairs, received in humans of the different age groups with intact dental rows and orthognathic occlusion is made. A treatment of the received data and detection of the abrasion facet area and the lateral tooth tubercle clivus divergence angle sizes were accomplished with a use of a computer 3 D-program ″Catia 5 - 14 ″. The age changes of the second tooth occlusive surface relief are studied. The received data of a physiologic abrasion was in a basis of the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> occlusive surface individual simulation method creation considering the patient’s age and prevailing side of chewing. The received results of the masticatory muscle tonometry and the temporomandibular joint arthrotribography in patients with a partial loss of teeth prior and after treatment prove, that the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> occlusive surface individual simulation unlike a traditional method more effectively reduces the masticatory muscle contractile ability and tonic activity, and normalizes the temporomandibular joint arthrotribographic values and the masticatory muscle contractile activity asymmetry of the right and left sides. A statistical reliability of the <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> occlusive surface individual simulation proposed method effectiveness is confirmed by the Wilcoxon and Friedman tests...|$|E

The existing <b>fixed</b> dental <b>prosthesis</b> {{was used in the}} fabrication of the maxillary immediate complete denture to preserve esthetics. The technique involved recording and {{preservation of}} the occlusal vertical dimension and occlusion of the existing prosthesis.

30|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} was to analyze if Stella and Warner’s technique have high survival rates and their rehabilitation have similar satisfaction when compared to total <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> with conventional implants.|$|R
30|$|To {{study the}} {{application}} of prosthetic labelling in implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses,</b> acrylic models were prepared and implant analogues were generated at Erciyes University, Turkey. For labelling, the phantom jaw model (Frasaco Phantom, Tettnang, Germany) was used.|$|R
40|$|Practical {{teaching}} {{is an important}} part of the teaching of <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> This work aims to evaluate <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> practical teaching of the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th year in terms of organization, developed skills, learning and assessment activities at the Faculty of Dentistry of Casablanca. A descriptive survey was conducted through questionnaires distributed to students who have completed their academic year 2011 / 2012. The results revealed the presence of numerous shortcomings regarding this teaching in relation to scheduled sessions, coaching, equipment, communication and argumentation of continuous exam’s marks. In the light of this work, an action plan tailored to the reality of the Faculty of dentistry of Casablanca resources was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Immediately loaded implant {{prostheses}} {{have been}} used to successfully rehabilitate completely edentulous arches. Risk factors for successful treatment have not included involuntary mandibular movements. The treatment was completed on a patient with a history of neuroleptic medications who had remaining mandibular teeth extracted and then developed involuntary mandibular movements. The patient was dissatisfied with a mandibular removable prosthesis and wanted a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The immediate implant loading of a complete arch <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was delivered, and the patient lost 3 of the 6 implants.

40|$|Dental implants, or {{completely}} said as dental implant bodies, function as analogues of tooth roots, achieving a union directly with jawbone following their insertion into a prepared socket in the bone. Implant system have three basic components, namely the dental implant {{body that is}} lying in the jawbone, abutment that lies on the jawbone and the prosthesis. Dental implants may stabilize a removable prosthesis, complete or partial overdentures, and or support and stabilize a <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> In designing implant-supported removable prostheses, there are three forms of anchorage frequently used, namely bar/sleeve (clip) joints which links two or more implants, ball/cap anchorages applied individually to two or more isolated implants, and magnets/magnetic keepers. Implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is either screwed to or cemented on to the abutment...|$|E
40|$|Many {{clinical}} {{studies have reported}} high survival rates for tilted implants. However, tilted implants transmit increased stress to bone when compared to vertically placed implants. Theoretical (computer-based), laboratory, and {{clinical studies}} are warranted to effectively address this issue. In this study, a 3 -dimensional finite element analysis was performed to analyze the stress values surrounding tilted versus vertical implants. The results revealed laboratory and biomechanical evidence that distal tilting of implants, splinted in full <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> without cantilevers, reduced the amount of stress generated around the peri-implant bone {{when compared to the}} levels of stress seen in peri-implant bone with vertical implants and cantilevered segments in similar full <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{aspects of}} a simple {{treatment}} concept with <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> in the edentulous jaw are described. Fixed implant-supported reconstructions in the edentulous jaw require multiple implants, are technically complex, aesthetically demanding and metal-ceramic solutions are expensive. Specific surgical techniques to enhance the hard and soft tissue conditions become often necessary. Thus the bar-supported overdenture may be preferred, because problems with aesthetics and alveolar ridge deficiencies can be solved more easily {{and the number of}} implants is reduced. Both, the "All-on-Four" technique and the "Procera implant bridge" are simple type of <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses,</b> comparable to overdentures or complete dentures with regard to design and technology. They present a cost-effective alternative, with predictable aesthetics and optimum passive fit...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} the methods used by dental professionals for gingival displacement before making impressions for <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Materials and Methods: A printed questionnaire was distributed to over 600 dentists at a National Dental Conference held in Hyderabad. The questionnaire was designed to know the preferred method of gingival displacement, medicament used, frequency of performing gingival displacement, etc. The results were analyzed and represented in the form of percentage. This method of survey distribution was selected to reach dental professionals in a wide range. Results: Of 600 dentists who received the questionnaire, 63. 3 % returned properly filled forms. Sixty-eight percentage of respondents advocate gingival displacement for all <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> cases, 23 % of respondents use for long span <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> cases, and 9 % of respondents use gingival displacement only for selected cases. Among the respondents, 69 % preferred to use chemicomechanical method, 16 % surgical method, 9 % of respondents preferred to use the mechanical method. Conclusion: The choice of technique and material for gingival displacement depends on the operator's judgment of the clinical situation apart from the availability of the materials...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{treatment}} with implants has demonstrated to {{be a good}} alternative to oral rehabilitation. However, it is important to follow some criteria in order to achieve success. Objective: This report showed an alternative approach to a clinical condition of non-favorable positioning of anterosuperior dental implants, added to an also non- favorable initial prosthetic planning. Case report: Female patient, 60 years old, with <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> over labial inclined implants, in the central and lateral superior incisors region, and with peri-implant disease. A new approach with <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and single abutments, what allows cleaning, and also removable gingival mask was applied. Monitoring of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were done. Conclusion: The use of a prosthetic alternative such as gingival mask demonstrated to be efficient regarding esthetic and masticatory functions, contributing to oral hygiene, an important factor to peri-implanttissues health...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{rehabilitation}} for {{a patient}} with severe loss of alveolar bone and soft tissue resulting from severe periodontitis presents a challenge to clinicians. Replacing loosening natural teeth with <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> supported by dental implants often requires either gingival surgery or bone grafting. The outcome of the bone grafting is sometimes unpredictable and requires longer healing time and/ or multiple surgeries. The presence of periodontal inflammation and periapical lesions often delay the placement of bone grafts as well as dental implants. Here we present a clinical case of a patient undergone full mouth reconstruction with implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses.</b> We demonstrated that early placement of implants (three weeks after extractions) with minimal bone grafting may be an alternative to conventional bone grafting followed by implant placement. We believe that primary stability during implant placement may contribute to our success. In addition, composite resin gingival material may be indicated in cases of large <b>fixed</b> implant <b>prostheses</b> {{as an alternative to}} pink porcelain...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{maintenance}} requirements of implant supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> opposed by implant supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> natural teeth or complete dentures. METHOD: The maintenance requirements {{were obtained by}} examining the dental records of 15 people, of whom 6 were edentulous in both arches and 9 edentulous in one arch. The results were compared to those obtained from 22 edentulous people in whom implants {{had been used in}} the mandible (control group). All the patients were treated with Nobel Biocare implants using standard implant and prosthetic protocols. RESULTS: The main maintenance requirement was the need to repair part of the superstructure. The artificial teeth and the acrylic resin had to be repaired on 44 occasions in the group with implants in both jaws and 14 occasions in the group with implants opposed by natural teeth. This compared with 2 occasions in the control group. Similarly the group with implants in both jaws were more likely to fracture the gold alloy framework, an event which occurred on 6 occasions. The Kruskal- Wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks was used to identify significant differences and Dunn’s method of All Pairwise Multiple Comparison Procedures was used to distinguish which group differed from the other. The group with implants in both jaws was significantly different to the other two groups in relation to the higher incidence of fracture of the teeth and acrylic resin superstructure (p< 0. 0001) and fracture of the gold alloy framework (p = 0. 0002). CONCLUSION: The maintenance requirements of implant supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> opposed by implant supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> are much greater than when opposed by natural teeth or complete dentures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Minor {{problems}} {{arising from}} optimizations by welding of <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> frameworks {{can be identified}} by macroscopic and microscopic visual inspection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to highlight the visible discontinuities present in the laser welds of dental Ni-Cr alloys. Ni-Cr base metal alloys designated for <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> manufacture were selected for the experiments. Using cast plates, preliminary tests were conducted by laser welding. Macroscopic visual inspection was done carefully to assess the defects of the welding rib. Electron microscopy images allowed visualization of small discontinuities, which escapes visual inspection. Making comparison to Ni-Cr alloys taken in the experiment and laser welded, after visual analysis, the best welds appear for Heraenium NA alloy.

40|$|A {{sustained}} submaximal (50 %) clenching {{effort was}} performed in four patient groups to establish whether implant-supported prosthetic reconstructions influence myoelectrical signal parameters. The first group consisted of patients with natural teeth in both jaws. The other three groups consisted of patients who were edentulous in both jaws: one group had complete dentures; one had an overdenture in the mandible on two implants connected by a bar; and the third had an implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis</b> in either the maxilla or the mandible. Surface electromyography indicated an increased myoelectrical output level that paralleled a higher bite force level for implant-supported reconstructions compared with complete dentures. Power spectrum analysis revealed a downward shift of the mean power frequency during sustained clenching in all groups except the implant-supported <b>fixed</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The absence of a spectral shift in the latter group probably reflected a fear of biting too hard and fracturing the prosthesis. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{preliminary}} international survey compared {{provision of}} implant-retained overdentures to <b>fixed</b> implant-supported <b>prostheses</b> for edentulous mandibles. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires {{based on a}} 2001 Swedish study were sent to prosthodontists and specialist clinics in nine additional countries. Results: Response rate varied from 53 % to 100 % in 10 national surveys and should allow careful comparison of results. The relationship between implant overdentures and <b>fixed</b> implant-supported <b>prostheses</b> in treatment of edentulous mandibles varied much; in Sweden, the proportion of overdentures was 12 %, whereas it was 93 % in the Netherlands. In all countries, the most common reason for choice of the overdenture was reduced cost. In all but two countries, {{the majority of respondents}} thought that patients with implant overdentures were equally or more satisfied with overdentures as those with <b>fixed</b> implant-supported <b>prostheses.</b> Conclusion: There were great differences among the 10 countries in choice of implant treatment of the edentulous mandible. The relative proportion of mandibular overdentures to <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> was low in Sweden and Greece and varied from one to two thirds in the other countries, except the Netherlands...|$|R
