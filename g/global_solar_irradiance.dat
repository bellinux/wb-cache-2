The estimation of radiation were made by linear regression, using the <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> (Rg) and net short-waves radiation (Rc) as independent variables.

40|$|The {{reliable}} quantification of ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the earth's surface requires {{accurate measurements}} of spectral <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> UV <b>irradiance</b> {{in order to}} determine the UV exposure to human skin and to understand long-term trends in this parameter. Array spectroradiometers (ASRMs) are small, light, robust and cost-effective instruments, and are increasingly used for spectral irradiance measurements. Within the European EMRP ENV 03 project “Solar UV”, new devices, guidelines and characterization methods have been developed to improve solar UV measurements with ASRMs, and support to the end user community has been provided. In order to assess the quality of 14 end user ASRMs, a solar UV intercomparison was held on the measurement platform of the World Radiation Center (PMOD/WRC) in Davos, Switzerland, from 10 to 17  July  2014. The results of the blind intercomparison revealed that ASRMs, currently used for solar UV measurements, show a large variation in the quality of their solar UV measurements. Most of the instruments overestimate the erythema-weighted UV index – in particular at large solar zenith angles – due to stray light contribution in the UV-B range. The spectral analysis of <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> UV <b>irradiance</b> further supported the finding that the uncertainties in the UV-B range are very large due to stray light contribution in this wavelength range. In summary, the UV index may be detected by some commercially available ASRMs within 5  % compared to the world reference spectroradiometer, if well characterized and calibrated, but only for a limited range of solar zenith angles. Generally, the tested instruments are not yet suitable for solar UV measurements for the entire range between 290 and 400  nm under all atmospheric conditions...|$|R

Different predictions models were performed such as machine learning techniques (Neural Networks, Gaussian processes and support vector machines) in order to forecast the <b>Global</b> Horizontal <b>solar</b> <b>Irradiance</b> (GHI). We also include in this study a simple linear autoregressive (AR) model {{as well as two}} naïve models based on persistence of the GHI and persistence of the clear sky index (denoted herein scaled persistence model). The models are calibrated and tested with data from three French islands: Corsica (42. 15 °N; 9. 08 °E), Guadeloupe (16. 25 °N; 61. 58 °W) and Reunion (21. 15 °S; 55. 5 °E).

The inclusion of the maximum daily temperature and daily mean relative humidity makes the model much more sensitive to climatic and weather changes.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{assessments of}} the solar radiation flux and the variations of its spectral distribution in the visible and near-infrared ranges {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} are of great interest in studying solar-terrestrial influences.

40|$|We use {{statistical}} methods for nonstationary time series {{to test the}} anthropogenic interpretation of global warming (AGW), according to which an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations raised global temperature in the 20 th century.

40|$|Global solar irradiances {{at ground}} level are {{modelled}} over Belgium using latest version of WRF-ARW regional climate model (RCM). The model set-up used has a resolution of 5 kilometres. The boundary layer scheme chosen is the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN) 2. 5 scheme with the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) closure proposed by Canuto et al., (2008) and Kitamura (2010). In this scheme, the modification of some parameters allows to change the determinant mixing length (surface layer, planet boundary layer, top of boundary layer/entrainment) which then modifies heat and moistures fluxes produced by turbulent mixing. Such modifications have significant influences on modelled cloudiness and therefore on modelled <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> incoming at the surface. 	The present study proposes a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters that influence the mixing length ('alp 1 ' to 'alp 5 ') and the TKE diffusion ('Sqfac') {{in order to find}} the most suitable constant values of these parameters for the modelling of cloudiness over Belgium. Results of different simulations are compared with <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> measurements performed by the Centre Spatial de Liège at Sart-Tilman in 2013 and 2014. Firsts results show that the dry bias frequently found when using WRF-ARW with standard set-ups can be greatly reduced thanks to an increased modelled cloudiness. The quantitative and qualitative effects of these modifications over cloudiness are also analysed by displaying 2 D representation of modelled clouds over Sart-Tilman and confronting them with on-site observations...|$|E

In the second part the prediction of <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> on inclined surfaces is performed, based on neural network techniques. The models tested are classified as isotropic (Liu and Jordan, Koronakis, Jimenez and Castro, Badescu, Tian) and anisotropic (Bugler, Temps and Coulson, Klucher, Ma and Iqbal, Reindl) based on the treatment of diffuse irradiance. For the aforementioned models, a qualitative comparison, based on diagrams, was carried out, and several statistical indices were calculated (coefficient of determination R 2, mean bias error MBE, relative mean bias error MBE/A(%), root mean square error RMSE, relative root mean square error RMSE/A(%),statistical index t-stat), in order to select the optimal. The isotropic models of ""Tian"" and ""Badescu"" show the best accordance to the recorded values. The anisotropic model of ""Ma&Iqbal"" and the pseudo-isotropic model of ""Jimenez&Castro"", show poor performance compared to other models.
