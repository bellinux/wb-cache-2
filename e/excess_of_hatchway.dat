40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to compare Lilluns egg {{production}} with other Swedish egg producers based on the flow of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) in the egg production systems. The main focus in the report was the utilization rate of the forage and the <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> nutrients per kg egg. Additionally, {{the purpose was to}} identify the environmental impact from Lilluns egg production and compare the results with other egg producers. The inflow of nutrients associated with forage and poultry was compared with the nutrients that were exported from the production. All of the egg producers in this study had an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> nutrients. The utilization rate of the forage for Lilluns egg was 47 %, the other egg producers in this study had an utilization rate between 45 - 50 %. The results showed that Lilluns egg had an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen of 0, 04 kg/kg eggs. Lilluns egg also had an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> phosphorus and potassium. The <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> phosphorus was 0, 01 kg/kg eggs and 0, 013 kg/kg eggs for potassium. The results showed that all the egg producers in this study had an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> all the nutrients.

40|$|Live human births {{are usually}} {{more than half}} male, in spite <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> losses <b>of</b> males {{throughout}} fetal development. These observations together demand an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> males {{near the beginning of}} pregnancy greater than that seen at birth. Reductions <b>of</b> the usual <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> males among human live births have widely been considered to represent consequences of untoward circumstances surrounding conception. Repeated competent research efforts have found no evidence for any bias in gametogenesis or fertilization in favour of Y-bearing sperm. Male embryogenesis is fas-ter and more efficient, leaving females in excess among failures before the fetal period. Sex differences in speed and efficiency of embryogenesis, dependent for example on epigenetic differences such as genomic imprinting, pro-duce an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> males at the transition from embryogenesis to clinical pregnancy, that will survive the male <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> losses throughout the fetal period, to yield an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> males among live births.
