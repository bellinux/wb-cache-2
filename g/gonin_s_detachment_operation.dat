A graph obtained from a given graph G by applying <b>detachment</b> <b>operations</b> at several vertices is called a detachment of graph G. While <b>detachment</b> <b>operations</b> may decrease the connectivity of graphs, there are several works on conditions for preserving the connectivity. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a given graph/digraph to have an Eulerian detachment that satisfies a given local edge-connectivity requirement. We also discuss conditions for the detachment to be loopless...|$|R

The declining risk of retinal detachment following cataract surgery is attributed to improvements in microsurgical techniques. In 1983 and 1984 the incidence of aphakic and pseudophakic retinal detachments dropped significantly (p less than 0. 05). At about this time extracapsular cataract surgery became widespread in the State, and this may explain the observed fall in retinal <b>detachment</b> <b>operations.</b> Since 1984 the incidence has risen owing to the rapidly increasing prevalence of pseudophakia in the resident population...|$|R

From June-July 1993 the squadron supplied <b>detachments</b> for <b>Operation</b> Sharp Guard in support of UN operations. This concept of separate detachment deployments, rather than entire unit deployments, became known as flexible <b>detachment</b> <b>operations,</b> or Det Ops. This form of deployment provided {{the maximum amount of}} interoperability between USN and USNR forward deployed forces, while supporting real operations and not just training flights for the Reserves.
