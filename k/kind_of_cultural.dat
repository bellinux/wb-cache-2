25|$|The Cumbre Tajín {{has been}} criticized for its {{emphasis}} on modern shows rather than on cultural events. One criticism is the illumination of pyramids at night without any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> historical instruction. The criticism is that it disrespects the site and the Totonac people. There are also fears that large numbers of visitors to the site for events such as concerts by names such as Alejandra Guzmán damage the site. However, the Centro de Artes Indígenas de Veracruz states that it works very hard to preserve and promote Totonac culture through the event, sponsoring events such as traditional cooking, painting and the ritual of the Voladores.|$|E

25|$|Large territories in the Pannonian Basin were conquered after 568 by the nomadic Avars who {{had arrived}} from the Eurasian Steppes.

25|$|According to the musicologists, the Lacanist {{psychoanalysis}} of the subculture {{indicate that}} the fascination to the singer's voice (the lack of understanding amplifies the effect), as well ineffable and unfulfillable desire, are what attracts most of the (predominantly female) fans to the groups on international scale. The female fans (bangyaru) show a behavioral pattern while attending the concerts, as there several furi (movements) like tesensu (arm fan), gyakudai (reversed dive), hedoban (headbang), saku (spread hands in the air). The explicit fan fiction, and homoerotic acts on the stage by some musicians called fan sabisu (fan service; a sexual term borrowed from manga culture), {{are related to the}} Lacanian man's type of desire (to be recognized by the other, desire of the other), i.e. the female fans do not desire the musician himself, but his desire, <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> social training ground for the inescapable process of learning how to desire.|$|E

500|$|Heather Phares from AllMusic gave it {{five out}} of five stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Video Collection: 1993-1999 adds to her status {{as one of the}} best {{represented}} artists on DVD. [...] Though it doesn't offer much in the way of DVD-specific features, the artistry of directors like Mark Romanek, Stephane Sedaoui, David Fincher, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, as well as Madonna herself, is on full display with videos like 'Take a Bow', 'Bedtime Story', 'Human Nature', 'Frozen', and 'Ray of Light'. All in all, it's a worthwhile collection of memorable videos from one of pop's trendsetters." [...] Bryan Chin from University Wire commented [...] "Some people really dislike the Madonna of the '90s. 'Oh, she got so slutty!, they quibble. 'She doesn't have the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> impact that she had in the '80s,' they whine. Obviously, these people haven't been paying much attention. With the recent release of The Video Collection 93:99, however, those naysayers are certain to realize what they've been missing. These videos have always been the perfect outlet to chronicle Madonna's smorgasbord of personas." ...|$|E

500|$|Watts {{argues that}} many of Disney's post World War II films [...] "legislated a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{cultural}}</b> Marshall Plan.

[...] Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney's studio as an [...] "agent of manipulation and repression", although he observes that it has [...] "labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy". John Tomlinson, in his study Cultural Imperialism, examines the work of Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart, whose 1971 book [...] (trans: How to Read Donald Duck) identifies that there are [...] "imperialist... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome façade of the world of Walt Disney"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as [...] "it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children."

2500|$|In The Lost Literature of Socialism, {{literary}} historian George G. Watson saw socialism as conservative, {{a reaction}} against liberalism and an attempt to return to antiquity and hierarchy. [...] He states that the writings of Friedrich Engels and others show that [...] "the Marxist theory of history required and demanded genocide for reasons implicit in its claim that feudalism, which in advanced nations was already giving place to capitalism, must in its turn be superseded by socialism. Entire nations would be left behind after a workers' revolution, feudal remnants in a socialist age, and since they could not advance two steps at a time, {{they would have to}} be killed. They were racial trash, as Engels called them, and fit only for the dung-heap of history." [...] Watson's claims have been criticised by Robert Grant for [...] "dubious evidence", arguing that [...] "what Marx and Engels are calling for is... at the very least a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> genocide; but it is not obvious, at least from Watson's citations, that actual mass killing, rather than (to use their phraseology) mere 'absorption' or 'assimilation', is in question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Various music {{writers and}} historians have traced {{the use of}} salsa to {{different}} periods of the 20th century. Max Salazar traces the word {{back to the early}} 1930s, when Ignacio Piñeiro composed [...] "Échale salsita", a Cuban son protesting tasteless food. While Salazar describes this song as the origin of salsa meaning [...] "danceable Latin music", Ed Morales describes the usage in the same song as a cry from Piñeiro to his band, telling them to increase the tempo to [...] "put the dancers into high gear". Morales claims that later in the 1930s, vocalist Beny Moré would shout salsa during a performance [...] "to acknowledge a musical moment's heat, to express a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> nationalist sloganeering [...] 'hotness' or 'spiciness' of Latin American cultures". World music author Sue Steward claims salsa was originally used in music as a [...] "cry of appreciation for a particularly piquant or flashy solo". She cites the first use in this manner to a Venezuelan radio DJ named Phidias Danilo Escalona; In 1955 Cheo Marquetti created a new band called Conjunto Los Salseros and recorded some new songs ( [...] Sonero and Que no muera el son [...] ).In 1955 José Curbelo recorded some others salsa songs (La familia, La la la and Sun sun sun ba bae).|$|E

Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities." [...] Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to Pulp Fiction itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that [...] "the way that [...] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming." [...] Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The fact that Pulp Fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultural</b> references are regarded as more fruitful— namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand." [...] Observing in the National Review that [...] "o film arrives with more advance hype", John Simon was unswayed: [...] "titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness".|$|E
