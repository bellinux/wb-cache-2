5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Acting on MacArthur's instructions, General Walton Walker of the Eighth Army {{started the}} Home-by-Christmas Offensive at 10 a.m. on November 24, 1950. With a reconstituted ROK II Corps {{placed on the}} Eighth Army's right flank, the advance was led by the US I Corps to the west, US IX Corps in the center, and the ROK II Corps to the east. The three UN Corps {{advanced}} cautiously <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> front line {{in order to prevent}} more ambushes similar to the Chinese First Phase Campaign, but the lack of manpower stretched the UN forces to the limit. Except for the strong Chinese resistances against the ROK II Corps, the Eighth Army met little opposition, and the line between Chongju to Yongwon was occupied {{on the night of the}} November 25.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
5|$|In Victoria {{groups of}} {{locomotives}} {{of the same}} design are classed together by letter, in a system introduced in 1886. Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> number block which is unique to the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe rolls, {{sometimes}} called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls of the Pipe, are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they {{are some of the}} earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> series like the English.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly {{rather than}} placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> line. The open areas between the buildings accommodate {{different types of}} public areas, while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond the avenue, such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate. The buildings lining the avenue range in height from three to six stories, with the higher stories set back from the street line. There is also a two-story, domed atrium housing shops and restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E

5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange. During continuous gas exchange, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>continuous</b> cycle. In discontinuous gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need {{to rise to the}} water surface to replenish air supplies, which may be held or trapped in special structures.|$|E
