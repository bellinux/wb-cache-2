50|$|As {{is common}} in {{response}} to many other sensory stimuli, much experimental evidence exists for the desensitization of human response of TRPM8 receptors to menthol. Testing involving administration of menthol and nicotine-containing cigarettes non-smokers, which induced what they classified as an <b>irritant</b> <b>response,</b> after initial sensitization, showed a declining response in subjects over time, lending itself to the incidence of desensitization. Ethanol, with similar irritant and desensitization properties, {{was used as a}} control for nicotine, to distinguish it from menthol-induced response. The menthol receptor was seen to sensitize or desensitize based on cellular conditions, and menthol produces increased activity in Ca2+-voltage gated channels that is not seen in ethanol, cyclohexanol and other irritant controls, suggestive of a specific molecular receptor. Dessirier et al., 2001, also claim the cross-desensitization of menthol receptors can occur by unknown molecular mechanisms, though they hypothesize the importance of Ca2+ in reducing cell excitability in a way similar to that in the capsaicin receptor.|$|E

A battery of anti-class II monoclonal antibodies, some of which are specific for class II subregion products (DP, DQ, DR), was used in an immunohistochemical study of the sequential changes in the allergic challenge reactions to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and nickel, the <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> to anthralin, and the induction of sensitization to DNCB. The induction of keratinocyte class II expression paralleled the influx of Leu- 3 a+ T cells into the skin and had occurred by 24 or 48 h in each type of reaction. Differential expression of class II subregion products on keratinocytes was noted: DR was the most frequently expressed molecule, followed by DP and DQ, although in the <b>irritant</b> <b>response,</b> DP expression was not observed.

40|$|The lymph {{transports}} tissue-resident dendritic cells (DCs) {{to regional}} lymph nodes (LNs), having {{important roles in}} immune function. The biological effects on tissue inflammation following lymphatic flow obstruction in vivo, however, are not fully known. In this study, we investigated {{the role of the}} lymphatic system in contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses using k-cyclin transgenic (kCYC+/-) mice, which demonstrate severe lymphatic dysfunction. kCYC+/- mice showed enhanced ear swelling to both DNFB and FITC, as well as stronger <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> to croton oil compared with wild-type littermates. Consistently, challenged ears of kCYC+/- mice exhibited massive infiltrates of inflammatory cells. In contrast, DC migration to regional LNs, drainage of cell-free antigen to LNs, antigen-specific IFN-γ production, and lymphocyte proliferation were impaired during the sensitization phase of CHS in kCYC+/- mice. Transfer experiments using lymphocytes from sensitized mice and real-time PCR analysis of cytokine expression using challenged ear revealed that ear swelling was enhanced because of impaired lymphatic flow. Collectively, we conclude that insufficient lymphatic drainage augments apparent inflammation to topically applied allergens and irritants. The findings add insight into the clinical problem of allergic and irritant contact dermatitis that commonly occurs in humans with peripheral edema of the lower legs...|$|R
40|$|Aedes aegypti, {{the primary}} vector {{mosquito}} of dengue virus, typically lives near or inside human dwellings, and feeds preferentially on humans. The {{control of this}} mosquito vector remains the most important dengue prevention method. The use of chemicals at levels toxic to mosquitoes is currently the only confirmed effective adult vector control strategy with interventions usually applied following epidemic onset. However, research indicates that sub-lethal chemical approaches to prevent human-vector contact at the house level exist: contact irritancy and spatial repellency. The optimum efficacy of an intervention based on contact irritant actions of chemicals will, however, require full knowledge of variables that will influence vector resting behavior and thereby chemical uptake from treated sources. Here we characterize the resting patterns of female Ae. aegypti on two material types at various dark:light surface area coverage ratios and contrast configurations under chemical-free and treated conditions using a laboratory behavioral assay. Change in resting behavior between baseline and treatment conditions was quantified to determine potential negative effects of untreated surfaces (“safe sites”) when <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> are elicited. We show that treatment of preferred resting sites with known irritant compounds do not stimulate mosquitoes to move to safe sites after making contact with treated surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Sensory nerves are {{equipped}} with receptors and ion channels {{that allow them to}} detect and respond to diverse chemical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli. These sensory proteins include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. A subclass of peptidergic sensory nerves express GPCRs and TRP channels that detect noxious, irritant, and inflammatory stimuli. Activation of these nerves triggers protective mechanisms that lead to withdrawal from danger (pain), removal of irritants (itch, cough), and resolution of infection (neurogenic inflammation). The GPCR-TRP axis is central to these mechanisms. Signals that emanate from the GPCR superfamily converge on the small TRP family, leading to channel sensitization and activation, which amplify pain, itch, cough, and neurogenic inflammation. Herein we discuss how GPCRs and TRP channels function independently and synergistically to excite sensory nerves that mediate noxious and <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> and inflammation in the skin and the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. We discuss the signaling mechanisms that underlie the GPCR-TRP axis and evaluate how new information about the structure of GPCRs and TRP channels provides insights into their functional interactions. We propose that {{a deeper understanding of the}} GPCR-TRP axis may facilitate the development of more selective and effective therapies to treat dysregulated processes that underlie chronic pain, itch, cough, and inflammation...|$|R
40|$|After {{repeated}} contact, many surfactants {{will cause}} skin irritation and, especially, dryness and scaliness. Earlier in vitro investigations {{suggested that the}} irritation potential of anionic surfactants {{was related to the}} induction of hydration of isolated stratum corneum membranes. We have now investigated early surfactant – stratum corneum interaction in vivo. Sodium salts of n-alkyl sulfates with variable carbon chain length (n = 8 – 14) were tested for the promotion of stratum corneum hydration by measurements of skin surface water loss and electrical capacitance measurements in healthy adult human volunteers. The surfactant-induced increase in water uptake was confirmed in vitro by means of isolated stratum corneum samples and surfactant solutions labeled with tri-tiated water. In a parallel experiment the irritation potential of these compounds was investigated by 24 -h patch testing in human volunteers. The <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> were quantified non-invasively by erythema (skin color reflectance measurements) and transepidermal water loss measurements. Hydration of stratum corneum exposed for 5 mm to factant solutions significantly exceeded that of controls (phosphate-buffered saline). It increased with application time and was concentration dependent, saturable with increasing concentration, and rapidly reversible. Baseline hydration was reestablished only 10 – 15 mm after treatment termination. Induction of hydration was closely correlated with the irritation potential of the investigated compounds. It initially increased with increasing carbon chain length. The maximum response was obtained for the C 12 analogue (sodium lauryl sulfate). With further increases in molecular size induction of stratum corneum hydration subsequently decreased. We have demonstrated that anionic surfactants increase stratum corneum hydration in vivo. The present results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the hydration are related to the irritation properties of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the role of endogenously produced interleukin (IL) 4 and IL- 10 in the regulation of inflammatory and immune reactions in the skin. In these experiments, irritant and contact hypersensitivity (CH) responses were elicited in mice with targeted disruptions of the IL- 4 (IL- 4 T) or IL- 10 (IL- 10 T) gene. Our study showed that IL- 4 T and wild- type (wt) mice exhibited equivalent <b>responses</b> to the <b>irritant</b> croton oil. In contrast, the response of IL- 10 T mice challenged with croton oil was abnormally increased. When IL- 10 T mice were exposed to a higher dose of irritant, irreversible tissue damage occurred. By comparison, any treatment of wt mice with croton oil resulted in far less tissue damage and resolution of inflammation. Neutralizing antibody studies demonstrated that the necrosis that occurred in IL- 10 T mice {{was due to the}} overproduction of tumor necrosis factor. The anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody treatment of IL- 10 T mice did not significantly reduce the edema or the influx of inflammatory cells, suggesting that these changes were due to the uncontrolled production of other proinflammatory cytokines. T cell-dependent immune responses were also evaluated using the contact sensitizer oxazolone. The response of IL- 4 T mice did not differ from wt mice. In contrast, IL- 10 T mice mounted an exaggerated CH response, increased in both magnitude and duration as compared with wt mice. Based on these studies, we have concluded that IL- 10, but not IL- 4, is a natural suppressant of <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> and of CH, and it limits immunopathologic damage in the skin...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{exposure}} of experimental animals and human subjects to sulfuric acid presents a consistent picture of its toxicology.

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey of over 400 workers handling reactive dyes showed that over 15 % had work related respiratory or nasal symptoms. Forty nine employees with symptoms {{were referred to}} chest clinics for detailed assessment.

Two patterns of allergic lower respiratory symptoms were identified; an immediate response of short duration and a longer lasting response, usually of several hours, sometimes accompanied by nocturnal asthma. A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) screen containing the most commonly used reactive dyes was used to detect specific IgE. Allergic symptoms to reactive dyes were strongly associated with specific IgE (17 / 21 employees) and atopy (18 / 21).

40|$|Interleukin (IL) - 10 is a {{regulator}} of inflammatory {{responses and}} is secreted {{by a variety}} of different cell types including T cells. T regulatory cells have been shown to suppress immune responses by IL- 10 –dependent, but also IL- 10 –independent, mechanisms. Herein, we address the role of T cell–derived IL- 10 in mice with an inactivation of the IL- 10 gene restricted to T cells generated by Cre/loxP-mediated targeting of the IL- 10 gene. Splenocytes from this T cell–specific mutant secrete increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines after activation in vitro compared with show enhanced contact hypersensitivity reactions, and succumb to severe immunopathology upon infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Despite intact IL- 10 genes in other cell types, the dysregulation of T cell responses observed in the T cell–specific IL- 10 mutant closely resembles the phenotype in complete IL- 10 deficiency. However, in contrast to complete IL- 10 deficiency, sensitivity to endotoxic shock and irritant responses of the skin are not enhanced in the T cell–specific IL- 10 mutant. Our data highlight the importance of T cell–derived IL- 10 in the regulation of T cell responses and demonstrate that endotoxic shock and the <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> of the skin are controlled by IL- 10 from other cell types...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effects of {{intensity}} and duration of exercise stress on induction of in-vivo immunity in humans using experimental contact hypersensitivity (CHS) with the novel antigen Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). Methods: Sixty-four healthy males completed either 30 minutes running at 60 % V[spacing dot above]O 2 peak (30 MI); 30 minutes running at 80 % V[spacing dot above]O 2 peak (30 HI); 120 minutes running at 60 % V[spacing dot above]O 2 peak (120 MI) or seated rest (CON). Twenty-minutes later subjects received a sensitizing dose of DPCP and four-weeks later the strength of immune reactivity was quantified by measuring the cutaneous responses to a low, dose-series challenge with DPCP on the upper inner-arm. Circulating epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol were measured pre, post and 1 h post-exercise or CON. Next, to better understand whether the decrease in CHS response on 120 MI was due to local inflammatory or T-cell mediated processes, in a cross-over design, eleven healthy males performed 120 MI and CON and cutaneous responses to a dose-series of the irritant, croton oil (CO) were assessed on the upper inner-arm. Results: Immune induction by DPCP was impaired by 120 MI (skin-fold-thickness - 67 % vs CON; P< 0. 05). However, immune induction was unaffected by 30 MI and 30 HI despite elevated circulating catecholamines (30 HI vs pre: P< 0. 01) and greater circulating cortisol post 30 HI (vs CON: P< 0. 01). There was no effect of 120 MI on skin <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> to CO. Conclusions: Prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise, but not short-lasting high or short-lasting moderate-intensity exercise, decreases the induction of in-vivo immunity. No effect of prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise on the skin's <b>response</b> to <b>irritant</b> challenge points towards a suppression of cell-mediated immunity in the observed decrease in CHS.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of asthma is increasing, and the cause(s) of this increase are unknown. The etiology of asthma {{is complex and}} includes both genetic, developmental, and environmental components. Epidemiological evidence suggests that acetaminophen (APAP, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol) {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of asthma. The goal of this thesis was to test the plausibility of the “acetaminophen hypothesis” in asthma, which states that therapeutic use of acetaminophen is linked to the increase in asthma prevalence through pro-oxidant effects of the drug. The airways of the respiratory system represent the largest surface area of the body exposed to the atmosphere. Several physiological adaptations of the respiratory tract aid in maintaining homeostasis under variable atmospheric conditions. These include oxidant responses, sensory irritation-reflex responses, and inflammatory responses. Respiratory tract responses can be activated by environmental exposures and disease states. In some situations they can be compromised. For example, asthmatic airways mount exaggerated immune responses to normally innocuous atmospheric variables, and may have altered oxidant responses. The measurement of respiratory responses can provide direct data on airway status. Described herein are studies examining the effects of acetaminophen on acute airway oxidant responses, acute sensory irritation-reflex responses, and longer-term inflammatory responses in a murine model of allergic airway disease (asthma). The first study assessed murine acute respiratory oxidant responses after APAP treatment alone, or in combination with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Near-therapeutic doses of APAP induced airway oxidant responses similarly to ETS. Notably, APAP potentiated both ETS induced oxidant responses and ETS induced sensory irritant-reflex <b>irritant</b> <b>responses.</b> In a second study, the effects of acetaminophen on airway inflammatory responses to house dust mite extract (HDM) were examined. Unexpectedly, the effects of HDM exposure were substantially diminished by APAP. These studies suggest that APAP has acute pro-oxidant effects in the airways at near-therapeutic doses, and thus may have detrimental effects in individuals predisposed to oxidant injury, or exposed to oxidant air pollutants such as ETS. Despite documenting pro-oxidant effects of APAP in the airways, these studies call into question the overall biological plausibility of the “APAP hypothesis” in asthma...|$|R

Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; 5 %, 6 %, and 7 % w/w) and Carbopol 934 (1 % w/w) hydrogels containing DFS-CS microspheres equivalent to 1 % w/w active drug were prepared. The physicochemical characterization revealed that all hydrogels had a suitable pH for rectal application (6. 5 – 7. 4). The consistency of HPMC hydrogels showed direct proportionality to the concentration of the gelling agent, while carbopol 934 gel showed its difficulty for rectal administration. Farrow’s constant for all hydrogels were greater than one indicating pseudoplastic flow. In vitro drug release from the mucoadhesive hydrogel formulations showed a controlled drug release pattern, reaching 34. 6 – 39. 7 % after 6  h. The kinetic analysis of the release data revealed that zero-order was the prominent release mechanism. The mucoadhesion time of 7 % w/w HPMC hydrogel was 330  min, allowing the loaded microspheres to be attached to the surface of rectal mucosa.

This study was conducted to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and skin <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> in a group of healthcare workers. 585 volunteer healthcare workers were genotyped for MHC SNPs and patch tested with three different irritants: sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and benzalkonium chloride (BKC). Genotyping was performed using Illumina Goldengate MHC panels. A number of SNPs within the MHC Class I (OR 2 B 3, TRIM 31, TRIM 10, TRIM 40 and IER 3), Class II (HLA-DPA 1, HLA-DPB 1) and Class III (C 2) genes were associated (p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 001) with skin response to tested irritants in different genetic models. Linkage disequilibrium patterns and functional annotations identified two SNPs in the TRIM 40 (rs 1573298) and HLA-DPB 1 (rs 9277554) genes, with a potential impact on gene regulation. In addition, SNPs in PSMB 9 (rs 10046277 and ITPR 3 (rs 499384) were associated with hand dermatitis. The results are of interest as they demonstrate that genetic variations in inflammation-related genes within the MHC can influence chemical-induced skin irritation and may explain the connection between inflamed skin and propensity to subsequent allergic contact sensitization.

40|$|An {{analysis}} was conducted of the cytokine profile and inflammatory response in oxazolone sensitized mouse skin. Following exposure to oxazolone, the intralesional production of inflammatory cytokines was demonstrable at the levels of both mRNA and protein. An initial challenge led to a transient increase in tumor necrosis factor-α production followed predominately by the T helper (Th) 1 cytokine, interferon-γ. There was a minimal production of interleukin- 4, a Th 2 cytokine. Continued exposure to oxazolone led to a downregulation of interferon-γ and an upregulation of interleukin- 4 production. A strong relationship was found between interleukin- 4 and the inflammatory response, as measured by ear thickness. Similar experiments conducted in mast cell-deficient mice revealed reduced neutrophil influx but only minor changes in cytokine profile. An <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> induced by chronic exposure of mouse skin to phorbol ester did not reveal any significant interferon-γ or interleukin- 4 response but was characterized by a tumor necrosis factor-α response that correlated with the inflammatory response. These observations suggest that {{the major source of}} interferon-γ and interleukin- 4 in the oxazolone response may be the infiltrating lymphocytes; whereas the tumor necrosis factor-α may result from the local irritation seen with both oxazolone and phorbol ester. At the end of 4 wk of chronic exposure to oxazolone, it was found that serum IgE levels had significantly increased. Histologic analysis of the skin lesion revealed that a mixed infiltrate including eosinophils developed upon repeat exposure to oxazolone.

Twelve volunteers were patch tested with 0. 12, 0. 25, 0. 50, and 1. 00 % SLS, and the skin response was evaluated after 24 and 48 h, respectively. We found a statistically significant linear {{dose-response relationship}} between dose of SLS and skin response evaluated by measurement of TEWL, skin color, superficial blood flow, and edema. Statistical evaluation by regression analysis proved measurement of TEWL to be the method best suited overall for quantification in relation to patch testing with SLS, whereas colorimetry was found to be the least sensitive of the applied methods.

40|$|Primary irritancy {{in human}} and animal skin is {{characterized}} by an inflammatory reaction mediated, in part, by membrane-derived arachidonate metabolites. One of the mechanisms of this reaction was investigated in cultured mammalian cells using three surfactants: linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS), alkyl ethoxylate sulfate (AEOS), and TWEEN 20. These compounds listed in order in vivo irritancy are LAS greater than AEOS greater than TWEEN 20. Each of these compounds was studied in C 3 H- 10 T 1 / 2 cells and human keratinocytes which had been prelabeled with 3 H-labeled arachidonic acid (AA). After labeling, media were removed, cells were washed, and fresh media with or without surfactant were added. Cells were then incubated for 2 hr, media were removed and centrifuged, and an aliquot was assayed by liquid scintillation for release of label. In C 3 H- 10 T 1 / 2 cells LAS and AEOS in 5 - 50 microM concentration stimulated 2 to 10 times the release of [3 H]AA as compared to controls. In contrast, concentrations of 50 - 100 microM of TWEEN were required to release [3 H]AA. With keratinocytes the same rank order of surfactant concentrations necessary for release was obtained as found with C 3 H- 10 T 1 / 2 cells. High-performance liquid chromatography of media extracts of both cell systems revealed surfactant stimulation of the production of cyclooxygenase AA metabolites. These results confirm the induction of release by primary irritants of fatty acid groups from membrane phospholipids.

40|$|Metabolic changes {{produced}} in rat skin by tributyltin have been determined {{with the aim}} of identifying some of the early events which may be associated with the <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> of this compound. When the skin irritant tributyltin (TBT) was applied to rat dorsal skin as a single cutaneous dose of 67 nmoles of TBT/sp. cm, steady state levels of 0. 44 nmoles/mg dry weight were attained in the viable epidermis by 1 hr. Calculations indicate that depletion of the applied dose and consequent reduction of the concentration in the viable epidermis occurred after 5 – 6 hr. This dose of TBT significantly reduced the oxygen consumption of epidermal slices by 1 hr. There were minimal pathological changes at this times. Maximum inhibition of oxygen consumption occurred by 8 hr (epidermal and dermal slices inhibited by 49 % and 46 % respectively) by which time focal epidermal and dermal separation had occurred and numerous inflammatory cells were present. Oxygen consumption returned to normal within 48 hr. The inhibition was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in ATP concentration in the epidermis with values reduced by 63 % at 12 hr. ATP remained at this value for 20 hr, returning to normal by 48 hr. Lactate concentration in full thickness skin increased by 89 % within 2 hr of application of tributyltin and remained elevated for up to 48 hr. The earliest detectable reductions in oxygen consumption and ATP concentration coincided with the time when the tributyltin content of the epidermis was maximal and preceded any necrotic changes. The recovery phase coincided with reduction of tributyltin concentration. It is concluded that the early toxic action of tributyltin in rat skin involves inhibition of oxidative metabolism. The resulting perturbations may result in cellular injury or dearth and these changes may be involved in production of the altered skin...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} the behavioral responses of Aedes aegypti to irritant and repellent chemicals that can be exploited to reduce man-vector contact. Maximum efficacy of interventions based on irritant chemical actions will, however, require full knowledge of variables that influence vector resting behavior and how untreated "safe sites" contribute to overall impact. METHODS: Using a laboratory box assay, resting patterns of two population strains of female Ae. aegypti (THAI and PERU) were evaluated against two material types (cotton and polyester) at various dark:light surface area coverage (SAC) ratio and contrast configuration (horizontal and vertical) under chemical-free and treated conditions. Chemicals evaluated were alphacypermethrin and DDT at varying concentrations. RESULTS: Under chemical-free conditions, dark material had significantly higher resting counts compared to light material at all SAC, and significantly increased when material was in horizontal configuration. Cotton elicited stronger response than polyester. Within the treatment assays, significantly higher resting counts were observed on chemical-treated dark material compared to untreated light fabric. However, compared to matched controls, significantly less resting observations were made on chemical-treated dark material overall. Most importantly, resting observations on untreated light material (or "safe sites") in the treatment assay did not significantly increase {{for many of the}} tests, even at 25 % SAC. Knockdown rates were ≤ 5 % for all assays. Significantly more observations of flying mosquitoes were made in test assays under chemical-treatment conditions as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: When preferred Ae. aegypti resting sites are treated with chemicals, even at reduced treatment coverage area, mosquitoes do not simply move to safe sites (untreated areas) following contact with the treated material. Instead, they become agitated, using increased flight as a proxy indicator. It is this contact <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> that may elicit escape behavior from a treated space and is a focus of exploitation for reducing man-vector contact inside homes...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of well known irritants {{was investigated in}} rabbit and human skin organ cultures. Test chemicals were selected from various categories of irritants and included both water-soluble and water-insoluble compounds. Using a highly standardized protocol, test chemicals were applied topically at concentrations relevant to the in vivo situation. Toxicity was assessed by histomorphological examination, inhibition of conversion of the tetrazolium salt MTT, inhibition of epidermal cell proliferation and release of pro-inflammatory hydroxy fatty acids. Chemicals that are known to induce irritation in vivo invariably caused histopathological changes and inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas non-irritating chemicals did not; however, inhibition of MTT conversion and release of hydroxy fatty acids occurred with {{only a limited number}} of <b>irritants.</b> The <b>response</b> to the chemical irritants was different in rabbit and human skin cultures. Rabbit skin was slightly more sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate and benzalkonium chloride than human skin. Moreover, mineral oil enhanced epidermal cell proliferation in rabbit skin, but not in human skin. This study demonstrates that chemical irritants cause substance- and species-specific effects in skin organ cultures. It is therefore unlikely that irritant potential of chemicals from all irritant categories can be detected in vitro using one single parameter. A multiple endpoint approach and the inclusion of human tissue are recommended for optimal in vitro irritancy testing of chemicals...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} an {{objective}} and non-invasive method for assessing reactions in the human skin and oral mucosa, particularly for weak reactions. During the past few decades, several methods of measuring <b>irritant</b> <b>responses</b> have indeed been developed for the skin and to some extent also for the oral mucosa. The focus of this thesis is upon a new measurement system based on electrical impedance, which reflects structural and chemical changes in living tissues. The system is an improvement over earlier impedance techniques, and measures magnitude and phase of impedance in the frequency range 1 kHz to 1 MHz at 5 depth settings. From the raw data, four indices are calculated, representing most of the information in compressed form, and also reducing inter-individual and inter-site variation by normalisation. The method has been used to study skin irritation induced by various concentration of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). Results have been compared with visual scoring as well as with those of other bioengineering techniques - transepidermal water loss (TEWL), electrical capacitance moist measurements (ECM), and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The results show that electrical impedance is at least as sensitive as other bioengineering techniques, and more sensitive than visual scoring. The later was confirmed in a study using low concentration of SLS, which demonstrated that the electrical impedance method is a delicate technique for detecting responses induced by SLS, when these are weak enough to be macroscopically negative. Furthermore, a good correlation was found between the severity of the changes observed visually, the histopathological alterations, and changes in the four electrical impedance indices. We have also found the method to be highly sensitive for detection of changes in the lipid content in the stratum comeum. Other irritants producing different types of histological skin responses have been shown to create their own distinctive impedance index patterns. Furthermore, the reduced data sets {{in the form of the}} four impedance indices contain sufficient information for classifying different responses of the skin, although additional information may be extracted from the complete spectrum. The impedance technique, can also be used in the oral mucosa, and has been shown capable of detecting mucosal responses induced by SLS in the invisible or barely visible range. Since different anatomical regions display typical baseline values for the skin as well as the oral mucosa it is important to use contra lateral reference sites from the same anatomical location or even better to follow a site over a period of time before and after exposure to a test agent. If references are not available, e. g. in situations where the entire skin or mocosa is affected, established baseline values for different sites in the skin and the oral cavity may be substituted. Such values have now been provided for both the skin and the oral mucosa. The electrical impedance technique seems to be a powerful tool for quantification and classification of reactions in both the skin and the oral mucosa...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To characterise {{irritant}} and allergic airway {{responses and}} assess changes in {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1  second (FEV 1) relative to exposure to toluene di-isocyanate (TDI).  METHODS—Employees (n= 313) ever assigned to a TDI production unit for ⩾ 3 months (1967 - 92) were identified from personnel records along with 158  frequency matched referents without known exposure to TDI. Reports made during visits to the occupational clinic of incidents related to exposure to TDI and annual periodic examination results (questionnaire, physical findings, and spirometry) were abstracted and assessed relative to industrial hygiene estimates of exposure to TDI.  RESULTS—Mean 8  hour time weighted average estimates of TDI concentrations ranged from 9. 9  ppb in jobs with potentially high exposure {{during the early years}} of plant operations to 0. 5  ppb in jobs with potentially low exposure in more recent years. The corresponding rates of visits to the clinic due to incidents of exposure to TDI (including both irritant and allergic airway responses) declined from 20. 5  to 1. 0  visits per 100  years of employment at the unit. The annual incidence of asthma induced by TDI declined from 1. 8 % before 1980  to 0. 7 % afterwards. Neither cross sectional nor longitudinal analyses of FVC and FEV 1 showed significant dose-response findings relative to exposure to TDI across the total exposed population. Among cases of occupational asthma there was an apparent initial decline in FEV 1 within 2  years of first reporting symptoms, but not an accelerated rate of decline in follow up tests from 4 - 30 years after induction of asthma.  CONCLUSIONS—Occurrences of both asthma induced by TDI and <b>irritant</b> airway <b>responses</b> due to exposure to TDI were found in this cohort, but there was no relation between cumulative exposure to TDI and irreversible airflow obstruction as assessed by spirometry.    Keywords: toluene di-isocyanate; lung function decrement; occupational asthm...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} microorganisms in indoor environments {{may result}} in infectious disease or elicit an allergic or <b>irritant</b> <b>response.</b> Air handling system components contaminated by fungi have been implicated in the dispersal of spores into the indoor environment, thereby serving as a route of exposure to occupants. This {{study was conducted to}} provide quantitative data on the dispersal of spores from fungal colonies growing on three types of duct material. Galvanized metal, rigid fibrous glass ductboard, and fiberglass duct liner were soiled and contaminated with a known concentration of Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The duct materials were incubated in humidity chambers to provide a matrix of growing, sporulating fungal colonies at a contamination level of 109 colony forming units (CFU) per duct section, consistent for all materials. For each experiment a contaminated duct section was inserted into the air handling system of an experimental room, and the air handling system was operated for three 5 -minute cycles with an air flow of 4. 2 m 3 min− 1. The duct air velocity was approximately 2. 8 m sec− 1. The airborne concentration of culturable P. chrysogenum spores (CFU m− 3), total P. chrysogenum spores (spores m− 3), and total P. chrysogenum-sized particles (particles m− 3) were measured in the room using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers, Burkard slide impactor samplers, and an aerodynamic particle sizer, respectively. The highest airborne concentrations (104 CFU m− 3; 105 spores m− 3; 104 particles m− 3) were measured during the first operating cycle of the air handling system for all duct materials with decreasing airborne concentrations measured during the second and third cycles. There {{was no significant difference in}} spore dispersal from the three contaminated duct materials. These data demonstrate the potential exposure for building occupants to high concentrations of spores dispersed from fungal colonies on air handling system duct materials during normal operation of the system...|$|E
40|$|Acute skin {{irritation}} is the reversible inflammatory {{response of the}} epidermis to a topically applied irritant substance. A tissue engineered model of the epidermis is used to test chemicals. The degree of development of the model needs to be carefully judged {{in order to get}} the correct proportion of proliferating through to differentiated phenotypes for normal function. This judgement typically necessitates over sensitive models with an underdeveloped barrier functionality, as opposed to an insensitive model due to terminal differentiation and low numbers of basal keratinocytes. It has been reported that the lack of proliferative epidermal cells in cultures may be due to the absence of fibroblasts. Paracrine signalling in response to potential irritants is required for propagating an acute inflammatory response. The aim of this thesis is to develop a skin model using a Three Dimensional scaffold that accurately mimics the micro-environment at the DEJ, for supporting keratinocyte and fibroblast self-organisation. We hypothesise that it takes a full thickness skin model with a complete cascade of inflammatory stimuli and cytokine signalling to provide a real indication of irritation. Initial studies focused on Alvetex® (Reinnervate Ltd.), a highly porous polystyrene scaffold, with the aim of developing a skin model using the immortalised cell line HaCaT (human adult low calcium high temperature) keratinocytes or NhKs, in co-culture with dermal fibroblasts. Skin models using electrospun biodegradable polymer scaffolds made of Poly L-lactide (PLLA) and a Poly L-lactide/Polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate/Poly L-lactide (PLLA/PHBV/PLLA) composites were then developed. Issues with achieving epidermal-dermal separation in the Alvetex® scaffold due to keratinocyte entrapment lead to an Alvetex®-PHBV Bilayer. Concentration of the SDS needed to illicit an <b>irritant</b> <b>response</b> was deduced at 2 D to be 0. 1 - 0. 15 mM, 3 D submerged to be 0. 33 - 0. 5 mM and for 3 D air-liquid models were at best unaffected by 8 mM SDS with a Bilayer scaffold of PHBV-PLLA...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{differentiate}} an allergic patch test response from an <b>irritant</b> <b>response,</b> we evaluated by flow cytometry the percentages of various epidermal cell populations isolated from allergen and irritant-treated patch test sites. Nine allergic individuals were patch tested with various allergens (Rhus, dinitrochlorobenzene [DNCB], or nickel chloride) and a vehicle control for 48 h. Eight additional individuals were patch tested with irritating chemicals (sodium lauryl sulfate or nonanoic acid) and with a vehicle control for 48 h. Epidermal cells, isolated from suction blisters, were double labeled for CD 1 /HLA-DR, CD 3 /HLA-DR, or CD 36 /HLA-DR cell surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of various cell populations. A mean increase of 0. 91 ± 0. 3 {{in the percentage of}} DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells over the vehicle control patch test site was detected in allergen-positive patch test sites in allergic individuals, whereas a decrease of 0. 19 ± 0. 2 in the percentage of DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells from the vehicle control patch test site was detected in irritant-treated patch test sites. Epidermal cells from allergen-positive patch test sites also exhibited an increase of 5. 2 ± 1. 8 in percentage of DR+CD 1 - cells over the vehicle control patch test site compared to an increase change of 0. 8 ± 0. 4 in epidermal cells isolated from irritant-treated patch test sites. We also found that DR+ cells that lacked the CD 1 determinant expressed the macrophage/monocyte antigen CD 36 (OKM 5). Finally, a 2. 3 ± 0. 8 increase in the percentage of DR-CD 3 + cells over the vehicle control patch test site was observed in allergen-positive patch test sites compared to an increase of 0. 2 ± 0. 2 observed in irritant- treated patch test sites. These results demonstrate a significant increase in DR+CD 1 +, DR+CD 1 -CD 36 +, and DR-CD 3 + epidermal cells in allergen-positive patch test sites compared to irritant patch test sites...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} 1 {{was conducted}} to estimate the likelihood of underclassifying ocular corrosives or severe irritants when using the current sequential three animal in vivo rabbit eye test method based on existing protocol guidelines (e. g., OECD 2002) and the United Nations (UN) Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (UN 2003). The analysis {{was based on a}} database of 128 substances classified as GHS Category 1 irritants (i. e., corrosives and severe irritants) based on 142 studies using a total of 661 rabbits. To conduct this analysis, individual rabbit responses were first classified according to the GHS classification system (UN 2003). The estimated underclassification rate was then calculated three ways, each using a different assumption. Calculation 1 assumed homogeneity of response for GHS Category 1 irritants; Calculation 2 assumed heterogeneity of response for GHS Category 1 irritants; and Calculation 3 assumed homogeneity of response for three subgroups of GHS Category 1 irritants. The three subgroups were: (1) strong responders, where all treated rabbits expressed a severe response; (2) moderate responders, where the majority but not all treated rabbits expressed a severe response; and (3) weak responders, where the majority of treated rabbits expressed a nonsevere <b>irritant</b> or nonirritant <b>response.</b> Using the three calculation methods, the estimated underclassification rates for the total databas...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{responses of}} 4 populations of #Anopheles albimanus$ females to DDT, permethrin, and deltamethrin were characterized in excito-repellency tests. One test population (ST) from El Salvador has been maintained as a colony for 20 years. A second population (ES) from Guatemala was colonized in 1992. Third and fourth populations consisted of field-caught specimens from Toledo District (TO) of southern Belize in 1994 and Corozal District (CO) of northern Belize, respectively. Females of ES, TO and CO populations rapidly escaped from {{direct contact with}} treated surfaces {{for each of the}} 3 insecticides. Similarities in escape responses of insecticide-resistant (ES) versus insecticide-susceptible populations (TO, CO) suggest that there is no relationship between physiological and behavioral responses of #An. albimanus$ populations to DDT, permethrin, and deltamethrin. Females from all but the ST colony escaped in greater numbers from chambers without direct contact with treated surfaces than from control chambers (P< 0. 05). Few females from the ST colony escaped from test chambers, regardless of which insecticide was used or whether contact was allowed, indicating that the ST colony has lost its capability to respond to insecticides. Repellent responses were significant; but they were not pronounced in 30 -min exposures, and they were very pronounced in 4 -h exposures. We conclude that <b>irritant</b> and repellent <b>responses</b> of malaria vectors to insecticides are important components of malaria control operations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy (OWLS) {{is based}} on {{measurements}} of the effective refractive index of a thin layer above the waveguide. Its potential as a whole-cell biosensor was demonstrated recently monitoring adhesion and spreading of Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells on-line. In this work the OWLS is {{shown to be a}} promising tool to study the adhesion, morphology and metabolic state of fibroblasts in real time. A new design of the measuring chamber allowed simultaneous observation by phase-contrast microscopy and made the adsorbed cell density controlable and reproducible. The OWLS signal correlated quantitatively with the contact-area between the fibroblasts and the waveguide. The OWLS signals for adhesion and spreading of three different fibroblast cell lines were in good agreement with their morphology identified by phase-contrast microscopy. The cell adhesion and cell shape changes were examined in three scenarios: (a) serum-induced spreading of the surface attached fibroblasts was followed until it was completed, and the OWLS signal remained constant for over 12 h; (b) the fully spread cells were exposed to the microtubuli-disrupting colchicine and a decrease of the OWLS signal was monitored; (c) in a similar experiment with benzalkonium chloride, a strong skin <b>irritant,</b> a concentration-dependent <b>response</b> of the signal was found. The results show the strength of the OWLS method for monitoring the adhesion behavior of anchorage-dependent cells such as fibroblasts. It has a great potential as a whole-cell biosensor for high throughput screening in toxicology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
