Telephoto lenses for such small formats <b>essentially</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> exist, except for Steky and Gami. There have been attachments to allow cameras (generally Minox) to attach to telescopes or binoculars, but these give results of lower quality than the camera's optics can achieve.|$|R

Some types of causative constructions <b>essentially</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> permit double causatives, e.g. {{it would be}} difficult to find a lexical double causative. Periphrastic causatives however, have the potential to always be applied iteratively (Mom made Dad make my brother make his friends leave the house.).|$|R

The fission process stops when the proton beam stops, as when power is lost, thus the reactor is subcritical. Only microscopic quantities of plutonium are produced and can be burned in the same reactor.|$|R
2500|$|In Losing chess, {{stalemate}} is {{not necessarily}} a draw [...] Depending on the variant, stalemate can be a draw, or a win for either the player with fewer pieces (a draw results if the players have the same number of pieces) or for the stalemated player. In xiangqi and shogi, a stalemated player loses, although in shogi stalemate <b>essentially</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> occur.|$|R
