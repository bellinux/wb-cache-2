No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles),</b> or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E
5|$|As Emily's winds eased over land, various {{assessment}} teams left Fort Bragg, North Carolina, {{to determine}} the extent of damage. FEMA informed the North Carolina congressional delegation about the storm's threat to their constituents. The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm-related operations. All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September1. In response to the extensive scale of the power outages, power companies flew a helicopter over the region to assess the damage. The power was expected to be out for two weeks. Six <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water.|$|E

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> is an {{important}} part of traffic flow. The efficiency, reliability, and safety of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> operations dropped due to increasing traffic congestion. With the advancement of the wireless communication technologies and the development of the vehicle-to-vehicle (v 2 v) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (v 2 i) systems, called Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure System (CVIS), there is an opportunity to provide appropriate traffic signal preemption for <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> based on real-ime <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> data, traffic volume data, and traffic signal timings. This paper describes the design and implementation of an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Signal Preemption System (TJ-EVSP) in CVIS environment. The system function, system architecture, and operation strategies were presented. Then, the system was deployed and validated at two adjacent intersections in Taicang City, Jiangsu Province, China. Results show that the proposed system can improve the efficiency of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> operations with less waste of traffic resources...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge would cost about $6.16 million, while keeping it would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was not convinced that it would be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals {{and he was not}} among them.|$|E
5|$|Tolls are {{collected}} in cash or via an ExpressCard account, a prepaid system {{that offers a}} discount for a $10deposit to the account. The current toll is $1 in each direction for two-axle vehicles and $0.50 for each additional axle. Previously <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> (ambulances) were not charged a toll, however beginning July 3, 2003, they must pay the standard $1toll. To allow quick passage through the toll barrier, these vehicles pay through a charge account. The Utah Department of Transportation worked out an agreement during local road construction for four days in 2003 to allow commuters to use the parkway free of charge.|$|E

5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot {{has replaced the}} former Joan of Arc parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former parking lot was torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> and during move in/out days.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles,</b> are {{required}} to operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

The research work done {{in the area of}} Intelligent Transportation Systems and Traffic Management primarily focuses on determining effectively green light duration along with dispatching of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In this research paper, we propose an algorithm which not only determines green light duration dynamically but also handles the <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> management efficiently. The objectives of the proposed algorithm are minimizing average waiting time. It always analysis the traffic situation at traffic intersection, along with continuous monitoring of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> arrival at different lanes causes to optimize the waiting time of vehicle in lanes. It also deals with the deadlock and starvation condition, due to arrival of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> in repeated interval of time in traffic intersection. The security level of <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicle</b> is in consideration during dispatching that assigned and verified by authorities to preserve security measures and society values. Here, the source of input on dynamic traffic condition is collected through Wireless Sensor Networks technology...|$|R

5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for <b>emergency</b> <b>vehicles.</b> About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. <b>Emergency</b> <b>vehicles</b> experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E
