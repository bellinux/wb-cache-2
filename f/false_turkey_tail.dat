40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} prostate cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSC) {{are responsible for}} cancer initiation as well as disease progression. Unfortunately, conventional therapies are only effective in targeting the more differentiated cancer cells and spare the CSCs. Here, we report that PSP, an active component extracted from the mushroom <b>Turkey</b> <b>tail</b> (also known as Coriolus versicolor), is effective in targeting prostate CSCs. We found that treatment of the prostate cancer cell line PC- 3 with PSP led to the down-regulation of CSC markers (CD 133 and CD 44) in a time and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, PSP treatment not only suppressed the ability of PC- 3 cells to form prostaspheres under non-adherent culture conditions, but also inhibited their tumorigenicity in vivo, further proving that PSP can suppress prostate CSC properties. To investigate if the anti-CSC effect of PSP may lead to prostate cancer chemoprevention, transgenic mice (TgMAP) that spontaneously develop prostate tumors were orally fed with PSP for 20 weeks. Whereas 100 % of the mice that fed with water only developed prostate tumors {{at the end of}} experiment, no tumors could be found in any of the mice fed with PSP, suggesting that PSP treatment can completely inhibit prostate tumor formation. Our results not only demonstrated the intriguing anti-CSC effect of PSP, but also revealed, for the first time, the surprising chemopreventive property of oral PS...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} {{a major issue in}} our current society. In 2012, the number of global lung cancer {{patients}} was estimated at 8. 2 million, with an expected incidence rate of 1. 8 million new cases. Of all the cancer types, lung {{cancer is a}}lso the most lethal, with a 19. 4 % mortality rate. Of all lung cancers, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent diagnosis. Although there are approved therapies for lung cancer, the majority of them focus on growth proliferation inhibition, or inducing apoptosis to reduce the tumor load of a patient. One aspect of NSCLC diagnosis is that patients are usually in the latter stages of cancer, indicating that the tumor is on the cusp of metastasizing, or has already done so. To date, there are no drugs available for a patient capable of inhibiting metastasis. There has been an increase in the use of herbal medicine in the past few decades. The prevalent view is to enhance general health, along with the desire to increase the effects of cancer drug treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has also been proven to be a ‘treasure trove’ of novel therapeutic compounds, due to its long history of clinical use. In this project, the ethanol extract of the fruiting body of Coriolus versicolor (ECV), a bracket fungus commonly known as <b>Turkey</b> <b>tail,</b> was studied. In {{the first part of the}} study, ECV and its fractions were tested for anti-proliferative effects on the A 549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line. The sixth fraction (S 6) was found to be responsible for these effects. Further screening determined that ECV and S 6 were capable of inhibiting TGFβ induced A 549 metastasis via the suppression of MMP 2 gelatinase activity. In the second part of the study, further focus was placed upon the underlying mechanisms of inhibition against TGFβ induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). ECV and S 6 abrogated the TGFβ induced phosphorylation of Smad 2 / 3 and Akt. Further details demonstrated that S 6 was capable of suppressing Slug mRNA transcription. Strikingly, rather than restore E-cadherin expression at the protein or mRNA level, ECV and S 6 pre-treatments enhanced the suppressive effects of TGFβ on E-cadherin. In contrast to these effects, ECV and S 6 also suppressed TGFβ induced vimentin expression. The third part of the study focused on the anti-proliferative aspect. The treatment of A 549 NSCLC with S 6 demonstrated a dose-dependent suppression of A 549 NSCLC and HK 2 proximal renal tubule cell viability. In the A 549 cell line, high doses of S 6 were found to significantly induce apoptosis, whilst treatment of HK 2 cells with S 6 induced necrosis. Cell cycle analysis with ECV and S 6 in the A 549 cell line indicated that the anti-proliferative effects were due to dysregulation of the cell cycle at the G 1 /S and G 2 /M checkpoints. These effects were mediated through the suppression of CDK 2, 4, and 6 protein expression. ECV and S 6 treatment also led to the induction of p 53 and p 21 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that S 6 is a potential candidate for continued drug development for late stage NSCLC treatment, either to suppress the growth of cancer cells or to reduce metastasis. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|By December 2007, {{there was}} a {{continuum}} of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 affected countries along the West African coast from Cote d’Ivoire to Cameroon. In all, 8 countries in West Africa had recorded HPAI H 5 N 1 (Niger, Burkina Faso, Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon). There is concern about the danger posed by circulation of the virus as these countries are members of ECOWAS and there is constant movement of people and goods and trade between them. At a workshop in Accra in November 2008, participants identified re-introduction of the virus into Ghana as a major challenge. The risk question posed was “What is the risk of re-introduction of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus from neighbouring countries (Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and Togo) into Ghana via cross-border trade and movements involving live birds, poultry products and fomites?“. Three release risk pathways involving Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Togo were developed. A questionnaire was developed to elicit responses from identified experts to provide information. Credible information was received from Cote d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso. There was no response from Togo. A qualitative risk assessment following the OIE framework was undertaken to address the risk question. The qualitative risk estimates for the release pathways ranged from negligible to very low with high uncertainty. During outbreaks in neighbouring countries when birds are infected, the risks will vary {{and are likely to}} be higher. The highest risk of re-introduction of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus to Ghana is the pathway involving cross-border trade and movement of poultry, poultry products, people and fomites from Cote d’Ivoire with risk estimates being negligible to medium. This is because poultry and poultry products are illegally sent into Ghana (despite a ban on poultry and poultry products) and the existence of farms along the border in the two countries under similar management and therefore sharing facilities. The steps of the pathway for the re-introduction from Cote d’Ivoire to Ghana associated with higher risks included the probabilities of introduction of live birds, eggs and egg trays, and day-old chicks and the probabilities of contamination of traders and poultry workers on small farms. From Burkina Faso, the steps with higher risks posing a threat for re-introduction of HPAI to Ghana included the probabilities of introduction of live household birds; the probability of transporting guinea fowl eggs; the probabilities of contamination and transporting of baskets used for live birds and egg containers; the probability of traders using vehicles to markets and the probability of maize being imported for use as poultry feed. From Togo, the steps with higher risks posing a threat for reintroduction of HPAI to Ghana included the probability of introduction of live household birds; the probability of contamination of poultry workers and the probability of importing frozen <b>turkey</b> <b>tails</b> and carcasses. These could be targeted as preventive or critical mitigation points. The high level of uncertainty associated with most of the risk estimates point to significant gaps in knowledge of the epidemiology of HPAI and/or poultry production or trade in West Africa. Therefore the risk estimates have to be interpreted with extreme caution. There is the need for targeted data collection to fill some of the relevant knowledge gaps. The particular areas are the prevalence of HPAI in household birds and wild and scavenging birds, and movement patterns of people and poultry and poultry products across the borders.
