50|$|Next on {{the stand}} was Charles Samson, a Director of the Green Island Coal Company and Manager of the Abbotsfield Coal Mine. Samson {{considered}} the mine {{should have had a}} second access and that the old workings should have been sealed off, as was the practice in England. He considered that accessing the old workings, given the presence of <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> in the mine, was reckless. Samson was followed by Samual Herbert Cox, New Zealand Government Inspector of Mines and holder of a Competency Certificate from the London School of Mines. The Mine Manager, Hodge, had informed him in February that there was no <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> present in the mine. Binns, the Coal Inspector had been through the old workings about 8 days earlier and had not reported any <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> present. He did not think Hodge was experienced enough to be a Mine Manager without supervision. Samson also stated that old workings should only be accessed with a safety lamp.|$|R
50|$|He {{undertook}} numerous {{experiments to}} determine {{the size of the}} flame in lamps that determined the percentage of <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> in the atmosphere, but details that were ridiculed at the time have since been found to be extremely accurate.|$|R

50|$|As with <b>fire</b> <b>damper</b> {{inspections}}, {{smoke damper}} inspections {{are required by}} Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ's). The International Code Council, the Joint Commission, NFPA and State Fire Marshals require these inspections {{as part of a}} Building's Life Safety Plan.|$|E
50|$|After Twining was heard, Robert Grigor - Land Surveyor {{took the}} stand {{followed}} by William Wilson, one of the miners. Wilson stated that <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> had been present in the mine {{from time to time}} since October 1878. Precautions had been taken and the mine was considered reasonably safe. He advised that in England areas of old working were usually bricked off and sealed to prevent build ups of <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> - entering that area of the mine was considered unsafe, although Archie Hodge had been into the area to get some rails on occasion. He also recalled that Andrew Javie had been burnt in a minor explosion about three months earlier at the east end of the workings. The miners used naked lights unlike the English miners who used the safety lamps. Wilson considered that the most likely source of the explosion was the old workings as there would not enough buildup of <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> in new workings to cause an explosion of such magnitude. John Irving, another miner gave a similar testimony and suggested that Hodge may have entered the old area to find more rails. He also said that he did not think Hodge was able to assess the danger in the old workings. The hearing was then adjourned.|$|R

50|$|By 1897, Zollverein had {{for years}} been {{suffering}} under mine accidents due to <b>fire</b> <b>damps</b> caused by ventilation problems. To resolve these problems, additional (mostly ventilation-only) shafts were opened near the existing ones: In 1899, shaft 7 was opened near shaft 3, shaft 8 near shafts 1/2 (1900), and shaft 9 near shaft 6 (1905).|$|R

An air gap of maximum 1/8" [...] per linear foot of width facilitate installation and allows smoke migration through the assembly.

50|$|Some registers, {{particularly}} those in commercial buildings or institutions which house {{large numbers of people}} (such as hotels or hospitals) have a <b>fire</b> <b>damper</b> attached to them. This damper automatically senses smoke or extreme heat, and shuts the register closed so that fire and smoke do not travel throughout the building via the HVAC system.|$|E
50|$|Ventilating cavity fire {{barriers}} {{is a type}} of air transfer <b>fire</b> <b>damper</b> used in cavities or voids in constructions with natural ventilation, typically inside air gaps behind cladding. These are often subject to sudden direct flame impingement. In the US, ASTM E2912 cover testing, combined with E119 where required. A method to verify performance in the open state, similar to E2912, is being assessed in Europe by CEN.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the Lowthers' {{interest}} in technology could be seen at Stone Pitt {{when one of the}} world's earliest steam engines, Engine No. 5 built by Thomas Newcomen and John Calley in 1715 was installed, to help in drainage and haulage. William Brownrigg, Whitehaven's most eminent scientist, was the first to investigate the explosive mine gas <b>fire</b> <b>damp.</b>|$|R
50|$|His medical {{interest}} led him {{to investigate}} the gases the miners breathed - <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> (methane) and choke damp (oxygen depleted air). Carlisle Spedding helped to build a laboratory for Brownrigg and fed it with gases from a nearby coal mine through lead pipes. Brownrigg developed methods of collecting and transferring the gases and supplied James Lowther with gas filled bladders to show to The Royal Society which then elected Brownrigg as a Fellow.|$|R
5000|$|In coal mining, accumulating and {{escaping}} gases {{were known}} originally for their adverse effects {{rather than their}} useful qualities. Coal miners described two types of gases, one called the choke damp and the other <b>fire</b> <b>damp.</b> In 1667, a paper detailing {{the effects of these}} gases was entitled, [...] "A Description of a Well and Earth in Lancashire taking Fire, by a Candle approaching to it. Imparted by Thomas Shirley, Esq an eye-witness." ...|$|R
50|$|In the US, the Joint Commission, State Fire Marshals and Other Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ's), require Fire and Smoke Dampers to {{be tested}} at {{specified}} intervals. Similarly, European authorities mandate maintenance and repairs of fire dampers also, as part of approvals or listings issued following successful testing of <b>fire</b> <b>damper</b> assemblies. Therefore, fire dampers that are not demonstrably maintained per regulations constitute fire code violations because installed but unmaintained fire dampers no longer comply with their certification listings.|$|E
50|$|McCabe {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Felix and Josephine McCabe. He {{graduated}} from Northeast Catholic High School for Boys, where he was an honor student. After graduation, McCabe took mechanical engineering classes at Drexel University. He then joined the Navy where {{he served as a}} pilot from 1958-1964. Upon leaving the Navy he worked in various jobs, including owning a hot rod building company that modified engines in different combinations of hot rods. McCabe once modified a 1958 Corvette to go faster than 200 miles per hour with his own engine accessories. In 1968 he started his first company, Prefco Products, a <b>fire</b> <b>damper</b> and smoke control company in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|Fire dampers are passive fire {{protection}} products used in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts {{to prevent the spread}} of fire inside the ductwork through fire-resistance rated walls and floors. Fire/smoke dampers are similar to fire dampers in fire resistance rating, and also prevent the spread of smoke inside the ducts. When a rise in temperature occurs, the <b>fire</b> <b>damper</b> closes, usually activated by a thermal element which melts at temperatures higher than ambient but low enough to indicate the presence of a fire, allowing springs to close the damper blades. Fire dampers can also close following receipt of an electrical signal from a fire alarm system utilising detectors remote from the damper, indicating the sensing of heat or smoke in the building occupied spaces or in the HVAC duct system.|$|E
50|$|The court {{began with}} the {{identification}} of the bodies by Thomas Knowles - Pit Headman, Joseph Robertson, David Dunn, and John McDonald. Only Archie Hodge and Jarvie remained unidentified {{at the end of the}} day. The hearing recommenced on the Monday at 11am when the remaining bodies identified. Charles Edward Twining, a qualified colliary manager and the mining surveyor with the Company was called to give evidence. He advised that in his opinion the mine should have had a second outlet and had recommended it. He stated that in England there was a requirement that there should be two outlets as a minimum, the air vent did not count as an outlet. There should also have been a barometer in the mine and outside to determine the presence of bad air. Locked lamps or safety lamps were required when <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> was suspected as being present. William Hodge and Beardsmore had advised Twining about 2 weeks before the explosion of <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> being present in the new working. Twining checked but found none. An inspection of the mine was carried out on 1 February by Mr Cox, the Government Assistant Geologist and Mr Binnes the Government Coal Inspector. Binnes drew out plans for the Mine Manager on how best to work the mine.|$|R
50|$|From 1894 to 1920, Evans was {{employed}} by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, producing a major Report on Manuscripts in the Welsh Language. In 1905 he facilitated {{the purchase of the}} Peniarth manuscript collection from Sir John Williams. Since 1909, this has been lodged in the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth. He campaigned for a secure library for Wales. Valuable books were then in danger of destruction by <b>fire,</b> <b>damp</b> and vermin. His connection with Sir John Williams was important {{in the history of the}} establishment of the National Library.|$|R
50|$|Blackdamp (also {{known as}} stythe or choke damp) is an asphyxiant, {{reducing}} the available oxygen content of air {{to a level}} incapable of sustaining human or animal life. It {{is not a single}} gas but a mixture of unbreathable gases left after oxygen is removed from the air and typically consists of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour. The suffix damp is believed to derive from the German word for vapours ("Dampf"). The word damp is used in similar mining terms such as white <b>damp</b> (carbon monoxide), <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> (typically methane) and stink damp (hydrogen sulfide).|$|R

50|$|Mr Shore rebutted the claim, {{stating that}} his mine was 500 yards away and 450 (yards or feet) below the Companies mine. He further stated {{that there was}} no {{reliable}} evidence to supported Ritchie and Hector's assertion and that gas transfer through a fault at that distance was inconsistent with evidence from other mine faults. Shore further pointed out that the ventilation system at the Companies mine had not been operational since the explosion and that it was more likely that a lack of ventilation was the cause of the buildup given that <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> was known to be present in the mine.|$|R
5000|$|Dewar {{engaged in}} an embittered {{controversy}} with Thomas Trotter on the chemistry of choke <b>damp</b> and <b>fire</b> <b>damp.</b> Trotter had proposed [...] "oxygenated muriatic gas" [...] (i.e. hydrochloric acid) as a fumigant. As far as chemistry went, both their theories were inaccurate. Dewar {{was a friend of}} the Newcastle physician John Clark, and Trotter's criticism of Clark has been given as one possible reason for the personal attacks included with the scientific and practical arguments Dewar gave. A scale or chemical slide rule mentioned by Thomas Charles Hope as [...] "Dr. Dewar's" [...] has been considered to be unpublished work of Henry Dewar.|$|R

50|$|In 1870, Galloway began {{investigations}} into the cause of explosions in dry mines, and became convinced that the cause was coal dust as well as <b>fire</b> <b>damp.</b> He was called on, as a mining inspector, to investigate the causes of between 60 and 80 explosions in Scottish mines and it became his life's work {{to find ways to}} reduce the risk to the lives on miners underground. He carried out tests with safety lamps, finding that the flame was deflected through the gauze when shots were fired, measured the varying size and colour of flame depending on the atmospheric conditions and composition. He wrote papers on his findings and presented them to the Institute of Mining, the Royal Society, the Athenaeum Club, London and anyone else who would listen.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of electric power into coal mines, {{it was discovered that}} lethal explosions could be initiated by electrical equipment such as lighting, signals, or motors. The hazard of <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> or methane accumulation in mines was well known by the time electricity was introduced, along with the danger of suspended coal dust. At least two British mine explosions were attributed to an electric bell signal system. In this system, two bare wires were run along the length of a drift, and any miner desiring to signal the surface would momentarily touch the wires to each other or bridge the wires with a metal tool. The inductance of the signal bell coils, combined with breaking of contacts by exposed metal surfaces, resulted in sparks which could ignite methane, causing an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} {{explosion}} the trap doors used for ventilation {{and the internal}} wall {{in the vicinity of}} the underground crane were observed to be in a good state by the men who escaped. Indeed, even the lamp at the crane was still burning. When the mine was reopened the area was found to damaged: [...] "the stoppings and trap-doors were blown down, the roof fallen and as great marks of destruction as in any other part of the mine". The area was near John Pit, the down-cast shaft where fresh air was entering the mine at its greatest velocity. Hodgson realised that this was significant and supposed that [...] "the atmospheric current ... intercepted the progress of the first explosion, and prevented it from igniting the <b>fire</b> <b>damp</b> here".|$|R
5000|$|The few French and English reviews at {{the time}} of {{publication}} were positive. It was called as a [...] "very sad" [...] and [...] "very beautiful" [...] novel, and the translation (by Jacques Le Clerq) was likewise praised. Elizabeth N. Case, writing in the Hartford Daily Courant, called it a [...] "delicate sensitive study in character", though she states in the same breath that it [...] "is manifestly one of those novels which inevitably lose definitely through translation"; and again, [...] "this restrained record of a French provincial school teacher, who yearned for all the elemental joys of a normal environment, is absolutely and essential Gallic, an appealing book even in its English form, but with its informing <b>fire</b> <b>damped</b> and dimmed through transference to an alien tongue". The novel has long been out of print.|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{explosion}} the station master, J B Griffen, sent the company's train to Balclutha to get Dr Smith. He {{arrived on the scene}} some 25 minutes later. While this was happening, men from the neighbouring mines gathered and organised a group of volunteers to either rescue the miners or recover their bodies. <b>Fire</b> <b>damp</b> initially prevented rescuers from entering the mine. Those first entering the mine were W Shore, R M Sewell, Mr Aitcheson, and some unnamed others. They found two falls in the mine, which had been caused by the explosion. Also the brattices which allowed air circulation had been destroyed and temporary canvas ones needed to be installed prior to further searching. Several of those installing the canvas ones were almost suffocated. The condition in the mine remained dangerous and those working in it had to do so in shifts because of the impact of after damp. All hope of finding the miners alive was abandoned at this point.|$|R
