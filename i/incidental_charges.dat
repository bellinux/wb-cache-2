40|$|PUBLIC UTILITY RATES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Amends Constitution {{to provide}} that, during any {{calendar}} year, the Public Utility Commission shall not approve a rate or <b>incidental</b> <b>charge</b> increase {{by a public}} utility for the furnishing of energy in any form which results in a cumulative increase to the ultimate consumer exceeding 10 %. For purpose of calculating maximum allowable increase in rates, specifies base year rates as those approved and in effect January 1, 1980, adjusted annually as provided in the measure. Allows waiver of this limit by a statute valid for a twelve month period following passage of the statute. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: These fiscal impacts would depend upon {{the extent to which}} allowable utility rates exceed the 10 % limit {{and the extent to which}} legislative waivers are granted. If legislature does not grant waivers, there could be reductions of income, sales, and property tax revenues of state and local governments. The energy costs of state and local governments could also be reduced. As there is no basis for predicting allowable utility rate increases or the legislative action that may be taken, the fiscal impact of the measure on state and local governments is indeterminable...|$|R

5000|$|... ===Early years=== After {{the great}} famine of 1866, {{the people of}} Odisha and some liberal Britons {{wanted to start a}} college at Cuttack. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, officiating {{commissioner}} of Odisha Division made the government of Bengal realise the difficulties of Oriya students in getting college educations and succeeded in obtaining permission to start collegiate classes in the Cuttack Zilla School. Thus the first college in Odisha was born in January 1868 with intermediate classes and six students. Commissioner Ravenshaw proposed to convert the Collegiate School into a full-fledged degree college. The government of Bengal accepted the demand with the condition that a public contribution of Rs.30,000 be deposited for the proposed college. Ravenshaw took up the matter as an object of personal interest and guaranteed the collection of the required amount. H. Woodrew, DPI of Bengal supported Ravenshaw. H. J. Reynolds, secretary to the government of Bengal requested the government of India to sanction the <b>incidental</b> <b>charges</b> and the post of the principal on the additional condition of meeting half the monthly expenses by public donation. Due to Ravenshaw's efforts and the financial support of Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, HH Shri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo, the college department of the Collegiate School was converted in 1876 to a full-fledged Government Degree College bearing the name Cuttack College affiliated to the University of Calcutta. Samuel Ager was appointed as the first principal. The college had only 19 students. H.H. Sri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo donated Rs. 20,000 as a permanent endowment which almost fulfilled the condition imposed by the government for public contribution. On his insistence the name was changed to Ravenshaw College in 1878 after Thomas Edward Ravenshaw to commemorate his services to the cause of education in Odisha. The college was granted permanent status by 1881. Growth in the initial days was slow. Altogether 94 graduates were produced by the closing year of the 19th century and the student strength had increased to 97. Science stream remained confined only to intermediate level until 1912 when Bihar and Odisha were separated from Bengal.|$|E
