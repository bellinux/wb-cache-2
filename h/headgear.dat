40|$|The thesis work named Reveal is a sculptural jewelry {{series that}} has a subtle tone of {{contemporary}} fashion. Reveal was created by studying traditional African art techniques for adorning the head and hair. The work analyzes the symbolic meaning of various hair styles and <b>headgears</b> within African cultures, by specifically zooming in on different threading hairstyles and free flowing sculptural <b>headgears.</b> This thesis highlights the importance and evolution of color within African cultures and how color symbolically reflects status and behavior of individuals within Africa. Reveal exposes the time intensive practices characteristic of Ghanaian daily life and juxtaposes them to the labor intensive process of making art works that provides a sense of satisfaction and value for work done. Finally, this thesis embodies my personal artistic flavor and how I interpret my intrinsic wisdom within Reveal...|$|R
