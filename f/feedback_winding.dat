A breadboard of {{a representation of the}} Hybrid 2301065, Bias Drive A driving a 2 N 3700 NPN transistor, with dual 75 V secondaries, with loads, was used to test the circuit. The initial transformer design that was wound with bifilar secondaries was too unstable to test. The second 1408 transformer with a split bobbin and the <b>feedback</b> <b>winding</b> below the primary was also found to be unstable. (It was nearly impossible to keep the circuit from squeeging). The third transformer tested has the feedback {{on the outside of the}} resonant winding. The primary goal of the design was to have as tight a magnetic coupling as possible to the resonant winding, and as loose a coupling as possible to the primary. Further, the circuit AC ground is connected to the winding at the feedback end of the secondary winding. This transformer proved to be very stable - it is virtually impossible to make this design squeg. An emitter resistor (Rl 29 A) was added to this circuit, as referenced to the GCMS design, to protect Q 102 from thermal runaway in the event of a turn on with a non- resonate circuit or load short. This was verified to protect Q 102 for at least 30 seconds in the event of a short. Approximately 1 % of the 4 lmW input power is lost in this protection resistor under normal operation. The circuit was verified to operate normally when a radiated Q 102 (2 N 3700), (low Beta) transistor was substituted for the normal 2 N 3700.

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} bounded control law {{for a class}} of {{uncertain}} nonlinear systems is proposed. The proposed bounded controller guarantees asymptotic stability, asymptotic tracking and asymptotic disturbance rejection of systems in strict feedback form with the sum of unmatched uncertainties and the unbounded exogenous disturbance. A feedback law emerged from Artstein's Theorem and Sontag's universal formulas {{are known to be}} useful to limit the control signal. However, the formulas are not robust as in many cases, being applied to the systems without uncertainties and disturbances. The controller proposed in this paper takes advantages of a mixed backstepping and Lyapunov redesign, which employed to enrich the Sontag's universal formulas. Therefore, the appealing feature of the proposed controller is that it satisfies small control property in order to preserve performance robustness and stability robustness with less control effort. Another advantage of the proposed controller is the formulas become applicable to higher order systems (i. e. order > 0). This paper also discusses fuzzy logic tuning approach for the controller parameters such that the closed loop system matrix remain Hurtwitz. For practicality, the proposed technique is applied to a variable speed control of a new strict <b>feedback</b> <b>wind</b> turbine system with wind dynamics appeared explicitly in the system model.

40|$|Galactic {{feedback}} strongly {{affects the}} way galactic environments are enriched. We examine this connection by performing {{a suite of}} cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, exploring a range of parameters based on the galaxy formation model developed in Vogelsberger et al. 2013 (henceforth V 13). We {{examine the effects of}} AGN <b>feedback,</b> <b>wind</b> mass loading, wind specific energy, and wind metal-loading on the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies with M_halo > 10 ^ 11 M_. Note that while the V 13 model was tuned to match observations including the stellar mass function, no explicit tuning was done for the CGM. The wind energy per unit outflow mass has the most significant effect on the CGM enrichment. High energy winds launch metals far beyond the virial radius. AGN feedback also has a significant effect, but only at z < 3. We compare to high redshift HI and CIV observations. All our simulations produce the observed number of Damped Lyman-α Absorbers. At lower column density, several of our simulations produce enough Lyman Limit Systems (LLS) 100 kpc from the galaxy, but in all cases the LLS abundance falls off with distance faster than observations, with too few LLS at 200 kpc. Further, in all models the CIV abundance drops off too sharply with distance, with too little CIV 100 - 200 kpc from the galaxy. Higher energy wind models produce more extended CIV but also produce less stars, in tension with star-formation rate density observations. This highlights the fact that circumgalactic observations are a strong constraint on galactic feedback models. Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures, accepted to MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Galactic winds {{regulate}} {{star formation}} in disk galaxies {{and help to}} enrich the circum-galactic medium. They are therefore crucial for galaxy formation, but their driving mechanism is still poorly understood. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} cosmic rays (CRs) can drive outflows if active CR transport is taken into account. Using hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies with virial masses between 10 ^ 10 and 10 ^ 13 M_, we study how the properties of CR-driven winds depend on halo mass. CRs are treated in a two-fluid approximation and their transport is modelled through isotropic or anisotropic diffusion. We find that CRs are only able to drive mass-loaded winds beyond the virial radius in haloes with masses below 10 ^ 12 M_. For our lowest examined halo mass, the wind is roughly spherical and has velocities of ∼ 20 km s^- 1. With increasing halo mass, the wind becomes biconical and can reach ten times higher velocities. The mass loading factor drops rapidly with virial mass, a dependence that approximately follows a power-law with a slope between - 1 and - 2. This scaling is slightly steeper than observational inferences, and also steeper than commonly used prescriptions for <b>wind</b> <b>feedback</b> in cosmological simulations. The slope is quite robust to variations of the CR injection efficiency or the CR diffusion coefficient. In contrast to the mass loading, the energy loading shows no significant dependence on halo mass. While these scalings are close to successful heuristic models of <b>wind</b> <b>feedback,</b> the CR-driven <b>winds</b> in our present models are not yet powerful enough to fully account for the required feedback strength.

This thesis quantifies the climate-carbon <b>feedback</b> of <b>wind</b> stress and surface warming, with a particular focus on the mechanisms driving the feedbacks {{and the role of the}} Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic. To study the feedbacks, a set of theoretical scalings and a hierarchy of numerical simulations are used. Of the climate feedbacks examined, increased surface warming is likely to result in large atmospheric CO 2 anomalies while the effects of North Atlantic wind stress are likely to be negligible. The atmospheric feedback of surface warming is constrained by compensating changes in separate ocean carbon reservoirs as a result of warming-induced circulation changes. Southern Ocean winds affect atmospheric CO 2 through both local upwelling of carbon as well as the remote modification of Equatorial and North Atlantic chemistry. As a result, the net Southern Ocean <b>wind</b> stress <b>feedback</b> could be significant and even comparable to the temperature feedback.

40|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{are considerably}} more complex structures than previously thought, harbouring {{at least two}} stellar generations which present clearly distinct chemical abundances. Scenarios explaining the abundance patterns in globular clusters mostly assume that originally the clusters had {{to be much more}} massive than today, and that the second generation of stars originates from the gas shed by stars of the first generation (FG). The lack of metallicity spread in most globular clusters further requires that the supernova-enriched gas ejected by the FG is completely lost within ~ 30 Myr, a hypothesis never tested by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. In this paper, we use 3 D hydrodynamic simulations including stellar <b>feedback</b> from <b>winds</b> and supernovae, radiative cooling and self-gravity to study whether a realistic distribution of OB associations in a massive proto-GC of initial mass M_tot ~ 10 ^ 7 M_sun is sufficient to expel its entire gas content.

The cluster wind blows out of the molecular clump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is entrained. The densest regions are surprisingly resistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other dense regions close to the cluster.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} predictability of the atmosphere-ocean climate system on interannual and decadal timescales. We investigate {{the extent to}} which the atmospheric internal variability (weather noise) can cause climate prediction to lose skill; and we also look for the oceanic processes that contribute to the climate predictability via interaction with the atmosphere. First, we develop a framework for assessing the predictability of a linear stochastic system. Based on the information of deterministic dynamics and noise forcing, various predictability measures are defined and new predictability-analysis tools are introduced. For the sake of computational efficiency, we also discuss the formulation of a low-order model within the context of four reduction methods: modal, EOF, most predictable pattern, and balanced truncation. Subsequently, predictabilities of two specific physical systems are investigated within such framework. The first is a mixed layer model of SST with focus on the effect of oceanic advection. Analytical solution of a one-dimensional model shows that even though advection can give rise to a pair of low-frequency normal modes, no enhancement in the predictability is found in terms of domain averaged error variance. However, a Predictable Component Analysis (PrCA) shows that advection can play a role in redistributing the predictable variance. This analytical result is further tested in a more realistic two-dimensional North Atlantic model with observed mean currents. The second is a linear coupled model of tropical Atlantic atmosphere-ocean system. Eigen-analysis reveals that the system has two types of coupled modes: a decadal meridional mode and an interannual equatorial mode. The meridional mode, which manifests itself as a dipole pattern in SST, is controlled by thermodynamic <b>feedback</b> between <b>wind,</b> latent heat flux, and SST, and modified by ocean heat transport. The equatorial mode, which manifests itself as an SST anomaly in the eastern equatorial basin, is dominated by dynamic <b>feedback</b> between <b>wind,</b> thermocline, upwelling, and SST.

ENSO {{is the most important}} year-to-year fluctuation of the climate system on the planet 1, varying between anomalously cold (La Niña) and warm (El Niño) condi tions. Underpinning occurrences of ENSO events is the positive <b>feedback</b> between trade <b>wind</b> intensity and zonal contrasts in sea surface temperature (SST), referred to as the Bjerknes <b>feedback.</b> The trade <b>winds</b> normally pile up warm surface water in the western Pacific while upwelling colder subsurface water in the east along the equator and off the west coast of South America. The resulting east–west surface temperature contrast reinforces an east–west air pressure difference across the basin that in turn drives the trade winds. During La Niña, the system strengthens, but during El Niño, the trade winds weaken as atmospheric pressure rises in the western Pacific and falls in the eastern Pacific. The Bjerknes feedback now operates in reverse, with weakened trade winds and SST warm-ing tendencies along the Equator reinforcing one another. It is still not clear what sets this quasi-oscillatory behaviour, that is, whether ENSO is self-sustaining or triggered by stochastic forcing 2.

We adopt the model of a thin disk with magnetically driven winds to investigate the observational high-efficiency jets in FRII radio galaxies. It is found that the structure of a thin disk can be significantly altered by the <b>feedback</b> of <b>winds.</b> The temperature of a disk gradually decreases with increasing magnetic field; the disk density, surface density, and pressure also change enormously. The lower temperature and higher surface density in the inner disk result in the rapid decrease of radiative efficiency. Thus, the jet efficiency is greatly improved even if the jet power is conventional. Our results can explain the observations quite well. The theoretical maximum jet efficiency of R similar to 1000 suggested by our calculations is large enough to explain all of the high jet efficiency in observations, even considering the episodic activity of jets...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from a {{numerical}} study of the multiphase interstellar medium in sub-Lymanbreak galaxy protogalactic clumps. Such clumps are abundant at z = 3 and {{are thought to be}} a major contributor to damped Lyα absorption. We model the formation of winds from these clumps and show that during star formation episodes they feature outflows with neutral gas velocity widths up to several hundred kms − 1. Such outflows are consistent with the observed high-velocity dispersion in DLAs. In our models thermal energy <b>feedback</b> from <b>winds</b> and supernovae results in efficient outflows only when cold ( ∼ 100 M ⊙ pc − 3) clouds are resolved at grid resolution of 12 pc. At lower 24 pc resolution the first signs of the multiphase medium are spotted; however, at this low resolution thermal injection of feedback energy cannot yet create hot expanding bubbles around starforming regions – instead feedback tends to erase high-density peaks and suppress star formation. At 12 pc resolution feedback compresses cold clouds, often without disrupting the ongoing star formation; {{at the same time a}} larger fraction of feedback energy is channeled into low-density bubbles and winds. These winds often entrain compact neutral clumps which produce multi-component metal absorption lines.

40|$|We {{implement}} {{and test}} a core-collapse Type II SN feedback that is physically motivated and produces good agreement with observations in galaxy formation simulations. The model includes both kinetic and thermal <b>feedback,</b> allowing <b>wind</b> particles {{to receive a}} velocity kick that mimics galactic winds and distributes mass and metallicity to the interstellar and intergalactic medium. We also include a phenomenological stellar feedback to study a possible enhancement of {{the efficiency of the}} SN-II feedback by creating lower-density ambient gas medium of the stellar populations by distribution of thermal energy. Our SN-II model is unique {{in the sense that it}} computes the wind velocity and the lifetime of a supernova remnant by considering its evolution with the Sedov-Taylor solution rather than taking them as constant values. We find that by combining SN-II and stellar feedback the model alleviates overcooling and missing satellites problems. The model also produces outflows without a need for turning off hydrodynamical interactions, cooling and star formation by hand. Our preliminary results with cosmological zoom-in simulations imply the new model successfully reproduces the stellar-to-halo mass ratio. We conclude that the Sedov-Taylor solution can be used to reasonably approximate the physical properties and evolutional time scales of supernova remnants in the galaxy formation numerical simulations...|$|R
