5000|$|Marvel Super Hero Squad Online had {{alternate}} controls, {{in which}} with one click the player could {{move from one}} place to another, or using the arrow keys or the traditional W, A, S, D keys on a keyboard. Selected characters could <b>fly</b> by <b>pressing</b> on blue circles on the ground. If the character was unable to fly, that character could have a double jump or a high/long jump. Points were separated into two compartments, gold and fractals. Gold points could be used to buy anything, while fractals also allowed a player to buy anything. However, fractals could be earned over time in game while gold had to be purchased with real money in the store. Many characters from the Marvel Universe appeared in Marvel Super Hero Squad Online in a traditional Super Hero Squad [...] "super-deformed" [...] style.|$|R
6000|$|And now the ardent {{friends to}} greet each other [...] Impatient <b>fly,</b> and <b>pressing</b> breast to breast [...] They tenderly embrace, and with {{alternate}} kisses [...] Their cheeks resound; then, clasping hands, they drop [...] Plummet-like {{down upon the}} sofa, both [...] Together. Seated thus, one flings a phrase, [...] Subtle and pointed, at the other's heart, [...] Hinting of certain things that rumor tells, [...] And in her turn the other with a sting [...] Assails. The lovely face of one is flushed [...] With beauteous anger, and the other bites [...] Her pretty lips a little; evermore [...] At every instant waxes violent [...] The anxious agitation of the fans. [...] So, {{in the age of}} Turpin, if two knights [...] Illustrious and well cased in mail encountered [...] Upon the way, each cavalier aspired [...] To prove the valor of the other in arms, [...] And, after greetings courteous and fair, [...] They lowered their lances and their chargers dashed [...] Ferociously together; then they flung [...] The splintered fragments of their spears aside, [...] And, fired with generous fury, drew their huge, [...] Two-handed swords and rushed upon each other! [...] But in the distance through a savage wood [...] The clamor of a messenger is heard, [...] Who comes full gallop to recall the one [...] Unto King Charles, and th' other to the camp [...] Of the young Agramante. Dare thou, too, [...] Dare thou, invincible youth, to expose the curls [...] And the toupet, so exquisitely dressed [...] This very morning, to the deadly shock [...] Of the infuriate fans; to new emprises [...] Thy fair invite, and thus the extreme effects [...] Of their periculous enmity suspend.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{his early}} {{setbacks}} in combat, Eaton soon rose to command No.3 Squadron, taking over from Squadron Leader Bobby Gibbes on 21April 1943. He led the unit as it relocated to Malta the following month, {{in preparation for}} the Allied invasion of Sicily. Illness forced him to hand over command in June–July, but he returned to take charge of the squadron in August as it continued to fly escort and interdiction missions in Sicily with other units of No.239 Wing RAF. His brother Roger, a flight sergeant serving with the RAF, was killed in a Wellington bomber raid during the campaign. On 3September, No.3 Squadron took part in the opening day of the Allied invasion of Italy, supporting the British XIII Corps as it moved inland after landing at Calabria. Enemy air resistance remained light and worthwhile ground targets few as the campaign progressed but, on 24October, Eaton led an attack against German shipping off the Yugoslav coast that left a merchant ship and two barges on fire. He repeated the exercise on 7November, when the squadron scored hits on vessels in two separate raids in the harbour at Split. On 19November, when the rest of No.239 Wing was unable to complete any missions due to adverse weather, Eaton found a hole in the clouds and led eight Kittyhawks in a successful attack on Opi in central Italy. He was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1December. On 14December, he was awarded the Distinguished <b>Flying</b> Cross for <b>pressing</b> home a night attack on Axis armour at Termoli. The citation was promulgated in the London Gazette: ...|$|R

The citation was promulgated in the London Gazette: One evening in October, 1943, this officer led his squadron in an attack on a strong enemy force, equipped with tanks, which were attacking our troops near Termoli. In spite of intense antiaircraft fire, Squadron Leader Eaton led his formation in at a low level and pressed home an attack which completely disrupted the enemy's forces. In this spirited action, Squadron Leader Eaton displayed inspiring leadership, great courage and tenacity.|$|R
