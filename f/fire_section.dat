5000|$|A typical AEF {{flight from}} RAF Manston would either be a “south below one”, which would last {{approximately}} thirty minutes inland down to Dover (seeing the Shakespeare Cliff [...] Channel Tunnel Site, Dover Castle, {{along with the}} location of the former Battle of Britain radar masts) and return up the coast for a “rejoin” at Sandwich, Kent (with a quick peer down the top of the Richborough Power Station cooling towers) or “west below one”, again thirty minutes duration, inland to Canterbury (seeing Canterbury Cathedral) and return along the north Kent coast for a “rejoin” at Reculver (of Sir Barnes Wallis Bouncing bomb fame). If the weather was particularly unkind for the visiting cadets, then Plan B was known as “round the island” (a reference to the Isle of Thanet) either clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on the wind direction, with sorties lasting approximately twenty minutes.

50|$|The Act {{stemmed from}} a {{petition}} made to Parliament by a delegation of shipowners in 1786, concerned that recent court cases had put them at risk of significantly greater liabilities in case of loss or damage to cargo. It was passed by Parliament without a division in either House. Section I of the Act imposed a limit on the liability of shipowners in regards to goods lost or damaged in a robbery, {{regardless of whether the}} robbers were part of the crew of the ship or not. The liability for any loss or damage of goods was limited to the value of the vessel, her equipment, and any freight due for the voyage. This was an extension to the provisions of the Responsibility of Shipowners Act 1733, as the case of Sutton v. Mitchell, (1785) 1 T.R. 18, had highlighted that the 1733 Act would give no protection to shipowners where a ship was robbed without the collusion of the crew. Section II provided that the liability of the owner in case of fire was entirely removed, a reaction to Forward v. Pittard, (1785) I T.R. 27, where a shipowner had been held liable for loss from an accidental <b>fire.</b> <b>Section</b> III provided that the shipowner was under no liability at all in the case of stolen valuables (gold, silver, jewels, watches, etc.) unless the bill of lading clearly stated their nature, quality and value.|$|E

This chapter also describes some of the stimuli that lead to innovation, and introduces {{some of the people that}} produced such inventions. Arnold Toynbee [TC 72] describes history using a challenge-response theory in which civilizations either grow or fail in response to a series of challenges. Similarly, the history of bridges can be described as a series of three challenges that are described in the three sections of this chapter: Ethernets under <b>fire</b> (<b>Section</b> 1. 1), wire speed Ethernet forwarding (Section 1. 2), and scaling to higher speeds (Section 1. 3.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} tests {{was carried out}} in two 1 / 15 reduced-scale tunnels to investigate ceiling temperature distribution and smoke diffusion in tunnel fires with natural ventilation. Based on experimental results and the one-dimensional theory, formulas to predict the temperature distribution and smoke diffusion extent were developed. As the smoke was extracted through natural ventilation shafts, the tunnel was conceptually divided into two zones or sections: the fire and non-fire sections. In both sections, the smoke temperature can be expressed using the temperature decay formula and reference temperature formula. The temperature decay is an exponential function. The reference temperature in the <b>fire</b> <b>section</b> can be developed from the definition of the dimensionless temperature and a constant value that is different for different tunnels. The reference temperature in the non-fire section represents the relationship between the dimensionless reference temperature in the non-fire section and a constant value that is different for different tunnels. The smoke diffusion area represents the relationship between the dimensionless length of the smoke layer and the temperature decay at the location of smoke.

40|$|In this study, Elif Şafak’s novel “Aşk” was {{examined}} in {{aspects of the}} teqniques used in the novel, {{the structure of the}} novel and the messages which the author wants to convey to the readers. In addition, the novel was analyzed in terms of location, time and characters. There are four important characters intertwined with very different temperaments from each other in the two novels. The stories in these two books take place in different regions and in different historical periods. The author combines two worlds with a gripping narrative and takes the reader {{to the world of the}} sufis. Events become a double-dimensioned position with the protagonist beginning to read a manuscript novel. The novel was built with many processes and a multilayered structure. The relationship between Shams and Rumi, is depicted with the point of view of other characters of the novel. Like the story of Layla and caliph Harun Rashid, Prophet Moses and Khidr parable and other unrelated stories told by Shams recall us the technical structure of the thousand and one nights tales.
