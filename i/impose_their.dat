5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most people have been tolerant and oppose the militants desire to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Gonzalo de Alvarado {{and his men}} {{decided to}} remain; the area was {{apparently}} well-populated enough to provide worthwhile tribute, {{and the existence of}} precious metal deposits in the region had already been established by earlier forays. Alvarado decided to found the new town of Gracias a Dios at Opoa, rather than at the nearby site that had been set aside by Chávez. In late 1536, Gonzalo de Alvarado finally founded the new town, assigning officials as had been designated by his brother. Although 100 citizens had been assigned by Pedro de Alvarado, in reality it had about 40 upon its foundation. The town only remained at Opoa for a brief period, before it was transferred to a new site. Gonzalo and his men campaigned to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> control over a wide area, penetrating as far as the Comayagua valley. Although claiming conquest of a wide region, Gonzalo had too few soldiers to effectively control it. Native resistance was such that the colonists were soon threatened by starvation, and the natives refused to serve the Spanish. San Pedro was in a similar situation, and was unable to provide any kind of relief to Gracias a Dios. The colonists appealed to Maldonado in Guatemala for assistance, and were informed that Francisco de Montejo would soon be taking up governorship, and would provide any assistance necessary.|$|E

In recognition of his efforts, the Dutch built him a palace (the Kovilakam) at Chendamangalam.|$|E

25|$|Khaled Diab {{argues that}} Muslims cannot <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> own values on {{people of other}} faiths.

25|$|Relations between France and England {{were already}} tense, with the English {{in control of}} the fief of Gascony and both sides {{struggling}} to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> own interpretations of what precisely their relationship was.

25|$|However, Mahathir's {{views were}} already firmly entrenched before this event.

He added that Asians need stability and economic growth more than civil liberties. These remarks did not endear him to US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was a guest at the meeting.|$|E

25|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} trend of Rajasingha's long reign was {{the replacement of the}} Portuguese by the Dutch. The strategy of bringing in one European power to help fend off another had backfired spectacularly, and the Kandyan kingdom found itself in much the same position as it had been with the Portuguese. Despite the Dutch being less determined to convert the mass populace and <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> cultural dominance, Europeans increasingly came to be seen as rapacious adventurers who were simply incapable of honouring their deals.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. Axial fans operate at high specific speed i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, {{they are unable to}} <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and outlet velocity triangles meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|E
25|$|The Visogoths {{eventually}} moved on, {{allowing a}} short period of stability apart from domestic disturbances in 431. (Alföldy p.214). 451 saw the Huns pour through the land, and in 433, Pannonia had had to be evacuated under the Hun attacks. The death of Attila in 453 allowed the Ostragoths to scatter his Hunnish empire. Many tribes, formerly under the Huns now started to settle along the Danube basin and assert their independence. Among these were the Rugii, who formed their own lands (Rugiland) across the Danube and started to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> will on Noricum.|$|E

50|$|From 895 to 902, the Hungarians (Magyars) {{progressively}} <b>imposed</b> <b>their</b> {{authority on}} the Pannonian Basin. Although some contemporary sources mention that Great Moravia disappeared without trace and its inhabitants left, archaeological research and toponyms suggest the continuity of Slavic population in the river valleys of the Inner Western Carpathians.|$|R
25|$|The {{relationship}} between priests and warriors was important, because {{the concept of}} Ērānshahr had been revived by the priests. Without this relationship, the Sassanid Empire would not have survived in its beginning stages. Because of this {{relationship between}} the warriors and the priests, religion and state were considered inseparable in the Zoroastrian religion. However, it is this same relationship that caused the weakening of the Empire, when each group tried to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> power onto the other. Disagreements between the priests and the warriors led to fragmentation within the empire, which led to its downfall.|$|E
25|$|Arwa al-Sulayhi {{is still}} {{remembered as a}} great and much loved sovereign, as attested in Yemeni historiography, literature, and popular lore, where she is {{referred}} to as Balqis al-sughra ("the junior queen of Sheba"). Although the Sulayhids were Ismaili, they never tried to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> beliefs on the public. Shortly after Queen Arwa's death, the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines. The Ayyubid dynasty overthrew the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt. A few years after their rise to power, Saladin dispatched his brother Turan Shah to conquer Yemen in 1174.|$|E
25|$|Bahá'í law limits {{permissible}} {{sexual relations}} to those {{between a man}} and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain from sex outside matrimony. Bahá'ís do not, however, attempt to <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> moral standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality, whether sexual or otherwise, the Bahá’í teachings also take account of human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be contrary to the spirit of the Bahá’í teachings.|$|E

50|$|In {{the modern}} trade arena many other {{initiatives}} besides tariffs {{have been called}} protectionist.
