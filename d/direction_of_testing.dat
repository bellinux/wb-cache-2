Relief of sigma in three aging conditions could be related to structural relaxation.

40|$|Across four experiments, {{this study}} {{investigated}} direction-specific adaptation and simultaneous contrast induced by moving binocular disparity information (stereoscopic motion). The stimuli were moving arrays of stereoscopic dots created from dynamic random-element stereograms. Experiments 1 and 2 {{examined the effects of}} adaptation to motion in a given direction on the apparent <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> motion. Results showed that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> motion appeared repulsed away from the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> adapting motion (repulsion aftereffect) by as much as 20 deg or more when <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> adapt and <b>test</b> were similar. Experiment 3 investigated transfer of the repulsion aftereffect across the stereoscopic and luminance domains by employing stereoscopic adapting motion and luminance test motion or vice versa. Results showed that the repulsion aftereffect transferred across the two stimulus domains. Experiment 4 investigated direction-specific contrast by measuring the perceived <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> two stereoscopic arrays presented simultaneously and moving in different directions. Results showed that the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the arrays appeared repulsed away from one another when their directions were similar. Taken together, these results suggest that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> stereoscopic motion is coded in the activity of directionally selective mechanisms, as is the case for luminance-domain motion. Transfer of the repulsion aftereffect between stereoscopic and luminance domains indicates the two kinds of motion perception are mediated by a common substrate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In this study, {{cubes of}} trabecular bone {{with a wide}} range of {{structural}} properties were scanned on a micro-computed tomography system to produce complete three-dimensional digitizations from which morphological and architectural parameters could be measured in a nondestructive manner. The cubes were then mechanically tested in uniaxial compression in three orthogonal directions and to failure in one direction to find the orthogonal tangent elastic moduli and ultimate strengths. After testing, the cubes were weighed and ashed to determine the apparent and ash densities. A high correlation between the basic stereologic measurements was found, indicating that there is a relationship between the amount of bone and number of trabeculae in cancellous bone. Regression analysis was used to estimate the modulus and ultimate strength; these regressions accounted for 68 - 90 % of the variance in these measures. These relationships were dependent on the metaphyseal type and donor, with the modulus also dependent on the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> This indicates that the properties of the individual trabeculae, as well as their amount and organization, may be important in predicting the mechanical properties of cancellous bone...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWood {{maintains}} remarkable durability under optimum conditions. However, it erodes {{faster than}} other construction {{materials in the}} circumstances of average usage of civil structures. Therefore, built features made of wood, especially historical features and structures, require repairs and reinforcements more frequently than those made of other materials. Non-destructive testing is usually carried out in structures that are currently in use and is aimed at early detection of failures and taking appropriate remedial measures. It can be generally assumed that diagnostic <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> wood is a difficult process due to its structure. However, the ability to identify the current strength parameters of wooden structural components {{makes it possible to}} properly assess their suitability for further use and design appropriate reinforcement and reconstruction methods. However, {{it should be noted that}} non-destructive test results are influenced by many factors such as: the type of wood, its defects, moisture content, age and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> in relation to annual growth rings as well as microbial agents. This paper addresses the evaluation of the mechanical properties of pine wood under testing perpendicular, vertical and diagonal to the annual growth rings. Furthermore, the paper presents problems related to <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> content on the results <b>of</b> non-destructive <b>testing</b> (sclerometer, ultrasonic tests and cutting resistance measurements). Based on the survey, it was found that the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> <b>direction</b> with respect to the annual growth rings must be taken into account in the course of the analysis using non-destructive methods...|$|R

Reducing the raw data from this technique was {{complicated by the fact}} that the skin is already biaxially loaded in the natural state and a rational basis on which to compare results obtained from different subjects was not available. Using a strain gauged pretension device, a procedure for determining the natural state tension and extension fields in the skin has been developed. The natural tension was then relaxed in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> and the suction device used to determine the two-dimensional skin tension-extension ratio response of the skin at a constant testing rate. The data from a number of subjects have been used to develop a new multidimensional stress-strain theory hi terms of two material constants that are related to basic material characteristics of the dermis and are uniquely determinable regardless of the natural state stress field. Tests performed on the upper backs of 23 healthy adult males were used to investigate the variations in the material constants with age and sun-exposure habits. Age variations were found to corroborate earlier studies, and variations with sun exposure habits were related to known dermal collagen and elastin changes due to ultraviolet radiation.

We investigated whether the surface of the blind spot is filled in with the average <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding local motions. To test this, we varied the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) both in adaptation and test. Motion aftereffects (MAE) were defined as the difference of motion coherence thresholds between with and without adaptation. The participants were initially adapted to an annular RDK surrounding the blind spot for 30 s in their dominant eyes. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> each dot in this RDK was selected equally and randomly from either a normal distribution with the mean of 15 ° clockwise from vertical, 15 ° counterclockwise from vertical, or from the mixture of them. Immediately after the adaptation, a disk-shaped test RDK was presented for 1 s to the corresponding blind-spot location in the opposite eye. This RDK moved either 15 ° clockwise, 15 ° counterclockwise, or vertically (the average <b>of</b> the two <b>directions).</b> The participants' task was to discriminate the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> RDK across different coherence levels. We found significant MAE when the test RDK had the same directions as the adaptor. More importantly, equally strong MAE was observed even when the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> RDK was vertical, which was not physically present during adaptation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{the use of}} {{woven fabric}} {{composites}} increases, understanding their elastic behavior is essential. For this study, an experimental approach was undertaken to determine the elastic properties of a woven fabric composite, {{with a focus on}} determining stiffness coupling terms that are often neglected in analytical and FEA models. Specimens were fabricated with a 5 -harness satin-weave carbon– epoxy composite and were subjected to three loading conditions: tension, bending, and torsion. The approach taken to calculate the stiffness (or compliance) matrix terms is presented, along with symmetry properties that provide some relationships between these terms. The results indicate that the minor coupling terms are difficult to quantify due to the small strains that need to be measured. The results indicate that the minor coupling terms are very sensitive to fiber misalignment. Careful fiber alignment along the longitudinal (warp) <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> coupons gives coupling terms corresponding to that direction which are much less sensitive to the fiber misalignment. The major in-plane and out-of-plane compliance terms were also measured by the tests conducted.
