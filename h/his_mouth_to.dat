25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E

500|$|During the offseasons, Bostic was {{a regular}} on the Oilers' summer {{basketball}} team that traveled around the state raising money for charities by playing various local All-star teams. After the team's twelfth season, Bostic {{had a reputation as}} the best player ever to play for the team. [...] During one NFL training camp Bostic played with tape over <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> try to win a $20 bet with Steve Brown over who could keep from talking the longest.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic later {{noted that}} {{recording}} the song's vocals was particularly difficult, {{because he was}} singing [...] "for eight to 12 hours a day", which caused strain on his vocal cords. For the verse where Yankovic mumbles the lyrics to the song, he placed several cookies in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> achieve the garbled effect. During the parody's musical interlude, Yankovic gargled water {{to the tune of}} the original's guitar solo. The solo also features kazoos and a tuba, with the latter being played by Tommy Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Kabuto is the titular {{creature}} of the game, {{and the only one}} of his race. In his back-story, the Reapers created him as their guardian, but found him beyond control. Creative Director, Tim Williams gave the [...] "Citizen" [...] title to Kabuto for its allusion to the character's wish for a sense of belonging to the Island. The game developer modeled Kabuto's attacks after those of giant monsters in classic monster movies, allowing him to use professional wrestling attacks and aerial techniques such as elbow drops, foot stomps, and the [...] "butt flop" [...] described as [...] "like the body slam, but with less dignity". To balance his strength, a weak point at his waist inflicts heavy damage when struck. Players playing the giant monster can assume a perspective through <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> target prey.|$|E

500|$|The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch horror film written, directed, and co-produced by Tom Six. The film {{tells the}} story of a German surgeon who kidnaps three {{tourists}} and joins them surgically, mouth to anus, forming a [...] "human centipede", a conjoined triplet. It stars Dieter Laser as the creator of the centipede, Dr. Josef Heiter, with Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura as his victims. According to Six, the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing a child molester by stitching <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the anus of a [...] "fat truck driver". Inspiration for the film also came from Nazi medical experiments carried out during World War II, such as the crimes of Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
500|$|Rufus is {{depicted}} as a large, heavily obese blond male. His head is mostly bald, with a long braided ponytail jutting from the top, and a mustache extending {{down the sides of}} <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> his chin. His clothing consists of a yellow and black sleeveless jumpsuit with padded shoulders, with the closing straps left open due to his girth and exposing the center of his torso and lower abdominal hair. Black shoes cover his feet, while black fingerless gloves cover his hands and most of his forearms. His secondary outfit is similar, changing the jumpsuit to a dark blue and green version with sleeves and a raised collar, additionally removing the gloves and changing his hairstyle to a double ponytail. Other alternate designs were considered but rejected, amongst which included an Elvis impersonator appearance and martial artist attire. Rufus stands [...] tall, and weighs [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director Tom Six once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the anus of an overweight truck driver. Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, {{and he began to}} develop the idea. He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese horror films. Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over [...] "unbelievable" [...] monster films, and said that he gets [...] "a rash from too much political correctness." [...] Major influences for The Human Centipede were Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial 1975 Italian drama film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike. Six has also expressed his love of the works of David Lynch. Further inspiration came from Six's previous work as a director on the Dutch series of Big Brother, where {{he had been able to}} observe people who [...] "did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched." ...|$|E

500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{on the high seas}} in the Caribbean during the 17th century during a {{conflict}} among colonists. When a major event occurs, Mike hears the sound of a typewriter in the sky. Mike's reality literally changes each time the author makes a change to the story. Mike realizes that during times when he hears the audible sounds of the typewriter, his actions and words are not of his own volition, and when such sounds are absent he is able to make decisions for himself. Mike {{falls in love with a}} woman in the story, and grows frustrated after realizing that she is just another of Hackett's fictional creations. At the end of the work, Mike returns to New York, and is left with lingering doubts whether he is still a character in someone else's story. He muses whether a [...] "typewriter in the sky" [...] is creating the world. Mike looks up into the sky in search of this mystical device or its controller: [...] "Abruptly Mike de Wolfe stopped. His jaw slackened a trifle and his hand went up to <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> cover it. His eyes were fixed upon the fleecy clouds which scurried across the moon. Up there– God?

2500|$|The {{most common}} tale that biographers tell {{is the story}} of Armstrong as a young boy dancing for pennies in the streets of New Orleans, who would scoop up the coins off of the streets and stick them into <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> avoid having the bigger {{children}} steal them from him. Someone dubbed him [...] "satchel mouth" [...] for his mouth acting as a satchel. Another tale is that because of his large mouth, he was nicknamed [...] "satchel mouth" [...] which became shortened to Satchmo.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{characters}} included: ageing rock-and-roller Sid Snot, unsuccessfully flipping cigarettes {{into his}} mouth – at one point Everett managed to catch one in <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>to</b> the amusement of the studio crew; Marcel Wave, a lecherous Frenchman played by Everett wearing an absurdly false latex chin; and [...] "Angry of Mayfair", an upper middle class City gent complaining of the risqué content of the show, banging the camera's lens hood with his umbrella, and then storming off, turning his back to us, only then to be revealed as wearing women's underwear {{in lieu of the}} entire back half of his suit.|$|E
5000|$|Like the komainu ("lion dogs"), the shisa are a {{variation}} of the guardian lions ("fu dogs") from China. From the Edo period, they started to be called [...] "guardian dogs" [...] in general in mainland Japan. Gender is variously assigned to the shisa. Some Okinawans believe the male has <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> closed <b>to</b> keep bad out of the home, while the female has her <b>mouth</b> open <b>to</b> share goodness. Others believe the female has her <b>mouth</b> closed <b>to</b> [...] "keep in the good", while the male has <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> open <b>to</b> [...] "scare away the bad". (Compare this to the distinction between male and female guardian lions in Chinese culture.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Looking {{over his}} right shoulder, and [...] {{bringing}} {{his head into}} line with the blast hole, Gage opened <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak; in that same instant the tamping iron sparked against the rock and (possibly because the sand had been omitted) the powder exploded. Rocketed from the hole, the tamping iron in diameter, [...] long, and weighing entered {{the left side of}} Gage's face in an upward direction, just forward of the angle of the lower jaw. Continuing upward outside the upper jaw and possibly fracturing the cheekbone, it passed behind the left eye, through {{the left side of the}} brain, and out the top of the skull through the frontal bone.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are widely}} {{contrasting}} views about Brown's personality. He was well-liked in Australia when he captained England there in 1950–51 as recorded by O'Reilly (see above). According to Kay, Brown had a hearty appetite {{for food and}} drink and was combative and forceful by nature, which endeared him to the Australian public. Jack Fingleton commented: [...] "With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> make him look like the original Farmer Brown". On the other hand, professional players viewed Brown's silk neckerchief with contempt as it [...] "enhanced {{the impression of a}} bumptious windbag". Brown was considered [...] "a bully who preyed on weakness or quirk of character".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, a {{prisoner}} accused Graner {{and three other}} guards of planting a razor blade in his food, causing <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> bleed when he ate it. The prisoner accused the guards of first ignoring his cries for help and then punching and kicking him when they {{took him to the}} nurse. Graner was accused of telling him to [...] "Shut up, nigger, before we kill you." [...] The allegations were denied; although a federal magistrate judge ruled that the charges had [...] "arguable merit in fact and law," [...] the case was dismissed when the prisoner disappeared after his release. Graner and four other guards were accused of beating another prisoner who had deliberately flooded his cell, taunting anti-capital punishment protesters, using racial epithets and telling a Muslim inmate he had rubbed pork all over his tray of food.|$|E

2500|$|By 1987, Abu Nidal {{had turned}} {{the full force of}} his {{paranoia}} and terror tactics inwards on the ANO itself. Members were routinely tortured by the [...] "Committee for Revolutionary Justice" [...] until they confessed to betrayal and disloyalty. Men would be hanged naked for hours and whipped until they lost consciousness, then revived with salt or chili powder rubbed into their wounds. A naked prisoner would be forced into a car tire with his legs and backside in the air, then whipped, wounded, and salted. Plastic melted under a flame would be dripped onto prisoners' skin. According to recruits who were able to escape, prisoners' genitals would be placed in skillets of boiling-hot oil and fried while the men were held down. Between interrogations, prisoners would be confined alone in tiny cells, bound hand and foot. If the cells were full, a prisoner might be buried alive, with a steel pipe in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> allow him to breathe. Water would be poured into it occasionally. When word came that Abu Nidal wanted the prisoner executed, a bullet would be fired down the tube instead, then the pipe removed and the hole filled in.|$|E
