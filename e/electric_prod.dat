5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or <b>electric</b> <b>prod,</b> on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E

50|$|In 2002 and 2003, they {{conducted}} a seven-month infiltration into rodeo in Ohio; according to MFA's website, their activists filmed animals being punched, kicked, shocked with <b>electric</b> <b>prods,</b> and beaten with iron rods.|$|R
5000|$|Cattle prods {{today are}} {{designed}} with a high range of voltages and amperages. If more powerful prods are applied continuously to the skin, the current (amperage) eventually causes heating, searing, burning, and scarring of skin at the contact point. <b>Electric</b> <b>prods</b> have found favour with torturers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>prods</b> {{have been}} used for the control of adverse self-injuring {{behavior}} in mentally handicapped people. This use is regarded by some advocates to be more effective than drugs since the experience of a shock is very short and temporary while using a drug may have long-lasting sedative effects.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2017, {{the animal}} rights {{organization}} Compassion Over Killing released undercover footage of {{cruelty to animals}} at Land O’Lakes supplier Mason Dixon Farms, which documented [...] "cows being kicked in the face, punched in their sensitive udders, excessively shocked with an <b>electric</b> <b>prod,</b> jabbed with a pens andor elbows, and having their tails twisted or bent by workers." [...] The footage resulted in the firing of one employee.|$|E
5000|$|Ranchers {{and farmers}} {{typically}} {{use the term}} [...] "cattle prods" [...] mainly to refer to simple non-electrified fiberglass or metal goads used to physically encourage cattle into motion; {{the majority of people}} living outside of rural areas use the term 'cattle prod' exclusively for the electrified variant. Most ranchers and farmers refer to electric cattle prods as [...] "hotshots" [...] (this {{is an example of a}} genericized trademark; one of the most prominent brands of <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> is Hot-Shot).|$|E
50|$|The picana is an <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> based {{originally}} on {{the cattle}} prod but {{designed specifically for}} human torture. It works at very high voltage and low current (amperage) so as to maximize pain and minimize the physical marks left on the victim. Among its advantages over other torture devices {{is that it is}} portable, easy to use, and allows the torturer to localize the electric shocks to the most sensitive places on the body, where they cause intense pain that can be repeated many times.|$|E
50|$|The Saudi National Guardsmen {{initially}} {{controlled the}} crowd {{through use of}} clubs and <b>electric</b> <b>prods,</b> which angered the crowd and was met by protesters throwing stones and wielding bars and wooden canes as weapons.

A company spokesperson dismissed PETA's concerns as [...] "Utopian philosophical ideology" [...] but said the circus would no longer use <b>electric</b> <b>prods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The game {{provides}} {{an array of}} collectible weapons, which automatically lock onto enemies. One of them, the Time Freeze Disruptor, can slow down the player's surroundings while he continues to move at regular speed (similar to bullet time). Most weapons rely on collectible ammo, but the <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> only needs to be charged by holding down the fire button before use.The game can be played alone or in co-op via Link Cable. The Link Cable also allows for a single-cartridge deathmatch with up to four players in a special arena.|$|E

Stealth was also a significant part of gameplay, as Vaughn could complete objectives easier by avoiding detection from guards and spotlights while inside enemy encampments. Vaughn could also use computer terminals located throughout the game to access security cameras for a better view of the area and nearby enemies.|$|E
50|$|James Serpell {{stated in}} his In the Company of Animals:"It is perhaps exaggerated to claim, as one author has, that the rodeo is 'the modern {{equivalent}} of the public hanging'. Nevertheless, these performances hinge on the violent subjugation of living animals, {{some of which are}} deliberately incited to frenzied violence by raking them with spurs, constricting the genital region with leather straps, or by thrusting an <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> into the rectal area. At the same time they are often given bogus, malevolent names in order to deflect sympathy from their plight. Occasionally, they are maimed or killed, and many are forced to undergo the same terrifying ordeal several times a day. Yet the rodeo is presented to the American public as a harmless, red-blooded entertainment in which the cowboy - the epitome of wholesome, manly virtue - uses his courage and skill to overcome and subdue untamable, outlaw stock. Doubtless, the Romans employed similar fantasies to justify their activities in the Circus Maximus.|$|E

50|$|Patti {{was born}} in rural Baigorrita, Buenos Aires Province, and as a child worked in a bakery. He entered the Buenos Aires Provincial Police Academy at 16 years old and was first {{stationed}} to the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires around Pilar and Belén de Escobar. Accusations against him date back to his early years in the force, a period of political instability and tough police action against guerillas, dissidents and other activities. He was accused in a local newspaper in 1973 of killing three youths wrongly believed to have committed a crime. Patti was tried for the torture of a prisoner in 1976, but the trial was suspended and not resumed before the time limit. In 1983 he faced two further trials, including for the kidnapping and murder of Osvaldo Cambiasso and Eduardo Pereyra Rossi. Again both trials were suspended. He rose through the ranks to become a police inspector and commisar and was decorated. In 1990 he faced accusations of torturing two alleged thieves with an <b>electric</b> <b>prod.</b>|$|E
50|$|Zelda DuBois, born in Darlington, South Carolina, {{developed}} an {{act as a}} snake charmer and circus performer using a twenty-five foot python as a young adult. Presumably, she joined the Circus of Crime in its early days but isn't actually seen as a professional criminal until {{the formation of the}} Masters of Menace. It is, in fact, the Princess who convinces the others {{to get rid of the}} Ringmaster, appoint the Clown as the leader, rename the group (she comes up with the name), and go out on a crime spree of their own. The Masters of Menace steal paintings from a Madison Avenue Art Gallery where they run afoul of Spider-Man. However, the web-slinger is unwilling to hit a woman and turns out to be putty in Zelda's hands. She tries to remove his mask but he stops her in time. She maneuvers the wall-crawler into a fight with her pet after jamming his web shooters with an <b>electric</b> <b>prod,</b> but is defeated when Spider-Man tricks the python into a knot and maneuvers her into the arms of the law.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, a number of cities and states, mostly in {{the eastern half of}} the United States, have passed ordinances and laws governing rodeo.

5000|$|The chapter {{starts with}} the Seance inside of a {{television}} left on by the obese Spaceboy, who is asleep on the couch. The Seance is trying to tell Spaceboy {{about what happened to}} him (being captured and how he will kill him). The television then breaks and Spaceboy wakes up. The Seance was communicating with Spaceboy through the television and Hazel and Cha-Cha found out, breaking the television. Cha-Cha then, after some words about the Seance's shoes and powers are exchanged by the three, puts a gun to the Seance's head. The Seance tries to pay his way out of his situation with money or [...] "hooker amputees," [...] but Hazel and Cha-Cha state that they have all they want, that is, the nukes referred to in the first issue's flashback. Then, after discussing how the nukes were found and the plans that Hazel and Cha-Cha had for finding 00.05, Hazel shoots the Seance. 00.05 starts to tell the Rumor about his time in the future in which he left out major details. During his travel back to the present he was captured by the Temps Aeternalis, an agency that preserves the time continuum and recruits [...] "anomalies," [...] like 00.05, and puts them to work. He was changed through numerous surgeries and training, which explains much of the skills and other abilities he acquires through the series. 00.05 was considered the best and was specially trained by a Shubukin Goldfish (Carmichael) with a genius-level intellect to handle specific individuals. 00.05 was then assigned to assassinate President Kennedy but rebelled. Spaceboy flies to where the Seance was held and finds him dead. An <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> handled by Hazel shocks Spaceboy, believing that it killed him. The Seance, on the other hand, is seen in a perception of Heaven with a figure implied to be God, who is depicted as a cowboy. The cowboy implies that the Umbrella Academy are a modern day incarnation of the Messiah and tells Klaus that he is to return to Earth and to [...] "Stop being such a fairy and kill those two sons o' bitches." [...] 00.05's commanding officer and trainer, Carmichael (the Shubukin Goldfish), appears talk with 00.05. 00.05 threatens his former officer that is until he states that he has his biological mother in the eyes of two agents that can kill her if he doesn't finish The Kennedy Assassination. Allison is invited to travel along but writes [...] "And why should I care what happens to this little jerk?" [...] Carmichael responds by informing them that 00.05's biological mother has twins, implying that Allison may be, in fact, 00.05's biological sister.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTDespite {{increasing}} {{public scrutiny}} of practices used in raising animals for food, {{there is little}} readily available information about how cattle handling is managed in feedyards. The {{purpose of this study}} was to score cattle handling in commercial feedyards using the most widely adopted program for managing cattle handling, and to make these scores available as evidence of producer commitment to proper care and handling of cattle. Our objectives were to estimate compliance with the Beef Quality Assurance Feedyard Assessment (BQA FA) for cattle handling, to validate 6 cattle handling categories of the BQA FA, and to document management practices and elements of facility design. Categories scored were <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> use; chute operation; rates of cattle vocalizing, stumbling, and falling; and rate of cattle jumping and running. This study compiles findings for cattle handling scores in commercial feedlots using the BQA FA. Of 28 sites, average scores were in compliance with BQA FA for the following 4 categories: <b>electric</b> <b>prod</b> use, vocalization, stumbling, and falling. For the following 2 categories, average scores were not in compliance: a score of 4. 2 % versus the target of 0 % was recorded for cattle caught improperly in the squeeze chute; and a score of 52 % versus the target of 25 % was recorded for cattle that jumped or ran from the squeeze chute exit. All but one site exceeded this target. Curved crowd systems were recorded for 89 % of feedyards, 11 % used Bud Box systems, and 78. 5 % had rubber mats at the squeeze chute exit...|$|E
