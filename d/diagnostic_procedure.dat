25|$|Psychiatric diagnoses {{take place}} {{in a wide variety of}} {{settings}} and are performed by many different health professionals. Therefore, the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered. In some cases, a brain scan might be used to rule out other medical illnesses, but at this time relying on brain scans alone cannot accurately diagnose a mental illness or tell the risk of getting a mental illness in the future. A few psychiatrists are beginning to utilize genetics during the diagnostic process but on the whole this remains a research topic.|$|E

25|$|The {{entry of}} {{tryptophan}} {{to the brain}} is crucial in the proper synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. One way to acutely cause depression or bulimia or anxiety in humans, {{in order to assess}} an individual's vulnerability to those disorders, is to supplement with a formula with all or most amino acids except tryptophan. The protein synthesis elicited by the amino acids leads circulating amino acids, including tryptophan, to be incorporated into proteins. Tryptophan thus lowers in the brain {{as a result of the}} protein synthesis enhancement (causing circulating tryptophan to lower more than other amino acids), and perhaps also competition of large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood–brain barrier through the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LNAA1). The consequence is acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in the brain and a consecutive lowering of serotonin synthesis. ATD, which is basically a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure,</b> is not a treatment for GA1.|$|E
25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and nasopharynx. The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an endoscope (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin urologist Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the tungsten filament incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E

2500|$|Arthroscopy of the {{temporomandibular}} joint {{is sometimes}} used {{as either a}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> for symptoms and signs related to these joints, or as a therapeutic measure [...] in conditions like temporomandibular joint dysfunction. TMJ arthroscopy can be a purely <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure,</b> or it can have its own beneficial effects which may result from washing out of the joint during the procedure, thought to remove debris and inflammatory mediators, and may enable a displaced disc to return to its correct position. Arthroscopy {{is also used to}} visualize the inside of the joint during certain surgical procedures involving the articular disc or the articular surfaces, similar to laparoscopy. Examples include release of adhesions (e.g., by blunt dissection or with a laser) or release of the disc. Biopsies or disc reduction can also be carried out during arthroscopy. It is carried out under general anesthetic.|$|E
2500|$|R.D. Laing {{argued that}} {{attributing}} mental disorders to biophysical factors was often flawed {{due to the}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure.</b> The [...] "complaint" [...] is often made by a family member, not the patient, the [...] "history" [...] provided by someone other than patient, and the [...] "examination" [...] consists of observing strange, incomprehensible behavior. Ancillary tests (EEG, PET) are often done after diagnosis, when treatment has begun, which makes the tests non-blind and incurs possible confirmation bias. The psychiatrist Thomas Szasz commented frequently on {{the limitations of the}} medical approach to psychiatry and argued that mental illnesses are medicalized problems in living.|$|E
2500|$|Colposcopy ( [...] + skopos [...] "look at") is {{a medical}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> to examine an illuminated, {{magnified}} view of the cervix and the tissues of the vagina and vulva. Many premalignant lesions and malignant lesions in these areas have discernible characteristics which can be detected through the examination. It is done using a colposcope, which provides an enlarged view of the areas, allowing the colposcopist to visually distinguish normal from abnormal appearing tissue and take directed biopsies for further pathological examination. The main goal of colposcopy is to prevent cervical cancer by detecting precancerous lesions early and treating them. The procedure {{was developed by the}} German physician Hans Hinselmann, with help from Eduard Wirths. The procedure involved female Jewish inmates from Auschwitz.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Mayo Clinic {{researchers}} identified an humoral mechanism, targeting a perivascular protein, as {{the culprit}} for NMO and in 2004 an unknown specific autoantibody was found. In 2005 they identified the aquaporin 4 protein as {{the target of}} the disease, and developed a test to aid in the diagnosis of Devic's disease by detection of an antibody, NMO-IgG, in the blood. Some patients with NMO may be seronegative for NMO-IgG, whilst some patients with NMO-IgG may still not fulfill clinical criteria for NMO thus serological testing is now an important part [...] of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> and seropositive and seronegative cases are described {{in a manner similar to}} myasthenia gravis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abnormal vaginal {{bleeding}} (AVB) {{in women}} of reproductive {{age is a}} common reason for consulting a general practitioner. Nevertheless, how general practitioners (GPs) choose to initially manage AVB is largely unknown, as is the prevalence of underlying pathology of AVB in primary care. METHODS: To investigate the initial <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> and treatment for AVB used in general practice, we performed a descriptive study based on computerised medical records. New consultations for AVB in 2000 and 2001 were selected. Patient characteristics, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> and treatment were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 270 new consultations were included. The majority of patients (75 %) consulted the GP for AVB only once. GPs performed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> in 54 % of all consultations. Overall, additional <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> revealed abnormalities in 11 % of women. However, the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> implemented by the GPs varied widely per bleeding type and contraceptive use. Anaemia was found in 36 % of 45 women tested. Uterine fibroids were found in 41 % of 27 women examined by ultrasound. Medication was prescribed in 34 % of all consultations. A gynaecological referral was registered in 4 % of all contacts. CONCLUSION: Initially, GPs tend to follow a policy of expectant management in women of reproductive age with AVB. However, when additional <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> were performed, anaemia and uterine fibroids were found in {{a considerable number of}} wome...|$|R
