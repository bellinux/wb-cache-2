40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} {{some aspects of}} the goffmanian and kouryanian {{conceptual}} schemes while theoretical and methodological tools for the discussion of ethnographic experience accumulated in a suburb of the city of João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil. In this sense, the everyday interactions of neighbors, friends and relatives in the neighborhood of Varjão/Rangel, which is characterized by intense co-presence, by the ambiguous and ambivalent identity of the neighborhood resident, and by a stigmatizing and moralizing pressure from the excluding and hierarchical sociability city of João Pessoa, are analyzed, among others, based on the concepts <b>of</b> <b>footing,</b> embedding, <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> experience, but also on the concepts of trust, everyday fears, daily shame and resentment. It is thus an analytical effort situated within the Anthropology of Emotions in a symbolic-interactionist perspective, whose theoretical and methodological proposal aims to be understood, based on the emotions as a central analytical category for the questioning of the individual – society tension, of relevant issues of sociability, and of the emotional culture and morals codes from an specific interactional space...|$|R

The mill's equipment included three sets of stamps and three sets of auxiliary crushing rolls. The stamps each had a capacity of 500 tons daily.

40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of conceptualizations of style shifting as a reactive phenomenon, conditioned by contextual factors such as formality and audience, style shifting increasingly {{has come to be}} viewed as a proactive phenomenon which speakers freely use to shape and re-shape context, as well as their personal and interpersonal identities (e. g. California Style Collective 1993, Coupland forthcoming). In this presentation, we suggest that an explanation for style shifting based on the interactional sociolinguistic notions <b>of</b> <b>footing</b> and <b>frame</b> indexing (e. g.

5000|$|The 3B (3B20D/3B20C/3B21D/3B21E) is a 32-bit microprogrammed duplex (redundant) high {{availability}} processor unit with a real-time operating system. It {{is used in}} the telecommunications environment and was first produced in the late 1970s at the WECo factory in Lisle, Illinois. It uses the Duplex Multi Environment Real Time (DMERT) operating system which was renamed UNIX-RTR (Real Time Reliable) in 1982. The Data Manipulation Unit (DMU) provided arithmetic and logic operations on 32 bit words using AMD 2901 bipolar 4-bit processor elements. The first 3B20D was called the Model 1. Each processor's control unit consisted <b>of</b> two <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> circuit packs. The whole duplex system required many seven <b>foot</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> circuit packs plus at least one tape drive frame (most telephone companies wrote billing data on magnetic tapes), and many washing machine sized (and look with the open top door) disk drives. For training and lab purposes a 3B20D could be divided into two [...] "half-duplex" [...] systems. A 3B20S consisted of most of the same hardware as a half-duplex but used a completely different operating system.|$|R

The easternmost of the two holes, Felderhoff-Federal 5 - 1, encountered about 200 <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> alluvium, underlain by 305 <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> basalt breccia and basalt, about 345 <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> probable Tertiary tuffaceous sedimentary rocks, and 616 <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> dense limestone and dolomite of uncertain age.

The two drill holes are located within a northerly trending fault zone defined largely by geophysical data; this fault zone lies along the east side of a major rift containing many small basalt eruptive centers and, farther north, several caldera complexes. Drill hole 25 - 1 penetrated an inverted paleozoic rock sequence; drill hole 5 - 1 encountered two large cavities 24 -inches wide or more in dense carbonate rock of uncertain, but probable Paleozoic age.

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to ease the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> is to first construct local components and then build a global frame from these. In this paper we will show {{that the study of}} the relation between a frame and its local components leads to the definition <b>of</b> a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. We introduce this new notion and prove that it provides us with the link we need. It will also turn out that <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces behave as a generalization <b>of</b> <b>frames.</b> In particular, we can define an analysis, a synthesis and a frame operator for a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, which even yield a reconstruction formula. Also concepts such as completeness, minimality, and exactness are introduced and investigated. We further study several constructions <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, and also <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> and Riesz frames using the theory <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. An important special case are harmonic <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces which generalize harmonic frames. We show that wavelet subspaces coming from multiresolution analysis belong to this class.
