40|$|Following the {{development}} of highly effective <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antiviral (DAA) <b>compounds</b> {{for the treatment of}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), WHO has set out plans for disease eradication by 2030. Many barriers must be surmounted before this can be achieved, including buy-in from governments and policy makers, reduced drug costs, and improved infrastructure for the pathway from diagnosis to treatment. A comprehensive set of guidelines was produced by WHO in 2014, updated in 2016, and they are due to be revised later this year...|$|R

In the canine model the rate of formation of methemoglobin in vitro is similar to the rate of methemoglobin formation obtained during rapid intravenous infusion. The in vitro addition of <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> p-aminopropiophenone derivatives to blood obtained from unanesthetized dogs forms methemoglobin at rates similar to the intravenous infusion of the same compounds in the same dogs. These studies demonstrate that in vitro addition of compounds to whole blood can be used to rapidly obtain an estimate of the rate of forzm 3 tion of methemoglobin and the approximate whole blood concentration of an unknown compound required to induce desired levels of methemoglobin.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of latently HIV-infected cells in patients under combined anti-retroviral treatment (cART) remains the major hurdle for HIV eradication. Thus far, individual compounds {{have not been}} sufficiently potent to reactivate latent virus and guarantee its elimination in vivo Thus, we hypothesized that transcriptional enhancers, in concert with compounds triggering the innate immune system, are more efficient in reversing latency by creating a Th 1 supportive milieu that acts against latently HIV-infected cells at various levels. To test our hypothesis, we screened six compounds on a co-culture of latently infected cells (J-lat) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). The PKC agonist, Prostratin, with a TLR 8 agonist, resulted in greater reversion of HIV latency than any single compound. This combinatorial approach led to a drastic phenotypic and functional maturation of the MDDCs. TNF and cell-cell interactions were crucial for the greater reversion observed. Similarly, we found a greater potency of the combination of Prostratin/TLR 8 agonist in reversing HIV latency when applying it to primary cells of HIV-infected patients. Thus, we demonstrated here the synergistic interplay between TLR 8 -matured MDDCs and <b>compounds</b> <b>acting</b> directly on latently HIV-infected cells, targeting different mechanisms of latency, by triggering various signaling pathways. Moreover, TLR 8 triggering may reverse exhaustion of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes that might be essential for killing or constraining the latently infected cells. IMPORTANCE Curing HIV is the Holy Grail. The so-called "shock and kill strategy" relies on drug-mediated reversion of HIV latency and the subsequent death of those cells under combined anti-retroviral treatment. So far, no compound achieves efficient reversal of latency nor eliminates this latent reservoir. The compounds may not target all of the latency mechanisms in all latently infected cells. Moreover, HIV-associated exhaustion {{of the immune system}} hinders the efficient elimination of the reactivated cells. In this study, we demonstrated synergistic latency reversion by combining agonists for protein kinase C and toll-like receptor 8 in a co-culture of latently infected cells with myeloid dendritic cells. The drug Prostratin stimulates directly the transcriptional machinery of latently infected cells and the TLR 8 agonist acts indirectly by maturing dendritic cells. These findings highlight the importance of the immune system and its activation, in combination with <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> <b>compounds,</b> to reverse latency...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 120 - 130 million {{individuals}} are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, {{although it is}} curable by therapy. Until recently, treatment of chronic hepatitis C {{was based on the}} combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. A number of models have been developed to study the HCV lifecycle and screen for potential HCV inhibitors. They {{led to the development of}} antiviral agents that specifically target a viral function (<b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals), and host-targeted agents that inhibit HCV replication. <b>Direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals in clinical development include NS 3 - 4 A protease inhibitors (two of which, telaprevir and boceprevir, have recently been approved for treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in combination with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin), nucleoside/nucleotide analogue and non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and NS 5 A inhibitors.
