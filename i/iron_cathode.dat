40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{cost and}} ohmic loss are two issues that {{microbial}} fuel cells (MFC) face before becoming economically viable. To address {{the high cost}} and ohmic loss issues, a flat-plate MFC (FPMFC) configuration applying a passive air-breathing cathode and a three-dimensional anode was introduced. Electricity generation was examined in the FPMFC through operation in the presence and absence of a proton exchange membrane (PEM), and in batch and continuous modes. RESULTS: Continuous operation of the FPMFC {{in the presence of}} a PEM favored power generation, mainly due to elimination of oxygen and biomass in the anode. Peak power density of 18 Wm- 3 was produced {{in the presence of a}} PEM (ohmic resistance 40 3 ̆a 9 cm 2), which was more than 5 -fold higher than that with J-cloth. During batch operation, the power density increased and reached maximum in the third batch (18 W m- 3 at 60 A m- 3). Greater stability was observed during continuous operation resulting in a 2. 5 -fold increase in peak power density (44 W m- 3 at 146 A m- 3).

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} the {{treatment}} of an industrial wastewater containing Cr (VI) by electrocoagulation using Al or Fe electrodes, in a discontinuous system with forced recirculation of the solution. Treatment of the waste impurities is achieved by electrocoagulation whereas Cr (VI) removal requires its reduction to Cr (III) prior to precipitation {{in the form of}} neutral hydroxide. The speciation of the various trivalent species, namely Cr (III), Fe (III) and Al (III) was investigated to determine the optimal pH range for treatment of Cr-containing wastes by using Al or Fe electrodes. With aluminium electrodes, the presence of Cr (VI) does not affect the COD abatement. Moreover Cr (VI) species was observed to be faster removed from the wastewater with higher current densities. However it was shown that the occurrence of the direct electrochemical reduction of Cr (VI) at the Al cathode surface, does not suffice to predict the experimental reduction rates. With Fe electrodes, COD abatement by electrocoagulation is retarded by the presence of Cr (VI), whereas the rate of iron dissolution is unaffected by chromate in the wastewater. The observed difference in the COD abatement rates suggests that the removal of generated Cr (III) by precipitation might be assisted by the presence of coagulant Fe(OH) 3. Removal of Cr (VI) from the wastewater in the cell could be successfully modelled taking into account the chemical reaction with electrogenerated Fe (II), its side oxidation by air oxygen, and the electrochemical reduction of Cr (VI) at the <b>iron</b> <b>cathode...</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Steel {{corrosion}} in {{reinforced concrete}} {{is a major}} concern to transportation agencies nationwide because of the expenses incurred for repair and ultimate shortening of bridge life. Cathodic protection (CP), as a remedy, has been applied to reinforced bridges in the US since 1974. However, application of this technique is largely empirical, lacking fundamental understanding. In order to optimize the performance of a CP system, it is important to monitor the rebar potential with respect to a reliable reference electrode. Moreover, because of potential variation in the concrete, reference cell placement is fundamental to ensure effective protection. The work plan was divided into two parts: laboratory scale experimentation and computer simulation. In the experimentation section, the response of graphite probes was compared to that of an Orion silver-silver chloride electrode. Graphite probes behaved as well as the standard electrode. Furthermore, the home-made graphite probes behaved the same as the commercial ones. This will allow much greater experimental latitude since the home-made probes are much more economical than the commercial ones. A finite difference code was developed to assess the performance of cathodic protection. The potential distribution in a two dimensional geometry of a concrete block with a sprayed zinc anode at one boundary and an <b>iron</b> <b>cathode</b> at the other side was calculated under cathodic protection. The equations were solved by means of a Gauss-Seidel iterative method {{with the help of an}} overrelaxation factor. An interval halving method was used to solve for nonlinear boundary condition at the iron. The effects of concrete pore saturation, concrete cover, and applied potential were studied to determine the degree of protection and proper placement of the reference electrode in concrete. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed versus input parameters: concrete conductivity, oxygen mass transfer coefficient, and oxygen reduction polarization parameters. The results of the simulation showed that the center of the rebar is less protected than the other locations. Therefore, the reference electrode should be located as close to the center as possible...|$|E
40|$|The cathode {{process of}} {{hydrogen}} evolution in chlorate cells, including possible depolarization, {{has not been}} studied to date. High hydrogen polariza-tion at graphite electrodes delayed the industrial application of bipolar cells for more than 80 years. A new method of depolarization has been developed which consists of depositing on the cathode side of a graphite electrode metallic chromium and/or an addition of small amounts of molybdate. The finely divided cathode molybdenum deposit decreases the cathode polarization for the hydrogen evolution reaction (h. e. r.) ~ The Tafel lines obtained on metallized graphite exhibit nearly the same slopes as the ones for the parent metals, but are shifted to more positive values. This represents a further ex-tension of the methods for depolarized hydrogen cathode evolution with metallized graphite (8, 9). Bipolar chlorate cells have found recent acceptance in industry because of their high permissible current densities, low potential drops in the electrodes, simple design, and high capacity (1, 2). The bipolar construc-tion of the cell allows copper bus bars and their con-nections to graphite lectrodes to be almost completely eliminated (except {{for the first and}} the last electrode connection). Thus, contact resistances are practically avoided. However, the higher the current density, the higher is the electrode polarization, especially at graphite electrodes.
