Writing for the Daily Mail, George Stark commented that perhaps the clip [...] "might enjoy a new lease of life". According to Sam Lansky for Idolator, the video's message is a [...] "soulful, and completely inexplicable, letter to her fans thanking them for their undying love". Malene Arpe for the Toronto Star was positive toward the clip, calling it a [...] "perfect antidote to a week {{of thinking about the}} Miley Cyrus/Robin Thicke porn circus". She continued, [...] "Aguilera's new video is so sweet and innocent and full of goodwill towards humanity, it will make you <b>forget</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> twerking and foam fingers and the inherent greasiness of Robin Thicke".

"The great {{quantity}} {{of guns and}} powder which the Europeans have brought have caused terrible wars between the Kings and Princes and Caboceers of these lands, who made their prisoners of war slaves; these slaves were immediately bought up by Europeans at steadily increasing prices, which in turn, animates again and again these people to renew their facilities, and their hope of gain and easy profits makes them <b>forget</b> <b>all</b> <b>about,</b> using all sorts of pretexts to attack each other for reviving old disputes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's <b>forget</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would <b>forget</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E
