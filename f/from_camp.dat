Most climbers require {{two to three}} days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. About 8,000 to 13,000people attempt the climb each year, about 90% via routes <b>from</b> <b>Camp</b> Muir on the southeast flank.|$|E

5|$|The {{east side}} of the city dates back to 1850 and has always {{contained}} higher end housing. The proximity and commanding view of the river kept these neighborhoods a fashionable address long after the original families departed.

5|$|Besides the director, a matron, {{business}} manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp. An educational director {{was responsible for}} creating recreational, social and educational programs for the men. Church history, Bible and first aid were standard course topics. The strength of instructional programs varied <b>from</b> <b>camp</b> to camp, and after nine hours of physical labor, it could be difficult to motivate the men to attend classes. Most camps had libraries, some showed current films and camp number 56 (Camp Angel) near Waldport, Oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts. Camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences.|$|E

It also operated the entry control checkpoints, protected U.S. and allied ships at the massive Djibouti Port, and guarded the U.S. Embassy there.

SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, the United States {{military}} flew planes {{away from}} the coast to safer shelters further inland. Two people were killed when they crashed the Navy plane they were evacuating. Naval ships rode out the storm at sea, while small boats were secured at port. The American Red Cross opened shelters and mobilized 41officials with experience in hurricanes. The Coast Guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate, and overall about 14,000people evacuated the coastline, some to the 79Red Cross shelters opened up. About 2,000people evacuated from flood-prone areas in New Bern, North Carolina. In Philadelphia, the Boy Scouts evacuated 800scouts <b>from</b> <b>Camp</b> Delmont due {{to the threat of}} the hurricane. The threat of Connie also canceled a flight by President Dwight Eisenhower from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., prompting him to travel instead by car. Residents were also evacuated in coastal portions of New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|In January 1945, prisoners <b>from</b> <b>camps</b> {{all over}} Germany were herded <b>from</b> the <b>camps</b> {{and forced to}} walk the length and breadth of Germany, {{in an effort to}} evade the {{encroaching}} Allied armies. On May 5, 1945, Roger and the others were turned over to the British Army not far from Bremen. Their guards surrendered and the prisoners were airlifted to Brussels.|$|R

5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men <b>from</b> <b>Camp</b> S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, President Grant's Indian peace policy, {{enforced}} {{and coordinated}} by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona, required the Apache {{to be put}} on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education. The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation <b>from</b> <b>Camp</b> Grant. 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache. When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women and children, in {{what became known as the}} Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise; during the chase they killed 13 Apache. Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return <b>from</b> <b>Camp</b> David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
