5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.|$|E
5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

25|$|In November 2014, Mattel {{received}} criticism {{over the}} book <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Be</b> a Computer Engineer, which depicted Barbie as being inept at computers and requiring that her two male friends complete {{all of the}} necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she downloads a virus onto both of them. Critics complained that the book was sexist, as other books in the <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Be...</b> series depicted Barbie as someone who was competent in those jobs and did not require outside assistance from others. Mattel later removed the book from sale on Amazon {{in response to the}} criticism.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to determine individually the semi-major axis a and the inclination of the orbit plane i. However, {{the product of the}} semi-major axis and the sine of the inclination (i.e. a sin i) may be determined directly in linear units (e.g. kilometres). If either a or <b>i</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> determined by other means, {{as in the case of}} eclipsing binaries, a complete solution for the orbit can be found.|$|E

25|$|The Hausdorff {{completion}} Y {{is unique}} up to isomorphism. As a set, Y {{can be taken}} to consist of the minimal Cauchy filters on X. As the neighbourhood filter B(x) of each point x in X is a minimal Cauchy filter, the map <b>i</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> defined by mapping x to B(x). The map i thus defined is in general not injective; in fact, the graph of the equivalence relation i(x) = i(x ') is the intersection of all entourages of X, and thus i is injective precisely when X is Hausdorff.|$|E
25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} type <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{caused by}} mutations {{in any one}} of several different genes: CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, and USH1G. These genes function in the development and maintenance of inner ear structures such as hair cells (stereocilia), which transmit sound and motion signals to the brain. Alterations in these genes can cause an inability to maintain balance (vestibular dysfunction) and hearing loss. The genes also {{play a role in the}} development and stability of the retina by influencing the structure and function of both the rod photoreceptor cells and supporting cells called the retinal pigmented epithelium. Mutations that affect the normal function of these genes can result in retinitis pigmentosa and resultant vision loss.|$|E

25|$|Structurally the hammerhead {{ribozyme}} {{is composed}} of three base paired helices, separated by short linkers of conserved sequences. These helices are called I, II and III. Hammerhead ribozymes can be classified into three types based on which helix the 5' and 3' ends are found in. If the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence contribute to stem I then it is a type I hammerhead ribozyme, to stem II is a type II and to stem III then it is a type III hammerhead ribozyme. Of the three possible topological types, type <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in the genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes and RNA plant pathogens, whereas type II have been only described in prokaryotes and type III are mostly found in plants, plant pathogens and prokaryotes.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{notion of}} {{duplicated}} work relies on noticing {{that after the}} first reduction of I I is done, {{the value of the}} other I <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting II terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of II can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the II term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.|$|E
500|$|... "Government Hooker" [...] {{begins as}} Gaga sings in an operatic fashion—backed by {{industrial}} synthesizers—and transcends into an electro-pop Gregorian chant. The song then progresses into the chorus: [...] "I {{can be good}} / <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sex / <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> anything / <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> everything / <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mom." [...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / Unless you want to hold hands / Unless you want to be dad". After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink my tears and cry / 'cos I know you love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E

Our approach is based on a domain generalization graph that defines a partial order specifying the generalization relations for a duration attribute.

[...] "If I make the team ... that would be unbelievable. If I don’t make this team, I plan to still be a champion." [...] He entered the {{competition}} ranked fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, fifth in the 200-meter butterfly, and also qualified in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle. He chose to scratch the 100-meter freestyle {{to concentrate on the}} 200-meter butterfly and freestyle. [...] Tarwater made the 200-meter freestyle finals; the top six finishers qualified for the Olympic 4×200 relay team, but Tarwater finished seventh. [...] He missed making the Olympic team by fourteen one-hundredths (0.14) of a second.|$|E

500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] is {{the kind}} of arena anthem that already sounds like it's being belted {{in the middle of a}} sold-out Madison Square Garden. It's a slow and steady build, but once it reaches that Journey-esque chorus ("I don't want to be alone forever, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be...</b> TONIGHT!", there's no going back. Cue the endless {{intercontinental}} shout-outs at the end ("I don't speak German, but I try!" [...] — a cute nod to [...] "Scheiße"), and you've got an instant classic from Artpop.|$|E
