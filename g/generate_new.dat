Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage would maintain the historic fabric of the castle, while the council would construct a new visitors' centre. A new, controversial visitor's centre {{was built in the}} style of a collection of jousting tents, while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, in an attempt to limit the erosion of the castle stonework.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to <b>generate</b> <b>new</b> T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E
5|$|On 28September, the 6th Company of the German 920th Landesschützen (Local Defence) Battalion was {{captured}} by insurgents {{in the town of}} Gornji Milanovac. According to the journalist Misha Glenny, the Partisans launched an attack on a small German detachment based at a local school. They did not expect to capture the German garrison, but undertook the attack in order to <b>generate</b> <b>new</b> recruits from the surrounding area. The local Chetnik commander, Zvonimir Vučković, became aware of the Partisan plans and decided to join in the attack to avoid the significant loss of prestige that would result from allowing the Partisans to attack alone. The insurgents launched a morning attack against the school. Although they were successful in overrunning the sentry posts, the Germans' heavy machine guns soon stopped the assault. In 90minutes of fighting, 10Germans were killed and 26wounded. The two insurgent groups judged that continuing the assault would be too costly and Vučković suggested negotiating with the Germans. To the insurgents' surprise, the Germans surrendered. They were then taken away by Vučković and his men.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{sufficient}} conditions for unweighted digraphs to induce facet-defining inequalitys of the linear ordering polytope P_n. We introduce constructive operations (Identification (of nodes), #nabla#-Extension) for <b>generating</b> <b>new</b> facets of P_n by using already known facets. The identification <b>generates</b> <b>new</b> digraphs by identification two nodes {{of the source}} digraph and presented for arbitrary unweighted digraphs. On examples of Moebius ladders we show a possible way to find two nodes, which can be identified to obtain new facet-defining digraph. By connecting Moebius ladders with special digraphs #nabla#-Extension <b>generates</b> <b>new</b> facet-defining diagraphs to which we can apply #nabla#-Extension repeatedly. (orig.)

25|$|The {{efficacy}} of cancer treatments is, {{in the initial}} stages of testing, often measured by the ablation fraction of tumor mass (fractional kill). As CSCs form a small proportion of the tumor, this may not necessarily select for drugs that act specifically on the stem cells. The theory suggests that conventional chemotherapies kill differentiated or differentiating cells, which form the bulk of the tumor but do not <b>generate</b> <b>new</b> cells. A population of CSCs, which gave rise to it, could remain untouched and cause relapse.|$|E

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} is that the Universe may have been designed by extra-universal aliens. Some believe this would {{solve the problem of}} how a designer or design team capable of fine-tuning the Universe could come to exist. Cosmologist Alan Guth believes humans will in time be able to <b>generate</b> <b>new</b> universes. By implication previous intelligent entities may have generated our Universe. This idea leads to the possibility that the extraterrestrial designer/designers are themselves the product of an evolutionary process in their own universe, which must therefore itself be able to sustain life. However it also raises the question of where that universe came from, leading to an infinite regress.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic typing {{typically}} makes metaprogramming {{easier to}} use. For example, C++ templates are typically more cumbersome to write than the equivalent Ruby or Python code since C++ has stronger rules regarding type definitions (for both functions and variables). This forces a developer to write more boilerplate code for a template than a Python developer would need to. More advanced run-time constructs such as metaclasses and introspection are often harder {{to use in}} statically typed languages. In some languages, such features may also be used e.g. to <b>generate</b> <b>new</b> types and behaviors on the fly, based on run-time data. Such advanced constructs are often provided by dynamic programming languages; {{many of these are}} dynamically typed, although dynamic typing need not be related to dynamic programming languages.|$|E
