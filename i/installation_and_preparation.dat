40|$|The Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA) {{is a small}} 30 m {{circumference}} synchroton {{under construction}} at CERN to further decelerate antiprotons from the Antiproton Decelerator AD from 5. 3 MeV to 100 keV. Controlled deceleration in a synchrotron equipped with an electron cooler to reduce emittances in all three planes will allow the existing AD experiments to increase substantially their antiproton capture efficiencies and render new experiments possible. Installation of the machine and lines needed for the commissioning of the ring are ongoing and commissioning is expected to start around mid- 2016. The aim is to complete ELENA ring commissioning in November followed by the installation of new electrostatic transfer lines to existing experiments until autumn 2017.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{project is}} based on technology content of the earlier run program FKZ 20 W 9301. This was essentially aiming at {{the definition of a}} fundamental reference wing in terms of configuration, aerodynamics, and loads. Development and tests of structure components improved the capabilities of dimensioning and calculation of wind box structures. This report describes the consequent continuation and the improvement of work, now achieved in phase II. The main task, the development of a general design concept for a CFRP wing box, ruled by materials and performance requirements has been successfully completed. Major topics were: Creating a performance profile including the definition of aerodynamics, the appropriate geometry and the resulting loads; structural lay out and dimensioning of the complete wing, as well as the structures of the fixation and the dummy structures; design of the CFRP wing (drawings) and of a adequate center wing box; accompanying investigations concerning system <b>installations</b> <b>and</b> system behavior; <b>preparation</b> <b>and</b> planning of the future tests.

40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{of organic}} or inorganic salts {{are used as}} secondary refrigerants in indirect refrigeration systems to transport and transfer heat. Water {{is known for its}} corrosive character and secondary refrigerants based on aqueous solutions have the same tendency. The least corrosive from the aqueous solutions are glycols and alcohols. Salt solutions, such as chlorides and potassium salts, are much more corrosive. Nevertheless, it is possible to minimize corrosion risks at the beginning stage while designing system. Proper design can significantly help in improving system performance against corrosion. There are several aspects which need {{to be taken into account}} while working with secondary refrigerants: design of system, selection of secondary refrigerant, proper corrosion inhibitors, compatible materials used to build the <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> proper <b>preparation</b> of system to operation. While choosing proper materials it is advised to avoid the formation of a galvanic couple to reduce the risk of the most dangerous type of corrosion. Oxygen present in installation is another important factor increasing the rate of corrosion. Even small amounts of oxygen can significantly affect the system lifetime. The methods of cleaning, charging the system with refrigerant, and deaeration procedures are extremely important. The purpose of this thesis work is to present the problems of corrosion occurring in the indirect systems with secondary refrigerants. The thesis describes the mechanism of corrosion and its different types, most commonly used materials in installation, different corrosion inhibitors used to protect system. This thesis also lists the available secondary refrigerants on the market and briefly describes them. Further, it describes the important aspects related with designing, preparing and maintaining of indirect systems. This thesis is giving some clues and shows what should be done in order to reduce risks of corrosion. Effsys 2 P 2 projec...|$|R
