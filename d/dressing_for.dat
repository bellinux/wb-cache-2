500|$|Jim Shelley of The Daily Mirror {{was also}} {{negative}} about the episode, especially towards Alex Kingston, {{who appeared to}} be acting while [...] "the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly naturally". The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller said that Moffat [...] "delivered a pacy romp" [...] and praised the concept of the Teselecta, but was disappointed with the [...] "wasted opportunity" [...] of the setting. He thought that the setting offered [...] "great dramatic potential" [...] but was [...] "little more than window <b>dressing</b> <b>for</b> the story". He also felt using Hitler as a comic relief [...] "struck a wrong note given the nature of the man and the regime he led" [...] and that it was [...] "an odd way to treat such an historically significant character". He was also critical of Moffat's [...] "seeming keenness to kill the regular cast in some way, shape or form". However, Entertainment Weekly Tucker thought that it [...] "didn't need Hitler to be an excellent [...] episode".|$|E

Entering the Canucks' training camp with an added 10 pounds, he made the Canucks' opening line-up for the 2011–12 season. After <b>dressing</b> <b>for</b> three of the team's first five games, he was reassigned to the Chicago Wolves, Vancouver's new AHL affiliate (the Moose were relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland, after the Winnipeg Jets returned to the NHL). Vigneault explained that the organization wanted Tanev receiving more ice time than he could receive in Vancouver while competing for the [...] "No. 5 to No. 8 spots on [...] team." [...] In his first game with the Wolves, he injured an oblique muscle after receiving a hit and was sidelined for a month. After returning, he formed a top defensive pairing on the team with Kevin Connauton. In late-January 2012, he was called up by the Canucks for one game, then again in mid-February {{until the end of}} the season.
