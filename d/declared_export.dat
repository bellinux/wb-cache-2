If mismanaged, legal trade in threatened species can lead to unsustainable exploitation. Inaccurate and incomplete trade records from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) undermine the regulation of this trade. We examine the trade of hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius) teeth to illustrate the extent of mismatched data between key trading nations. More than 90 % of global hippo teeth trade is imported to, and re-exported from, Hong Kong. Of that imported, 76 % originated in Tanzania or Uganda, but there are notable disparities in declared trade volumes. In most transactions, Hong Kong declares more volume imported than the volume <b>declared</b> <b>exported</b> by Uganda. Overall, Hong Kong has reported the import of 3, 176 kg more hippo teeth than <b>declared</b> <b>exported</b> by Tanzania. This indicates that actual trade levels may exceed internationally agreed quotas. In total, over 14, 000 kg of hippo teeth is unaccounted for between Uganda and Hong Kong, representing more than 2, 700 individual hippos – 2 % of the global population. This gross discordance in trade data undermines regulatory measures and challenges the persistence of hippo populations in Africa...|$|R

40|$|Global trade {{data are}} {{collected}} worldwide and made available by national statistical services {{as well as}} dedicated data providers. JRC has carried out a support task to IAEA to identify main trade data sources and explore uses for safeguards. In this context a software tool has been developed in support to nuclear trade analysis. The tool, called The Big Table (TBT), allows IAEA¿s analysts to search control lists, identify items of interest to trade-related case studies, and link these to technical documentation and descriptors needed to retrieve global trade data. A distinguishing trait of TBT is that it enables searching in an ¿inter-related way¿ a collection of reference documents for export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related items. Reference documents include: regulatory documents, technical handbooks and the Harmonized System, the taxonomy of goods by the World Customs Organization used by traders to <b>declare</b> <b>exports</b> and imports to customs. By inter-related search it is meant that semantically related items listed in different documents of TBT¿s collection are put in correspondence by ad hoc correspondence tables. In this way, any document in the collection can be taken as starting point for a search, and retrieve complementary perspectives on items given other relevant documents. TBT can serve a variety of tasks and communities underpinning export controls, including the rating of items by licensing authorities and commodity identification for customs controls. JRC.

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The most known Lake Victoria dagaa fishery (Rastrioneobola argentae) in Eastern and Southern {{countries}} of Sub-Saharan African region consists characterized by physical, quality and economical (PQE) losses along the supply chain. The survey {{was done on}} the PQE losses on Sun dried dagaa along the supply chain. Losses are at fishing, processing under sun drying on bare open beach sand and during consumers' preparation. During sun drying in open sand, birds and animals find an opportunity to eat. If it rains {{then there is a}} total physical loss. Similarly economical loss is in parallel due to poor raw dagaa and sand processed dagaa products which lead to low price of dagaa. The price of dagaa is dependent on {{the quantity and quality of}} the dagaa catch yield. Dagaa again suffers with a huge loss about 1 / 3 of total weight of dagaa during preparation for cooking at street restaurants and households. The heads and bellies of dagaa are removed on believes that heads contain sand and the bellies cause the bitter taste of dagaa.   The consumer encounters loss in quantity, nutrients and economical losses due the sand, heads and bellies parts being removed and thrown away during preparation.   PQE losses are costing all the stakeholders in the supply chain, the fishers, traders, Government and consumers. The dagaa business is not formally regulated; very few traders may <b>declare</b> <b>exports.</b> Hence the government is losing a lot of revenue as there is limited control of records on processed and exported dagaa products. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} of trade liberalisation, when most {{developing}} countries are following export-oriented policies, the impact of trade liberalisation on labour markets has become an important area to explore. The experience of trade liberalisation in developing countries is quite varied, but understanding the effects of openness on their labour markets is a complex and demanding task as these countries have undergone significant structural changes and adjustments from 1980 s onward. In accordance with standard trade theory, developing countries should specialise {{in the production of}} labour-intensive goods, thus increasing the relative demand for this factor. Pakistan’s trade policy has also <b>declared</b> <b>exports</b> as an important and leading sector for employment generation. However, so far, little evidence is available on the issue of trade liberalisation and labour markets which can help work out the trade-labour linkages for Pakistan. In that context, the present study is an attempt to investigate these linkages. Among various paths through which trade liberalisation is channelled to the labour market, one is that of labour demand elasticity. It is expected that trade openness might induce an increase in elasticity via a scale effect due to the increased competition in the output market, and via a substitution effect generated by expanding a firm’s production possibility set to include additional input. The main hypothesis {{of this study is that}} trade liberalisation might lead to an increase in labour demand elasticity and is expected to have a favourable impact on the employment generation in Pakistan. The study is carried out for labour engaged in the manufacturing sector in Pakistan, using panel data approach for the years 1970 - 1995. A labour demand equation is obtained from the solution of a firm’s cost minimisation problem. The impact of trade liberalisation on employment is not restricted to a wage elasticity effect; it also allows for a direct effect with globalisation acting as a demand shifter. Overall, we find a positive significant effect of trade liberalisation on labour demand elasticities. As Pakistan has adopted a stance in favor of trade liberalisation over time, and the effective rate of protection has reduced very sharply since the early 1990 s, it is thus revealed from the results that there has been a consequential shift from capital-intensive production to more labour-intensive production that is in keeping with the perceived static comparative advantage, and, in turn, is expected to lead to increased employment generation because of the greater incentives afforded to labour-intensive...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{theoretical}} {{literature has}} focused on the importance of extensive and intensive margins of trade {{in the case of the}} Euro adoption. But few works have investigated the effects of the euro introduction on the extensive and intensive margins of trade. All these studies have used disaggregated bilateral flows data (6 digit). However, not even the finest level of disaggregation in the publicly available trade data is enough to single out individual products. We try to fill this gap by using a unique dataset taken from ISAE surveys on Italian manufacturing firms. From this quarterly survey it is possible to obtain information about both the structural characteristics (geographical location, industrial sector of activity, number of employees) and exporting behaviour of firms. In particular, among other things, firms <b>declare</b> their <b>export</b> turnover (as a share of total turnover) and their exporting markets both in the EU (Germany, France, Benelux, UK, other EU countries) and extra-EU areas (USA and other extra EU countries).

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} role of Switzerland, as the leading hub for global {{commodities}} trading, {{in terms of the}} patterns of prices received by original exporting countries and subsequently by Switzerland and other jurisdictions. We find support for the hypotheses that (i) the average prices for commodity exports from developing countries to Switzerland are lower than those to other jurisdictions; and that (ii) Switzerland <b>declares</b> higher (re-) <b>export</b> prices for those commodities than do other jurisdictions. This pattern implies a potential capital loss for commodity exporting developing countries, and we provide a range of estimates of that loss – each of which suggests the scale is substantial (the most conservative is around $ 8 billion a year) and that the issue merits greater research and policy attention. An important first step would be a Swiss commitment to meet international norms of trade transparency...|$|R
40|$|This article {{would like}} to give some {{insights}} about nuclear dual-use items, i. e. goods {{that can be used for}} both civil and military purposes. The contemporary world faces great challenges how to curb nuclear proliferation and provide for legitimate use of items for <b>declared</b> purposes. Effective <b>export</b> control of dual-use items addresses a number of stakeholders – from a single exporter, research institutes, larger companies, national agencies to international fora and non-governmental organisations. The first part of the article intends to encompass several international, legally binding instruments, fora and different groups that deal with the export control of nuclear and other dual-use items. These mechanisms are used by those states which follow their international obligations in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It includes control of exports, as well as transfers, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The second part will touch upon Slovenian experience in this sphere, in particular its participation in the work of international bodies and organisations, domestic legislation, national inter-agency co-operation and obligations within the European Union (EU). The third part shows a few practical examples of nuclear dual-use items as well as some thoughts about challenges with regard to effective export control. ...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{of the effects of}} hazardous substances on {{human health and the environment}} has led to a growing demand for information regarding use and release patterns of such substances. For the past few years, Statistics Norway has been working on new statistics on the consumption and emission of hazardous substances in Norway. At present, the statistics cover the emissions of hazardous substances caused by the use of products that are subject to the duty of declaration to the Norwegian Product Register. The statistics include about 450 substances that are categorised as being CMR (may cause cancer, be mutagenic or generate reproductive disorders), chronically toxic, sensitising and/or dangerous for the environment. The emission of hazardous substances to the surroundings (including air, soil and water) is calculated by multiplying the amount consumed of a substance by an emission factor. The emission estimates include diffuse emissions. This means that not only emissions from production of products containing the substance, but also emissions from the subsequent use of these products are included. The consumption of a substance is expressed as the sum of production and import, minus <b>export,</b> <b>declared</b> to the Product Register. The emission factor represents the fraction of the substance that is not incorporated into a new product, transformed into a new compound, or handled in some other way (e. g. as waste). The fraction of a hazardous substance emitted is assumed to be dependent both on the type of product used and the sector in which it is used. The model and its emission factors have been gradually improved, incorporating an increasing amount of information. In the present model, the majority of the emission factors are specific for the combination of product type and industrial sector. Some are product-specific factors, while a few emission factors are specified for the combination of product type, industrial sector and substance. The first two groups of emission factors are obtained from two Swedish studies, while the substance-specific factors are based on consultations with relevant industry...|$|R
40|$|Model-driven {{development}} (MDD) {{has become}} a promising trend in software engineering {{for a number of}} reasons. Models as the key artifacts help the developers to abstract from irrelevant details, focus on important aspects of the underlying domain, and thus master complexity. As software systems grow, models may grow as well and finally become possibly too large to be developed and maintained in a comprehensible way. In traditional software development, the complexity of software systems is tackled by dividing the system into smaller cohesive parts, so-called components, and let distributed teams work on each concurrently. The question arises how this strategy can be applied to model-driven development. The overall aim of this thesis is to develop a formalized modularization concept to enable the structured and largely independent development of interrelated models in larger teams. To this end, this thesis proposes component models with explicit export and import interfaces where <b>exports</b> <b>declare</b> what is provided while imports declare what it needed. Then, composite model can be connected by connecting their compatible export and import interfaces yielding so-called composite models. Suitable to composite models, a transformation approach is developed which allows to describe changes over the whole composition structure. From the practical point of view, this concept especially targets models based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). In the modeling community, EMF has evolved to a very popular framework which provides modeling and code generation facilities for Java applications based on structured data models. Since graphs are a natural way to represent the underlying structure of visual models, the formalization is based on graph transformation. Incorporated concepts according to distribution heavily rely on distributed graph transformation introduced by Taentzer. Typed graphs with inheritance and containment structures are well suited to describe the essentials of EMF models. However, they also induce a number of constraints like acyclic inheritance and containment which have to be taken into account. The category-theoretical foundation in this thesis allows for the precise definition of consistent composite graph transformations satisfying all inheritance and containment conditions. The composite modeling approach is shown to be coherent with the development of tool support for composite EMF models and composite EMF model transformation...|$|R
