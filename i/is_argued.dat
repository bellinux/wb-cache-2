5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that radiometric dating technique of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that radiometric decay relies {{on a number of}} unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E
5|$|The crown-of-thorns starfish, {{like other}} starfish such as Metrodira subulata, has {{conspicuous}} coloration and conspicuous long, sharp spines, {{as well as}} chemical defences {{in the form of}} saponins; this evidence <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> to be sufficient for such species to be considered aposematic.|$|E

Similarly, [...] "The Beehive" [...] could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to equal 60000 points, as there {{would be at least}} 10,000 bees in a beehive; conversely it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to gain twelve points as the number of bees are not specified.

5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E

5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> to be due, in part, to a more mature reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that {{the teaching of}} evolution degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory {{have nothing to do with}} its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} the {{discovery}} of a penny of Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very different dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution {{is required to}} interpret the evidence. An {{example of this is}} the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that evolution and religion {{have one or}} more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular {{in recent years as}} the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E

5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors.

5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and {{can be attributed to the}} direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E

5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E
