25|$|The {{original}} Selectric mechanism {{was designed}} and manufactured by the office <b>equipment</b> <b>division</b> of IBM and was not engineered {{for use as a}} computer terminal. Adapting this mechanism to the needs of computer input/output was not simple. Microswitches were added to the keyboard, solenoids were added to allow the computer to trigger the typing mechanism, and interface electronics were also needed. Several mechanical components, in particular the motor and the main clutch, had to be upgraded from the typewriter versions to reliably support continuous operation. Additional microswitches had to be added to sense the state of various parts of the mechanism, such as case (upper vs. lower).|$|E

500|$|By 1962, four of Panavision's founders {{had left}} the company to pursue private careers. That year, MGM's Camera 65 {{production}} of Mutiny on the Bounty went so far over budget that the studio liquidated assets to cover its costs. [...] As {{a result of this}} liquidation, Panavision acquired MGM's camera <b>equipment</b> <b>division,</b> as well as the rights to the Camera 65 system it had developed for MGM; the technology was renamed Ultra Panavision. Only six more features were made with the system: It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), Battle of the Bulge (1965), The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), The Hallelujah Trail (1965), and Khartoum (1966). The system was revived in 2015 for Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. As 1.25× anamorphosers for 70mm projectors have become rare, most of the 70mm prints of these films still in circulation are designed for projection with non-anamorphic, spherical lenses. The result is a 2.20:1 aspect ratio, rather than the broader ratio originally intended.|$|E

O'Brien reviewed the ordnance program, and recommended that the production of three-quarters of the items he reviewed cease upon the expiration of the existing contracts, and scaled back the production of munitions [...] to replacement rates. Two of the most controversial projects he inherited were the Owen Gun and the Sentinel tank. While he believed that the Owen Gun was a superior weapons based on its performance in trials, he deferred a decision until reports came in from the field. When these expressed a preference for the Owen Gun, he recommended its adoption. He reported his doubts about the Sentinel tank, leading to a June 1943 decision to cancel it.|$|E
