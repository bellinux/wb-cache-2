25|$|To {{understand}} how band structure changes {{relative to the}} Fermi level in real space, a band structure plot is often first simplified {{in the form of}} a band diagram. In a band diagram the vertical axis is energy while the horizontal axis represents real space. Horizontal lines represent energy levels, while blocks represent energy bands. When the horizontal lines <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>diagram</b> are slanted then the energy of the level or band changes with distance. Diagrammatically, this depicts the presence of an electric field within the crystal system.

50|$|Again, <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> the {{direction}} of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the sake of illustration, but would in reality vary with point of sail for a constant true wind. In the left-hand diagram (broad reach), the boat is on a point of sail, where the sail can no longer be aligned into the apparent wind to create an optimum angle of attack. Instead, the sail is in a stalled condition, creating about 80% of the lift as in the upwind examples and drag has doubled. Total aerodynamic force (FT) has moved away from the maximum lift value. In the right-hand diagram (running before the wind), lift is one-fifth of the upwind cases (for the same strength apparent wind) and drag has almost quadrupled.|$|E

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> the {{direction}} of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with point of sail. Constant VA in these examples means that either VT or VB varies with point of sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case Newtons). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the sail's angle of attack (α [...] ) is essentially constant, although the boom angle over the boat changes with point of sail to trim the sail close to the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force (FT) into forward driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT) vary with point of sail. Forward driving force (FR) increases, as {{the direction}} of travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force (FLAT) decreases.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn early {{moments of}} {{computer}} systems development, computer engineers typically draw interaction diagrams, occasionally annotated with timing constraints, to reason about the specification {{of the system}} behavior.

To help the formal verification of their actual behavior, i. e. their temporal properties, this paper describes an interpretation of basic timed MSCs in a temporal framework that formally represents, in a unified model, both the qualitative and the metric temporal information conveyed <b>in</b> <b>these</b> intuitive <b>diagrams.</b> The framework solves the verification problems in polynomial time and lays the foundation of an automatic tool...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on moduli spaces of {{complexes}} of sheaves and diagrams of such moduli spaces. The objects <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> are constructed as geometric invariant theory quotients and the points in these quotients correspond to certain equivalence classes of complexes. The morphisms <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> are constructed by taking direct sums with acyclic complexes. We then study the colimit {{of such a}} diagram and in particular are interested in studying the images of quasi-isomorphic complexes in the colimit. As part of this thesis we construct categorical quotients of a group action on unstable strata appearing in a stratification associated to a complex projective scheme with a reductive group action linearised by an ample line bundle. We study this stratification for a closed subscheme of a quot scheme parametrising quotient sheaves over a complex projective scheme and relate the Harder-Narasimhan types of unstable sheaves with the unstable strata in the associated stratification. We also study the stratification of a parameter space for complexes {{with respect to a}} linearisation determined by certain stability parameters and show that a similar result holds in this case. The objects <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> are indexed by different Harder-Narasimhan types for complexes and are quotients of parameter schemes for complexes of this fixed Harder-Narasimhan type. This quotient is given by a choice of linearisation of the action and so the diagrams depend on these choices. We conjecture that these choices can be made so that for any quasi-isomorphism between complexes representing points in this diagram both complexes are identified in the colimit of this diagram. </p...|$|E
40|$|Software Architecture (SA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} artifacts for life cycle of a software system because it incorporates some important decisions and principles for the system development. On the other hand, developing the systems based on uncertain and ambiguous requirement has been increased, significantly. Therefore, there have been significant attentions on SA requirements. In this paper, we present a new method for evaluation of performance characteristics based on a use case, response time, and queue length of SA. Since there are some ambiguities associated with considered systems, we use the idea of Fuzzy UML (F-UML) <b>diagrams.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> have been enriched with performance annotations using proposed Fuzzy-SPT sub profile, the extended version of SPT profile proposed by OMG.

40|$|Abstract — The {{components}} of a large software application do not interact in random ways. Instead, class diagrams exhibit remarkable topological similarities to other natural and artificial systems. The {{components of}} a large software application are very well connected because the mean shortest distance between them is very low in spite of having {{a relatively small number}} of connections per class. <b>In</b> addition, <b>these</b> <b>diagrams</b> are very heterogeneous. These measurements are of a general nature and are largely independent of the particular semantics of the application.
