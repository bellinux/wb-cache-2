50|$|The related Hygrocybe kula, {{found in}} Royal National Park {{as well as}} Lane Cove Bushland Park, is similar in being red with <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills,</b> but its gills are more creamy and not visible through the cap surface. It has a yellow base to the stem. Hygrocybe miniata {{mushrooms}} are red but have adnate rather than <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gyrodon miretipes is a bolete {{mushroom}} {{described in}} 1983 from Burundi. {{it has a}} red-brown cap and stipe, and yellow-tan <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{mushroom}} can {{be mistaken}} for the toxic Clitocybe rivulosa which lacks an umbo, is white to grey in color, and has closely spaced <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gyrodon crassipes is a bolete {{mushroom}} {{described in}} 1983 from Ethiopia. {{it has a}} cinnamon-coloured cap that turns black-brown to touch, <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and a brown stem.|$|R
50|$|Gerronema is a genus of small- to {{medium-sized}} lignicolous agarics with white, nonamyloid, spores and <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b> The genus was circumscribed by American mycologist Rolf Singer in 1951.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ring and}} volva, {{together}} with the very decided <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> (upon which character the generic name is based), are telling characteristics of this genus of the Leucosporae.|$|R
50|$|Austropaxillus infundibuliformis (formerly Paxillus infundibuliformis) is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Serpulaceae. A {{mycorrhizal}} species, it grows in the eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia. It is readily recognised by its tawny yellow colour, large size (relative to other Australian mushrooms) and forked <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Morphologically, {{the fruit}} bodies of these fungi {{resemble}} those of Paxillus, namely they have funnel-shaped caps with inrolled margins and <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b> In the case of Austropaxillus, the gills are always forked. The spore print is brown. Microscopically they have long spindle-shaped spores from 7.8 to 16 μm long.|$|R
50|$|Omphalina is a genus {{of small}} agarics with white, nonamyloid, basidiospores and <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b> Typically the cap {{has a deep}} central {{depression}} giving the umbrella-like to funnel-shaped cap {{the appearance of a}} belly button, or a belly with a navel. Similarly-shaped agarics are said to be omphalinoid in appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit body}} has an orange- to dark brown cap, which {{is up to}} 10 cm (4 in) across. The stipe, flesh and <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> are all orange. The gills are forked. Hygrophoropsis rufa can have a {{penetrating}} ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of an orchid species Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|R
5000|$|Palaeocybe is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Psathyrellaceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single fossil species Palaeocybe striata, which was found in Tertiary amber in Saxony, Germany. The holotype consists of a single cap measuring 1.6 mm in diameter, {{and part of a}} stem, which is made of tubes. On the cap underside are <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Lactarius glyciosmus (commonly {{known as}} the coconut scented milk cap) is a semi-edible {{mushroom}} in the genus Lactarius. Mycorrhizal, {{it can be found}} growing in soil at the base of birch trees in Europe. It is typically coloured a greyish lilac, with the sometimes hollow stem a little lighter coloured than the cap. It has crowded, <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills,</b> and smells strongly of coconuts.|$|R
50|$|Clitopilus prunulus, {{commonly}} known as the miller or the sweetbread mushroom, is an edible pink-spored basidiomycete mushroom found in grasslands in Europe and North America. Growing Solitary to gregarious in open areas of conifer/hardwood forests; common under Bishop pine (Pinus muricata) along the coast north of San Francisco; fruiting shortly after the fall rains. It has a grey to white cap and <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Species are {{distinguished}} from most other waxcaps by producing basidiocarps (fruit bodies) with strongly <b>decurrent</b> lamellae (<b>gills).</b>|$|R
25|$|The North American Hygrocybe flavescens is {{very similar}} in appearance, but {{is said to have}} a drier stipe. Boertmann (2010) has {{suggested}} it may not be distinct from H.chlorophana. Hygrocybe glutinipes is similarly coloured, but is typically smaller with a glutinous, semi-translucent cap and an equally glutinous stipe. Hygrocybe ceracea is also similarly coloured, but has a waxy (not viscid) cap and stipe and broadly attached, almost <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arrhenia eburnea is {{a species}} of agaric fungus in the family Hygrophoraceae. Found in Spain, it was {{described}} as new to science in 2003. It has white to ivory-colored fruit bodies with <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills,</b> and a smooth stipe. Its spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to somewhat cylindrical, and measure 9-11.5 by 4.5-6.5 µm. The specific epithet eburnea, derived from the Latin eburneus, refers to the yellowish-white hues of the fruit bodies.|$|R

50|$|Panus conchatus, {{commonly}} known as the lilac oysterling, is an inedible species of mushroom that occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Its fruitbodies are characterized by a smooth, lilac- or tan-colored cap, and <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b> The fungus is saprophytic and fruits on the decomposing wood {{of a wide variety of}} deciduous and coniferous trees. Despite being a gilled species, phylogenetic analysis has shown it is closely related to the pored species found in the family Polyporaceae.|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinguishable}} {{mainly by}} its pinkish-buff gills and rosy markings {{on the upper}} cap surface, often arranged in concentric rings. Like other fungi in the genus, it has crumbly, rather than fibrous, flesh, and when this is broken the fungus exudes a white milky liquid. Mature specimens are funnel-shaped, with <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and a concave cap. It has firm, tough flesh, and a stipe which is shorter than the fruitbody is wide. The spore print is creamy-pink in colour.|$|R
2500|$|Lactarius deliciosus has {{a carrot}} orange cap which is convex to vase shaped, inrolled when young, [...] across, often with darker orange {{lines in the}} form of {{concentric}} circles. The cap is sticky and viscid when wet, but is often dry. It has crowded <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and a squat orange stipe which is often hollow, [...] long and [...] thick. This mushroom stains a deep green color when handled. When fresh, the mushroom exudes an orange-red latex or [...] "milk" [...] that does not change color.|$|R
5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|R
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills,</b> and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|R
5000|$|All four {{species of}} Catathelasma {{are found in}} North America but only one (C. imperiale) is known in Europe. They are all fairly massive Tricholoma-like fungi, but are {{distinguished}} from that genus because they have <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and (at the microscopic level) because they have amyloid spores and a bilateral gill trama. [...] They are mycorrhizal, growing on the ground under conifers, have a tough consistency, and their stems taper towards the bottom and are often partly buried in the soil. They have prominent veil remnants (two rings, or a ring and a volva).|$|R
5000|$|Lactarius deliciosus has {{a carrot}} orange cap which is convex to vase shaped, inrolled when young, 4 to 14 cm across, often with darker orange {{lines in the}} form of {{concentric}} circles. The cap is sticky and viscid when wet, but is often dry. It has crowded <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and a squat orange stipe which is often hollow, 3 to 8 cm long and 1 to 2 cm thick. This mushroom stains a deep green color when handled. When fresh, the mushroom exudes an orange-red latex or [...] "milk" [...] that does not change color.|$|R
50|$|A cream- or buff-coloured mushroom, the cap {{may reach}} 20 cm in diameter. It has a {{prominent}} boss and looks small {{in relation to}} the large stem in young specimens. As the mushroom ages, the cap changes from convex with inrolled margins to more funnel shaped. The <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> are the same colour as the cap. The stipe is bulbous, larger at the base and 10 - 20 cm high. The spore print is white. There is a sweet smell, which has been likened to the odour of bitter almonds. The white flesh is firm in young specimens.|$|R
50|$|The basidiocarp (mushroom) has a {{white to}} cream cap {{that can be}} sticky when wet and grows to 15 cm (6 in) across. The cap margin is inturned in young {{mushrooms}} and wavy in older ones. The adnate to <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> are white when young, turning red-brown with age as the spores mature. The spore print is red-brown. The stout white stipe is mostly underground, extending up to 3.5 cm (1.4 in) above the surface and up to 30 cm (12 in) below it. It is up to 2.5 cm (1 in) thick. The oval warty spores are 10 μm long by 6 μm wide.|$|R
50|$|The {{mushroom}} has a coral-pink cap up to 5 cm in diameter, {{though sometimes}} larger, which is initially convex and later flattening {{and becoming a}} more brick colour with maturity. Often slimy or sticky as {{with other members of}} the genus, its cap lacks the blackish markings of the related G. glutinosus. The stipe is 2.5 - 4.5 cm high and 0.4-1 cm wide and bears an indistinct ring. It is white with a pinkish or wine-coloured tint and often flushed yellow at the base. The whitish flesh may also be tinged pink and has little taste or smell. The <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> are grey, and the spore print is brownish-black.|$|R
5|$|First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he {{transferred}} {{it to the}} genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now a synonym. Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M.cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or yellowish tones, <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills,</b> and two-spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it {{should be treated as}} a synonym of M.cinerella.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have long}} been differing {{opinions}} as to how mushrooms which were assigned to genus Lepista (sometimes also placed in genus Clitocybe) should be classified. The fungi in question all have a white or slightly pink/yellow spore print, finely warty spores, and easily separable gills. [...] In 1981 Jörg H. Raithelhuber identified as separate a subgroup having very crowded strongly <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> and spores which are oval in section to almost spherical, including Lepista flaccida and Lepista gilva. He proposed this subgroup as a new genus Paralepista. [...] In the following years it was recognized {{at the level of}} a subgenus (also called [...] "Lepista section Inversae" [...] or [...] "Lepista sect. Gilva), but not as a genus.|$|R
50|$|Lactarius pyrogalus has a cap 5 - 10 cm {{across which}} is grey fawn, {{sometimes}} with a yellowish tinge, with pink and purple tinges not unknown. It is flattened convex to flat, later becoming funnel shaped. The cap is sometimes faintly concentrically banded, it is thin fleshed and becomes sticky when moist, {{but is not}} shiny. The stem is between 4 and 6 cm, and between 7 and 15 mm thick, generally cylindrical but sometimes slightly swollen at the base. The stem is whitish or concolorous with the cap, with whitish flesh. It has slightly <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills,</b> which are yellow to flesh coloured, though later become a cinnamon-ochre colour. The well-spaced, yellow gills differentiate it from other greyish Lactarius species.|$|R
500|$|Lactifluus piperatus has a {{cap that}} varies from [...] across and is convex with a widely funnel-shaped center. The cap is creamy-white in colour, glabrous and not glossy; its surface may become cracked in dry locales. The stipe is white in colour, smooth, [...] long by [...] thick and is cylindrical, {{sometimes}} tapering towards the base. There is {{a thick layer}} of firm white flesh, and the <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> are particularly crowded and narrow, sharing the white colouration of the stem but becoming creamy with age. As with other species of Lactarius, there is abundant milk (latex), which is white, and dries olive-green. It has a white spore print with , elliptic or amyloid spores which are ornamented, as with L. vellereus. The spores measure from 6.59.5 by 58μm, and have tiny warts.|$|R
5000|$|The eponymous [...] "milk" [...] and {{the brittle}} {{consistency}} of the flesh are the most prominent field characters of milk-cap fruitbodies. The milk or latex emerging from bruised flesh is often white or cream, but more vividly coloured in some species; it can change upon exposition or remain unchanged. Fruitbodies are small to very large, gilled, rather fleshy, without veil, often depressed or even funnel-shaped with <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills.</b> Cap surface can be glabrous, velvety or pilose, dry, sticky or viscose and is often zonate. Several species have pits (scrobicules) on the cap or pileus surface. Dull colors prevail, but some more colorful species exist, e.g. the blue Lactarius indigo or the orange species of section Deliciosi. Spore print color is white to ocher or, in some cases, pinkish. Some species have angiocarpous, i.e., closed fruitbodies.|$|R
50|$|The velvety cap is {{initially}} slightly convex (planoconvex), becoming funnel-shaped (infundibuliform) as it matures; it is 4-15 cm (1½-4 in) {{in diameter and}} has a faint zonate (bull's-eye) pattern, beige or light grey at the margins and darkening toward the centre. The <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> are cream when young, and darkening to ochre-yellow with age. The flesh is white or beige, often pink-tinged. The latex, or milk, is watery and colourless, unlike {{that of any other}} milkcap. The hollow cylindrical stalk is 3-9 cm (1-3½ in) high by 1-2 cm (½ in) wide. It may be whitish when young, ochre or pink-tinged, and sometimes spotted orange-brown. The highly distinctive smell has been described as reminiscent of fenugreek, with a mild taste. To others, the smell has been likened to lovage or celery, or liquorice or a packet of Maggi instant soup.|$|R
25|$|The way {{the gills}} {{attach to the}} top of the stalk is an {{important}} feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that do not extend {{to the top of}} the stalk. Others have <b>decurrent</b> <b>gills</b> that extend down the stalk, as in the genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.|$|R
