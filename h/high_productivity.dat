5|$|The {{years before}} the First World War were {{the golden age of}} the inshore fisheries. Landings reached new heights, and Scottish catches {{dominated}} Europe's herring trade, accounting for a third of the British catch. <b>High</b> <b>productivity</b> came about thanks to the transition to more productive steam-powered boats, while the rest of Europe's fishing fleets were slower because they were still powered by sails. However, in general the Scottish economy stagnated leading to growing unemployment and political agitation among industrial workers.|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for <b>high</b> <b>productivity</b> of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Russel {{estimated}} the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural {{populations in the}} time period. He attributes it to the <b>high</b> <b>productivity</b> of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop.60,000), Alexandria (pop.30,000), Qus (pop.25,000), Damietta (pop.18,000), Fayyum (pop.13,000), and Bilbeis (pop.10,000). Numerous smaller cities dotted the Nile River. Among the latter were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, mainly because of greater urbanization and industrialization than elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively <b>high</b> <b>productivity,</b> {{which would make}} its population more resilient to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|Water {{efficiency}} is being improved {{on a global}} scale by increased demand management, improved infrastructure, improved water productivity of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of <b>high</b> <b>productivity,</b> and planning for climate change, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively <b>high</b> <b>productivity</b> seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained.|$|E

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with <b>high</b> <b>productivity</b> {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with <b>high</b> <b>productivity</b> is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
