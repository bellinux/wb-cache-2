The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (<b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade)</b> contains detailed imports and exports statistics reported by statistical authorities of over 200 countries or areas. It concerns annual trade data from 1962 {{to the most recent}} year. <b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade</b> is considered the most comprehensive trade database available. The database is continuously updated. Whenever trade data are received from the national authorities, they are standardised by the UN Statistics Division and then added to <b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade.</b> The UK Data Service provide access to the premium service, for staff and students from UK Higher or Further education institutions (this includes the ability to bulk download data). The UK Data Service website includes further information on <b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade</b> including a dataset user guide and a guide on how to access the data. Main Topics : The database covers annual bilateral commodity trade statistics detailed by commodity and partner countries...|$|R

30|$|Since we need {{to build}} the {{instrument}} for the whole 1980 – 2001 period, and because of data limitations, we focus on Argentina’s major trade partners, namely Brazil, Chile, the United States and the European Union. Imports value data come from <b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade,</b> and exchange rates data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI).|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} more than 10  years since the signing of the {{agreement}} and no empirical analysis has been done to assess the overall performance of the economic partnership.

30|$|In this study, all trade {{data are}} based on the Harmonized System 6 -digit level and a time span of 9  years between 2007 and 2015. The Harmonized System has been revised every 4 or 5  years by the World Customs Organization, and each {{revision}} follows different nomenclature systems. We combined data under the 3 rd revision (2007 – 2011) and the 4 th revision (2012 – 2015). Data with invalid nomenclature are eliminated to maintain the consistency of product codes across countries. The trade data for this study come from various sources. The first is <b>UN</b> <b>COMTRADE.</b> Trade data from China with trade regimes and types of enterprise are from China Customs. Since <b>UN</b> <b>COMTRADE</b> data are missing for Taiwan and Korea, we fill the gaps with data from Trade Map and Korea Customs. And data from Macau are deleted in the full set since it distorts PRODY and EXPY.|$|R
30|$|The {{second step}} {{consists}} in merging the above dataset {{with a set}} of gravity variables.

40|$|Environmental {{targets and}} saving energy have become ones {{of the world}} main {{concerns}} {{over the last years}} and it will increase and become more important in a near future. The world population growth rate is the major factor contributing for the increase in global pollution and energy and water consumption. In 2005, the world population was approximately 6. 5 billion and this number is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 [United Nations, 2008. www. <b>un.</b> <b>org,</b> accessed on July]. Water supply systems use energy for pumping water, so new strategies must be developed and implemented in order to reduce this consumption. In addition, if there is excess of hydraulic energy in a water system, some type of water power generation can be implemented. This paper presents an optimization model that determines the best hourly operation for 1 day, according to the electricity tariff, for a pumped storage system with water consumption and inlet discharge. Wind turbines are introduced in the system. The rules obtained as output of the optimization process are subsequently introduced in a hydraulic simulator, in order to verify the system behaviour. A comparison with the normal water supply operating mode is done and the energy cost savings with this hybrid solution are calculated. Pump-storage Energy efficiency Water supply systems...|$|R
40|$|Following theOpen Data trend, {{governments and}} public {{agencies}} have started making their data {{available on the}} Web and established platforms such as data. gov or data. <b>un.</b> <b>org.</b> These Open Data platforms provide {{a huge amount of}} data for various topics such as demographics, transport, finance or health in various data formats. One typical usage scenario for this kind of data is their integration into a database or data warehouse in order to apply data analytics. However, in today’s business intelligence tools there is an evident lack of support for so-called situational or ad-hoc data integration. In this demonstration we will therefore present DrillBeyond, a novel database and information retrieval engine which allows users to query a local database as well as the Web of Open Data in a seamless and integrated way with standard SQL. The audience will be able to pose queries to our Drill-Beyond system which will be answered partly from local data in the database and partly from datasets that originate from the Web of Data. We will show how such queries are divided into known and unknown parts and how missing attributes are mapped to open datasets. We will demonstrate the integration of the open datasets back into the DBMS in order to apply its analytical features. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of international trade}} in sports goods {{is still in its}} infancy. Only four articles dealing with the topic have appeared in economic literature so far. In order to alleviate the sports economists ignorance about international specialisation in sports goods trade, we started to build up an entirely new dataset based on extracting data available in <b>Comtrade</b> (the <b>UN</b> word trade data basis) at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). After resolving a number of classification and statistical tricks, we have built up a country and sports goods dataset (41 countries, 36 goods), which gathers 94 - 96 % of sports goods global trade every sampled year (1994, 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2004). Our country sample is divided into five regional areas of the world economy: NAFTA, EU + Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Asia, other emerging countries. As a first step, our dataset enables us to precisely describe the major flows of sports goods global trade. Major trading areas are Asia, Europe and NAFTA while major exporters ar...|$|R
40|$|We use the Establishment History Panel from 1975 to 2010 {{provided}} by the German Federal Employment Office to {{examine the impact of}} international trade on the occupational structure of the German manufacturing sector. To capture trade, we match the Establishment History Panel with <b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade</b> trade data. To do so, we develop a new matching approach that takes the input and output structure of the German manufacturing sector into account. We identify three different trade channels: import intensity, import competition, and export intensity. Using a fixed-effects Poisson regression model, we find diverse occupational effects from trade at the industry-level, while establishment-level estimations show only few significant effects...|$|R

Analysis of regular equivalence gives clustering of countries into core and three tiers of (semi) periphery of the international production networks. Estimates of the gravity equation do not reveal significant differences in determinants of trade in the final goods and their intermediate inputs.

40|$|Distillers’ Dried Grains with Soluble (DDGS) is a {{coproduct}} from {{ethanol production}} {{which can be}} used as an alternative feedstuff in livestock rations. Ethanol, and consequently DDGS, production has increased dramatically since 2000. Ethanol production increased by 12. 9 billion gallons, a 760 % increase between 2000 and 2015, with the majority of this increase after 2007. This increase in ethanol production contributed to an increase of over 37. 75 million tons in DDGS production, or 1, 646 % between 2000 and 2015. In 2015, the United States produced about 40. 23 million tons of DDGS (USDA ERS Database 2015). Of this total DDGS production, approximately 66 % of DDGS were consumed domestically while the remaining 34 % was exported. U. S. Exports of DDGS have also been increasing. Between 2000 and 2015, U. S. DDGS exports increased by 12. 94 million tons, a 1, 439 % increase. Just between 2014 and 2015 U. S. exports increased approximately 2 million tons, a 17. 3 % increase. In 2015, the United States delivered DDGS to 46 countries around the world compared to only 22 countries in 2000 (<b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade</b> Database 2015). The United States was the largest exporter of DDGS in the world in 2015, exporting 13. 84 million tons representing 82. 8 % of the total world exports (Figure 1). The second largest exporter in 2015 was Canada, exporting only 0. 54 million tons, 3. 2 % of the world exports. China was the largest importer of DDGS in 2015, importing 7. 52 million tons representing 45. 1 % of total world imports, followed by Mexico importing 1. 73 million tons, 10. 4 % of the world exports (Figure 2) (<b>UN</b> <b>Comtrade</b> Database 2015) ...|$|R
