5|$|Messiaen {{continually}} evolved new composition techniques, always integrating {{them into}} his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the <b>geophone)</b> for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mechanical and electronic cones, {{a variety of other}} CPT-deployed tools have been developed over the years to provide additional subsurface information. One common tool advanced during CPT testing is a <b>geophone</b> set to gather seismic shear wave and compression wave velocities. This data helps determine the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio at intervals through the soil column for soil liquefaction analysis and low-strain soil strength analysis. Engineers use the shear wave velocity and shear modulus to determine the soil's behavior under low-strain and vibratory loads. Additional tools such as laser-induced fluorescence, X-ray fluorescence, soil conductivity/resistivity, pH, temperature and membrane interface probe and cameras for capturing video imagery are also increasingly advanced in conjunction with the CPT probe.|$|E
500|$|The first sensors {{utilized}} {{by the program}} were Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detector (ADSID), which had been developed from devices then in use in underground mapping for the oil industry. The device could sense vertical earth motion {{by the use of}} an internal <b>geophone</b> and could determine whether a man or a vehicle was in motion at a range of [...] and [...] respectively. The first acoustic sensors were developed from the U.S. Navy's Project Jezebel anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys, which recorded and processed sound by the utilization of an audio spectrum analyzer. The first model of seismic detectors (Phase I) outshone their contemporary acoustic types in {{the quality and quantity of}} the information they reported. The Phase I models of both the acoustic and seismic sensors were only available for operation in a continuous mode, which meant that under normal conditions, their lithium batteries would function for approximately 30 days.|$|E
40|$|Field {{tests of}} Litton, Geosource and Oyo 3 -component <b>geophones</b> showed similar {{performance}} characteristics {{for all three}} <b>geophones</b> for a test signal generated by a seismic cap at a horizontal distance of 7. 5 m from the <b>geophones.</b> Output signal levels from the Litton and Geosource <b>geophones</b> were similar, with the Oyo output being about 20 % lower. No cross-coupling between the elements within any of the <b>geophones</b> was observed, but the polarity {{of all of the}} horizontal elements is opposite to the recommended SEG standard. There is no consistent colour coding of the clip leads for the various elements between any of the <b>geophones.</b> Polarization tests for a circle of test shots spaced around the cluster of <b>geophones</b> gave remarkably similar results for all three <b>geophones.</b> Generally, the polarization direction measured by the horizontal elements matched the source azimuth closely, and any deviations were attributed to inhomogeneities in the near-surface sediments...|$|R
50|$|Deflection sensors (geophones; force-balance seismometers) mounted {{radially}} {{from the}} center of the load plate measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load. Some typical offsets are 0mm, 200mm, 300mm, 450mm, 600mm, 900mm, 1200mm 1500mm. The deflections measured at these sensors are termed D0, D200, D300 etc. The advantages of seismometers compared to <b>geophones</b> are built-in calibration devices and higher range (5 mm vs 2 mm). <b>Geophones</b> are more sensitive to disturbance immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated. <b>Geophones</b> however are much cheaper than seismometers. Dynatest, Carl Bro, Jils and PaveTesting use <b>geophones</b> while KUAB have seismometers in their standard FWD's and <b>geophones</b> in their low-cost models.|$|R
50|$|Analog <b>geophones</b> {{are very}} {{sensitive}} devices which can respond to very distant tremors. These small signals can be drowned by larger signals from local sources. It is possible though to recover the small signals caused by large but distant events by correlating signals from several <b>geophones</b> deployed in an array. Signals which are registered only at one or few <b>geophones</b> {{can be attributed to}} unwanted, local events and thus discarded. It can be assumed that small signals that register uniformly at all <b>geophones</b> in an array can be attributed to a distant and therefore significant event.|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the speed and}} efficiency of shallow seismic data recording and thereby decrease acquisition costs, {{the concept of a}} towed land streamer containing self-orienting, gimbal-mounted <b>geophones</b> is being evalu-ated. Our initial experiments at two locations within Switzerland demonstrate that good coupling with the ground may be achieved when the gimbal-mounted ver-tical <b>geophones</b> are contained in heavy (- 1 kg) casings and pulled along a very shallow (2 - 3 cm deep) furrow. Such a furrow may be created by mounting a heavy wheel on the towing vehicle. Placing the <b>geophones</b> in even heavier casings may provide the necessary good coupling with the ground, negating the need for the fur-row. Shot gathers and stacked sections recorded with the gimbal-mounted <b>geophones</b> are practically indistin-guishable from those recorded with conventional spike <b>geophones.</b> The principal advantage of this approach is that significantly fewer field personnel (only two or three) are required than for conventional shallow seis-mic surveying. When fully operational, the new acquisi-tion system should be faster and less expensive {{for a wide variety of}} engineering and environmental applications...|$|R

50|$|At the moment, {{there is}} not a field routine {{operation}} method, but in scientific studies an array of several dipole antennas is placed along a straight line to record seismoelectric waves, and an array of <b>geophones</b> placed between dipole antennas to record seismic wave arrivals. <b>Geophones</b> are necessary to be able to suppress coseismic waves from the seismoelectric signal, so that electrokinetic effect can be separated and studied.|$|R
50|$|The {{response}} of a coil/magnet <b>geophone</b> {{is proportional to}} ground velocity, while MEMS devices usually respond proportional toacceleration.

50|$|The {{frequency}} response of a <b>geophone</b> {{is that of}} a harmonic oscillator, fully determined by corner frequency (typically around 10 Hz) and damping (typically 0.707).
