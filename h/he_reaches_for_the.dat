He tells Griffin to [...] "get rid of me", to tell his family that he's killed Little and to live his life for them, not for vengeance against Little.|$|E

5000|$|One {{account of}} Dylan's first {{experience}} with psychedelics places it in April 1964; producer Paul Rothchild told Bob Spitz that he was present when Dylan took his first hit of LSD. By February 1964, Dylan was already telling his friends that [...] "Rimbaud's where it's at. That's {{the kind of stuff}} means something. That's the kind of writing I'm gonna do." [...] A nineteenth-century French poet, Rimbaud once wrote to his mentor Georges Izambard that [...] "the poet makes himself a seer by a long, prodigious and rational disordering of the senses … <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unknown and even if, crazed, he ends up by losing the understanding of his visions, at least he has seen them." [...] (Dated May 1871) Dylan's early experimentation with hallucinogens has often been connected with the dramatic development his songwriting would soon take, but Dylan himself has denied any connection.|$|E

5000|$|Megatron goes {{looking for}} Optimus Prime by {{destroying}} the city, instead finding Sam and Mikeala hiding. Optimus appears and intervenes before Megatron can kill them, {{to have the}} last battle. Eventually, Megatron injures Optimus badly, and as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> All Spark, Megatron stands in the way. He lowers his flail, and can tell Optimus what happens now. He raises the flail, swings it around his head once, then swings it into Prime. Prime's optical display flickers for seconds, showing all of his past recordings before, flickering out, along with his Spark. With Optimus dead, Sam and the other humans remain unharmed, as Megatron is seen activating the All Spark, then releases a massive shockwave, presumably converting all the electronics in the world into Decepticons, and uses the new army to take over Earth. The story ends sometime later, with Megatron ordering all Decepticons to kill the last of Mankind from his [...] "throne" [...] before they leave Earth.|$|E
50|$|It takes {{concentration}} {{to understand}} that the confused melee is a victory of sainthood. Saint Matthew appears to recoil as he falls before the naked fury of his executioner, burning in the glare of light, who readies his sword to strike. Around the saint are persons showing varied emotions, as required by Contarelli: terror, awe, and consternation, while an angel holds out the palm of martyrdom. Confusion about the image can be alleviated by understanding that Matthew is not quailing in fear at the executioner's strike, instead <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> angel's gift. The executioner's grasp and the angel's reach are two parallel paths. Only Matthew is privy to the angelic visitation. Viewed as such, this is a painting not about a moment of general terror, but the death of a saint as the personal handshake of the divine. Italian Baroque painting and sculpture of the time commonly depicted martyrdoms not as moments of fear, but as moments of joy or ecstasy, as in for example, Bernini's Santa Bibiana.|$|E
5000|$|Fuse {{garnered}} generally positive reception {{from music}} critics to critique the album. At Metacritic, they assign a weighted average score based upon selected mainstream critics reviews and ratings, which based upon four reviews, the album has a Metascore of a 74. At Country Weekly, Bob Paxman {{said that the}} release [...] "meshes Keith's usual blend of pop and country with some R&B touches and even some New Age-y sounds." [...] He praised the variety of sounds and thought that the vocals were more prominent than on Urban's previous albums. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone highlighted that [...] "What is surprising, though, is how unforced and fun the record sounds", and this was because [...] "Sometimes, leaving your zone {{is the best way}} to find yourself." [...] At Allmusic, Thom Jurek wrote that [...] "For all the piecemeal recording, technological obsession and sheer ambition on the Fuse, Urban manages to fashion it all into a (mostly) working whole and maintain his identity as a contemporary country artist, even as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mainstream pop fences." ...|$|E

50|$|Trigger uses an {{air hose}} {{to enter the}} flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the torpedo tubes, but a second leak and broken valve are found, which Trigger can't reach. U-571 {{surfaces}} heavily damaged and begins to flood, unable to fire its last torpedo from its stern tubes. The destroyer gives chase and fires upon U-571 with its main guns; the first hit causes pipes to collapse, pinning Trigger's leg, after he has left the air hose behind. Unable to turn back, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> valve and closes it before he dies. The second the pressure is available, Tyler orders Tank to fire the final torpedo. The German destroyer is unable to take evasive action and is sunk. As the crew sigh in relief, Tank reports Trigger's death. U-571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long. The crew abandons the submarine with the Enigma in their possession. The crew watch U-571 as she slips beneath the waves. Floating aboard an inflatable lifeboat, they are eventually rescued by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat.|$|E
5000|$|The House of Atreus {{begins with}} Tantalus. Tantalus was {{a son of}} Zeus who enjoyed cordial {{relations}} with the gods until he decided to slay his son Pelops and feed him to the gods {{as a test of}} their omniscience. Most of the gods, as they sat down to dinner with Tantalus, immediately understood what had happened, and, because they knew the nature of the meat they were served, were appalled and did not partake. But Demeter, who was distracted due to the abduction by Hades of her daughter Persephone, obliviously ate Pelops' shoulder. The gods threw Tantalus into the underworld, where he spends eternity standing in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches. Whenever <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fruit, the branches raise his intended meal from his grasp. Whenever he bends down to get a drink, the water recedes before he can drink. Thus is derived the word [...] "tantalising". The gods brought Pelops back to life, replacing the bone in his shoulder with a bit of ivory, thus marking the family forever afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|Three years pass, {{in which}} the {{previously}} amicable relationship between the narrator and Divney breaks down. Eventually Divney reveals that the box is hidden under the floorboards in Mathers's old house, and instructs the narrator to fetch it. The narrator follows Divney's instructions but just as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> box, [...] "something happened":It {{was as if the}} daylight had changed with unnatural suddenness, as if the temperature of the evening had altered greatly in an instant or as if the air had become twice as rare or twice as dense as {{it had been in the}} winking of an eye; perhaps all of these and other things happened together for all my senses were bewildered all at once and could give me no explanation. The box has disappeared, and the narrator is perplexed to notice that Mathers is in the room with him. During a surreal conversation with the apparently dead Mathers, the narrator hears another voice speaking to him which he realises is his soul: [...] "For convenience I called him Joe." [...] The narrator is bent on finding the cash box, and when Mathers tells him about a remarkable police barracks nearby he resolves to go to the barracks and enlist the help of the police in finding the box.|$|E

50|$|In the painting, a clerk, {{a peasant}} farmer, and a soldier lie dozing {{on the ground}} {{underneath}} a table bound to a tree. The clerk's book, papers, ink and pen lie idle, as do the peasant's flail and the soldier's lance and gauntlet. A half-eaten egg in its shell runs between the peasant and the clerk. The table attached to the tree is laden with partly consumed food and drink. Behind the tree, a roasted fowl lays itself upon a silver platter, implying that it {{is ready to be}} eaten, and a roasted pig runs about with a carving knife already slipped under its skin. On the left, a knight emerges from a lean-to whose roof is covered in dishes of pie and pastry, with an open mouth, waiting for the roasted pigeon to fly in (the pigeon was accidentally removed during restoration work). On the right and behind the main action, a man clutching a spoon forces his way out of a large cloud of pudding, having eaten his way through it; <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bent branch of a tree in order to lower himself into Cockaigne. The fence enclosing the main scene behind the dozing trio is made of interwoven sausages. A partly eaten wheel of cheese and a bush (or tower) of loaves of bread are on the left and right of the scene, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Jim Leonard tells all {{the boys}} how Pony {{is going to run}} off. That night, Pony's father takes him and his sisters to the circus. His mother and father are very nice to him and this makes Pony's heart ache when he thinks about leaving them. After supper, Jim Leonard comes over and helps Pony pack his belongings. Pony gets into bed early and his mother comes to see him and apologizes for boxing his ears. Pony begins to cry and wraps his arms around her neck. Pony {{eventually}} falls asleep and wakes up {{to the sound of the}} circus band. He gets dressed as quickly as possible and rushes to his front steps where he sees the circus magician. Pony tries to get back into the house, so the magician cannot find him. As <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> doorknob there is no door there. Pony curls into a ball in hopes that the magician will not see him. Then his father and the doctor are standing by him looking down at him. The doctor claims Pony has been walking in his sleep. Pony wakes up finding it to be morning. Pony is relieved that the circus is so far away, but becomes ill for two or three days. Pony is never actually sure if he waited on the front steps that night and seen the circus magician or not. Jim Leonard tries to help him figure out if it was a dream or not. Jim tells Pony that he wishes he had not overslept, so that he could have come said good-bye to Pony, like he said he would.|$|E
