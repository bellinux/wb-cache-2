5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are <b>foreshortened,</b> while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E

Because of this rotation, {{the projection of}} a primed meter-stick onto the unprimed x-axis is <b>foreshortened,</b> while the projection of an unprimed meter-stick onto the primed x′-axis is likewise <b>foreshortened.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{models and}} investigates the <b>foreshortening</b> of {{transferred}} quota which is {{applied in the}} Norwegian fisheries management. This reduction in the transferred quota amount by 20 % is then redistributed amongst all vessels in the relevant vessel group. It is shown that fishing units {{can be expected to}} be operated longer, and capital renewed at a slower rate under <b>foreshortening</b> than if <b>foreshortening</b> is not used by the government. <b>Foreshortening</b> will most likely also reduce the value of the quotas. However, <b>foreshortening</b> may increase the value of the quotas if unit costs of fishing increase fast compared to the discount rate used by quota holders...|$|R

25|$|The frescoes {{also have}} {{significant}} aspects which relate most {{closely to the}} late antique art of Italy. Several of the buildings are successfully <b>foreshortened,</b> {{and the relationship between}} buildings and figures is more effectively managed than in most Byzantine painting.

25|$|While {{the film}} was in production, a logo was {{commissioned}} from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as The Exorcist (1973), Taxi Driver (1976). Perri devised a <b>foreshortened</b> STAR WARS logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl. In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees.|$|E
25|$|Wheat is {{a staple}} crop from Canada. To help homesteaders attain an {{abundance}} harvest in a <b>foreshortened</b> growing season, varieties of wheat were {{developed at the}} beginning of the twentieth century. Red Fife was the first strain; it was a wheat which could be seeded in the fall and sprout in the early spring. Red Fife ripened nearly two weeks sooner and was a harder wheat than other spring wheats. Dr. C. Saunders, experimented further with Red Fife, and developed Marquis Wheat, which was resistant to rust and came to maturity within 100 days. Some other types of wheat grown are durum, spelt, and winter wheat. In recent years, Canadian farmers have also begun to grow rice.|$|E

25|$|Fig. 2-9 {{illustrates}} {{the motions of}} a 1nbsp&m rod that is traveling at 0.5nbsp&c along the x axis. The edges of the blue band represent the world lines of the rod's two endpoints. The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1nbsp&m. The endpoints O and B measured when nbsp&=nbsp&0 are simultaneous events in the S′ frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the x-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's world sheet onto the x axis yields the <b>foreshortened</b> length OC.|$|E
25|$|The {{studio of}} Campeche painter Joaquín Clausell {{occupies}} several {{rooms in the}} upper part of the house. He lived there as the husband of Angela Cervantes, a descendent of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya. Clausell received visitors in these rooms such as Gerardo Murillo (Dr. Atl), Diego Rivera, Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo and Julio Ruelas. The rooms contain 1,300 sketches by the artist including portraits of famous people, images of Christ, angels and animals and mythological scenes. These works show influences from the Impressionism and Symbolism movements. The collection of works by Clausell include <b>foreshortened</b> figures that the artist made simply to clean his brushes. Clausell's works are on display here due to an agreement between the Museum and the Museo Nacional de Arte, where every two months, works by this artists are circulated between the two museums.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the constellations}} can be simply {{divided into two}} regions; namely the {{northern}} and southern sky, whose origins are distinctly different. The northern skies have constellations that have mostly survived since Antiquity, whose common names are based on Classical Greek legends or those whose true origins have now been lost. Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts, whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas, which has been suggested {{to be based on the}} star catalogue of the Greek astronomer, Hipparchus. Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions, which were created as new constellations, or become substitutes for some ancient constellation. e.g. Argo Navis. Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became <b>foreshortened</b> to more usable forms e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca.|$|E

25|$|The first {{title to}} be relaunched was Youngblood, the first Image title, and core title in Liefeld's various — and {{subsequent}} — imprints. Issue #1, written by Moore with art by Steve Skroce was released {{around the same}} time as Judgment Day: Aftermath in early 1998. Despite Moore reportedly having the first 12 issues outlined and part-written prior to its launch, the title was delayed considerably, with the second issue not seeing print until six months after the first. The second issue also proved to be the final issue, although the title was subsequently retitled and relaunched a year later as Awesome Adventures, featuring a <b>foreshortened</b> story from Moore's script and notes. This followed the publication of a Glory Preview issue (#0) by Moore for a series that would not see print from Awesome. (Ultimately, and also plagued by similar delays, a couple of issues of Moore's Glory finally saw print from Avatar Press in 2001/2002).|$|E
25|$|Unlike some of Pisanello's other {{portrait}} medals, such {{as those}} of Leonello d'Este, the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the right. Behind him, mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and <b>foreshortened.</b> The emperor wears his distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reigns of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. The gesture of the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is framed in the bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October, having reached Ferrara, the Pope {{raised the}} stakes by {{ordering}} Baldwin actually to demolish his new headquarters, to desecrate {{the site and}} to suspend its clergy, to restore {{all members of the}} existing chapter to office and to refrain from further actions against them while the case continued. He was given 30 days to comply. Southern alleges that Peter made a last, personal appeal to his old teacher while riding from Verona to Ferrara, and that the Pope was so incensed by the attempt to circumvent legal procedure that he died the following day of a heart attack. Kingsford's account is much less dramatic, without the <b>foreshortened</b> time scheme. The Pope's letter from Ferrara seems to have preceded his death by some weeks: he died on 19 October and was buried on the 20th, while Pope Gregory VIII was elected on 21 October, as Honorius reported to his monks. Peter's own later account of Urban's death has him taken ill while changing horses, shortly after Peter had approached him, but also mentions he contracted dysentery on the journey from Verona - an entirely plausible cause of death. The new pope moved the court to Pisa on its way towards Rome. He seems to have been less sympathetic to the Cathedral chapter but made no further decisions before he died at Pisa in December and was succeeded by Pope Clement III.|$|E

500|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the image upon the viewer is attributed to what E. B. Goldstein has called the 'differential rotation effect.' Because of this effect, Kitchener's eyes and his <b>foreshortened</b> arm and hand appear to follow the viewer regardless of the viewer's orientation to the artwork. Historian Carlo Ginzburg compared Leete's image of Kitchener to similar images of Christ and Alexander the Great as depicting the viewer's contact with a powerful figure. Pearl James commented on Ginzburg's analysis agreeing that {{the strength of the}} connotation lies with a clever use of discursive psychology and that art historical methods better illuminate why this image has such resonance. The capitalized word [...] "YOU" [...] grabs the reader, bringing them directly to Kitchener's message. The textual focus on [...] "you" [...] engages the reader about their own participation in the war. Nicholas Hiley differs in that Leete's portrayal of Kitchener is less about immediate recruiting statistics but the myth that has grown around the image, including ironic parodies. Leete's Kitchener poster caught the attention of a then eleven-year-old George Orwell, who may have used as it the basis for his description of the [...] "Big Brother" [...] posters in his novel 1984.|$|E
