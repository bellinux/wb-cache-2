40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} about {{the formation of the}} Democratic Labor Party(DLP). Its prime aim will be to show that ideology was the overriding factor which brought about the DLP's existence. In attempting to prove this contention the following thesis will be subdivided into three parts. Firstly, an emphasis will be placed on outlining the lack of historiographical consensus concerning the DLP's formation. Three main schools of thought will be identified. It is hoped the inconsistencies within each group will allow the reader to see the scope that exists for a new argument. Secondly, this thesis will argue that the DLP's existence was d i r e c t l y related to the Catholic Social Studies Movement (Movement) and ALP Industrial Groups. This connection will be highUghted by drawing together <b>DLP</b> <b>policy,</b> Movement/Industrial Group directives, populist ideals and views from contemporaries associated with Democratic Labor. Issues concerning the family, economics, social decentralisation and patriotism will all be used to illustrate and reinforce this link. Thirdly, this thesis will introduce some key Catholic activists and discuss their definition of "true" Labor ideals. By bringing forward this final point, the following thesis will seek to complete the argument that ideology {{was at the heart of}} the DLP's genesis and existence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{complexity}} of satisfiability for DLP + dyn, an expressive logic introduced by Demri that allows to reason about dynamic <b>policies.</b> <b>DLP</b> + dyn extends the logic DLPdyn of Pucella and Weissman, which in turn extends van der Meyden’s Dynamic Logic of Permission (DLP). DLP + dyn generously enhances DLP and DLPdyn by allowing to update the policy set by adding or removing policy transitions, which are defined as a direct product of two sets, each spec-ified by a formula of the logic itself. It is proven that satisfiability for DLP + dyn is complete for deterministic exponential time. Our results close the complex-ity gap of satisfiability for DLP + dyn from 2 EXP, and for DLPdyn from NEXP, to EXP respectively, matching the EXP lower bound both inherit from Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). To prove the EXP upper bound for DLP + dyn, we first proceed by accurately identifying a suitable generalization of PDL, which allows to use compressed programs and then find a satisfiability preserving translation from DLP + dyn to this extension of PDL. To finally show the EXP upper bound for, we prove that satisfiability of our extension of PDL lies in EXP. DLP + dyn...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{extensive}} education reform programme, Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) is currently introducing a Dual Language <b>Policy</b> (<b>DLP)</b> in which English, maths and science are to be taught fully {{through the medium of}} English while other subjects are taught through Arabic with the goal of producing biliterate school graduates. The DLP has already been implemented in Grades 1 - 6 and it is hoped that it will be migrated into secondary schools by 2015. The success of any major educational policy innovation is dependent on professional support at many levels, including that of teachers. For this reason it is important to explore teachers’ perspectives of the policy and how the policy might be in alignment or conflict with their professional identities. This study has adopted a discursive understanding of identity and a post structural theoretical framework. Using semi-structured interviews, observations and documentary analysis, this study sought firstly to explore the primary discourses which shape Emirati female secondary school maths teachers’ professional identities. It then identified their perspectives on the DLP before exploring how their identities explained these perspectives. The research found that the importance of childhood experiences in education, gendered roles, Islam, professional roles, relationships with students and their perspectives of society’s view of them as secondary maths teachers were key aspects of participants’ professional identities. It also found that teachers had fragmented identities resulting in mixed perspectives on the DLP. In some regard, this resulted in positivity towards the policy although simultaneously they felt their identities were threatened by it, causing them to view its implementation with caution. These threats were clustered around three main areas relating to pedagogic beliefs, their work ethic and linguistic and nationalistic discourses. A significant finding of this study was that the participants held differing views regarding the principles behind the DLP. Some teachers had accepted the policy ideologically, having adopted a position which assumed the neutrality of English, while others expressed strong views against the encroachment of English in education and society more generally. Nevertheless, there was agreement across the participants that while English was necessary in 21 st century Abu Dhabi, it must remain a second language. While this is the stated intention of the DLP, teachers expressed limited awareness of how Arabic is being protected and promoted by ADEC, causing further animosity towards the policy. By adopting a post structural position, this research demonstrates the complexity of the situation as teachers find themselves caught in the intersection of multiple, and often conflicting, discourses. It shows that contrary to the prevailing belief, teachers are neither powerless nor passive but are exercising their power, at the micro level, through acts of negotiation, resistance and subversion. By drawing attention to these teachers’ discursive positionings, ‘framing discourses’, such as those related to patriarchy, Islam and linguistic imperialism, are highlighted. These are shown to both shut down and open up possibilities of being (Keddie, 2011), emphasizing the limited space these subjects have to manoeuvre in. By exploring the construct of teacher identities in the Emirati context and relating it to the practical aspect of policy implementation, this study aims to highlight its relevance to education reform and contribute to a gap in the field. It is hoped that through this, teacher identity will become a more significant part of the educational discourse in this region, disrupting the continued epistemic privilege of Western-informed views of education...|$|R
