5|$|He {{was chosen}} to chair a {{committee}} set up in 1951 to revise {{the rules of the}} Assembly. During a session on March 21, 1952, Dawson was pushed to name Arthur Wray, MLA for Banff-Cochrane, after Wray made remarks towards a provincial official at a committee meeting. When asked by Dawson to withdraw the remarks, Wray refused, prompting Dawson to name him and order his removal from the chamber. A unanimous motion was later passed to suspend Wray for two sitting days, or until he withdrew <b>his</b> <b>remarks</b> and delivered an apology to the chamber. Wray returned four days later, issuing an apology and retracting <b>his</b> <b>remarks.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Fuseli {{had been living}} with Johnson and he also lost all of his possessions, {{including}} the first printing of <b>his</b> <b>Remarks</b> on the Writings and Conduct of J. J. Rousseau. Johnson and Payne subsequently dissolved their partnership. It was an amicable separation, and Johnson even published some of Payne's works in later years.|$|E
5|$|His {{performances}} {{backed up}} <b>his</b> <b>remarks,</b> {{as he started}} the 2007 outdoor season with two wind-assisted runs of 9.79s and 9.76s. The latter time was recorded with a wind only 0.2m/s over the allowed limit, and was superior to Powell's record of 9.77s.|$|E

5|$|Speaking at a Chautauqua {{conference in}} Jūrmala, Latvia in June 1986, Matlock {{told the crowd}} that the United States did not {{recognize}} the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union. <b>His</b> <b>remarks</b> are credited by Dainis Īvāns, leader of the Popular Front of Latvia, with galvanizing the independence movement in Latvia.|$|E
5|$|The Movie and Television Review and Classification Board {{also became}} {{increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} scandal due to the escalating on-air feuds between Willie and Joeyasking Willie to make an on-air apology about <b>his</b> <b>remarks</b> towards Joey on the September 4 episode of Wowowee.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>Remarks</b> {{upon the}} Life of Jan Zamoyski (Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1787), {{published}} anonymously {{on the eve}} of the Great Sejm, transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth. It became a model for other similar works and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, Chekhov {{undertook}} {{an arduous}} journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the Russian Far East and the katorga, or penal colony, on Sakhalin Island, north of Japan, {{where he spent}} three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. The letters Chekhov wrote during the two-and-a-half-month journey to Sakhalin {{are considered to be}} among his best. <b>His</b> <b>remarks</b> to his sister about Tomsk were to become notorious.|$|E
5|$|In the 1948 King's Birthday Honours, Kippenberger was {{appointed}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The same year, {{he was also}} elected Dominion President of the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RSA), a position he would hold until 1955. While serving as RSA president, he courted controversy by his outspoken opposition to the All Blacks tour of South Africa in 1949, {{on the basis of}} the exclusion of Maori players from the team. While forced to apologise for <b>his</b> <b>remarks,</b> he received much support from Maori veterans.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website. He {{explained}} that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said <b>his</b> <b>remarks</b> were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. They added {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to <b>his</b> <b>remarks</b> on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make <b>his</b> <b>remarks</b> in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with <b>his</b> <b>Remarks</b> on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.|$|E

5|$|South African {{track and}} field athletes won a {{combined}} 17 medals at the Games, four gold, seven silver and six bronze. Sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who carried the nation's flag at the opening ceremony, was the most successful South African athlete winning individual gold in the T44 400 metres, gold in the 4×100 metres relay T42-46, setting world records in both, and individual silver in the T44 200 metres. In the 200 metres event Pistorius set a new world record in his heat, but he was defeated in the final by Brazilian Alan Oliveira. After the race Pistorius raised an issue {{about the length of}} Oliveira's blades, he later apologised for the timing of <b>his</b> <b>remarks,</b> but not the content of his complaint. The IPC confirmed the length of Oliveira’s blades were proportional to his body and legal, but expressed willingness to engage with Pistorius about the issue.|$|E
5|$|Within <b>his</b> <b>Remarks,</b> Staszic did not {{portray the}} life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In Remarks he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.|$|E

Lewis had no connection with the cult; <b>his</b> <b>remark</b> had been a grisly coincidence.|$|R
