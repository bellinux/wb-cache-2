5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now <b>glowed</b> <b>with</b> a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism {{continued}} to have a hold {{on the minds of}} Anglo-Saxon people into the Christian eras. The interiors of churches would have <b>glowed</b> <b>with</b> colour, and the walls of the halls were painted with decorative scenes from the imagination telling stories of monsters and heroes like those in the poem Beowulf. Although nothing much is left of the wall paintings, evidence of their pictorial art is found in Bibles and Psalters, in illuminated manuscripts. The poem, 'The Dream of the Rood', is an example how symbolism of trees was fused into Christian symbolism.|$|E
25|$|In Aman, Fëanor, son of Finwë, King of the Noldor, {{created the}} Silmarils, jewels that <b>glowed</b> <b>with</b> {{the light of}} the Two Trees. Melkor, who had been held in captivity by the Valar, was {{eventually}} released after feigning repentance. Upon release, Melkor deceived Fëanor into believing that his eldest half-brother Fingolfin was attempting a coup against Finwë. This rift led to the banishment of Fëanor from the Noldor city Tirion, and Fëanor thereafter created the fortress Formenos to the North of Tirion. Finwë moved to Formenos to live with Fëanor, his favorite of three sons, and there they safely kept the Silmarils. After many years, Fëanor traveled to Tirion to make amends with Fingolfin, while Finwë stayed at Formenos. While making amends, Melkor destroyed the Two Trees with the help of Ungoliant, a dark spider Melkor found in Avathar, on the Southeast side of Aman. Together, Melkor and Ungoliant then escaped to Formenos, killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. Melkor kept the Silmarils and banished Ungoliant, later attacking the Elvish kingdom of Doriath. He was defeated in the first of five battles of Beleriand, however, and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of Angband.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, O'Hara helped run her third husband's flying {{business}} in St Croix in the American Virgin Islands, and edited a magazine, but later sold {{them to spend}} more time in Glengariff in Ireland. She was married three times, and had one daughter, Bronwyn (1944–2016) to her second husband. Her autobiography, [...] 'Tis Herself, was published in 2004 and became a New York Times Bestseller. In November 2014, she was presented with an Honorary Academy Award with the inscription [...] "To Maureen O'Hara, one of Hollywood's brightest stars, whose inspiring performances <b>glowed</b> <b>with</b> passion, warmth and strength".|$|E
500|$|Coolbrith also mentored young Isadora Duncan {{who later}} {{described}} Coolbrith as [...] "a very wonderful" [...] woman, with [...] "very beautiful eyes that <b>glowed</b> <b>with</b> burning fire and passion". Magazine writer Samuel Dickson reported that, at a soirée in 1927, an aging Coolbrith {{told him of}} the famous lovers she had known, {{and that she had}} once dazzled Joseph Duncan, Isadora's father. Coolbrith said that his attentions led to the breakup of his marriage. Duncan's mother left San Francisco and settled her four children in Oakland, little knowing that Coolbrith would soon meet one of her children, and help the young dancer develop a wider knowledge of the world through reading. Duncan wrote in her autobiography that, as a librarian, Coolbrith was always pleased with the youthful dancer's book choices, and that Duncan did not find out until later that Coolbrith was [...] "evidently the great passion of [...] life".|$|E
