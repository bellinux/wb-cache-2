50|$|Key FeaturesREA is an electro {{mechanical}} device {{mounted on the}} compressor housing and connected to the VNT (for diesel applications) or the wastegate (for gasoline applications). In diesel applications, the electronic control of diesel fuel injection in recent years precipitated {{the need for the}} electronic control of airflow. Working in conjunction with Honeywell VNT turbos, the REA provides this control in both steady state and transient mode by knowing and controlling the vane position. It communicates with the <b>Engine</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Unit</b> (EMU) in either analogue, PWM or CAN form, receiving and carrying out instructions instantaneously. In gasoline applications, REA works through the control of the wastegate.|$|E
5000|$|Volkswagen's [...] "defeat device" [...] is {{specially}} written <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>unit</b> firmware that detects [...] "the {{position of}} the steering wheel, vehicle speed, {{the duration of the}} engine's operation, and barometric pressure" [...] when positioned on a dynamometer using the FTP-75 test schedule. These criteria very closely match the EPA's required emissions testing protocol which allowed the vehicle to comply with emissions regulations by properly activating all emissions control during testing. The EPA's NOV alleged that under normal driving conditions, the software suppressed the emissions controls, allowing better fuel economy, at the expense of emitting up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed by law.|$|E

50|$|On 18 September 2015 the US EPA and California Air Resources Board served {{notice to}} VW that {{approximately}} 480,000 VW and Audi automobiles equipped with 2.0 TDI engines {{sold in the}} US between 2009 and 2015 had an emissions compliance defeat device installed. The defeat device, {{in the form of}} specially crafted <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>unit</b> firmware, detects emissions testing conditions, and in such conditions will cause the vehicle to comply with emissions regulations by properly activating all emissions controls. However, under normal driving conditions, the emissions controls are suppressed, allowing the engine to produce more torque and get better fuel economy, at the expense of emitting up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed by law. Such NOx emission levels are not in compliance with US regulations. VW has since admitted to these allegations, and said that the illegal software was in use in its diesel cars worldwide, affecting some 11 million vehicles.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{automotive}} {{engines are}} digitally controlled using an <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>unit</b> (EMU) that is typically manually programmed using an engine dynamometer to obtain desired levels of power, emissions and effciency. Closed-loop control of an engine dynamometer and EMU, {{combined with an}} overall engine tuning algorithm, is used to automate the tuning of the engine map for a four-cylinder engine. The tuning algorithm determines the air-to-fuel ratio necessary for each region of engine speed and throttle position to obtain the desired performance, automatically moving to each operating region in the map. Preliminary automated tuning results produce power output curves comparable with those delivered using the original manufacturer tuned EMU. At lower engine speeds data filtering is required and results in power outputs slightly lower than the factory-tuned engine. At higher speeds small improvements in engine efciency, for equivalent performance, can be found. The research presented clearly demonstrates that engine tuning to a very high standard, equivalent to original equipment manufacturer engine performance, can he successfully automated, saving time and adding consistency to the engine tuning process...|$|E
40|$|A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) {{is defined}} by its unique {{characteristics}} involving both the cyber and physical domains. Their hybrid nature introduces new attack vectors, but also provides an opportunity to design new security defenses. In this paper, we present a new domain-specific security mechanism, FIRED, that leverages physical properties such as inertia of the CPS to improve security. FIRED is simple to describe and implement. It goes through two operations: Reset and Diversify, as frequently as possible [...] typically {{in the order of}} seconds or milliseconds. The combined effect of these operations is that attackers are unable to gain persistent control of the system. The CPS stays safe and stable even under frequent resets because of the inertia present. Further, resets simplify certain diversification mechanisms and makes them feasible to implement in CPSs with limited computing resources. We evaluate our idea on two real-world systems: an <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>unit</b> of a car and a flight controller of a quadcopter. Roughly speaking, these two systems provide typical and extreme operational requirements for evaluating FIRED in terms of stability, algorithmic complexity, and safety requirements. We show that FIRED provides robust security guarantees against hijacking attacks and persistent CPS threats. We find that our defense is suitable for emerging CPS such as commodity unmanned vehicles that are currently unregulated and cost sensitive...|$|E

40|$|Piezoelectric {{injectors}} {{allow to}} inject precise proportional quantities of fuel at extremely high speed. Controlled by pulses from the <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>unit,</b> they work like solenoid valves, {{opening and closing}} back very rapidly, spraying the exact quantity of fuel determined by the injection computer into the engine combustion chambers. However, {{for this type of}} injectors an impulse of a hundred volts is applied in order to actuate them. This is a big concern in automotive environment, where the 12 V battery voltages is still the main power source available. Therefore, a power converter is needed to interface battery voltage and piezo actuator; for mechanical and electrical reasons (weight, dimensions and power losses) a switching amplifier is preferred with respect to linear amplifier, especially for this type of applications where efficiency and weight are the main issues. Fig. 1 presents a switching amplifier for piezo actuator: it consists of two components, a unidirectional DC/DC converter with a small input power that loads a large buffer capacitor and a bidirectional DC/DC converter, which controls the energy alternating between the buffer capacitor and the piezo actuator. The requirements on the unidirectional DC/DC converter are few. It only needs to compensate for the power losses of the two stages plus the energy dissipated in the actuator and the connected mechanical system [6]. Conventional DC/DC boost converter is not the best solution in piezoelectric based applications where a high step up ratio (more than 20) and high efficiency power conversion is required. Flyback converter could be an alternative topology but presents high switching losses and it has an insulated output, so not compliant with electrical load specification. An efficient high-step up DC/DC converter is presented for interfacing the standard 12 V battery with the high voltage DC-bus used for piezoelectric actuators system. In the proposed converter, two coupled inductor boost converters are interleaved and controlled by an FPGA. Different types of control techniques could be used to limit the input current [7]; the solution presented herein allows fast transient response and best performances with respect to traditional control techniques. Moreover the implemented technique has the advantages of lower electromagnetic emission and higher operating frequency capability, compared to the standard fixed frequency control; on the other hand it is difficult to design the EMI filter due to the intrinsic variable frequency. The high computational load of the control algorithms forces the use of an FPGA implementation in order to achieve the desired accuracy in real time control at the frequency of the PWM signal needs for the DC/DC converter, which will be 200 kHz. Design and analysis of the proposed converter are presented. Finally, experimental results are reported in order to validate the proposed converte...|$|E
