5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E
5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E
25|$|When {{the amount}} of one <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{production}}</b> increases, {{the production of the}} good that uses that particular production factor intensively increases relative to the increase in the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> as the H–O model assumes perfect competition where price is equal to the costs of factors of production. This theorem is useful in explaining the effects of immigration, emigration, and foreign capital investment. However, Rybczynski suggests that a fixed quantity of the two factors of production are required. This could be expanded to consider factor substitution, in which case the increase in production is more than proportional.|$|E

50|$|A {{single market}} has many benefits: with full freedom of {{movement}} for all the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> between the member countries, the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> become more efficiently allocated, further increasing productivity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{are owned}} by {{households}} and they supply these <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to firms and in return earn wages, interest, rent and profit. Households buy goods and services with this money.|$|R
25|$|Solow {{extended}} the Harrod–Domar model by adding labor as a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and capital-output ratios {{that are not}} fixed {{as they are in}} the Harrod–Domar model. These refinements allow increasing capital intensity to be distinguished from technological progress.|$|E
25|$|The Magnification effect {{shows that}} trade {{liberalization}} actually makes the locally-scarce <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> worse off (because increased trade makes the price index fall {{by less than}} the drop in returns to the scarce-factor induced by the StolperSamuelson theorem).|$|E
25|$|The law of {{diminishing}} marginal utility {{is similar to}} the law {{of diminishing}} returns which states that as the amount of one <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.|$|E
50|$|Neoclassical economics, {{one of the}} {{branches}} of mainstream economics, started with the classical <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> land, labor, and capital. However, it developed an alternative theory of value and distribution. Many of its practitioners have added various further <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (see below).|$|R
50|$|In the “long run”, all <b>of</b> these <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> can be {{adjusted}} by management. The “short run”, however, {{is defined as a}} period in which at least one <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is fixed.|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} model which {{generates a}} Balassa–Samuelson effect has two countries, two goods (one tradable, and a country specific nontradable) and one <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> labor.

25|$|The {{exogenous}} rate of TFP (total factor productivity) {{growth in}} the Solow–Swan model is the residual after accounting for capital accumulation. The Mankiw, Romer and Weil model provides a lower estimate of the TFP (residual) than the basic Solow–Swan model because the addition of human capital to the model enables capital accumulation to explain more {{of the variation in}} income across countries. In the basic model the TFP residual includes the effect of human capital because human capital is not included as a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{economic}} {{compensation is}} merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment {{may be related to}} that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a graduate degree represents the acquisition of expertise (a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production)</b> that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner. As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on educational attainment (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being. The following chart further explains the strong correlation between educational attainment and personal as well as household income.|$|E
25|$|Wieser {{based his}} theory of {{imputation}} {{on the assumption that}} <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are combined in fixed proportions in each industry, but at different rates in different industries.

50|$|In 1933 Ohlin and Heckscher {{proposed}} the Heckscher-Ohlin Model of International Trade, which claims that countries will export products that use their abundant and cheap <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and import products that use their scarce <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> In 1977 Ohlin {{was awarded a}} share of the Nobel Economics Prize.|$|R
500|$|Fetter notably debated Alfred Marshall, {{presenting}} a theoretical reassessment of land as capital. Fetter's arguments have {{been credited with}} prompting mainstream economists to abandon the Georgist idea [...] "that land is a unique <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and hence {{that there is any}} special need for a special theory of ground rent...." [...] A proponent of the subjective theory of value, Fetter emphasized the importance of time preference and rebuffed Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure time preference theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book, The Rate of Interest.|$|E
500|$|Fetter's {{stand on}} this issue further led him to oppose Georgist ideas like the land value tax. Mark Blaug, a {{specialist}} {{in the history of}} economic thought, credits Fetter and John Bates Clark with influencing mainstream economists to abandon the idea [...] "that land is a unique <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent.... This is in fact the basis of all the attacks on Henry George by contemporary economists and certainly the fundamental reason why professional economists increasingly ignored him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within the {{framework}} of the neoclassical theory <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> there does also exist a law of diminishing returns. However, this law does not directly concern profit yields, but rather the variability of output yields in response to variations in the use <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (capital, labor and land). The [...] "returns" [...] are not profits, but output values. This law is linked to profitability only indirectly, insofar as profit in neoclassical theory is defined as the cost (or the price) of using capital, where capital (including land) is one <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} of {{the rate}} development <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> was obtained.

2500|$|Market {{supply and}} demand are {{aggregated}} across firms and individuals. Their interactions determine equilibrium output and price. [...] The market {{supply and demand}} for each <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is derived analogously to those for market [...] to determine equilibrium income and the income distribution. [...] Factor demand incorporates the marginal-productivity relationship of that factor in the output market.|$|E
2500|$|However, Sraffa {{then pointed}} out that this {{accurate}} measuring technique still involved the rate of profit: the amount of capital depended on the rate of profit. This reversed the direction of causality that neoclassical economics assumed between the rate of profit {{and the amount of}} capital. Further, Sraffa showed that a change in the rate of profit would change the measured amount of capital, and in highly nonlinear ways: an increase in the rate of profit might initially increase the perceived value of the truck more than the laser, but then reverse the effect at still higher rates of profit. See [...] "Reswitching" [...] below. The analysis further implies that a more intensive use of a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> including other factors than capital, may be associated with a higher, not lower price, of that factor.|$|E
2500|$|The Ricardian {{model of}} {{comparative}} advantage has trade ultimately motivated by differences in labour productivity using different [...] "technologies". Heckscher and Ohlin {{did not require}} production technology to vary between countries, so (in the interests of simplicity) the [...] "H–O model has identical production technology everywhere". Ricardo considered a single <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (labour) {{and would not have}} been able to produce comparative advantage without technological differences between countries (all nations would become autarkic at various stages of growth, with no reason to trade with each other). The H–O model removed technology variations but introduced variable capital endowments, recreating endogenously the inter-country variation of labour productivity that Ricardo had imposed exogenously. With international variations in the capital endowment like infrastructure and goods requiring different factor [...] "proportions", Ricardo's comparative advantage emerges as a profit-maximizing solution of capitalist's choices from within the model's equations. The decision that capital owners are faced with is between investments in differing production technologies; the H–O model assumes capital is privately held.|$|E

40|$|Many {{nations with}} {{transition}} economies {{are attempting to}} develop their national competitiveness through such processes as privatisation of state owned enterprises (SOEs) and/or the use of economic liberalisation (e. g. lessening of tariffs, industry regulations, etc.) to spur economic growth and development as a complement to privatisation. The impact <b>of</b> the intermediary <b>factor</b> markets <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and the entrepreneur has largely been underestimated and unexplored {{in the context of}} transition economies. Drawing upon economic market transition and entrepreneurship theories, a theoretical framework of the transition process from a command to a market economy is proposed of the interdependent relationships of transition policies, intermediary <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and entrepreneurship. We base our categorization <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> markets <b>of</b> <b>production</b> from Porter’s (1990) perspective of basic and advanced <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> A key premise of our article concerns a nation’s ability and capability of generating basic and advanced <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> that enable the nation’s economy to move from a command to a market oriented.

2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal physical product of labor. More importantly for the discussion here, the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the cost of borrowing funds) is supposed to equal the marginal physical product of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) will lead to more of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing marginal returns implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming profit maximization.|$|E

50|$|An {{economy is}} {{dependent}} on the production of goods and services, hence factors of production are required for the production of goods and services. They are broadly divided in the three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. Land is the primary <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Labor is the specific <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and payment is made in the form of wage. Capital is regarded as secondary <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> as it can be manipulated by economic activity. Payment received would be in the form of interest.
