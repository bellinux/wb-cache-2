40|$|The {{obligations}} {{deriving from}} {{participation in the}} World Trade Organization are never inherently indivisible or erga omnes in the sense elaborated by the International Court of Justice {{in the field of}} human rights. As a rule, remedies for violations of WTO obligations remain available only to the Member(s) whose international trade interests have been affected, in actual or potential terms. Nonetheless, contracting parties have decided to extend to a limited number of WTO obligations the legal regime of <b>indivisible</b> <b>obligation</b> and to consider immaterial for the purpose of resorting to the dispute settlement system the effects of their violations. WTO obligations, therefore, are not a monolithic bloc. They may be divided into two categories which are governed by different rules as far as legal standing and counter-measures are concerned. Depending on whether the obligation allegedly breached belongs to one or the other category, the nullification or impairment of benefits is presumed – but can be challenged – under Article 3 (8) of the DSU or is entirely irrelevant. Furthermore, countermeasures are normally proportionate or equivalent to the nullification or impairment of the benefits of the complainant. In the case of WTO obligations treated as indivisible obligations, however, the effects of the violation are immaterial and the trade interests of the complainant may well be unaffected. As a result, counter-measures are to be permitted {{to the extent that they}} will effectively ensure compliance. Special problems may finally arise in the case of multiple applicants, especially when the countermeasures are authorized at different times...|$|E
40|$|From the {{analytical}} viewpoint a norm can formally {{be regarded as}} a right-duty (or claim-obligation) relation (1) that regulates behaviour (action/inaction) (2) among subjects (3) in definite space (4) and time (5). Consequently, a legal order can be defined as a system of right-duty (or claim-obligation) relations that regulate behaviour (action/inaction) among subjects in definite space and are procedurally organised in the vertical and horizontal sense according to time. An iconic representation of these minimum necessary concepts allows switching from natural language to a purely formal representation of the legal system(s) (deontic network). Within this ‘geometrical’ frame, general principles (the ‘basis’) of (international) law can be conceived of as general obligations, i. e. obligations erga omnes (towards everyone). Obligations erga omnes (ties), indivisible or divisible because of their content, link a subject (node) to every other subject of international law, endowed with a correlative claim (s – s), so that the whole obligations erga omnes are matched by the whole claims erga omnes of all the subjects of international law. <b>Indivisible</b> <b>obligations</b> erga omnes are unavailable from the viewpoint of the power, so cogentes, breaches violate necessarily all the correlative claims, possibly enabling every subject to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as <b>indivisible</b> <b>obligations</b> erga omnes, the violation of which allows universal enforcement. Nevertheless, specifically by reason of the gravity of the breach, it is possible to split primary and secondary norms, conceiving of the sanction as a bilateral relation allowing solely reciprocal enforcement {{in the case of an}} infringement. Divisible obligations erga omnes are available from the viewpoint of the power, so dispositivae, breaches must be seen as relative, enabling only the subject(s) injured to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as bilateral obligations, the infringement of which gives rise to reciprocal enforcement. Nevertheless, it is possible to figure out that specifically the gravity of the breach ‘unifies’ the primary divisible obligation, allowing universal invocation of the responsibility, so that the secondary obligation could be either bilateral or a general indivisible one, respectively permitting relative or absolute enforcement in the case of a breach...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the years, {{international}} legal society {{has become increasingly}} interdependent. States and international organizations (IOs) engage in cooperative activities and pursue common goals that cannot be achieved by any of them independently. In this context of interdependence, cooperation and pursuance of common interests one might expect that states and/or IOs do not only share rights and legal interests (which is generally recognized in {{international legal}} literature) but that they may also share international obligations. In practice, there are various situations in which multiple states and/or IOs are bound to an international obligation {{in the context of}} cooperative activities and the pursuance of common goals. Moreover, one may find an increasing number of references to international obligations that are 'shared', 'joint' or 'collective' in legal literature, which suggests that the idea that the fulfilment of international obligations is not always up to one duty-bearer only is gaining support. Nevertheless, there has been no comprehensive attempt to define what it means to speak of shared obligations in international law. This thesis examines the topic of shared obligations in international law, and answers the following research question: in what situations are international obligations shared rather than individual, and {{what are the implications of}} a breach of a shared obligation for the international responsibility of states and/or IOs? The study distinguishes between two types of shared obligations: divisible and <b>indivisible</b> shared <b>obligations.</b> It finds that the relationship between shared obligations and shared responsibility depends on whether the shared obligation breached is divisible or indivisible...|$|R
