6000|$|All naturalists, with, {{as far as}} I know, {{a single}} exception, believe that the several {{domestic}} breeds of the rabbit are descended from the common wild species; I shall therefore describe them more carefully {{than in the previous}} cases. Professor Gervais (4/1. M.P. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' 1854. tome 1 page 288.) states [...] "that the true wild rabbit is smaller than the domestic; its proportions are not absolutely the same; its tail is smaller; its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair; and these characters, without speaking of colour, are so many indications opposed to the opinion which unites these animals under the same specific denomination." [...] Few naturalists will agree with this author that such slight differences are sufficient to separate as distinct species the wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit.</b> How extraordinary it would be, if close confinement, perfect tameness, unnatural food, and careful breeding, all prolonged during many generations, had not produced at least some effect! The tame rabbit has been domesticated from an ancient period. Confucius ranges rabbits among animals worthy to be sacrificed to the gods, and, as he prescribes their multiplication, they were probably at this early period domesticated in China. They are mentioned by several of the classical writers. In 1631 Gervaise Markham writes, [...] "You shall not, as in other cattell, looke to their shape, but to their richnesse, onely elect your buckes, the largest and goodliest conies you can get; and for the richnesse of the skin, that is accounted the richest which hath the equallest mixture of blacke and white haire together, yet the blacke rather shadowing the white; the furre should be thicke, deepe, smooth, and shining;...they are of body much fatter and larger, and, when another skin is worth two or three pence, they are worth two shillings." [...] From this full description we see that silver-grey rabbits existed in England at this period; and what is far more important, we see that the breeding or selection of rabbits was then carefully attended to. Aldrovandi, in 1637, describes, on the authority of several old writers (as Scaliger, in 1557), rabbits of various colours, some [...] "like a hare," [...] and he adds that P. Valerianus (who died a very old man in 1558) saw at Verona rabbits four times bigger than ours. (4/2. U. Aldrovandi 'De Quadrupedibus digitatis' 1637 page 383. For Confucius and G. Markham see a writer who has studied the subject in 'Cottage Gardener' January 22, 1861 page 250.) ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the fact}} of the rabbit having been domesticated at an ancient period, we must look to the {{northern}} hemisphere of the Old World, and to the warmer temperate regions alone, for the aboriginal parent-form; for the rabbit cannot live without protection in countries as cold as Sweden, and, though it has run wild in the tropical island of Jamaica, it has never greatly multiplied there. It now exists, and has long existed, in the warmer temperate parts of Europe, for fossil remains have been found in several countries. (4/3. Owen 'British Fossil Mammals' page 212.) The <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit</b> readily becomes feral in these same countries, and when variously coloured kinds are turned out they generally revert to the ordinary grey colour. (4/4. Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' 1801 b. 1 page 1133. I have received similar accounts with respect to England and Scotland.) Wild rabbits, if taken young, can be domesticated, though the process is generally very troublesome. (4/5. 'Pigeons and Rabbits' by E.S. Delamer 1854 page 133. Sir J. Sebright 'Observations on Instinct' 1836 page 10) speaks most strongly on the difficulty. But this difficulty is not invariable, as I have received two accounts of perfect success in taming and breeding from the wild rabbit. See also Dr. P. Broca in 'Journal de la Physiologie' tome 2 page 368.) The various domestic races are often crossed, and are believed to be quite fertile together, and a perfect gradation can be shown to exist from the largest domestic kinds, having enormously developed ears, to the common wild kind. The parent-form must have been a burrowing animal, a habit not common, as far as I can discover, to any other species in the large genus Lepus. Only one wild species is known with certainty to exist in Europe; but the rabbit (if it be a true rabbit) from Mount Sinai, and likewise that from Algeria, present slight differences; and these forms have been considered by some authors as specifically distinct. (4/6. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. des Mammiferes' tome 1 page 292.) But such slight differences would aid us little in explaining the more considerable differences characteristic of the several domestic races. If the latter are the descendants of two or more closely allied species, these, {{with the exception of the}} common rabbit, have been exterminated in a wild state; and this is very improbable, seeing with what pertinacity this animal holds its ground. From these several reasons we may infer with safety that all the domestic breeds are the descendants of the common wild species. But from what we hear of the marvellous success in France in rearing hybrids between the hare and rabbit (4/7. See Dr. P. Broca's interesting memoir on this subject in Brown-Sequard 'Journ. de. Phys.' volume 2 page 367.), it is possible, though not probable, from the great difficulty in making the first cross, that some of the larger races, which are coloured like the hare, may have been modified by crosses with this animal. Nevertheless, the chief differences in the skeletons of the several domestic breeds cannot, as we shall presently see, have been derived from a cross with the hare.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Infrared video {{observations}} {{were used to}} study behaviour in the nestboxes of both adult wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> A total of 1080 hours of observations of wild rabbits and 1008 hours of observations of <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> kept in two enclosures with free access to two nestboxes and some other hiding-places were analysed. Both wild and <b>domestic</b> adult <b>rabbits</b> spent a considerable part of their time (54. 9 % in wild and 30. 6 % in <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits)</b> in pairs or in groups of three and voluntarily were in body contact between 65. 3 % (<b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits)</b> and 80. 4 % (wild rabbits) of the time. While crouching together, both wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> used {{only a very small}} nestbox space: 0. 08 to 0. 125 m 2 /animal in wild and 0. 14 to 0. 21 m 2 /animal in <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m., an average of 2. 9 animals from a maximum of 3 wild rabbits stayed in the nestboxes. <b>Domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> used nestboxes less: an average of 0. 9 adults were in the nestbox between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m.

In the present study, a serological survey was conducted to detect the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with rabbit chlamydiosis in northeast China, including Liaoning province, Jilin province, Heilongjiang province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Antibodies to Chlamydia were determined by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). The overall seroprevalence was estimated at 17. 88 % in total of 800 blood samples. The Chlamydia seroprevalence varied in <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> from different factors, and genders of <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> were considered as major risk factors associated with Chlamydia infection.

40|$|A benign, infectiqus, {{cutaneous}} tumor of rabbits, the Shope papilloma, {{is caused}} by a virus that upon inoculation in either <b>domestic</b> or cottontail <b>rabbits</b> induces papiUomas with great regularity (1).

This finding does not prove, of course, that the virus is absent from the papillomas of <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> On the contrary, some immunological evidence for its presence in such papillomas and in the cancers derived from them has been presented (10, 11).
