30|$|Prior to the 2011 reform, the {{two most}} {{relevant}} reforms took place in 1997 and 2002. In 1997, {{the number of years}} required to be entitled to a retirement pension was increased from 8 to 15 years with the corresponding timetable. Moreover, the period for calculating the reference wage was extended from 8 to 15 years and the replacement rate was established as 50 % for the first 15 years of contributions. Each additional year up to year 25 adds 3 % and from that year onwards, each additional year adds another 2 % until reaching 100 % for 35 years of contributions. Pensions have been indexed to inflation since this reform. Later, the 2002 reform allowed for <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> at 61 for those workers that had not contributed before 1967 and had contributed a minimum of 30 years. Moreover, it also introduced changes to the penalization coefficient for <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> and a <b>premium</b> for late <b>retirement</b> was introduced (2 % per additional year beyond 35 years of contributions or qualifying years).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Switzerland {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{employment}} rates of older individuals among industrialized countries. Nevertheless, in the past decade, Switzerland has experienced a marked trend toward <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> This study analyzes the motives of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in Switzerland in the 1990 s. The three main groups of motives that cover about 70 % of all <b>early</b> <b>retirements</b> are "personal reasons", company reorganizations", and "poor health". The incidence of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> due to corporate restructuring has significantly increased during the economic recession of the mid- 1990 s. Contrary to other European countries, early exits from the labor force have not been promoted by public policies. In an international comparison, Switzerland thus has a relatively low frequency of <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> Furthermore, involuntary <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> is relatively rare in Switzerland, but often encountered in countries in which strict employment protection legislation forces firms to use <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> as a means to circumvent such legislation...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: Job {{characteristics}} play a {{major role}} in shaping employees’ <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decisions. Research purpose: The objective of this study was to examine the mechanisms through which job characteristics associate with <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention, using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework. Motivation of the study: <b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> presents a threat to existing health and pension systems, and to organisational functioning. Therefore, it is important to examine how workrelated factors contribute to <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decisions. Research design, approach and method: Two parallel processes were theorised to shape <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention: a health impairment process (i. e. job demands → recovery need → <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention) and a motivational process (i. e. job resources → work enjoyment → <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention). Survey data were collected from a heterogeneous sample of 1812 older workers (age > 45). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Main findings: Job demands and job resources were both associated with work enjoyment, which was associated with <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention. Recovery need did not add to the prediction of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention. Practical/managerial implications: To retain older workers, companies should promote work conditions and practices that keep older workers motivated. Good health may be a necessary condition for retaining older workers, but it does not appear to be a sufficient one.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} whether <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> patterns vary between countries with distinct <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> systems. By choosing countries that differ not only {{with respect to the}} coverage and generosity of publicly provided pensions but also with respect {{to the extent to which}} the state interferes in the non-public pillars of pension provision, we analyse to what extent such issues have an effect on individual <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> behaviour. Selectivity effects are expected to be stronger in countries with highly fragmented public systems or private <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> schemes. By pursuing a shift to more private pension provisions, governments might unintentionally create more inequality in <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> opportunities among the population.

Based on the literature, we created the <b>Early</b> <b>Retirement</b> Model. This study aims to investigate whether data support the model and {{how it could be}} improved. Methods Employees aged 58 – 62 years (N= 1862), who participated in the first three waves of the Dutch Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM) were included.

Results Testing the <b>Early</b> <b>Retirement</b> Model resulted in a model with good fit. Health, job characteristics, skills, and social and financial factors were related to the ability, motivation and/or opportunity to work (significant β range: 0. 05 – 0. 31). Lower work ability (β= - 0. 13) and less opportunity to work (attitude colleagues and supervisor about working until age 65 : β= - 0. 24) predicted <b>early</b> <b>retirement,</b> whereas the motivation to work (work engagement) did not.

In this study, some of the pertinent research relative to perceptions of teachers toward <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> was examined and a number of general hypotheses which related the needs of teachers to three <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> options were tested. ^ Subjects consisted of 216 teachers having 30 or more years of experience in education and representing six classes of Nebraska school districts as categorized by the Nebraska Department of Education. Two instruments were utilized to collect data from the sample population. The initial instrument was a questionnaire consisting of 18 variables and describing three <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> incentive options. The options involved payment of a stipend to reduce losses from Social Security and from the state teacher retirement fund incurred by <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> A third <b>retirement</b> incentive allowed <b>early</b> retirees to work part time for the district following retirement. Respondents were asked to rank order the retirement options and also to rate the degree of acceptance of each retirement option proposed in the study and to select the age at which they would accept a preferred <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> option should it be adopted by their school district. The second data collecting technique was an interview with 15 respondents to the initial questionnaire. A structured interview format was utilized to focus upon the attitudes and feelings of the participants regarding <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> ^ The study involved the use of correlation and crosstabulation analysis to test the relationship between the variables selected for examination with the three <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> options proposed in the study. The variables consisted of the enrollment and class of Nebraska school district as well as personal characteristics of the respondents. ^ Findings indicated significant relationships between selected variables and each of the three <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> options. Solicited anecdotal data from the interview phase were summarized in the study. An analysis of fiscal implications was provided for school districts and for teachers upon adoption of the <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> options proposed in the study. ...|$|R
30|$|Technical {{progress}} affects <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in {{two opposing}} ways. On the one hand, it increases real wages and thus produces {{an incentive to}} postpone retirement. On the other hand, it erodes workers’ skills, making <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> more likely. We re-examine the effect of technical progress on <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in the US. We measure technical change during the whole working life of the individuals and find that {{its effect on the}} probability of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> is non-monotonic. In particular, when technical change is small, the erosion effect dominates, but when it is large the wage effect dominates. These results may signal that the higher the technical change, the more willing are the elderly to retrain, which has direct policy implications for the design of elderly training programs.|$|R
40|$|In many {{countries}} <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> {{has become a}} personnel strategy. The establishments are interested in hiring younger employees and try to avoid 'deferred payments' which arise if older employees are paid above their productivity. Firms enter into contracts with their employees that include clauses about <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> In response to demand or technological shocks, workers receive retirement offers from their employers which cannot be rejected by rational actors. Using the IAB Establishment Panel 2003 - 2006, the relation between indicators of demand and technological shocks and the incidence and quantity of <b>early</b> <b>retirements</b> is analyzed. Thus, {{our findings suggest that}} firms' personnel policies affect the employees' decisions about <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> " (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en)) Frührentner, Personalpolitik, ältere Arbeitnehmer, Lohnhöhe, IAB-Betriebspanel, vorgezogene Altersgrenze, Vorruhestand, Berufsausstieg...|$|R
40|$|We analyze two social {{security}} reforms aimed at increasing working lifetimes. The first reform eliminates <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> provisions, {{while the second}} increases both the age of early eligibility and the normal retirement age. We and that although both reforms increase the participation rates of older workers, the elimination of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> provisions reduces future {{social security}} imbalances if benefits taken early are not reduced actuarially. Additionally, we nd that both reforms increase aggregate hours and output, although e ciency gains derived from {{the elimination of the}} <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> scheme are distant from previous estimates since labor supply could be less responsive. Finally, we also nd that the output gap brought about by the <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> scheme may decrease in coming decades...|$|R
