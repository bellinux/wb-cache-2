500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{displays}} Milo's growth; Leonard S. Marcus in {{his notes}} to its annotated edition {{writes that the}} boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions {{that he will not}} make up his mind again without a good reason. [...] Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same. According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E
2500|$|Hume's {{solution}} to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences.

Kenyon writes: [...] "Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment...</b> but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief." [...] Commentators such as Charles Sanders Peirce have demurred from Hume's solution, while, some, such as Kant and Karl Popper, saw that Hume's analysis [...] "had posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well, father. But <b>just</b> think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Place {{yourself}} in Luke's position. The very {{idea that you}} might be suspected must in itself be terrible." ...|$|R
