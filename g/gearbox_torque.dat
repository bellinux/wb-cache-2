25|$|The vintage era {{lasted from}} the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to {{dominate}} with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary <b>gearbox,</b> <b>torque</b> converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just {{at the end of the}} vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).|$|E

The brake drums and back plates were designed specifically for the Loyd.|$|E
30|$|When {{electronic}} dynamometers {{are used}} to analyze the operation of the sucker-rod pumping system then calculation of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> is only possible if the change of crank angle with time, θ(t), is inferred from dynamometer measurements.|$|R
30|$|The {{calculation}} model just described solves {{the basic problem}} of calculating <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> by providing the variation of crank angles with time during the pumping cycle based on measured dynamometer data. The crank angle versus time function, θ(t), thus determined {{is used for the}} calculation of the angular acceleration of the crankshaft {{as well as that of}} the beam, as detailed in the following.|$|R
30|$|For {{the beam}} pumping units, {{reduction}} of the polished rod load or the <b>gearbox</b> net <b>torque</b> is an effective method to improve its system performance, because the amplitude value and the fluctuation of the <b>gearbox</b> net <b>torque</b> reflect the running condition of this oil wells system. The oilfield engineers had redesigned the beam pumping units by many methods in order to decrease the polish load and the energy.|$|R

30|$|Power {{requirements}} and profitability of sucker-rod pumping are basically {{determined by the}} torque load on the pumping unit’s <b>gearbox.</b> <b>Gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> include the torque required to drive the polished rod and the torque used to rotate the counterweights. In addition to these, inertial torques arise in {{those parts of the}} pumping unit that turn at varying speeds. As shown in the paper, all torque components are functions of the crank angle; consequently, their exact calculation necessitates the knowledge of the crank angle versus time function. This circumstance, however, complicates torque calculations because contemporary dynamometers, used to acquire the necessary operating data, do not provide any information on the variation of the crank angle during the pumping cycle. The paper introduces a solution of the problem and presents an iterative calculation of the crank angle versus time function from dynamometer data. Based on this function crank velocity, crank acceleration, as well as beam acceleration can be calculated and all necessary <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> can be evaluated. For calculating articulating inertial torque, the acceleration pattern of the walking beam during the pumping cycle is evaluated according to three different models and the accuracy of those is compared. The paper gives the details of the developed calculation models and presents a typical sample case.|$|R
30|$|Power {{costs in}} sucker-rod pumping {{operations}} {{are related to}} the surface power required to drive the pumping system. This power, in turn, depends mainly on the mechanical torque required at the gearbox of the pumping unit. Thus, proper calculation of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> during the pumping cycle is crucial for determining the power requirements and operating costs of sucker-rod pumping. Torques on the crankshaft of the gearbox are classified as static torques required to move the polished rod and the counterweights, and inertial torques representing the energy stored in and released from the accelerating/decelerating parts of the pumping unit (Takacs 2003).|$|R
50|$|Gustav Bauer, {{director}} of the marine engine section, supervised the work of Hermann Föttinger on the Fottinger hydraulic transmitter known as Vulcan Coupling and Vulcan Drive or fluid coupling. In 1924, Vulcan's Hermann Rieseler invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary <b>gearbox,</b> <b>torque</b> converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (The less-sophisticated Hydra-Matic, which used a simple fluid coupling, would only become an available option on Oldsmobiles in 1940.) The original coupling further developed in collaboration with Harold Sinclair of Fluidrive Engineering of Isleworth for Daimler of Coventry and matched with a manually controlled epicyclic gearbox went into production in England in 1929.|$|E

30|$|The torque {{factor of}} the four-bar linkage is an {{important}} factor to determine the fluctuation of the <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque</b> curve. The phased pump units and the dual-horsehead pump units all have excellent wording performance to be benefit for decreasing the polished rod load and <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque.</b> Based on the Fourier expansion theory of the polished rod torque, the energy-saving mechanism of the multi-crank balance was disclosed perfectly, and the secondary balance technique has verified the validity of this theory. The flywheel-energy-storage device can improve the motor efficiency and decrease the <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
50|$|They can be finely {{controlled}} and provide high torque from rest, unlike internal combustion engines, {{and do not}} need multiple gears to match power curves. This removes the need for <b>gearboxes</b> and <b>torque</b> converters.|$|R
5000|$|A third coaxial shaft {{connects the}} low {{pressure}} power turbine to the 5.3 m diameter, eight-bladed, composite propeller, via an offset reduction gearbox. Maximum power output is 11,000 shp installed. (The <b>gearbox</b> output <b>torque</b> {{is up to}} 100 kNm).|$|R
30|$|When calculating <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> on a pumping unit, {{two basic}} cases can be {{distinguished}} depending on the angular velocity of the crankshaft (a) those with a constant or nearly constant, and (b) those with varying crankshaft velocities. In the majority of pumping installations, the crankshaft’s angular velocity is constant during the pumping cycle and matches the measured pumping speed. These are the cases when the gearbox is properly counterbalanced and an electric motor with a low slip drives the pumping unit (Takacs 2003). The API Spec. 11 E (API 2008) suggests that up to a speed variation of 15  % over the average pumping speed, neglecting inertial effects does not introduce errors greater than 10  % in torque calculations.|$|R
30|$|Beam {{balance method}} is an {{effective}} complement method to decrease the <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
30|$|The beam {{pumping units}} applied in {{oilfield}} {{for more than}} 150  years, because it had the advantages of simple structure, reliable and durable. At present, it {{is still one of}} the most important artificial lift methods in the world. Due to the inherent structure of the beam pumping units, the balanced torque curve of gearbox has a bigger fluctuation ratio and negative torque that results low motor efficiency and load impact. Because the motor efficiency is directly proportional to the fluctuation ratio of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque,</b> many researchers designed many types of energy-saving devices to improve the system efficiency. Therefore, based on the balance theory of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque,</b> we introduced and discussed some significant energy-saving technologies, such as phased pumping units, dual-horsehead pumping units, shock absorber device, load reducer device, lower barbell pumping units, multi-balance device, flywheel-energy-storage device, variable speed drive device. Meanwhile, we also pointed out the future research direction.|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{inherent}} {{characteristics of the}} four-bar linkage of the beam pumping units, although the torque balance reaches the industry standards, it still has many disadvantages, such as poor balance effect, bigger fluctuation of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque,</b> existence of negative torque, lower work efficiency, bigger consumption of energy, phenomenon of “a big horse pulls a small carriage”. Most of the system efficiency of the beam pumping units is less than 30 % (Zhou 2011); this means that will waste vast energy.|$|E
30|$|The basic {{requirement}} for the calculation of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> is the knowledge of polished rod loads in the function of crank angle since rod torque is found by multiplying the load and the torque factor belonging to the same crank angle. This condition, however, is not met if data recorded on conventional dynamometer cards are used to find polished rod loads because these cards record the load against polished rod displacement. Thus the load versus crank angle function, F(θ), must be derived before the torques on the speed reducer can be calculated. The procedure introduced in API Spec.  11 E (API 2008) and widely {{used for this purpose}} is based on data obtained from a conventional dynamometer survey.|$|R
50|$|While early railcars were {{propelled}} by steam, petrol, and diesel engines, modern railcars are usually {{propelled by}} a diesel engine mounted underneath {{the floor of}} the coach.

30|$|To {{improve the}} system {{efficiency}} and working performance of beam pumping units, many production engineers devoted to research many energy-saving technologies for the beam pumping units {{based on the}} <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque</b> curve, and some technologies had achieved very good effects. This paper will introduce some technologies such as phased pumping units, dual-horsehead pumping units, shock absorber device, load reducer device, lower barbell pumping units, multi-balance device, flywheel-energy-storage device, and variable speed drive device. Meanwhile, we also discuss their merits, demerits and the future research direction.|$|E
30|$|When the {{pumping unit}} {{is driven by}} a multicylinder engine, a high-slip, or even an ultra-high-slip (UHS) {{electric}} motor, the angular velocity of the crankshaft changes during the pumping cycle: the crank speeds up when the unit is lightly loaded and slows down as the load becomes heavier. The high accelerations/decelerations coupled with the heavy rotating masses give rise to inertial torques because of the flywheel effect; <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque</b> calculations must be appropriately modified to include these effects. In such cases, {{in addition to the}} torques normally present on the gearbox and discussed so far, articulating and rotary inertial torques must be also calculated (Gibbs 1975).|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} previously, {{the basic}} requirement for an accurate calculation of <b>gearbox</b> <b>torque</b> components from dynamometer survey data is {{the knowledge of}} the variation of crank angle versus time. The iterative procedure developed in this paper accomplishes this task by finding inferred crank angles from which the acceleration patterns of the pumping unit’s different parts are also found. All these kinematic parameters being available at this point, the calculation of torque components is straightforward. To illustrate the necessary calculations for the example problem, let’s find the gearbox torques at a time t =  1.0  s where the measured polished rod load is F(t) =  19, 617  lb, and the crank angle calculated with the iterative procedure developed in this paper is θ(t) =  47.35 °.|$|E
50|$|The 6HP32 is a {{variation}} of the 6HP26 for high-output applications. The <b>gearbox's</b> maximum input <b>torque</b> is 750 Nm.|$|R
30|$|<b>Torques</b> on the <b>gearbox</b> {{are found}} from the {{variation}} of the polished rod load during the pumping cycle; torque calculations, therefore, depend on the accurate measurement of those loads. These are obtained from a dynamometer survey {{which is the most}} valuable tool for analyzing the performance of the pumping system. Polished rod dynamometers, as the name implies, are instruments recording polished rod loads during the pumping cycle. The conventional dynamometer produces a continuous plot of polished rod load versus polished rod displacement, the so-called dynamometer diagram or card. Modern dynamometers, on the other hand, are electronic devices that record the loads and displacements at the polished rod in the function of time. Because of the operating differences of the two dynamometer types different procedures must be used to derive <b>gearbox</b> <b>torques</b> depending on the device used, as discussed in the following.|$|R
50|$|Moto Guzzi {{increased}} the pushrod-operated V-twin's {{bore and stroke}} to give a displacement of , and replaced manual <b>gearbox</b> with a <b>torque</b> converter built by Sachs, and two-speed gearbox.|$|R
30|$|As already discussed, gearbox torques are {{normally}} calculated based on dynamometer measurements {{that provide the}} variations of polished rod loads and positions. Modern dynamometer systems register these data in function of time but give no information on the crank angles valid at the measured times. This circumstance, however, prohibits a direct calculation of gearbox torques because all torque components depend on the crank angle, θ. Rod torque changes with the torque factor that varies with the crank angle; counterbalance torque is a direct function of crank angle, see Eqs.  1 – 3. Inertial torques are found from the acceleration patterns of different components of the pumping unit, these also change with the variation of the time history of crank angle. <b>Gearbox</b> <b>torque</b> components, therefore, can only be calculated if the change of crank angle with time, θ(t), is determined from dynamometer measurements.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', {{to their}} {{standard}} 3-speed manual <b>gearbox.</b> The <b>torque</b> converter allowed {{the car to}} remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired. Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.|$|R

The transmission is a conventional automatic <b>gearbox</b> with a <b>torque</b> converter offering the driver fully automatic operation or manual selection of the gear ratios.|$|R
30|$|The beam {{pumping units}} can be {{simplified}} to the four-bar linkage; the rotary {{motion of the}} motor is converted into the reciprocating motion of the rod pump with low transmission efficiency. The <b>torque</b> of <b>gearbox</b> is cyclical and like a sinusoidal curve. Some researchers (Zhang and Li 2009; Zou et al. 2005) attempt to make the <b>gearbox</b> static <b>torque</b> relatively flat {{as far as possible}} by taking a variety of energy-saving technology, to decrease the peak torque and the root mean square torque, and eliminate the negative torque in order to decrease energy consumption.|$|R
