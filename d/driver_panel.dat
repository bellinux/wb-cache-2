25|$|Thirty new train units (named DT3) {{were ordered}} {{and have been}} {{delivered}} for U3 operations. Those trains are designed to operate without a driver, controlled by an ATC system from Siemens, and will provide the passengers with an unobstructed view from the front window into the tunnel. A normally locked <b>drivers</b> <b>panel</b> exists at every front window which enables service employees to drive DT3 units by hand if required. As with all Nuremberg subway trains, these units consist of two carriages and are half the platform length. They can be run as a single unit (short train) or coupled as double unit (long train), depending on passenger numbers. For {{the first time in}} a Nuremberg subway train, the two carriages of a unit are built with an accessible gangway. This is intended to improve passenger distribution in the train as many stations in the system have their exits at the very ends of the platform and therefore often the first and the last carriages of a 4 carriage (long) train are rather full, while the two middle carriages are relatively empty.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the time varying dispersion in city house price levels across the four biggest euro area countries {{compared with those}} in the United States. Using available city-level data over the period 1987 - 2008, it tests for price convergence and analyses key factors explaining price differentials in a panel regression framework including per capita income, population and relative distances. Results indicate limited evidence of convergence in city-level house prices despite synchronised cycles in the national aggregates for most countries since the 1990 s. There is an important role for income differentials in explaining city-level house price dispersion in Germany, France, and the US (but not in Italy or Spain once unobserved city factors are taken into account). At the same time, population differences across cities play a role, though this appears to be associated with amenities specific to a particular location. In general, there has been a lower dispersion of city-level house prices in the four largest euro area economies compared with the US in conjunction with a lower estimated income elasticity for house price differentials. The results, particularly for income, appear to be robust to restricting the analysis to large urban centres.

40|$|Duration {{models are}} still very {{uncommon}} in transportation analysis, although they have been extensively applied in some other fields (medicine, labour market economics). The model system developed in this paper contains several submodels, one of them being a duration model for the time elapsed between two vehicle transactions. In {{the first wave of}} a new car <b>drivers</b> <b>panel,</b> questions were asked about the respondents' present and previous vehicle. The answers to these questions are used to estimate a model system with four components: (i) models for vehicle holding duration (in months); (ii) models for the choice of vehicle type; (iii) regression equations for annual kilometrage; (iv) regression equations for fuel efficiency. For the duration model several assumptions on the form of the hazard function are tested, as well as functional forms which account for heterogeneity and time-varying covariates. The type choice model is a logit model for the new car conditional on replacement. The regression equations are estimated using selectivity correction terms. In the paper we discuss the specification of the model, describe the dataset used and present the main estimation results. Finally, the estimated models are used in predicting the next wave (1 yr ahead) and in various policy simulation runs. We hope to extend this model system in the future to a dynamic simulation system which covers all types of vehicle transactions for a multi-year period. ...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} move, Carpenter {{unveiled}} {{major changes}} for its 1996 product line. On the outside, the body now wore full-length guard rails above the wheels. Under the skin, the body was redesigned with single-piece roof bows; new welding procedures allowed by the equipment at Richmond strengthened roof joints (unlike a crucial structural flaw later found in Mitchell-produced buses). Inside the bus, Wayne tooling was used to update {{certain areas of the}} Carpenter buses; on conventional buses, Carpenter re-used the <b>driver</b> control <b>panel</b> and windshield from the Wayne Lifeguard; all full-size buses would use Wayne entry doors.|$|R
50|$|In the {{development}} of the Saf-T-Liner C2, many advancements were made in {{the development}} of the interior of the school bus. In previous conventional-style school buses, from the firewall rearward, few parts from the chassis manufacturer were retained aside from the steering column and instrument cluster. For the design of the C2, Thomas and Freightliner designed the vehicle to retain the dashboard of the Freightliner M2 106 in its entirety. Only a few changes were made, with the ignition moved to the center of the dashboard, as a <b>driver</b> switch <b>panel</b> was located to the left of the driver (full-size school buses do not have a traditional driver-side entry door).|$|R
50|$|The Staghound was an {{innovative}} design that incorporated some advanced features.

Additionally, a power steering pump was incorporated that could be switched on or off manually from the <b>driver's</b> instrument <b>panel</b> depending on steering conditions. Steering and suspension components were directly attached to the hull as the structure was rigid enough to dispense with the need for a separate chassis.|$|R
40|$|Loudspeaker {{research}} {{has been carried out}} for many years and some of the latest developments involve a panel to produce the sound. Using panels to produce sound offers many possible advantages – for example, it is possible to create sound using a window or a house wall. However, to make these new sound devices feasible, it is necessary to investigate further the exact frequency response of these drivers, how they compare with traditional technologies and how efficient they are. This {{research has}} been focussed on the optimisation of gel-type <b>panel</b> <b>drivers</b> and their performance under different conditions. Gel-based drivers have their structure based on soft rubber type materials (gel), and that same gel transfers the vibrations from the <b>driver</b> to the <b>panel.</b> In addition, this thesis covers the development of design tools necessary to predict and improve the gel-based drivers performance. Consequently, a Finite Element Analysis package was employed to enable the simulation of the gel-based drivers. Laser Doppler vibrometer measurements to validate the process were also carried out. Other factors investigated included gel hardness, driver position on the panel, panel material and overall frequency response compared to conventional loudspeaker technology.

50|$|In the R300 drivers, {{released}} {{alongside the}} GTX 680, Nvidia {{introduced a new}} feature called Adaptive VSync. This feature is intended to combat the limitation of v-sync that, when the framerate drops below 60 FPS, there is stuttering as the v-sync rate is reduced to 30 FPS, then down to further factors of 60 if needed. However, when the framerate is below 60 FPS, {{there is no need}} for v-sync as the monitor will be able to display the frames as they are ready. To address this issue (while still maintaining the advantages of v-sync with respect to screen tearing), Adaptive VSync can be turned on in the <b>driver</b> control <b>panel.</b> It will enable VSync if the framerate is at or above 60 FPS, while disabling it if the framerate lowers. Nvidia claims that this will result in a smoother overall display.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on delinking and Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for municipal waste production in Italy. First, methodological issues and literature on delinking and EKC for waste are critically re-examined. Secondly, we analyse two very disaggregated panel datasets on Italian Regions and Provinces (1996 - 2004 {{data for the}} 20 regions, 2000 - 2004 data for the 103 provinces) to estimate {{the extent to which}} delinking between waste production and economic drivers is taking place. The empirical analysis of different specifications shows mixed evidence in favour of an EKC relationship. Evidence supporting an EKC hypothesis significantly arises at a provincial level, which presents a very high data heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the turning point is at very high levels of added value per capita (around 23, 000 - 26, 000 €), which characterise a very limited number of wealthy (Northern) Italian provinces. The analysis does not reveal a similar evidence for the regional dataset: only a relative delinking dynamic emerges at the provincial level, we also note a positive relationship between waste production and the share of separated waste collection, which {{can be explained by the}} sharp difference in income and waste-policy performance between Northern and Southern Italy. Population density is not significant. Finally, the test on some policy proxies, i. e. the diffusion of the new waste tariff regime at the local-level and the ability of utilities to recover waste service cost, leads to the conclusion that they are not (yet) impacting waste production. To lower the turning points and to avoid an increasing gap between geographical areas, innovative (market based) and more effective policy instruments should be implemented. In particular, the weight of waste policies should be rebalanced towards waste prevention targets and instruments, in line with the priorities stated by the EU and Member Countries. In fact, the indirect feedback effect of good post-production waste management policies/practices on reducing waste production at a source can be weak and slow. In general, the results confirm that more geographically-disaggregated data may offer more insights with respect to cross-country datasets, also from the policy perspective.
