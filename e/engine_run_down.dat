50|$|The Juggernaut is {{a diesel}} railway lorry {{made out of}} bits, bobs and flanged wheels, which appears {{towards the end of}} the series. Due to its brakes being as {{unreliable}} as its <b>engine,</b> it <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> a hill and falls into the lake soon after starting service, nearly killing Idris, whom it was carrying on a chestnut barrow.|$|R
25|$|American Airlines Flight 96, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, on 12 June 1972. The {{failure of}} the rear cargo door caused an {{explosive}} decompression, which in turn caused the rear main cabin floor to collapse and severed flight controls. The pilots had only limited ailerons and elevators; the rudder was jammed. The number two <b>engine</b> also <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> to idle {{at the time of}} decompression. The aircraft landed safely at Detroit-Metropolitan Airport.|$|R
5000|$|The latter {{involved}} a Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer 3 (registration: G-ANTP) carrying three crew members on a demonstration {{flight from the}} Indian Air Force (IAF) base at Jorhat Rowriah Airport, Assam, in northeast India. Shortly after takeoff from the IAF's Rowriah Airport base on an evaluation flight, the aircraft's no. 1 <b>engine</b> <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> at a height of 30 to 40 ft. The aircraft continued to climb to 100 ft, when it yawed left and lost height. This resulted in the aircraft striking the ground and bursting into flames on impact, killing all three occupants. Investigators attributed the accident to [...] "an attempt to climb the aircraft on a single engine with full flaps and slats during the takeoff when its all-up weight was near its maximum limit". This resulted in the aircraft losing its forward speed, stalling and crashing due to an inadequate climb performance in such configuration under the conditions it was operating.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} the farm {{buildings}} {{are based on the}} design in Poundley’s Cottage Architecture which was published in 1857. Poundley was the architect for the Naylor Estates and worked from Black Hall in Kerry. [...] The intention was to build a smaller version of the Victorian Model or Industraial Farms of the mid- 19th century. Poundley would have been working on the much larger farm complex which he had designed for John Naylor at Leighton Hall near Welshpool. Poundley published layout has been modified and scaled down at Upper Pengelli. The long spinal building with a central ventilator, that was for cattle stalls was shortened and pigsties and sheepfolds were parallel with, rather than at right angles to the spinal building. As in the plan the hay barn with its ventilated brick windows and the stabling is at right angles. There was also a root store for feeding the cattle and a raised seed store. The sheep fold later was adapted to be used as cart sheds. The farm would have been highly mechanised with a drive shaft, possibly powered by a steam <b>engine,</b> that <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the spinal building.|$|R
5000|$|... ====EMD 'pancake' diesels==== A new {{aluminum}} block lightweight compact {{engine was}} designed that ran {{at a higher}} rpm. These engines feature a vertical crankshaft and the cylinders were arranged in an X pattern of four cylinder banks in four cylinder rows. These were the 16-184 and 16-338 [...] "pancake" [...] engines. The 16-388 engine was 13.5 ft {{from the base of}} the generator to the top of the air intake filter and 4 ft wide. It is a mechanically injected two-stroke diesel engine that used a roots blower. The 16-184A was installed in some 110 ft subchasers of the [...] during World War II. The two [...] 16-184A diesel engines driving two shafts produced a faster subchaser that achieved 21 knots. The EMD 16-338 developed [...] at 1600 rpm. On the top was an air intake then four layers of four cylinders each. Each cylinder had a 6 in bore and a 6+1/2 in stroke. On the bottom of the crank shaft was an Elliot generator which developed 817 kW at a maximum of 710 volts DC. This proved problematic as the <b>engine</b> fluids <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> into the generator. The whole engine weighed just over eight tons.

40|$|The need {{to ensure}} {{diversity}} in energy supply and its long-term sustainability necessitated the quest for renewable energy sources.
