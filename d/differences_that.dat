5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E

5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E

5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. <b>Differences</b> <b>that</b> were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} of the carnivores, the family Canidae is {{represented}} by the two extinct subfamilies designated as Hesperocyoninae and Borophaginae, and the extant subfamily Caninae. This subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives. All living canids as a group form a dental monophyletic relationship with the extinct borophagines with both groups having a bicuspid (two points) on the lower carnassial talonid, which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication. This together with the development of a distinct entoconid cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower molar, and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar and reduction of its parastyle distinguish these late Cenozoic canids and are the essential <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> identify their clade.|$|E

5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E

The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O.

While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.
