5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual.

They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press.

This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of <b>his</b> <b>manager,</b> realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager.

I sued <b>his</b> <b>manager.</b>|$|E
