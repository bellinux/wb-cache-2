40|$|AbstractFinal flexion {{mobility}} after a total knee arthroplasty is {{an important}} factor in patient comfort. Some patients <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion mobility, others do not. Is it possible to identify the clinical factors related to the patient that predicted the final <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion?Materials and methodsA multicenter retrospective study directed by the Société française de la hanche et du genou (SFHG) was conducted on 1601  cases of total knee arthroplasty that had presented no complications and a minimal follow-up of 2  years. The <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion was assessed by the difference between the preoperative and the final range of flexion. The range of the <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion was tested based on eight factors: age, gender, etiology, body mass index, frontal deformity, preoperative flexum deformity and four levels of preoperative mobility: <  90 °, 90 °– 109 °, 110 °– 129 °, and ≥  130 °. ResultsA mean <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion of 8. 4 °± 14 ° was found for the overall series. In 66 % of cases, we found an increase of flexion and in 19 % a loss of flexion. In cases with BMI higher than 35, varus deformity with an HKA angle< 166 °, or flessum greater than 5 °, the <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion was significantly higher. A significantly different <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion (P< 0. 0001) was found in the four levels of preoperative flexion: the greatest <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion was found in the “< 90 °” group, then this <b>gain</b> was less <b>in</b> the next two groups, to become a significant decrease in the “≥ 130 °” group. A decrease in flexion was noted in 51 % of the cases in the latter group. Other factors such as age, sex, and etiology had no influence on the <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion. DiscussionAfter TKA, a <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion was often noted. The amount of gain depended on the preoperative range of flexion: the lower this level was, the more flexion increased. The presence of a varus deformity, morbid obesity, or flessum was associated with greater <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> flexion, even if the final flexion was lower than the mean flexion in the overall population.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak, after cardiac {{rehabilitation}} (CR), is associated with reduced mortality and morbidity. We have previously shown that the VO 2 peak improvement in CR, after myocardial infarction (MI), is significantly lower in Type 2 diabetic (T 2 D) patients and that response to CR seems to be impaired by poor glycemic control. Thus, we set up a prospective multicenter study (DARE Study) in order to determine whether good glycemic control during CR may improve the <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak. MethodsFifty six T 2 D patients referred to CR after MI were randomized in an intensive treatment group (basal-bolus insulin) or in a control group (usual treatment). Fructosamine {{at the end of the}} CR program was used to assess mean glycemic level during the CR period. ResultsFor the whole diabetic population studied, mean <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak after CR was 2. 7 ± 2. 4 ml/kg/min. <b>Gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 Peak after CR was negatively correlated with basal (r=- 0. 32, p< 0. 05) and final fructosamine (r=- 0. 36, p= 0. 01) and with basal (r=− 0. 36, p< 0. 05) and final HbA 1 c (r=- 0. 34, p< 0. 05). At the end of the CR program, the <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak and the reduction in mean fructosamine were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups. But, patients with final fructosamine below the median value showed significantly higher <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak (3. 5 ± 2. 5 vs. 1. 7 ± 2. 4 ml/kg/min, p= 0. 014). <b>In</b> multivariate analysis <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak was associated with final fructosamine (p= 0. 019) but not with age, gender, duration of diabetes, MI location, insulin treatment or basal fructosamine. In conclusion, the DARE study shows that fructosamine at the end of the CR-program is an important determinant of <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak in T 2 D patients and that good glycemic control in CR is associated with significantly better <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak, independent of the treatment used (insulin or not). ConclusionThese data indicate that good glycemic control of type 2 diabetes in CR, after MI, is mandatory in order to get optimal <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> VO 2 peak...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Palsy of a nerve {{might be}} {{expected}} to lower vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responses in its fields of motion, but effects of peripheral neuromuscu-lar disease were unknown. We recorded the VOR during sinusoidal head rota-tions in yaw, pitch, and roll at 0. 5 – 2 Hz and static torsional <b>gain</b> <b>in</b> 43 patients with unilateral nerve palsies. Sixth nerve palsy (n = 21) reduced both abduction and adduction VOR <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> darkness. In light, horizontal visually enhanced VOR (VVOR) <b>gains</b> were normal <b>in</b> moderate and mild palsy. In severe palsy, horizontal VVOR <b>gains</b> remained low <b>in</b> the paretic eye when it was fixating, whereas <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> the nonparetic eye became higher than normal. Third nerve palsy (n = 10) decreased VOR and VVOR gains during abduction, adduction, elevation, depression, extorsion, and intorsion. Fourth nerve palsy (n = 13) re-duced VOR gains of the paretic eye during intorsion, extorsion, elevation, de-pression, abduction, and adduction, but in light vertical and horizontal VVOR <b>gains</b> were normal. <b>In</b> the nonparetic eye, all gains were normal. Reduced VOR <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> the direction of paretic muscles and also in the direction of their antag-onists, together with normal <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> the nonparetic eye, indicate a selective ad-justment to the antagonists of paretic muscles. Increase of VVOR <b>gains</b> to normal <b>in</b> the paretic eye, when used for fixation, without conjugate increase <b>in</b> <b>gains</b> <b>in</b> the occluded nonparetic eye, provides further evidence of selective ad-aptation for the paretic eye.
