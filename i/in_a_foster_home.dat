Suspecting child abuse, Bernhardt S.

On that same day, Annie Santosky gave birth to Jed, the couple's third child.

5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} three {{factors that may}} predict attachment patterns and behavior problems of children in foster care: length of time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single <b>foster</b> <b>home,</b> presence of biological and/or adopted children in the <b>foster</b> <b>home,</b> and parenting stress. Participants included 50 primarily African American 8 to 12 year old foster children and their foster caregivers. Data were obtained using the Parenting Stress Index, Beech Brook Attachment Disorder Questionnaire, and Child Behavior Checklist. Correlations revealed that high negative attachment and low positive attachment {{were significantly related to}} greater behavior problems. Regression analyses revealed that time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> was <b>a</b> significant predictor of positive attachment, with more time in the current placement related to less positive attachment. Trends further indicated that presence of other children and extended time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> predicted high negative attachment. Implications of the findings for practitioners and policy makers are discussed...|$|R

25|$|When Manson's {{mother and}} her brother were sentenced to five years' {{imprisonment}} for robbing a Charleston, West Virginia, service station in 1939 by brandishing a ketchup bottle, Manson {{was placed in the}} home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia. Upon her 1942 parole, Manson's mother retrieved her son and lived with him in a series of run-down hotel rooms. Manson himself later characterized her physical embrace of him on the day she returned from prison as his sole happy childhood memory. In 1947, Kathleen Maddox tried to have her son placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> but failed because no such home was available. The court placed Manson in the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute, Indiana. After 10 months, he fled from there to his mother, who rejected him.|$|E

25|$|When {{her client}} Sekou Bah (J. Mallory Cree) is killed in and framed for a {{terrorist}} attack, Carrie begins to investigate. She goes {{to talk with}} Sekou's family, leaving Quinn to watch Frannie. A group of protestors, angered by leaked reports that Carrie was Sekou's lawyer, gather outside Carrie's house; this triggers Quinn's PTSD, and he shoots one of the protestors and takes a reporter hostage. Carrie manages to talk Quinn down so he will be taken in alive. Dar Adal - the mastermind of the attack - exploits the situation by telling Children's Protective Services (CPS) that Carrie put Frannie in danger, in order to drive Carrie over the edge and discredit her in Keane's eyes. The plan works: CPS put Frannie <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> <b>home,</b> and Carrie falls into an alcoholic despair that motivates Keane to question her judgment.|$|E

2500|$|Bunker {{was born}} [...] "on New Year's Eve, 1933" [...] into a troubled family in Los Angeles. His mother, Sarah (née Johnston), was a chorus girl from Vancouver, and his father, Edward N.

[...] When they divorced, Bunker ended up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> {{at the age}} of five, but he felt profoundly unhappy and ran away. As a result, Bunker went through a progression of increasingly draconian institutions. Consistently rebellious and defiant, young Bunker was subjected to a harsh regime of discipline. He attended a military school for a few months, where he began stealing and eventually ran away again, ending up in a hobo camp 400 miles away. While Bunker was eventually apprehended by the authorities, this established a pattern he would follow throughout his formative years.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers have posed a few core {{explanations}} for the overrepresentation of LGBT youth in the general United States homeless youth population. LGBT youth {{are more likely to}} be homeless because they run away or are evicted due to family conflict surrounding their sexual orientation or behavior. This explanation is supported by a 2011 survey study of a representative Massachusetts high school sample that found that LGBT youth were no more likely to be homeless and living with their parents than non-LGBT youth. Therefore, according to the study's authors, it may not be that LGBT youth {{are more likely to be}} part of a homeless family, but rather that their higher rate of homelessness is caused by being more likely to be evicted or run away. A 2008 study using in-person interviews found that among youth who experienced homelessness for more than six months, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were more likely than heterosexual youth to report being verbally or physically harassed by family. In addition, LGBT youth are more likely to be homeless due to physical or sexual abuse experienced at home. [...] The Hetrick-Martin Institute showed that among homeless queer girls aged 13–15 in New York City, that 50% of them were homeless because they were fleeing familial corrective rape. [...] In the background of both these explanations is the fact that, since the family conflicts associated with LGBT youth occur relatively late in a youth's development, LGBT youth are much less likely to be placed in foster care. Those who are placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> find an unwelcoming or hostile environment, and a study on the New York City Child Welfare System reported 78% of LGBTQ youth were kicked out, or ran away from their foster home as a result. Finally, a number of other factors that lead to increased risk of homelessness in adolescents disproportionately affect LGBT youth, such as experiencing conflict at school.|$|E
