With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the San Diego children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city. Also in 1921, the legislature moved San Diego <b>Junior</b> <b>College,</b> that was a part of San Diego High School, to the college campus due to crowding issues.
