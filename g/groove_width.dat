With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the <b>groove</b> <b>width</b> required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased.

We report a high-throughput method to investigate neural cell response to surface chemistry overlaid orthogonally onto a gradient of gradually changing <b>groove</b> <b>widths.</b> Using a bio-inspired approach wherein radial glial cells, which naturally guide neurons in the developing brain, enhance the attachment and directional outgrowth of neurons, we show the differences in the interaction and cellular response of glia, neurons and co-cultured cells. Radial glia were found to preferentially reside in <b>grooves</b> of <b>width</b> 6 – 35 μm with greater alignment to grooves &# 60; 10 μm on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic extremes of chemistry. When neurons were sequentially cultured after radial glia, they showed enhanced alignment compared to when they were cultured alone, for all chemistries and <b>groove</b> <b>widths.</b> This is not dependent on co-localisation of the neurons with glia suggesting the radial glial cells pre-condition the substrate giving rise to enhanced attachment and {{alignment of}} subsequently cultured neurons. The results indicate a dependence of both primary radial glia and neuron responses on surface chemistry and micro-groove <b>width.</b> <b>Grooved</b> surfaces (<b>width</b> 5 – 10 μm) of mid-range wettability show the greatest potential to significantly enhance axonal alignment and, therefore, potential regeneration, when pre-conditioned by radial glia, highlighting the importance of surface engineering for neural scaffolds...|$|R

50|$|RIAA {{equalization}} {{is a form}} of pre-emphasis on {{recording and}} de-emphasis on playback. A recording is made with the low frequencies reduced and the high frequencies boosted, and on playback the opposite occurs. The net result is a flat frequency response, but with attenuation of high frequency noise such as hiss and clicks that arise from the recording medium. Reducing the low frequencies also limits the excursions the cutter needs to make when cutting a groove. <b>Groove</b> <b>width</b> is thus reduced, allowing more grooves to fit into a given surface area, permitting longer recording times. This also reduces physical stresses on the stylus which might otherwise cause distortion or groove damage during playback.|$|E

50|$|Polygonal rifling {{prevents}} the forensic firearms examiner from microscopically measuring {{the width of}} land and groove impressions because the lands and grooves have a rounded profile instead of a well-defined rectangular profile.

50|$|Several highly {{regarded}} tactile tests {{have been developed}} as rigorous replacements to the 2PD test. In psychophysics research laboratories, a favored test of tactile spatial acuity has for many years been the grating orientation task (GOT). In the GOT, the participant attempts to discern the orientation of parallel grooves pressed either along or across the fingertip. The GOT threshold is the <b>groove</b> <b>width</b> at which the participant performs with some specified level of accuracy (e.g., 75% correct). The GOT is considered to yield a valid measure of tactile spatial acuity and {{has been used in}} many research studies, with both manual and automated stimulus delivery protocols. For example, the GOT has been used to map spatial acuity on different body areas, to characterize how tactile spatial acuity is affected by age, sex, skin characteristics, and blindness, and to track the changes in tactile spatial acuity that occur during perceptual learning and recovery from nerve injury.|$|E
5000|$|When {{cells are}} seeded onto flat substrates, they {{generally}} exhibit a random orientation. Conversely, when substrates have topographical patterns, {{the orientation of}} cells cultured on these surfaces is influenced by these geometrical cues. For example, if a substrate has nano/microgrooves running parallel to each other, cells orient along the direction of these topographical patterns. Therefore, cells {{seem to be able}} to sense the morphological characteristics of their surrounding and consequently respond by adopting the orientation of topographical stimuli. A similar effect can be obtained when cells are cultured on flat surfaces with lines of proteins printed on top (to which cells can adhere), interspersed by repellent lines; also in that case, cells align along the patterns.It has been observed that the phenomenon of contact guidance on microgrooved surfaces is influenced by the <b>groove</b> <b>width.</b> For instance, osteoblast-like cells align along the nanogrooves only for grooves wider than 75 nm. A similar behavior has been observed with other cell types, such as fibroblasts, which align along these topographical patterns when the grooves are wider than 150 nm. On the other hand, too large values of groove widths can also decrease the effects of contact guidance ...|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{models have}} been {{presented}} to provide explanations for the sequence-dependent variation of the DNA minor <b>groove</b> <b>width.</b> In a structural model groove narrowing in A-tracts results from direct, short-range interactions among DNA bases.
