60|$|Twelve {{flowers on}} these crossed plants were again crossed, and eleven {{capsules}} were produced; of these, five were poor and six good; the latter <b>contained</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> 3.75 grains of seeds. Twelve {{flowers on the}} self-fertilised plants were again fertilised with their own pollen and produced no less than twelve capsules, and the six finest of these <b>contained</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> 2.57 grains of seeds. It should however be observed that these latter capsules were produced by the plants in Pot 3, which were not exposed to any competition. The seeds in the six fine crossed capsules {{to those in the}} six finest self-fertilised capsules were in weight as 100 to 68. From these seeds the plants of the next generation were raised.|$|R

60|$|Twelve {{flowers were}} crossed with pollen from another plant, and yielded ten capsules, <b>containing</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> 5.77 grains of seeds. Eighteen flowers were fertilised {{with their own}} pollen and yielded twelve capsules, <b>containing</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> 2.63 grains. Therefore the seeds from {{an equal number of}} crossed and self-fertilised flowers would have been in weight as 100 to 38. I had {{previously}} selected a medium-sized capsule from each lot, and counted the seeds in both; the crossed one contained 284, and the self-fertilised one 126 seeds; or as 100 to 44. These seeds were sown on opposite sides of three pots, and several seedlings raised; but only the tallest flower-stem of one plant on each side was measured. The three on the crossed side averaged 32.5 inches, and the three on the self-fertilised side 34 inches in height; or as 100 to 104. But this trial was on much too small a scale to be trusted; the plants also grew so unequally that one of the three flower-stems on the crossed plants was very nearly twice as tall as that on one of the others; and one of the three flower-stems on the self-fertilised plants exceeded in an equal degree one of the others.|$|R
