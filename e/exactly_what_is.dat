25|$|More specifically, an {{ontology}} is a {{model for}} describing the world that consists {{of a set of}} types, properties, and relationship types. <b>Exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the Byzantine strategy at this battle, ambushing a raiding army on its return journey when it would be slowed by plunder and captives, is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> prescribed in much earlier Byzantine military treatises, such as the Tactica of Leo VI (886–912). This points to a retention by Byzantine commanders of knowledge of the successful military strategies of the past.|$|E
25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> necessary to compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions {{that are involved in}} our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature of what we are saying (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E

25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even {{if we do not}} know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going to come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E
25|$|Few {{images of}} medieval {{football}} survive. One engraving {{from the early}} fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards {{each other with a}} ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.|$|E

However, the festival soon goes awry because {{those responsible for}} building the stages and maintaining the rides [...] "didn't feel like" [...] doing a thorough job, resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel and more. Arguments begin, as everybody has been encouraged to always say <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> on their mind, and soon a riot starts. Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole [...] "Do As You Feel" [...] trend. The town chases after Bart, but Homer drives by in a float and saves him.

500|$|Although it {{is widely}} claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the {{possibility}} of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed {{out the possibility of}} giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using type theory. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using transfinite induction up to an ordinal called ε0. Gentzen explained: [...] "The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε0 can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a Turing machine describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the poem}} is {{concerned}} primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, {{it can be difficult}} to interpret.

This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, General Electric {{engineers}} began experimenting with porous carbon electrodes, {{in the design}} of capacitors, from the design of fuel cells and rechargeable batteries. Activated charcoal is an electrical conductor that is an extremely porous [...] "spongy" [...] form of carbon with a high specific surface area. In 1957 H. Becker developed a [...] "Low voltage electrolytic capacitor with porous carbon electrodes".

However, Lorentz showed that the theory is not concerned by Laplace's critique, because due to the structure of the Maxwell equations only effects in the order v2/c2 arise. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low. He wrote: ...|$|E
