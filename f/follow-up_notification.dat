40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and describes issues of analysis and <b>follow-up</b> <b>notification</b> of changes on websites and web feeds. The {{goal is to}} create web application that would be efficient to follow up changes on websites and to inform a user about changes in user friendly way. The analysis of similar existing applications was made to specify requirements of new application. Following the analysis, design of application was made by using different design techniques such as determining use cases of aplication, modelling of data or design of user interface using wireframe. Application was successfully implemented with PHP framework Nette. In conclusion, application was tested and its functionality was demonstrated on the set of input documents and for different combination of document analysis and notifications. The main benefit of the application is the practical usability and wide range of set up of document analysis and ways of notification...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this quality}} {{improvement}} project was to delineate an evidence-based practice initiative at a university health center to improve patient follow-up care after fragility fractures. Patients with fragility fractures {{are at risk for}} recurrent fracture, and inadequate follow-up care for patients with fragility fractures was identified as a problem. Prevention of future fractures through appropriate patient follow-up can decrease annual health care expenditures, and decrease patient morbidity and mortality. A review of the literature revealed a significant evidence base supporting appropriate <b>follow-up,</b> including <b>notification</b> of the patients 2 ̆ 7 primary care provider of the fracture and the follow-up plan, ordering a bone density scan within 3 months of the time of the fragility fracture diagnosis, and making a formal referral to the osteoporosis center for consultation. A description of the problem and the significance to health care is discussed, including baseline data for current follow-up practices. A plan for improving patient outcomes for follow-up care of fragility fractures was developed utilizing the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care. The evidence-based initiative was implemented, and the outcomes assessed. The results were that 100...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of genetic notification of smoking-related disease risk on smoking cessation in the general population. Secondary objectives were {{to assess the impact}} of genetic notification on intention-to-quit smoking and on emotional outcomes as well as the understanding and the recall of this notification. Methods: A systematic review of articles from inception to August 2011 without language restriction was realized using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Toxnet. Other publications were identified using hand search. The pooled-analysis included only randomized trials. Comparison groups were (i) high and low genetic risk versus control, and (ii) high versus low genetic risk. For the pooled-analysis random effect models were applied and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Eight papers from seven different studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. High genetic risk notification was associated with short-term increased depression and anxiety. Four randomized studies were included in the pooled-analysis, which revealed a significant impact of genetic notification on smoking cessation in comparison to controls (clinical risk notification or no intervention) in short term follow-up less than 6 months (RR = 1. 55, 95 % CI 1. 09 – 2. 21). Conclusions: In short term <b>follow-up,</b> genetic <b>notification</b> increased smoking cessation in comparison to control interventions. However, there is no evidence of long term effect (up to 12 month) on smoking cessation. Further research i...|$|R

The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (ALIGO) observatory recently reported the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) which triggered ALIGO on 2015 September 14. We report on observations taken with the Swift satellite two days after the trigger. No new X-ray, optical, UV or hard X-ray sources were detected in our observations, which were focused on nearby galaxies in the GW error region and covered 4. 7 deg² (∼ 2 per cent of the probability in the rapidly available GW error region; 0. 3 per cent of the probability from the final GW error region, which was produced several months after the trigger). We describe the rapid Swift response and automated analysis of the X-ray telescope and UV/Optical telescope data, and note the importance to electromagnetic <b>follow-up</b> of early <b>notification</b> of the progenitor details inferred from GW analysis.

40|$|Abstract A {{meta-analysis}} of prior studies of techniques de-signed to induce mail survey response rates was conducted. Re-search encompassing 184 effects (study outcomes) in 115 studies (articles) for 17 predictors of {{response rate was}} examined. The average effect size across all manipulations was r =. 065, indicat-ing an average increase of about 6. 5 percent in response rates for manipulations. Effect sizes for specific predictors and two potential moderators of effects were examined. Results indicated that repeated contacts {{in the form of}} preliminary <b>notification</b> and <b>follow-ups,</b> appeals, inclusion of a return envelope, postage, and monetary incentives, were effective in increasing survey re-sponse rates. Significant effect sizes for the predictors ranged from an increase in response of 2 percent to 31 percent. Implica-tions of the results for the conduct of mail surveys and future research on mail survey response behavior are discussed. Researchers have amassed myriad techniques to stimulate mail survey response rates, reduce item omission, speed up response, and reduce response bias. Examples include the use of preliminary <b>notification,</b> <b>follow-up,</b> sponsorship, appeals, postage, personalization, incentives, anonymity, prior commitment, and techniques affecting questionnaire Correspondence regarding {{this article should be addressed}} to FRANCIS I.

40|$|Objective: It {{was aimed}} to {{investigate}} whether neglected and abused pediatric patients are properly recognized and reported by emergency physicians in the emergency department (ED). Methods: This prospective study was conducted on patients between 0 and 6 years of age presenting with trauma to ED. Patients were examined again by an emergency medicine specialist independent from the physician who did the first intervention during clinical <b>follow-up</b> phase after <b>notification</b> of patients presenting with trauma to emergency physician. Asked radiological examinations and clinical follow-up were performed. The suspected abuse evaluation form, consisting 12 items, which was formed by considering the forms used in previous studies {{was used to examine}} the awareness of physicians in cases of abuse suspicion. Results: A total of 126 patients were included in our study. 54 % of cases (n =  68) were male and mean age was determined to be 31. 3  ±  18. 9 months. It was found that no judicial records were written to 35. 7 % (n =  45) of our patients and that 11. 1 % (n =  5) of these patients were hospitalized. In 51. 1 % (n =  23) of patients without judicial records, multiple suspected abuse findings were identified. According to evaluation of first physician, it was found that 75. 9 % (n =  41) of discharged patients had no judicial records and was not considered as neglect and abuse. Conclusion: We conclude that detection rates of abuse can be increased by developing child abuse screening forms and ensuring the continuity of the necessary training programs.
