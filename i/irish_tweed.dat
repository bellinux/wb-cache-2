50|$|The {{clothing}} {{culture of}} Ireland {{is a very}} interesting aspect of the country. Irish clothes are generally very well-made and {{have a long history of}} significance attached to them.Men in Ireland are often seen wearing linen driving caps. Europeans have been fond of linen driving caps for centuries. The patterns and colors of these hats vary greatly by their design but are most often found in neutral colors. Patchwork is also a popular look for these caps, although other more respectable and somber designs are more appropriate for some settings. However they look, a quality linen driving cap should be cool and not stifle the wearer. Aran sweaters are a historical part of Irish culture. Clan Arans used to be very popular. Each family clan had its own unique stitching or pattern that was used in their sweaters. These sweaters were hand knit with careful attentiveness. Museums in Ireland have the different clan patterns registered and well-documented. Even today Aran sweaters remain a popular staple of the Irish wardrobe. Tweed is another fabric traditionally noted in Irish culture. In the past, looms were used to create the tweed fabrics, and these methods are still used in modern times to make high quality tweed. Because most <b>Irish</b> <b>tweed</b> is handwoven it is more costly and durable than tweed commonly manufactured in other parts of the world. Jackets are a very popular way to wear tweed, as tweed jackets are appropriate for many occasions and have a simple yet elegant style.|$|E
