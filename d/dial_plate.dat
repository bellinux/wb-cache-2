25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front <b>dial</b> <b>plate.</b> Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E
500|$|Like most of Moore's work {{completed}} after 1954, {{this was a}} modeled sculpture instead of a direct carving. The sculpture is composed of two bronze semicircles, one set inside and {{at right angles to}} the other and a slim bronze rod that extends {{from one end of the}} outer semicircle to the other that serves as the gnomon (indicator). [...] The bowstring equatorial sundial derives its name from the appearance of the shadow-casting gnomon, which resembles a bow string. The shadow of the rod projects onto the inner semicircle, which serves as the dial face (or <b>dial</b> <b>plate),</b> to mark the time of day when there is sufficient sunlight to produce shadows.|$|E

My uncle left his bag standing in the post-office for a few minutes, {{and when he got}} back the grip was gone. The police hunted everywhere for the thief, but all that could be discovered was that it looked as if the rascal had come to Boston. To-night--or rather, last evening--a man came up and showed the watch, which I know only too well, as it has a little horseshoe painted on the <b>dial</b> <b>plate.</b> I tried to collar the fellow, but he ran away, and after stopping in a tenement house, he came here.

50|$|In only a {{few decades}} the lantern clock became very popular in London, and from there its {{popularity}} spread to the entire country. This {{is evident from the}} large number of lantern clocks that still exist. Dozens of clockmakers produced great numbers of these clocks in the city of London during the 17th century. This huge productivity {{was the result of the}} high demand for this popular clock in combination with an effective guild system. In 1631 King Charles I granted a charter for a clockmaker guild in London: the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, which exists to this day. Many of the well-known clockmakers from that era were freemen of this guild. Many small companies were established in Lothbury in London that functioned as suppliers for the clockmakers. A clockmaker could benefit from the services of brass founders who supplied cast brass clock parts, <b>dial</b> <b>plates,</b> finials, pillars, frets etc., or employ engravers who would carry out the engraving of the <b>dial</b> <b>plates</b> and frets. The guild assured the quality of the products that left the clockmakers' workshops. Before a clockmaker could become a freeman, able to set up his own shop, he had to spend 7 years as an apprentice learning the trade. This ensured independent clockmakers a plentiful supply of apprentices, who were also cheap labourers who helped to attain this high productivity.|$|R

Whilst we use this grand cipher to expedite the affairs of our pot and kettle, {{we feel that we}} have not yet put it to its use, neither are able. We are like travellers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs. Whilst we see that it always stands ready to clothe what we would say, we cannot avoid the question, whether the characters are not significant of themselves. Have mountains, and waves, and skies, no significance but what we consciously give them, when we employ them as emblems of our thoughts? The world is emblematic. Parts of speech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind. The laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face to face in a glass. [...] "The visible world and the relation of its parts, is the <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> of the invisible." [...] The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics. Thus, [...] "the whole is greater than its part;" [...] "reaction is equal to action;" [...] "the smallest weight may be made to lift the greatest, the difference of weight being compensated by time;" [...] and many the like propositions, which have an ethical as well as physical sense. These propositions have a much more extensive and universal sense when applied to human life, than when confined to technical use.|$|E

50|$|Style {{characteristics}} were copied from prints {{that were available}} for craftsmen. Under {{the influence of the}} Renaissance, prints with motives and patterns from the Classical antiquity found their way to the workshops. They served as examples for the clock pillars that were inspired by columns from Greek temples. During the 17th century the tulip became very popular to an extent of a real tulip mania. Prints with pictures of tulips were a rewarding subject for the adornment of the <b>dial</b> <b>plates</b> of lantern clocks. In the early 17th century, lantern clocks got their characteristic shape, which hardly changed during the 17th and halfway through the next century as a result of all this.|$|R

50|$|In 1888, the Historical Society of Netze District in Bydgoszcz made {{available}} the chancel for exhibition purposes. The exhibition of historical collections started in 1890, and imposed an external stairwell to be erected on northern wall. In the following years, the Historical Society of Netze District planned and systematically carried out conservation actions. Around 1900 was built a ceiling with joists in the nave, and 1901 a clock with two <b>dial</b> <b>plates</b> was {{mounted on the}} tower and a Baroque pink cupola reconstructed. Initially, the 1897 project should take a modest form but eventually urban architect Carl Meyer, {{with the help of}} Prussian conservator J. Kothe, changed the design, using 1844-drawing of Ferdinand von Quastof. Once completed, the church was the pride of Bromberg city center.In 1911, the Fire Brigade received new headquarters in Bydgoszcz and moved out. Idea was raised to transform the ex- sacred buildings into a prison: the members of the Historical Society of Netze District strived to grant sanctuary for museum purposes. During World War I, the basement of the chancel has housed emergency medical service, in the nave were stored benches and postal supplies.|$|R

There is a jack for a mono earplug. The Panapet came in several colors including red, yellow, white, blue, and avocado green.|$|R
50|$|Many design tricks {{were used}} to reduce {{production}} costs of the five-tube radio. The heaters of all the vacuum tubes had to be rated {{to use the same}} current, so they could be operated in series from line voltage. The rectifier and audio output tube required more heater power, so dropped a larger voltage than the other tubes. In many designs the rectifier tube had a tap on the heater to power a <b>dial</b> light. The <b>plate</b> current was routed through that portion of the rectifier heater, in order {{to make up for the}} current diverted to the dial lamp. If the dial lamp failed, that part of the rectifier heater would have a larger current which could burn out the tube in a few months. Early radios had a resistor network to minimize the problem but this was soon eliminated as the cost of replacing the tube was not the manufacturer's problem. As with Christmas tree lights, if one tube heater failed, none of the tube heaters would operate.|$|R

5000|$|The gnomon {{is usually}} fixed {{relative}} to the dial face, but not always; in some designs such as the analemmatic sundial, the style is moved according to the month. If the style is fixed, the line on the <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> perpendicularly beneath the style is called the substyle, meaning [...] "below the style". The angle the style makes with {{the plane of the}} <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> is called the substyle height, an unusual use of the word height to mean an angle. On many wall dials, the substyle {{is not the same as}} the noon line (see below). The angle on the <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> between the noon line and the substyle is called the substyle distance, an unusual use of the word distance to mean an angle.|$|E

50|$|A <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> can be laid out, by {{a pragmatic}} approach, observing and marking a shadow at regular {{intervals}} throughout the day on {{each day of the}} year. If the latitude is known the <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> can be laid out using geometrical construction techniques which rely on projection geometry, or by calculation using the known formulas and trigonometric tables usually using logarithms, or slide rules or more recently computers or mobile phones.

5000|$|In 1908 Frederic Dreyer {{suggested}} an improvement, adding gears {{so that the}} enemy bar would alter direction automatically when the <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> was rotated. This allowed an automatic correction of enemy direction as the home ship changed course. [...] A similar [...] "helm-free" [...] Mark VI* model with a range and bearing clock and fixed <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> permitted a gyrocompass input to automatically track own ship as it altered course, and was the one incorporated in the Dreyer Fire Control Table Mark III and III*. [...] Such equipment was quite specialized to a larger fire control context.|$|E
50|$|These {{were nearly}} {{identical}} to the Mark XI model, but had range rate markings on its <b>dial</b> <b>plate.</b> It must have been for convoy vessels {{with at least a}} Vickers range clock whose rate could be set according to this indication.|$|E
5000|$|This version {{included}} a hand wheel on the side, which rotated the <b>dial</b> <b>plate,</b> {{and with it}} the enemy bar. Relative direction of the enemy ship could be maintained to within a few degrees during a turn of the [...] "own ship".|$|E

The <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> lacks markings for range rate, implying the fire control staff of the ship would have no range clock at all and that this device was solely to give an idea of what deflection should be used on the gun sights. A further indication that these were to be used by less intensively trained personnel is that the <b>dial</b> <b>plate</b> helpfully features an image of a gun muzzle which is to be pointed toward the enemy ship.|$|E
