50|$|<b>Fork</b> <b>steerer</b> tubes may be {{threaded}} or unthreaded, {{depending on}} the headset used to attach the fork {{to the rest of}} the bicycle frame. An unthreaded steel steerer tube may be threaded with an appropriate die if necessary. The thread pitch is usually 24 threads per inch except for some old Raleighs which use 26.|$|E
5000|$|A stem must be {{compatible}} with {{the dimensions of the}} <b>fork</b> <b>steerer</b> tube. Steerer tubes come mainly in two common nominal sizes: 1" [...] and 1". Less commonly 1" [...] was used on some mountain bikes and tandems and has now returned on some carbon fiber forks, and 1" [...] is found on high end Downhill bikes.|$|E
50|$|Threadless stems, {{the newer}} {{of the two}} styles, are widely popular and have {{displaced}} quill stems as the industry standard on sport bikes. Threadless stems feature a modular design where the stem clamps around {{the outside of the}} top of the <b>fork</b> <b>steerer</b> tube that protrudes above the headset. Threadless stems are commonly available in lengths up to about 130 millimeters (5 inches).|$|E

5000|$|When sizing a fork to a frame, the {{diameter}} of the <b>fork</b> <b>steerer</b> or steer tube (1" [...] or 1⅛" [...] or 1½") must not be larger than that of the frame, and the length of the steerer tube should be greater than but approximately equal to the head tube length plus the stack height of the headset. Adapter kits are available to enable use of a 1" [...] fork in a frame designed for a 1⅛" [...] steer tube or a 1⅛" [...] fork in a 1½" [...] frame.|$|E

50|$|The {{head tube}} of a bicycle is {{sometimes}} {{designated by the}} <b>fork</b> <b>steerer</b> column it accepts. This can lead to confusion, since head tube inside diameters are dependent on the headset standard. For example, frames that take one inch (25.4 mm) steerer columns can have three different inside diameters for threaded and threadless headsets (not including integrated-type headsets). The wide variety of integrated and non-standard, proprietary headsets that some frame manufacturers have created (and abandoned in some cases) makes listing all current and past head tube dimensions problematic. The following table includes the most common sizes; nominal head tube diameters are assuming a 0.1-0.2 mm interference fit, which is what most head tube reaming cutters are designed to bore. Adequate press fits are typically between 0.1 and 0.25 mm of interference.|$|E
50|$|Shock is an unincorporated {{community}} in Gilmer County, West Virginia, United States. Shock is 13 mi southwest of Glenville, along the Right <b>Fork</b> <b>Steer</b> Creek. Shock has {{a post office}} with ZIP code 26638.|$|R
50|$|The Right <b>Fork</b> <b>Steer</b> Creek, 25.4 mi long, rises {{approximately}} 5 mi {{northwest of}} Frametown in western Braxton County and flows generally north-northwestward into southern Gilmer County, through {{the communities of}} Tague, Rosedale, and Shock.|$|R
50|$|The Left <b>Fork</b> <b>Steer</b> Creek, 24.5 mi long, rises {{approximately}} 3 mi {{north of}} Gassaway in central Braxton County and flows generally northwestward into southern Gilmer County, through {{the communities of}} Chapel, Normantown, and Lockney.|$|R
50|$|Cutting the steerer tube to its {{minimum length}} {{prevents}} {{switching to a}} taller stem or to a headset cups with a higher stack height. Any increase in handlebar height after this cut requires purchasing a new fork, a stem with more angular rise (some stems can be turned over for greater height), or a special adapter that clamps onto the steerer tube and gives a higher clamping position for the original stem. In addition, many riders who may have less flexibility than a seasoned racer may wish to gain more height on the handlebars, reducing the saddle-to-handlebar drop and providing a more upright and comfortable riding position. If an owner simply wishes to replace the headset with one having a slightly larger stack height, {{it may be possible}} for a bike shop or framebuilder to mill or re-face the head tube to gain an extra 1-2mm of stack height without having to replace the fork. Many threadless <b>fork</b> <b>steerer</b> tubes are cut longer than necessary to allow for adjustments and the steerer tube above the stem is stacked with spacers that can be moved above or below the stem to fine-tune the handlebar height. Often these spacers are aluminum or carbon fiber, but titanium spacers are also available.|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} {{installation}} of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top 1-2 inch cm of the steerer is threaded using a rolling process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top 1-2 inches, therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If {{there is a need}} to use a fork that is too long, meaning the <b>fork</b> <b>steerer</b> is not threaded down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can use a die to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try to thread an unthreaded steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard, 1 in by 24 tpi, but other standards exist. The headtube may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the headtube using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the headtube. The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.|$|E
5000|$|Forks are {{sometimes}} designated as right or left. Here, the [...] "handedness" [...] {{is from the}} point of view of an observer facing upstream. For instance, Steer Creek has a left tributary which is called Right <b>Fork</b> <b>Steer</b> Creek.|$|R
50|$|A detangler {{is usually}} only {{used for the}} rear brake cable. The front brake cable can be routed through the stem, via a hollow stem bolt known as a Pott's mod bolt, and <b>fork</b> <b>steer</b> tube to avoid the {{tangling}} problem.|$|R
5000|$|The {{head tube}} {{is the part}} of a cycle's tubular frame within which the front <b>fork</b> <b>steer</b> tube is mounted. [...] On a motorcycle, the [...] "head tube" [...] is {{normally}} called the steering head. On bicycles the manufacturer's brand located on the head tube is known as a head badge.|$|R
50|$|Somewhat counterintuitively, {{the term}} {{threadless}} derives not from whether the stem itself is threaded, but from whether a headset lock nut threads onto the <b>fork</b> <b>steer</b> tube. Quill stems require a threaded headset of specific length for each bicycle model. Threadless stems require an unthreaded steerer tube, which may vary in length for each bicycle model.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fork</b> <b>steer</b> handcycles {{represent}} {{the majority of}} handcycles sold. They work well for both low and high-level spinal injuries, and most have adjustable footrests, seat angle, and come {{with a variety of}} gearing, wheel and tire configurations depending on intended use: racing, recreation, or touring. Manufacturers of this type of handcycle include Invacare (Top End), Intrepid Equipment, Varna, Schmicking and Sunrise Medical (Quickie).|$|R
5000|$|Tague is an unincorporated {{community}} in Braxton County, West Virginia, United States, along the Right <b>Fork</b> <b>Steer</b> Creek. [...] The community took {{its name from}} nearby Tague Fork creek. A post office was established in Tague in 1911, but was downgraded as an independent rural station of Frametown. It {{is believed to be}} the only location in the United States with that name.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>forks</b> <b>steer</b> on {{bearings}} {{installed in}} a head tube. The forks on Stridas and Pedersen bicycles pivot about an axis external to the fork, supported at two different points on the frame. A new trend in triathlon bikes is similar, called a bayonet or external-steerer fork, but the pivot bearings {{are at the top}} and bottom of something that still resembles a head tube.|$|R
50|$|Lockney is an unincorporated {{community}} in Gilmer County, West Virginia, United States. Lockney is located along U.S. Routes 33 and 119 and the Left <b>Fork</b> <b>Steer</b> Creek 9 mi southwest of Glenville. Lockney had a post office, which opened on May 17, 1898, and closed on November 9, 2002. The community {{was named after}} H. C. Lockney, a senator who was instrumental in securing for the town a post office.|$|R
50|$|The stem, of the quill variety, is {{attached}} to the <b>fork's</b> <b>steerer</b> tube using an expander bolt which fits through the stem from the top with a wedge at the bottom, the stem fits inside the steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free the stem for adjustment, undo the bolt {{on the top of the}} stem a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.|$|R
50|$|Cargo {{bicycles}} have a low-set cargo platform {{ahead of}} the rider with a small diameter front wheel ahead of this. The conventional <b>fork</b> and <b>steerer</b> rises above this, often inconveniently for cargo loading. In 2011 Elian developed a cargo bicycle with hub-centre steering to the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Stumptown is an unincorporated {{community}} in Gilmer County, West Virginia, United States, at {{the confluence of}} the left and right <b>forks</b> of <b>Steer</b> Creek. It was named for Michael Stump III, a pioneer settler. [...] It lies at an elevation of 725 feet (221 m). The Stumptown Post Office opened 5/29/1883 and closed 2/1/1997.|$|R
50|$|The {{single cable}} from the handlebar's rear brake lever divides into two cables which are routed to {{opposite}} sides of the stem or <b>fork</b> <b>steer</b> tube and into cable stops. The inner cables connect to metal tabs on a disc attached to the upper side of a thrust bearing placed around the stem or steer tube. Squeezing the brake lever pulls the inner cables and causes the bearing assembly to rise. A second disc is attached {{to the bottom of the}} thrust bearing such that the entire assembly moves together up and down the steering axis while each disc can rotate independently around the axis. A second set of cables are attached to tabs on this lower disc and pass through cable stops mounted on the either side of the head tube. The two lower cables merge back into one and then are routed to the rear brake. The cables are split in this way to ensure that the detangler mechanism moves equally on both sides.|$|R
2500|$|The {{head tube}} {{contains}} the headset, the bearings for the <b>fork</b> via its <b>steerer</b> tube. In an integrated headset, cartridge bearings interface {{directly with the}} surface {{on the inside of}} the head tube, on non-integrated headsets the bearings (in a cartridge or not) interface with [...] "cups" [...] pressed into the head tube.|$|R
