25|$|Development {{geography}} is {{a branch of}} geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E

25|$|Pollution {{control is}} a term used in {{environmental}} management. It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control.

25|$|In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom {{is only a}} minor {{character}} and {{is used as a}} foil for Huck, particularly in the later chapters of the novel after Huck makes his way to Uncle Phelps's plantation. Tom's immaturity, imagination, and obsession with stories put Huck's planned rescue of the runaway slave Jim in great jeopardy — and ultimately make it unnecessary, since he knows Jim's owner has died and freed him in her will. Throughout the novel, Huck's intellectual and emotional <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> central theme, and by re-introducing a character from the beginning (Tom), Twain is able to highlight this evolution in Huck's character.|$|E
25|$|Software <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> complex process, and {{developers}} are often uncertain {{how long it}} will take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up a significant portion of its development time, {{and developers}} are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{model of}} flower <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{scientific}} {{model of the}} process by which flowering plants produce a pattern of gene expression in meristems that leads to the appearance of an organ oriented towards sexual reproduction, a flower. There are three physiological developments that must occur in order for this to take place: firstly, the plant must pass from sexual immaturity into a sexually mature state (i.e. a transition towards flowering); secondly, the transformation of the apical meristem’s function from a vegetative meristem into a floral meristem or inflorescence; and finally the growth of the flower’s individual organs. The latter phase has been modelled using the ABC model, which aims to describe the biological basis of the process from the perspective of molecular and developmental genetics.|$|E

25|$|On {{the level}} of {{developmental}} psychology the Gestaltkreis teachings correspond to Jean Piaget's observances {{on the development of}} the early childhood structures of perception, attitude and thought. In continual assimilation and accommodation processes, the motor cognitive and the emotional development work together and determine each other. The development of the senses, the continually differentiating thought and comportment structures, and the experience of space and time are, for Piaget, the prerequisites for developing the ability to symbolize. Compatible with this are the theories of development in depth psychology, where the main emphasis is on early childhood experience with the people with whom one has relationships and where the condition for a healthy <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> happy relationship with the person to whom one relates most closely (Balint, Mahler, Ericson, Winnicott, Kohut and Kernberg).|$|E
25|$|Serfdom in Suvalkija was {{abolished}} in 1807 by Napoleon Bonaparte: peasants acquired personal freedoms, {{although they}} could not own land. That changed only in 1861 when serfdom was abolished in the entire Russian Empire. By the 1820s, farmers in Suvalkija had begun to divide their villages into individual farmsteads (Lithuanian: singluar – vienkemis, plural – vienkemiai). This <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> clear indicator of economic prosperity among the peasants. The old three-field system was becoming obsolete; under that system the land was managed by the community and individuals could not introduce any technological advances without their approval. By contrast, {{in other parts of}} Lithuania this process did not begin until serfdom was abolished throughout the Empire in 1861, intensifying after the Stolypin reform in 1906.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{many other}} countries, {{development}} of renewable electricity in Australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change, energy independence and economic stimulus. A key policy {{that has been in}} place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy <b>development</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mandatory renewable energy target, which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations. This was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the Abbott Government with the agreement of the Labor opposition. Alongside this there is the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme, an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water and several State schemes providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics. In 2012, these policies were supplemented by a carbon price and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects, although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the Federal Government.|$|E
