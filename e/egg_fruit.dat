40|$|Many food {{ingredients}} are supplied in powdered form, as reducing water content increases shelf life and aids ease of storage, handling and transport. Powder technology is therefore {{of great importance}} to the food industry. The Handbook of food powders explores a variety of processes {{that are involved in}} the production of food powders, the further processing of these powders and their functional properties. Part one introduces processing and handling technologies for food powders and includes chapters on spray, freeze and drum drying, powder mixing in the production of food powders and safety issues around food powder production processes. Part two focusses on powder properties including surface composition, rehydration and techniques to analyse the particle size of food powders. Finally, part three highlights speciality food powders and includes chapters on dairy powders, fruit and vegetable powders and coating foods with powders. The Handbook of food powders is a standard reference for professionals in the food powder production and handling industries, development and quality control professionals in the food industry using powders in foods, and researchers, scientists and academics interested in the field. Explores the processing and handling technologies in the production of food powders. Examines powder properties, including surface composition, shelf life, and techniques used to examine particle size.

40|$|Introduction: Proper {{nutrition}} {{is one of}} {{the essential}} factors to well being for children andadolescents. Meanwhile, breakfast has a major role to supply their requirement nutrients and energy. There are some experimental evidences that suggest that omitting breakfast negatively affectscognitive functioning. This survey was performed to study of breakfast habits and its relationshipswith some factors in Semnan (Iran) pupils during 2006. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive analytical study, 1193 pupils in different educationalgrades were selected by the multistage cluster sampling. Data were collected by using a questionnaireand analyzed with Kruskal Wallis, Mann - Whitney and Spearman Coefficient Correlation tests usingSPSS software. Results: The mean and standard deviation of age was 12. 4 ± 3. 3 years old. 50. 7 % of them were boysand 49. 3 % were girls. 53. 4 % of the pupils stated that they always eat breakfast and the rest of them, donot eat irregularly. 4. 4 % of the pupils said they never eat breakfast. In this study, there was significantrelationship between breakfast habits and age (P<. 01), educational grade (P<. 0001), sex (P<. 0001),the time of getting up in the morning (P<. 0001), sleeping time at night (P<. 0001), the education ofpupil’s mother (P<. 04), the education of pupil’s father (P<. 05), the birth rank (P<. 05) and theintervention of pupils in the breakfast planning (P<. 0001). According to pupils’ breakfast for threecontinuous days, the relative consumption of bread (2. 26), tea (2. 20) and cheese (1. 66) was higherthan other foods, such as milk, walnut, honey, <b>egg,</b> <b>fruit</b> and fruit juice. Conclusion: These finding showed that pupils need to learn more about both irregular intake ofbreakfast and various intake of nutritious foods and this issue must be considered by differentauthorities...|$|E

40|$|It s only {{a yellow}} fruit, {{but it is}} almost sacred among its aficionadas, or ackee-onadas as they are coming to be known. The ackee is widely {{regarded}} as poisonous, yet it is the official national fruit of Jamaica, among whose diaspora it is revered. The ackee (Blighia sapida) is an evergreen tree of West Africa, introduced into Jamaica in 1797. It is widely known in central America and the Caribbean, with such Spanish names as fruto de huevo (<b>egg</b> <b>fruit</b> its cooked fruit looks like scrambled egg). In Ghana, the fruiting tree is a much liked ornamental. In Côte d Ivoire it is called kaka or finzan; in the Sudan, finza. Elsewhere in Africa it is known as akye, akyen or ishin, and in Portuguese it is castanheiro de Africa (African chestnut). How can a fruit which is so widely known in at least three ACP regions have been developed so little? In Trinidad it was outlawed in 1900, having allegedly caused fatalities; in the United States, there was an import ban for 27 years, until July 2000. The reason is fear of poisoning, which are not fully founded. The seeds are poisonous. The fleshy arils surrounding the seeds, however, whilst poisonous for some species when raw, are not toxic when ripened, dried in the air and cooked. So, as with so many plants, pay regard to some basic rules and the ackee is safe and enjoyable to eat, and nutritional. There are medicinal uses for its bark, and its oils are used to treat dysentery. With the US export ban lifted, Jamaican producers see a prospect of export earnings doubling within two years, from the 2000 level of US$ 14 million of which 70 % was from sales to Britain and Canada. But the export euphoria has already blown away. Before plans could even be firmed up to expand cultivation into plantations, Jamaica s perennial problem of praedial theft theft from the farm was ruining existing plots. In the US, unscrupulous traders have doubled the price of a 500 gram can to US$ 9, amid mutterings of mafia tactics and ackee for yuppies only. Complacency is also a threat: the widespread belief that the nation s ackee, like its coffee or pimentos (allspice), are surely the world s best and probably the finest too, has blinded people to other countries starting {{to cash in on the}} ackee hype. From Mexico to Kenya there is barely a country without plans for this crop. Be that as it may, this correspondent recognises a nation s gift to the world: cook it with a little onion, tomato and salt fish, add a thyme leaf if you like, and your day is made.
