25|$|Body and Soul, Archer's debut novel, was {{released}} in 1999.

500|$|The {{covers of}} The Nancy Drew Files and Girl Detective series {{represent}} further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy. The Nancy portrayed {{on the covers}} of The Nancy Drew Files is [...] "a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous." [...] In the Girl Detective series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>for</b> example, are confined to a strip {{across the top of the}} cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of The Secret of the Old Clock.|$|E

500|$|Born in Atlanta, Illinois in 1858, Eleanor was the {{daughter}} of Willard Newton and Matilda (Jaspersen) Smith. She came from a musical family, as her father was a noted bass in the First Presbyterian Church Choir in Chicago between 1860 and 1871. In an interview she gave in 1908, Smith claimed that both sides of her family were musical, noting that a paternal great-grandfather composed hymns and that her maternal line was a musical mix of Danish, French, German and Jewish ancestry. Smith taught herself to play the piano and did not begin any formal training for voice or composition until she was eighteen years old. She had very poor vision, which limited her ability to use <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time. She studied at the Hershey School of Musical Art, and published her first cantata, [...] "The Golden Asp", while still a student there. She later graduated from Cook County Normal School, but continued to study music privately as a pupil of Frances A. Root (voice) and Frederick Grant Gleason (composition).|$|E
500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy {{in a matter of seconds}} he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would get in the way of his thinking process. River was also meant to understand this and explain to Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not open <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> more than a second but was determined to do it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, and it was so wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father {{in the land of}} the midnight sun. Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings, famous in history. As such he is held in great reverence by his servants, who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king, and his daughter a princess. Outside of the years spent at school, Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone, her mother having died when she was a baby. When on a visit to her mother's grave, Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington, a distinguished young Englishman, who is touring Norway in his private yacht. Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and, obtaining information as to where she lives, presents himself to Olaf, the Viking, and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter. Sir Philip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride, and with her sails back to England. In London, Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip's friends, who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis. Lady Clara, alone, of all Sir Philip's old friends, wishes Thelma harm. She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip, and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far-off Norway. This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma's happiness, and force her to leave England. This she contrives to do, in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her, but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara. As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend, who is in love with Lady Clara, and wishes her to become his wife. This Lady Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her. Thelma, heartbroken, believing she has lost her husband's love, returns to Norway, just as her father, the Viking, breathes his last. She, with his faithful followers, complies with his last wishes, which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him – sent out to sea in his burning ship. This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past. After straining <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> a final look at the departing ship, Thelma retraces her steps to her mother's grave, and there, feeling that she is absolutely alone, prays for the strength to live. Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother, where first she met the man who won her heart, Sir Philip again finds Thelma. A few words suffice to show her how she has been tricked, and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart. In Sir Philip's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father; she starts out bravely to again face the world, now sure of his unending love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giffords {{initially}} {{was placed in}} an induced coma to allow her brain to rest. She was {{able to respond to}} simple commands when periodically awakened, but was unable to speak as she was on a ventilator. Nancy Pelosi said Giffords's husband Mark Kelly acknowledged that there is a [...] "rough road ahead" [...] for his wife's recovery, but was encouraged by her responsiveness, which included the ability to signal with her hand and move both arms. U.S. Army neurologist Geoffrey Ling of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, was sent to Tucson to consult on Giffords's condition. Ling stated, [...] "Her prognosis for maintaining the function that she has is very good. It's over 50 percent." [...] On January 11, neurosurgeon G. Michael Lemole Jr. said that Giffords's sedation had been reduced and that she could breathe on her own. On January 12, President Barack Obama visited Giffords at the medical center and publicly stated in an evening memorial ceremony that she had [...] "opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> the first time" [...] that day. Shortly after the shootings, some questions were raised by the media as to whether Giffords could be removed from office under a state law that allows a public office to be declared vacant if the officeholder is absent for three months, but a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state said the statute [...] "doesn't apply to federal offices" [...] and was, therefore, not relevant.|$|E
