40|$|Barley (Hordeum vulgare) {{ranks as}} the world’s fourth major cereal crop after maize, wheat and rice, {{both in terms of}} {{quantity}} produced and in area of cultivation. It has received considerable research attention as a model for genetic analyses, and breeding programs globally are working towards improved varieties with better quality, disease-resistance and agronomic traits. Like many other food staples, the use of transgenic technology has become an important tool available for modern barley improvement programs. However, transformation technology relies upon in vitro plant tissue culture, which has been proven to generate spontaneous and heritable genetic changes termed somaclonal variation (SCV). To be of practical value, genetic engineering techniques should produce genetically elite plants with one or more novel characteristics. Extensive SCV can result in many undesirable changes in the genetic background of transgenic plants, affecting their potential as cultivars or elite parents. Many factors have been described as potentially responsible for SCV, and generally most can be classified as stress factors. Tissue culture-induced mobilisation of transposable-elements (TEs) is one cause of SCV based on the knowledge that TEs can be responsible for generating significant genomic change and are one of the driving forces of evolution. To elucidate the extent of TE participation in SCV, barley was chosen as a genetic model because of its importance and its well characterised genome. Retro-element BARE- 1 (for barley retroelement 1) is part of an active family of copia-like retroelements, dispersed on all chromosomes. Hence, BARE- 1 {{has been used as a}} case study in understanding the role of retro-elements in barley SCV. A retrotransposon-based marker system, inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP), and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) were used to detect SCV induced by tissue culture. It was proposed that a greater frequency of polymorphisms emanating from the IRAP marker system in comparison to the ISSR marker system, would suggest that activation and transposition of BARE- 1 elements, and thus retrotransposon activity, were making a significant contribution to the extent of SCV. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of novel, non-parental bands. Cluster analysis also revealed that the level of polymorphism and genetic variability detected was comparable between IRAP and ISSR markers. The effect of transformation protocols on BARE- 1 expression levels was then assessed. Treatments included osmoticum, bialaphos, kanamycin, hygromycin and cefotaxime. Anti-retroviral compounds were applied to tissue culture media to evaluate the effectiveness of reducing BARE- 1 expression and, indirectly, SCV. It was observed that hygromycin B, osmoticum and cefotaxime had the greatest impact on BARE- 1 up-regulation, with kanamycin and bialaphos having a low, observable impact on retrotransposon activity. The response of barley to anti-retroviral drug compounds differed according to the class of drug applied and the gene evaluated. A marked reduction in BARE- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) expression was observed in ‘Mackay’ explants treated with the nucleoside analog, reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), Zidovudine, over a period of hours. However, over a period of weeks, no discernible down-regulation of BARE- 1 RT was observed and some treatments actually showed up-regulation. A transgenic approach using RNAi methodologies to silence a conserved domain of the BARE- 1 RT and, indirectly, BARE- 1 transposition was explored. All T 0 lines tested positive for transgene sequences using PCR, but only 4 plants were according to Southern blot hybridisation. Relative expression of BARE- 1 RT in T 2 generation lines showed up-regulation compared to non-transgenic controls, possibly as a result of the inadvertent detection of the hairpin construct. Further investigation is required to evaluate if it is possible to down regulate or knockout BARE- 1 RT and assess the level of SCV amongst transgenic progeny. Such experiments would be highly valuable in elucidating the biology of retrotransposons in cereals. Integration of IRAP markers, derived from a barley recombinant inbred (RI) line population, into a high density <b>genetic</b> <b>consensus</b> map and evaluation of their potential to be used for basic and applied genetic diversity analyses and marker-assisted selection programs was assessed. IRAP markers were shown to be distributed over all chromosomes, and significant associations with phenotypic QTLs for quality, agronomic and disease traits were found. Further evidence supporting retrotransposon activity is a substantial component of SCV was provided through the comparison between ISSR and IRAP markers to indicate the degree of genomic instability in barley explants as well as through the quantification of the BARE- 1 retrotransposon family and its response to different stress inducing treatments sourced from transformation protocols. Assessment of BARE- 1 activity response to anti-retroviral drug compounds provided some evidence of the efficacy of the compounds to reduce BARE- 1 RT expression. As stated above, further work is required to conclusively demonstrate their capacity to reduce retrotransposon proliferation during tissue culture, as certain anti-retroviral compounds actually exacerbated BARE- 1 expression above controls. Pursuit of such an intervention seems likely to be complicated by the complex interaction between retro-elements and their hosts combined with the multifarious cellular environment...|$|E

40|$|Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) is an {{important}} food legume crop of rainfed agriculture. Owing to exposure of the crop {{to a number of}} biotic and abiotic stresses, the crop productivity has remained stagnant for almost last five decades at ca. 750 kg/ha. The availability of a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system has facilitated the development and release of hybrids which are expected to enhance the productivity of pigeonpea. Recent advances in genomics and molecular breeding such as marker-assisted selection (MAS) offer the possibility to accelerate hybrid breeding. Molecular markers and genetic maps are pre-requisites for deploying MAS in breeding. However, in the case of pigeonpea, only one inter- and two intra-specific genetic maps are available so far. Here, four new intra-specific genetic maps comprising 59 – 140 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci with map lengths ranging from 586. 9 to 881. 6 cM have been constructed. Using these four genetic maps together with two recently published intra-specific <b>genetic</b> maps, a <b>consensus</b> map was constructed, comprising of 339 SSR loci spanning a distance of 1, 059 cM.

Wheat breeding has a long history in Kazakhstan and the aim {{of this study was to}} explore the relationship between key varieties from Kazakhstan and germplasm from breeding programs for other regions. RESULTS: The study revealed 5, 898 polymorphic markers amongst ten cultivars, of which 2, 730 were mapped in the <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> map. Mapped SNP markers were distributed almost equally across the A and B genomes, with between 279 and 484 markers assigned to each chromosome. Marker coverage was approximately 10 -fold lower in the D genome. There were 863 SNP markers identified as unique to specific cultivars, and clusters of these markers (regions containing more than three closely mapped unique SNPs) showed specific patterns on the <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> map for each cultivar. Significant intra-varietal genetic polymorphism was identified in three cultivars (Tzelinnaya 3 C, Kazakhstanskaya rannespelaya and Kazakhstanskaya 15). Phylogenetic analysis based on inter-varietal polymorphism showed that the very old cultivar Erythrospermum 841 was the most genetically distinct from the other nine cultivars from Kazakhstan, falling in a clade together with the American cultivar Sonora and genotypes from Central and South Asia. The modern cultivar Kazakhstanskaya 19 also fell into a separate clade, together with the American cultivar Thatcher. The remaining eight cultivars shared a single sub-clade but were categorised into four clusters.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThis study describes development of a <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> linkage map of bovine chromosome 24 (BTA 24). Eight participating laboratories contributed data for 58 unique markers including a total of 25 409 meioses. Eighteen markers, which were typed {{in more than one}} reference population, were used as potential anchors to generate a consensus framework map. The framework map contained 16 loci ordered with odds greater than 1000 : 1 and spanned 79. 3 cM. Remaining markers were included in a comprehensive map relative to these anchors. The resulting BTA 24 comprehensive map was 98. 3 cM in length. Average marker intervals were 6. 1 and 2. 5 cM for framework and comprehensive maps, respectively. Marker order was generally consistent with previously reported BTA 24 linkage maps. Only one discrepancy was found when comparing the comprehensive map with the published USDA-MARC linkage map. Integration of genetic information from different maps provides a high-resolution BTA 24 linkage map...|$|R
40|$|For genetic {{research}} to contribute more fully to furthering {{our knowledge of}} neuropathic pain, we require an agreed, valid, and feasible approach to phenotyping, to allow collaboration and replication in samples of sufficient size. Results from genetic studies on neuropathic pain have been inconsistent and have met with replication difficulties, {{in part because of}} differences in phenotypes used for case ascertainment. Because there is no consensus on the nature of these phenotypes, nor on the methods of collecting them, this study aimed to provide guidelines on collecting and reporting phenotypes in cases and controls for <b>genetic</b> studies. <b>Consensus</b> was achieved through a staged approach: (1) systematic literature review to identify all neuropathic pain phenotypes used in previous genetic studies; (2) Delphi survey to identify the most useful neuropathic pain phenotypes and their validity and feasibility; and (3) meeting of experts to reach consensus on the optimal phenotype(s) to be collected from patients with neuropathic pain for genetic studies. A basic “entry level” set of phenotypes was identified for any genetic study of neuropathic pain. This set identifies cases of “possible” neuropathic pain, and controls, and includes: (1) a validated symptom-based questionnaire to determine whether any pain is likely to be neuropathic; (2) body chart or checklist to identify whether the area of pain distribution is neuroanatomically logical; and (3) details of pain history (intensity, duration, any formal diagnosis). This NeuroPPIC “entry level” set of phenotypes can be expanded by more extensive and specific measures, as determined by scientific requirements and resource availability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genetic maps {{provide an}} {{important}} genomic resource for understanding genome organization and evolution, comparative genomics, mapping genes and quantitative trait loci, and associating genomic segments with phenotypic traits. Spruce (Picea) genomics work is quite challenging, {{mainly because of}} extremely large size and highly repetitive nature of its genome, unsequenced and poorly understood genome, and the general lack of advanced-generation pedigrees. Our goal was to construct a high-density genetic linkage map of black spruce (Picea mariana, 2 n = 24), which is a predominant, transcontinental species of the North American boreal and temperate forests, with high ecological and economic importance. Results We have developed a near-saturated and complete genetic linkage map of black spruce using a three-generation outbred pedigree and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), selectively amplified microsatellite polymorphic loci (SAMPL), expressed sequence tag polymorphism (ESTP), and microsatellite (mostly cDNA based) markers. Maternal, paternal, and <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> linkage maps were constructed. The maternal, paternal, and consensus maps in our study consistently coalesced into 12 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number (1 n = 1 x = 12) of 12 in the genus Picea. The maternal map had 816 and the paternal map 743 markers distributed over 12 linkage groups each. The consensus map consisted of 1, 111 markers distributed over 12 linkage groups, and covered almost the entire (> 97 %) black spruce genome. The mapped markers included 809 AFLPs, 255 SAMPL, 42 microsatellites, and 5 ESTPs. Total estimated length of the genetic map was 1, 770 cM, {{with an average of}} one marker every 1. 6 cM. The maternal, paternal and <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> maps aligned almost perfectly. Conclusion We have constructed the first high density to near-saturated genetic linkage map of black spruce, with greater than 97 % genome coverage. Also, this is the first genetic map based on a three-generation outbred pedigree in the genus Picea. The genome length in P. mariana is likely to be about 1, 800 cM. The genetic maps developed in our study can serve as a reference map for various genomics studies and applications in Picea a nd Pinaceae. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Triticale {{is adapted}} {{to a wide range}} of abiotic stress conditions, is an {{important}} high-quality feed stock and produces similar grain yield but more biomass compared to other crops. Modern genomic approaches aimed at enhancing breeding progress in cereals require high-quality <b>genetic</b> linkage maps. <b>Consensus</b> maps are <b>genetic</b> maps that are created by a joint analysis of the data from several segregating populations and different approaches are available for their construction. The phenomenon that alleles at a locus deviate from the Mendelian expectation has been defined as segregation distortion. The study of segregation distortion is of particular interest in doubled haploid (DH) populations due to the selection pressure exerted on the plants during the process of their establishment. Results The final consensus map, constructed out of six segregating populations derived from nine parental lines, incorporated 2555 DArT markers mapped to 2602 loci (1929 unique). The map spanned 2309. 9 cM with an average number of 123. 9 loci per chromosome and an average marker density of one unique locus every 1. 2 cM. The R genome showed the highest marker coverage followed by the B genome and the A genome. In general, locus order was well maintained between the consensus linkage map and the component maps. However, we observed several groups of loci for which the colinearity was slightly uneven. Among the 2602 loci mapped on the consensus map, 886 showed distorted segregation in at least one of the individual mapping populations. In several DH populations derived by androgenesis, we found chromosomes (2 B, 3 B, 1 R, 2 R, 4 R and 7 R) containing regions where markers exhibited a distorted segregation pattern. In addition, we observed evidence for segregation distortion between pairs of loci caused either by a predominance of parental or recombinant genotypes. Conclusions We have constructed a reliable, high-density DArT marker <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> linkage map as a basis for genomic approaches in triticale research and breeding, for example for multiple-line cross QTL mapping experiments. The results of our study exemplify the tremendous impact of different DH production techniques on allele frequencies and segregation distortion covering whole chromosomes. </p...|$|R

A panel of 8 ISSR primers was screened representing di-nucleotide repeats, of which 57 polymorphic and informative patterns were selected to determine the <b>genetic</b> diversity. The <b>consensus</b> tree constructed using binary data from banding patterns generated by ISSR-PCR depicting that A. indica and A. cathcartii are more similar in terms of their genetic level and included in the same cluster. However, the rest of the two species viz., A. saccata and A. tagala are included into two different clusters which indicate their level of polymorphisms in the genetic level. This study may be useful in identifying diverse genetic stocks of Aristolochia, which may then be conserved on a priority basis. The ISSR markers are thus useful in the fingerprinting of wild species germplasm, and in understanding the evolutionary relationships of Aristolochia...|$|R

In this study, we applied the restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) method to genotype an F 9 recombinant inbred line population {{derived from a}} wild type × domesticated cultivar (W × D) cross. A high density linkage map was developed based on the W × D population. By integrating sequence-defined DNA markers reported in previous mapping studies, we established an ultra-high density <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> map, which contains 34, 574 markers consisting of 3508 loci covering 2399 cM on 20 linkage groups. The largest gap in the entire consensus map was 4. 73 cM. The high density W × D map and the consensus map were used to develop an improved physical map, which covered 560. 5 Mb of genome sequence data. The ultra-high density consensus linkage map, the improved physical map and the markers linked to genes of breeding interest reported in this study provide a common tool for genome sequence assembly, structural genomics, comparative genomics, functional genomics, QTL mapping, and molecular plant breeding in lupin...|$|R

TheMFP locus was mapped with reference to DNA markers using F 2 and F 2 : 5 RIL as mapping populations. Among 205 RAPD, 27 ISSR and 35 SSR markers that demonstrated polymorphism between the parents of mapping populations, three RAPD markers were found linked to the MFP locus by bulk segregant analyses onmfp/mfp andMFP/MFP bulks assembled from the F 2 : 5 population. The segregational analysis of mfp and 267 DNA markers on 96 F 2 plants allowed placement of 26 DNA markers with reference to MFP on a linkage group.

We combined 27 public quantitative genetic studies and four genetic maps to deliver an exhaustive consensus map consisting of 140, 315 molecular markers hosting 221, 73, and 82 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for respectively yield, baking quality, and grain protein content (GPC) related traits. Projection of the <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> map and associated QTLs onto the wheat syntenome made of 99, 386 genes ordered on the 21 chromosomes delivered a complete and non-redundant repertoire of 18, 8, 6 metaQTLs for respectively yield, baking quality and GPC, altogether associated to 15, 772 genes (delivering 28, 630 SNP-based makers) including 37 major candidates.

The amount of disease produced {{on a range of}} Col ¥ Ler lines by spray inoculation was highly correlated with that produced by pressure infiltration of bacteria into the apoplast. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified four loci that contributed to partial resistance: QRps. JIC- 1. 1, QRps. JIC- 2. 1, QRps. JIC- 3. 1 and QRps.

On the basis of microsatellite analysis, spatial genetic structure (SGS) can be estimated to delineate provenances of eucalypts. In addition, non-denaturing FISH (ND-FISH) can be used to compare the distribution of SSRs to determine whether the range of molecular diversity shown by these highly polymorphic sequences is reflected at the chromosome level. They are also ideally used as anchor markers in molecular linkage maps and in generation of consensus maps across species and that can be highly saturated with DArT and SNP/genotyping by sequencing markers (GBS). Development of a high-density <b>consensus</b> <b>genetic</b> map with SSRs in an important chromosomal interval provides eucalypt molecular breeding programs with a better choice regarding the quality of markers and a higher probability of polymorphic markers.
