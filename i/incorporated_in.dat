5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it is <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> the bone. All four stable isotopes are <b>incorporated,</b> <b>in</b> {{roughly the same}} proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{examination of the}} determinants of firms 2 ̆ 7 decisions where to incorporate. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find substantial evidence that firms {{are more likely to}} <b>incorporate</b> <b>in</b> states with corporate law rules that offer firms flexibility to devise their governance arrangement and significant but less robust evidence that firms are more likely to <b>incorporate</b> <b>in</b> states with higher quality judicial systems.
