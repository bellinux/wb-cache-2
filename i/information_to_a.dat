5|$|In March 2013, Lohan pleaded {{no contest}} to {{misdemeanor}} charges stemming from the June 2012 car accident; reckless driving and providing false <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police officer. She was sentenced to community service, psychotherapy and lockdown rehabilitation. Her probation was also extended for another two years. Between May and July 2013 Lohan spent 90 days in rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|A person {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA, or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist, but who fails to report the matter to a police officer, commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years. However, if the person voluntarily gives full <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence, {{he or she will}} not be convicted.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> physician.|$|E

The metaphor of dissemination directs our attention to those vast continents of signification that are not directly interactive." [...] Dissemination basically sends <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> audience, without direct contact to the receiver, and without a direct response or clarification method that a conversation or dialogue would have.|$|R
25|$|Where {{drugs or}} other {{materials}} are shipped by air, radar systems, both ground- and air-based, while powerful, are relatively straightforward to provide. The actual radar {{need not be}} operated by the HN or even in their country; the radar can send its <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> remote intelligence center.|$|E
25|$|Many modern digital {{television}} receivers {{can be directly}} connected to cables, but often cannot receive scrambled channels that the user is paying for. Thus, {{the lack of a}} standard way of sending CC information between components, along with the lack of a mandate to add this <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> picture, results in CC being unavailable to many hard-of-hearing and deaf users.|$|E
25|$|In a 2011 New Yorker article, {{journalist}} Jane Mayer {{wrote that}} Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, {{on a level}} worse than what President Nixon had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed unclassified <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reporter, then {{the worst thing that}} would happen to him was probably that he would be fired.|$|E

25|$|Provision {{of false}} <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{registration}} officer is an offence under section 13D of the 1983 Act. While no specific allegation of false registration was particularised {{on the election}} petition, evidences were heard by the court {{as part of the}} case on personation and other voting offences. A schedule containing multiple false registrations were submitted to and accepted by the court where all entries were shown to have voted for Rahman.|$|E
25|$|Telecommunications {{engineering}} {{focuses on the}} transmission of information across a channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> carrier frequency suitable for transmission; {{this is known as}} modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.|$|E
25|$|When a {{hardware}} device triggers an interrupt, the operating system's kernel decides {{how to deal}} with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the operating system's kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> running program by various means.|$|E

25|$|Deception is {{providing}} false <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> teacher/instructor concerning a formal academic exercise. Examples of this include taking {{more time on}} a take-home test than is allowed, giving a dishonest excuse when asking for a deadline extension, or falsely claiming to have submitted work. This type of academic misconduct is often considered softer than the more obvious forms of cheating, and otherwise-honest students sometimes engage {{in this type of}} dishonesty without considering themselves cheaters. It is also sometimes done by students who have failed to complete an assignment, to avoid responsibility for doing so.|$|E
25|$|Strange {{meets with}} Devra and agrees to {{relocate}} her for safety. He begins to follow McKinley and tracks him to Foreman's home where he sells weapons. Strange has Quinn meet him there and Quinn tails McKinley {{back to his}} home but is noticed. Strange tracks an employee of Foreman's to a gun store and observes him buying a weapon under false pretences. He passes the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> contact in the police. He asks Quinn to watch over Devra. Quinn leaves Devra unwatched to return to question the men about his missing girl but is again unsuccessful. He is increasingly agitated about being intimidated by the men.|$|E
25|$|Lutfur Rahman {{was found}} {{personally}} guilty {{by the court}} of making false statements about a candidate, bribery, and undue spiritual influence. The court also found Rahman guilty by his agents of personation, postal vote offences, provision of false <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> registration officer, voting when not entitled, making false statements about a candidate, payment of canvassers, bribery, and undue spiritual influence. A finding that corrupt and illegal practices {{for the purpose of}} securing Rahman's election, and that such general corruption so extensively prevailed such that it could be reasonably concluded to have affected the result was also returned. Alibor Choudhury was found personally guilty of bribery, making false statements about a candidate, and payment of canvassers.|$|E

25|$|The Web {{has also}} enabled {{individuals}} and organizations to publish ideas and <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization {{in the hope that}} visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, DA Ferman charged Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane for her alleged {{involvement}} in the leaking of confidential investigative <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> newspaper and for her subsequent attempts to cover up these actions. Following the leak, a grand jury investigated and recommended the arrest and filing of criminal charges against Kane for felony perjury and multiple misdemeanors nine months prior to her being charged. However, Ferman launched her own independent criminal investigation into the allegations against Kane. Ultimately DA Ferman concluded that it was appropriate to file criminal charges against the Attorney General. Kane's criminal trial for felony charges of perjury and obstruction began on August 8, 2016. On August 15, she was convicted on all nine counts.|$|E
25|$|Fifty-eight {{days after}} the Langley bombing, Carrie has been {{reinstated}} to the CIA and answers questioning by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. During her testimony, she states that Brody {{had nothing to do}} with the attack. Information is leaked to the public about her previous immunity deal with Brody, as well as her sexual relationship with him. Saul acknowledges Carrie's bipolar disorder when he appears before the committee. In retaliation, Carrie leaks classified <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reporter, leading Saul to have her temporarily committed to a mental hospital. She appears before a hospital committee to ask for her release, which her father and sister attend. When they tell her to begin taking lithium again, she flies into a rage and has to be forcibly medicated and restrained. She is then formally committed.|$|E

25|$|Paperless geocaching means hunting a geocache {{without a}} {{physical}} printout of the cache description. Traditionally, {{this means that}} the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PDA or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with a web-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{mathematical}} optimization, stochastic programming is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Whereas deterministic optimization problems are formulated with known parameters, real world problems almost invariably include some unknown parameters. When the parameters are known only within certain bounds, one approach to tackling such problems is called robust optimization. Here {{the goal is to}} find a solution which is feasible for all such data and optimal in some sense. Stochastic programming models are similar in style but take advantage of the fact that probability distributions governing the data are known or can be estimated. The goal here is to find some policy that is feasible for all (or almost all) the possible data instances and maximizes the expectation of some function of the decisions and the random variables. More generally, such models are formulated, solved analytically or numerically, and analyzed in order to provide useful <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decision-maker.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of Atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special popup tags. When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored {{the movements}} of the tuna for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
