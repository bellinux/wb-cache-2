40|$|While self-directed {{support for}} people with disabilities and their {{families}} represents a welcome shift toward self-determination and increasing control, the risk of managing with insufficient funds remains. This article examines whether different types of case management can mitigate that risk by providing support when people have only a small direct funding package. It applies the question to an evaluated program of self-directed support in Queensland, Australia that allocated A$ 4000 with one of two approaches to case management: program-focused or organizationally oriented. Case management contributed to the effective use of limited budgets and addressing goals when it promoted choice and control, built relationships, and enabled <b>flexible</b> <b>fund</b> use. Program-focused case management seemed to be less constrained in enhancing social participation than organizationally oriented case management, which tended to restrict some participatory opportunities. These findings are consistent with earlier research, which indicated that case management can interfere with participation. Even {{in the context of a}} small funding allocation, a case management approach that promotes flexibility and person-centered planning, control over funding, and capacity building can improve the effectiveness of self-directed support; however it does not overcome the inherent limitations of insufficient funds for adequate support, or the cost of case management itself...|$|R

British foot regiments generally consisted of a single battalion made up of a variable number of companies, usually 9 or 10.

40|$|Spurred by a deep {{recession}} and large budget shortfalls, the California Legislature in 2009 enacted what was arguably the largest change to California’s school finance system in decades—relaxing spending restrictions {{on more than}} 40 categorical programs through 2012 – 13, extended later to 2014 – 15. Categorical funding, which gives school districts money {{in addition to the}} general funds they already receive from the state, had been limited to specific, narrow purposes: buying textbooks or providing summer school, for example. Under the 2009 changes, districts could begin spending these funds for any educational purpose. When the law expires, the legislature will be faced with a decision: whether to return to the previous, tightly restricted categorical fund system or transition to a permanent version of the flexibility now in use. Because they were part of legislative negotiations over the state budget, not education policy, the decisions made in 2009 were far from optimal for K– 12 schools. A more systematic and less political reconsideration of categorical flexibility could result in a more equitable and transparent distribution of funds, while also reserving targeted aid for students who need supplemental services. In addition, under the 2009 provisions, districts could spend categorical funds on any educational purpose.
