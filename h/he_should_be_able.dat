5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to feel it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him {{to stay with her}} for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins with}} Mega Man Volnutt trying to exit a ruin after finding the {{refractor}} inside. After {{dealing with the}} Reaverbots blocking his way out, {{he makes his way}} to the Flutter, which leaves the ruin. However, the Flutter experiences some engine problems and crash lands on Kattelox Island. From there, the Casketts {{try to find a way}} to repair their ship. However, when the pirates the Bonnes attack Kattelox's city with giant mechanical weapons, Mega Man decides to stop them. Once Mega Man is able to defeat each member individually, Kattelox's mayor, Amelia, tells Mega Man the Bonnes are searching for the island's secret treasure and that it is said if somebody obtains it, a great disaster will befall the island. Amelia asks Mega Man to explore the island's ruins in order to investigate it. With a refractor found in a ruin, Roll and Mega Man are able to repair the Flutter, allowing them to find a cave to continue exploring the island. While exploring the cave, Mega Man activates the Main Gate, a dungeon where <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find the reason why Reaverbots from the island are being activated. Before being able to enter into the Main Gate, Mega Man once again confronts the Bonnes who, after being defeated once again, decide to let Mega Man enter the Main Gate, hoping he will bear the brunt of the work then planning to steal the treasure from him afterward.|$|E

500|$|At 1613Z, {{almost three}} {{hours into the}} flight of the unresponsive Learjet, two F-16s from the 138th Fighter Wing of the Oklahoma Air National Guard (ANG), flying under the {{call-sign}} [...] "TULSA 13 flight", were directed by the Minneapolis ARTCC to intercept. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported {{that he could not}} see any movement in the cockpit, that the windshield was dark and that he could not tell if the windshield was iced. A few minutes later, a TULSA 13 pilot reported, [...] "We're not seeing anything inside, could be just a dark cockpit though...he is not reacting, moving or anything like that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to have seen us by now."

500|$|Mario Bros. {{was created}} by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead {{developers}} for the video game Donkey Kong. In Donkey Kong, Mario dies if he falls too far. Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking {{that it would make}} it [...] "not much of a game." [...] He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario [...] "jumping and bouncing around", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below. Because of Mario's appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls, a hat, and a thick moustache, Shigeru Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter, and designed this game to reflect that. Another contributing factor was the game's setting: it was a large network of giant pipes, so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Blake experimented {{with the idea}} of {{attaching}} a sail to one of his surfboards. As one author wrote, [...] "The modern sport of windsurfing {{can be traced back to}} the 1930s when a surfer named Tom Blake, whose arms became particularly tired one afternoon from paddling his board out to catch the waves, thought <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to use the wind for propulsion.” For his first experiment, he simply used an umbrella, but subsequently refined the design, adding a proper sail and a foot-controlled rudder. By 1935, he had a version usable in competitions, and in 1940, the L.A. Ladder Company produced them for sale.|$|E

2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made {{to take part in a}} school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'. So I thought,'Ok, I'll carry on doing this for a bit and the next thing you know that's how I make my living these days".|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Abin {{compared}} {{the instruction of}} [...] to a handsome king who instructed a servant to fashion a bust exactly like him. The servant exclaimed {{that he could not}} possibly make a likeness exactly like the king. But the king replied that the servant would paint it with his materials, but the king would appear in his own glory. Thus, when in [...] God told Moses [...] "see that you make them after their pattern," [...] Moses complained that he was not God that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make one exactly like the pattern. God replied that Moses should follow the pattern of blue, purple, and scarlet that he saw above. The [...] "acacia-wood, standing up" [...] of [...] would reflect the Seraphim who stand above, and Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba said that the gold clasps of [...] would reflect the glittering stars in heaven. Thus God told Moses that if he would make below a replica of that which was above, God would cause God's Shechinah to dwell among the people.|$|E
2500|$|Louisbourg {{was also}} known for its fortifications, which took the {{original}} French builders 28 years to complete. [...] The engineer behind the project was Jean-Francois du Vergery de Verville. [...] Verville picked Louisbourg as his location because of its natural barriers. [...] The fort itself cost France 30 million French livres, which prompted King Louis XV to joke that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to see the peaks of the buildings from his Palace in Versaille. [...] The original budget for the fort was four million livres. [...] Two {{and a half miles}} of wall surrounded the entire fort. [...] On the western side of the fort, the walls were [...] high, and [...] across, protected by a wide ditch and ramparts. [...] The city had four gates that lead into the city. The Dauphin Gate, which is currently reconstructed, was the busiest, leading to the extensive fishing compounds around the harbour and to the main road leading inland. The Frederick Gate, also reconstructed, was the waterfront entrance. The Maurepas Gate, facing the narrows, connected the fishing establishments, dwellings and cemeteries on Rocheford Point and was elaborately decorated as it was very visible to arriving ships. The Queen's Gate on the sparsely populated seaward side saw little use. Louisbourg was also home to six bastions, two of which are reconstructed. Dauphin bastion, commonly referred to as a 'demi-bastion' for its modification, the King's bastion, Queen's bastion, Princess bastion, Maurepas bastion and the Brouillon bastion. On {{the eastern side of the}} fort, 15 guns pointed out to the harbour. [...] The wall on this side was only [...] high and [...] across. [...] Louisbourg was one of the [...] "largest military garrisons in all of New France", and many battles were fought and lives lost here because of it. [...] The fort had the embrasures to mount 148 guns; however, historians have estimated that only 100 embrasures had cannons mounted. [...] Disconnected from the main fort, yet still a part of Louisbourg, a small island in the harbour entrance was also fortified. [...] The walls on the Island Battery were [...] high, and [...] thick. [...] Thirty-one 24-pound guns were mounted facing the harbour. [...] The island itself was small, with room for only a few small ships to dock there. An even larger fortified battery, the Royal Battery was located across the harbour from the town and mounted 40 guns to protect the harbour entrance.|$|E

2500|$|The Free Movement of Workers Regulation {{articles}} 1 to 7 set out {{the main}} provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held [...] "the transfer rules constitute an obstacle to free movement" [...] and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified {{as part of the}} public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving [...] "horizontal" [...] direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was [...] "impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was [...] "likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding [...] "social advantages", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was [...] "closely linked to the socio-economic situation" [...] of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are [...] "public policy, public security or public health", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for [...] "employment in the public service".|$|E

It cannot be doubted that they left him for dead.
