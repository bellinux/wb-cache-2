Performance of these <b>controls</b> known as <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>Controls</b> is compared with the optimal cost (when possible) and the costs obtained with two well known heuristics known as Kanban Controls and Two Boundary Controls.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{selection}} of governance forms in interfirm collaborations {{taking into account the}} predictions from transaction costs and property rights theories. Transaction costs agurments are often used to justify the introduction of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>controls</b> in collaborations, but the ownership dimensions of going from "contracts" to "hierarchies" has been ignored in the past and with it the so called "costs of ownership". The theoretical results, tested with a sample of collaborations in which Spanish firms participate, indicate that the cost of ownership may o set the benefits of hierarchial controls and therefore limit their diffusion. Evidence is also reported of possible complementarities between reputation effects and forms of ownership that go together with <b>hierarchical</b> <b>controls</b> (i. e. joint ventures), in contrast with the generally assumed substitutability between the two.

We use a typology of alliance governance structures that differentiates structures by the magnitude of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>controls</b> to test hypotheses predicting alternative contractual choices. We use empirical data on alliance announcements in three worldwide industries over a 20 -year period to assess which factors explain the choice of alliance types. The {{findings suggest that the}} magnitude of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>controls</b> in contractual relationships such as alliances is influenced by the anticipated coordination costs and by expected appropriation concerns. 1 Corporations have increasingly seen alliances as attractive vehicles through which they can grow and expand their scope, and the rate at which interfirm alliances have been formed {{in the last two decades}} has been unprecedented (Harrigan, 1986; Anderson, 1990).
