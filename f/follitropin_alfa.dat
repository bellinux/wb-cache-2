40|$|Abstract Background The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to determine if <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone; r-hFSH) and lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinizing hormone; r-hLH) biopotencies were unchanged by reconstituting in sterile water for injection and mixing prior to injection. Methods The biopotencies of r-hFSH and r-hLH were determined following injection of female Sprague-Dawley rats with a mixture of <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> revised formulation female (RFF) and lutropin alfa (1 : 1, r-hFSH:r-hLH). Biopotencies of <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> RFF and lutropin alfa were measured using ovarian weight and ascorbic acid depletion assays, respectively, and compared with a reference standard. Stock mixtures of <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> RFF and lutropin alfa (1 : 1) were prepared within 1 h prior to each respective assay's injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. Separate low dose (<b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> RFF 1. 5 IU/rat, lutropin alfa 2 IU/rat) and high dose (<b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> RFF 3 IU/rat, lutropin alfa 8 IU/rat) treatments were prepared from stock mixtures or individual solutions by diluting with 0. 22 % bovine serum albumin saline solution and injected within 1 h of preparation. The main outcome measures were ovarian weight and ovarian ascorbic acid depletion. Results FSH bioactivities were similar (p > 0. 10) between the individual <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> RFF test solution (84. 2 IU) and <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> RFF/lutropin alfa (87. 6 IU) mixtures prepared within 1 h of injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. LH bioactivities were similar (p > 0. 10) between lutropin alfa (94. 7 IU) test solution and lutropin alfa/follitropin alfa RFF (85. 3 IU) mixtures prepared within 1 h of injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C for not more than 1 h prior to injection.

40|$|Abstract Background Gonadotrophins are {{routinely}} administered in assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment protocols. Recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (r-hFSH; <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa)</b> and recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH; lutropin alfa) can be administered individually or in a fixed combination. The ability to vary the FSH to LH dose ratio {{in a single}} injection without compromising the bioactivity of either gonadotrophin or generating losses of active principle is important for physicians and patients alike. Methods This study investigated whether <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (GONAL-f (R)), as lyophilized powder for reconstitution or solution from the GONAL-f (R) (filled-by-mass [FbM]) Prefilled Pen, {{could be used to}} reconstitute Pergoveris TM (follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa 150 IU/ 75 IU) lyophilized powder. In Ratio Groups 1 and 2, the r-hFSH:r-hLH ratio was 3 : 1; in Ratio Groups 3 and 4, the ratios of r-hFSH:r-hLH were 5 : 1 and 8 : 1, respectively. The protein content and bioactivity of each mixed solution were evaluated. The r-hFSH and r-hLH content was determined using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The biological activity of r-hFSH and r-hLH was assessed using the Steelman-Pohley and Van Hell in vivo bioassays in rats, respectively. Results Follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa 150 IU/ 75 IU lyophilized powder could be successfully mixed with <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> 75 IU FbM solution that was either reconstituted from lyophilized powder or injected directly from the prefilled pen to create solutions with ratios of r-hFSH and r-hLH from 3 : 1 to 8 : 1. The measured content of r-hFSH and r-hLH corresponded favourably with the target protein content in Ratio Groups 1 – 4. The in vivo target and measured bioactivity of r-hFSH and r-hLH were also closely matched in all Ratio Groups. Conclusion <b>Follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> lyophilized powder or solution can be accurately mixed with follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa 150 IU/ 75 IU lyophilized powder to enable physicians to administer ratios of r-hFSH and r-hLH in the IU range from 3 : 1 to 8 : 1.

40|$|Klaus Bühler Centre for Gynaecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Stuttgart, Germany Abstract: Gonadotropin {{treatment}} {{has been used}} in fertility treatment since the 1930 s. First, preparations coming from animals were injected, then, gonadotropins prepared from the pituitary glands of human cadavers. A great step was achieved with the introduction of human menopausal gonadotropin extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women. When cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease were recognized after the use of human pituitary-derived hormone injections, urinary gonadotropins were increasingly purified and then produced by the use of recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant gonadotropins were characterized by the extreme high specificity and the nearly 100 % purity. This allows for <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa,</b> the first recombinant-human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) approved, to be quantified and filled by mass, with a small variance of only ± 2 % and no more with a bioassay with a variance of 45 %. With recombinant preparations, it is also possible to cover the tremendous growing demand for gonadotropins. Ovarian stimulation has become a self-injecting procedure for the patients. Accurate and easy-to-use injection devices which minimize pain, difficulty, and stress are essential for patient compliance. So, two pen injectors adapted from the well-known insulin pen were introduced in fertility treatment, one as a multiple-use device rechargeable with premixed, prefilled cartridges with r-hFSH (follitropin β) and the other a disposable, prefilled drug delivery system with a liquid formulation of <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> filled by mass. The efficacy in comparison to the quite more cumbersome handling with ampoules and syringes has been proven very quickly. In several studies, {{it has been shown that}} patients had a preference to the prefilled <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> pen due to the faster preparation and were more confident of accurate dosing. The <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (filled by mass [FbM]) prefilled pen is a move toward better quality of treatment and also better quality of life for the women within the stressful period of fertility treatment.

Methods: Seventy-three UK women of reproductive age either administering daily treatment with self-injectable gonadotropins or about to start gonadotropin treatment for infertility (aged 24 &ndash; 47 years; 53 self-injection-experienced and 20 self-injection-na&iuml;ve) and 28 nurses from UK infertility clinics were recruited for the study. Following instruction, patients and nurses used the redesigned <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> pen to inject water into an orange and completed questionnaires to evaluate their experiences with the pen immediately after the simulated injections. Results: Most (88 %, n = 64) patients found it easy to learn how to use the pen. Among injection-experienced patients, 66 % (n = 35) agreed that the redesigned pen was easier to learn to use compared with their current method and 70 % (n = 37) also said they would prefer its use over current devices for all injectable fertility medications. All nurses considered the redesigned pen easy to learn and believed it would be easy to teach patients how to use. Eighty-six percent (n = 24) of the nurses thought it was easy to teach patients to determine the remaining dose to be dialed and injected in a second pen if the initial dose was incomplete. Compared with other injection devices, 96 % (n = 27) thought it was &quot;much easier&quot; to &quot;as easy&quot; to teach patients to use the redesigned pen. Based on ease of teaching, 68 % (n = 19) of nurses would choose to teach the pen in preference to any other injection method. Almost all (93 %, n = 26) nurses considered that having the same pen format for a range of injectable gonadotropins would facilitate teaching and learning self-injection.

Although biosimilar versions of r-hFSH (<b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa)</b> are currently on the market, given their structural complexity and manufacturing process, {{it is important to}} thoroughly evaluate them in comparison with the reference product. This evaluation should focus on how they differ (e. g., active component molecular characteristics, impurities and potency), as this could be associated with clinical outcome. This study compared the site-specific glycosylation profile and batch-to-batch variability of the in-vivo bioactivity of Bemfola, a biosimilar <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa,</b> with its reference medicinal product GONAL-f. The focus of this analysis was the site-specific glycosylation at asparagine (Asn) 52 of the α-subunit of FSH, owing to the pivotal role of Asn 52 glycosylation in FSH receptor (FSHR) activation/signalling. Overall, Bemfola had bulkier glycan structures and greater sialylation than GONAL-f. The nominal specific activity for both Bemfola and GONAL-f is 13, 636 IU/mg. Taking into account both the determined potency and the nominal amount the average specific activity of Bemfola was 14, 522 IU/mg (105. 6 % of the nominal value), which was greater than the average specific activity observed for GONAL-f (13, 159 IU/mg; 97. 3 % of the nominal value; p = 0. 0048), although this was within the range stated in the product label. A higher batch-to-batch variability was also observed for Bemfola versus GONAL-f (coefficient of variation: 8. 3 % vs 5. 8 %). A different glycan profile was observed at Asn 52 in Bemfola compared with GONAL-f (a lower proportion of bi-antennary structures [~ 53 % vs ~ 77 %], and a higher proportion of tri-antennary [~ 41 % vs ~ 23 %] and tetra-antennary structures [~ 5 % vs < 1 %]). These differences in the Asn 52 glycan profile might potentially lead to differences in FSHR activation. This, together with the greater bioactivity and higher batch-to-batch variability of Bemfola, could partly explain the reported differences in clinical outcomes. The clinical relevance of the differences observed between GONAL-f and Bemfola should be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin therapy {{plays an}} {{integral}} role in ovarian stimulation for infertility treatments. Efforts {{have been made}} {{over the last century}} to improve gonadotropin preparations. Undoubtedly, current gonadotropins have better quality and safety profiles as well as clinical efficacy than earlier ones. A major achievement has been introducing recombinant technology in the manufacturing processes for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and human chorionic gonadotropin. Recombinant gonadotropins are purer than urine-derived gonadotropins, and incorporating vial filling by mass virtually eliminated batch-to-batch variations and enabled accurate dosing. Recombinant and fill-by-mass technologies have been the driving forces for launching of prefilled pen devices for more patient-friendly ovarian stimulation. The most recent developments include the fixed combination of <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> + lutropin alfa, long-acting FSH gonadotropin, and a new family of prefilled pen injector devices for administration of recombinant gonadotropins. The next step would be the production of orally bioactive molecules with selective follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone activity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pharmacokinetic {{studies with}} XM 17 (Ovaleap®), a {{recombinant}} human follicle-stimulating hormone (r-hFSH, <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa),</b> have demonstrated good safety and tolerability in healthy women whose endogenous FSH levels were down-regulated {{with a long}} agonist protocol. In these studies, Ovaleap® pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional and bioequivalent to the reference <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> product (Gonal-f®). The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine whether Ovaleap® is equivalent to Gonal-f® with respect to the number of oocytes retrieved in infertile but ovulatory women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) therapy. Methods: This multinational, multicenter, randomized (1 : 1), active-controlled, assessor-blind, comparative study included infertile normally gonadotrophic women 18 to 37  years old with a body mass index of 18 to 29  kg/m 2 and regular menstrual cycles of 21 to 35  days undergoing ART therapy. During a 5 -day fixed-dose phase, women received 150  IU/day of Ovaleap® (n[*]=[*] 153) or Gonal-f® (n[*]=[*] 146), followed by an up to 15 -day dose-adaptation phase during which doses could be adjusted every 3 to 5  days, up to a maximum of 450  IU/day. Ovaleap® was to be deemed equivalent to Gonal-f® if the two-sided 0. 95 confidence interval (CI) for the difference in the number of oocytes retrieved fell within the equivalence range of ± 3 oocytes. Results: Similar numbers of oocytes were retrieved in the 2 treatment groups. The mean[*]±[*]SD number of oocytes retrieved was 12. 2 [*]±[*] 6. 7 in the Ovaleap® group and 12. 1 [*]±[*] 6. 7 in the Gonal-f® group (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). Regression analysis estimated a mean difference of 0. 03 oocytes between the treatment groups (95  % CI: − 0. 76 - 0. 82), which was well within the prespecified equivalence range of ± 3 oocytes. Ovaleap® and Gonal-f® showed favorable and comparable safety profiles, with no unexpected safety findings. Conclusions: Ovaleap® has shown the same efficacy and safety as Gonal-f® for stimulation of follicular development in infertile women (up to 37  years of age) who are undergoing ART therapy.

Methods: Starting from the study by Rettenbacher et al, a cost-effectiveness model was developed in the Italian and Spanish contexts. Clinical data on subjects, doses of gonadotropin, pregnancies, live-born children, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were used to feed the model. Costs related to drugs, hospitalizations, specialist visits, and examinations were retrieved from Italian and Spanish tariffs. Gonadotropin acquisition costs for Germany and the UK were also taken into account to expand the economical assessment to the other countries. The evaluation was done based on the National Health Service perspective. Sensitivity analyses, both univariate and probabilistic, as long as scenario analyses, tested the robustness of the model. Results: Originator follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) costs were € 3, 663 and € 6, 387 in Italy and Spain, respectively, whereas biosimilar FSH costs were € 3, 483 and € 6, 342. The efficacy was found to be 0. 52 for the originator and 0. 47 for the biosimilar. The average cost per live birth was estimated to be € 7, 044 and € 12, 283 for the originator FSH and € 7, 411 and € 13, 494 for the biosimilar for Italy and Spain, respectively. Furthermore, the originator FSH generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 3, 600 for Italy and € 900 for Spain compared to the biosimilar. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the base case model. Conclusion: This analysis indicated that the originator FSH is a cost-efficient treatment strategy for Italian and Spanish health services compared to the biosimilar and it would be worthwhile extending this evaluation to other countries.

40|$|Andreas Lammerich, Peter Bias, Beate Gertz Merckle GmbH, Ulm, Germany Background: XM 17 is a {{recombinant}} human follicle-stimulating hormone (<b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa)</b> for stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation during assisted reproductive therapy and {{for treatment of}} anovulation. Manufactured using Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human follicle-stimulating hormone gene, XM 17 has an identical amino acid sequence {{to that of the}} human protein as well as to those of the other approved {{recombinant human}} follicle-stimulating hormone products. Glycosylation patterns may differ slightly between products. The objectives of this first-in-human study were to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and dose-proportionality of single ascending subcutaneous doses of XM 17 in healthy young female volunteers. Methods: Endogenous follicle-stimulating hormone was downregulated by implanting a 1 -month depot of goserelin acetate 3. 6 mg on day 0 in eligible subjects. On day 14 of the experimental period, subjects received one of four ascending doses of XM 17. Blood sampling to obtain the pharmacokinetic profile of XM 17 was done at frequent intervals until 168 hours post-dose. Results: Following downregulation of endogenous follicle-stimulating hormone to < 4 IU/L, 40 subjects (of mean age 29 ± 5. 4 years) received single subcutaneous doses of 37. 5 (n= 4, pilot group), 75, 150, or 300 IU (n= 12 each) of XM 17. The mean serum concentration-time profiles of XM 17 revealed dose-related increases in maximum concentration (Cmax) within 24 hours followed by monoexponential decay for the three higher dose levels. Slopes estimated by linear regression for Cmax and AUC 0 – 168 h were ~ 1. 0 (0. 9052 IU/L and 1. 0964 IU·h/L, respectively). For each IU of XM 17 administered, Cmax and AUC 0 – 168 h rose by 0. 032 IU/L and 2. 60 IU·h/L, respectively. Geometric mean elimination half-life ranged from 54 to 90 hours. No antibodies to XM 17 were detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (12 events in eleven [27. 5 %] subjects) and dizziness (four events in four [10 %] subjects); two subjects (5 %) reported mild pain on touch at the injection site. Conclusion: Single subcutaneous doses of XM 17 up to 300 IU in healthy young women exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with good safety and tolerability.

A randomized, multi-centre, Phase 3 study in women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (n = 372) showed Bemfola yielding similar efficacy and safety profiles to Gonal-f. Women aged 20 – 38 years of age were randomized 2 : 1 to receive a single, daily, subcutaneous 150 [*]IU dose of either Bemfola or Gonal-f. This study tested equivalence {{in the number of}} retrieved oocytes using a pre-determined clinical equivalence margin of ± 2. 9 oocytes. Compared with Gonal-f, Bemfola treatment resulted in a statistically equivalent number of retrieved oocytes (Bemfola 10. 8 ± 5. 11 versus Gonal-f 10. 6 ± 6. 06, mean difference: 0. 27 oocytes, 95 % confidence interval: − 1. 34, 1. 32) as well as a similar clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer in first and second cycles (Bemfola: 40. 2 % and 38. 5 %, respectively; Gonal-f: 48. 2 % and 27. 8 %, respectively). No difference in severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed between treatment groups (Bemfola: 0. 8 %; Gonal-f: 0. 8 %). This study demonstrates similar clinical efficacy and safety profiles between Bemfola and Gonal-f, and suggests that Bemfola can be an appropriate alternative in ovarian stimulation protocols...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} several decades, {{as a result of}} an {{evolution}} in manufacturing processes, a marked development has been made in the field of gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation. Initially, therapeutic gonadotropins were produced from a simple process of urine extraction and purification; now they are produced via a complex system involving recombinant technology, which yields gonadotropins with high levels of purity, quality, and consistency. Methods A retrospective analysis of 865 consecutive intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) compared the clinical efficacy of three gonadotropins (menotropin [hMG; n = 299], highly-purified hMG [HP-hMG; n = 330] and <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> [r-hFSH; n = 236]) for ovarian stimulation after pituitary down-regulation. The endpoints were live birth rates and total doses of gonadotropin per cycle and per pregnancy. Results Laboratory and clinical protocols remained unchanged over time, except for the type of gonadotropin used, which was introduced sequentially (hMG, then HP-hMG, and finally r-hFSH). Live birth rates were not significantly different for hMG (24. 4 %), HP-hMG (32. 4 %) and r-hFSH (30. 1 %; p = 0. 09) groups. Total dose of gonadotropin per cycle was significantly higher in the hMG (2685 +/- 720 IU) and HP-hMG (2903 +/- 867 IU) groups compared with the r-hFSH-group (2268 +/- 747 IU; p Conclusion Although similar live birth rates were achieved, markedly lower doses of r-hFSH were required compared with hMG or HP-hMG. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the dose–response relationship {{of a novel}} recombinant human FSH (rhFSH; FE 999049) with respect to ovarian response in patients undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment; and prospectively study the influence of initial antimüllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations. DesignRandomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, AMH-stratified (low: 5. 0 – 14. 9 pmol/L [0. 7 –< 2. 1  ng/mL]; high: 15. 0 – 44. 9 pmol/L [2. 1 – 6. 3  ng/mL]) trial. SettingSeven infertility centers in four countries. Patient(s) Two hundred sixty-five women aged ≤ 37  years. Intervention(s) Controlled ovarian stimulation with either 5. 2, 6. 9, 8. 6, 10. 3, or 12. 1  μg of rhFSH, or 11  μg (150 IU) of <b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> in a GnRH antagonist cycle. Main Outcome Measure(s) Number of oocytes retrieved. Result(s) The number of oocytes retrieved increased in an rhFSH dose–dependent manner, from 5. 2 ± 3. 3 oocytes with 5. 2  μg/d to  12. 2 ± 5. 9 with 12. 1  μg/d. The slopes of the rhFSH dose–response curves differed significantly between the two AMH strata, demonstrating that a 10 % increase in dose resulted in 0. 5 (95 % confidence interval 0. 2 – 0. 7) and 1. 0 (95 % confidence interval 0. 7 – 1. 3) more oocytes in the low and high AMH stratum, respectively. Fertilization rate and blastocyst/oocyte ratio decreased significantly with increasing rhFSH doses in both AMH strata. No linear relationship was observed between rhFSH dose and number of blastocysts overall or by AMH strata. Five cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were reported for the three highest rhFSH doses and in the high AMH stratum. Conclusion(s) Increasing rhFSH doses results in a linear increase in number of oocytes retrieved in an AMH-dependent manner. The availability of blastocysts is less influenced by the rhFSH dose and AMH level. Clinical Trial Registration NumberNCT 01426386...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ovaleap® (<b>follitropin</b> <b>alfa),</b> a {{recombinant}} human follicle-stimulating hormone {{intended for use}} in controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART), showed therapeutic equivalence to Gonal-f® in a multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blind phase 3 Main Study. The current study examined safety, including immunogenicity, and efficacy of Ovaleap® in an open-label, uncontrolled, follow-up treatment period of up to 2 additional treatment cycles in patients who did not become pregnant in the phase 3 Main Study. Methods: Patients with negative biochemical or clinical pregnancy in the phase 3 Main Study, regardless of treatment group (ie, Ovaleap® or Gonal-f®), were eligible to participate. Patients received Ovaleap® (Merckle Biotec GmbH, Ulm, Germany) for up to 2 additional cycles, administered using a reusable semi-automated pen device. The primary objective was the assessment of safety, including adverse events (AEs), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), and anti-drug antibodies. Tolerability, patient satisfaction with the Ovaleap® pen device, and efficacy outcomes (as evaluated in the Main Study) were also assessed. Results: One hundred forty-seven patients were included in cycle 2, and 61 patients were included in cycle 3. In cycles 2 and 3, 10. 9 % (16 / 147) and 6. 6 % (4 / 61) of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), respectively. Three serious TEAEs (ie, appendicitis, OHSS, and borderline ovarian tumor) were reported and successfully resolved. The OHSS TEAE was the only OHSS reported in the study (0. 7 % [1 / 147]). Positive findings on anti-drug antibody assays in 6 serum samples did not show neutralizing activity or clinical relevance in biochemical pregnancy rate. No hypersensitivity reaction occurred. Most patients reported “very good”/“good” local tolerability. All patients were “very confident”/“confident” about dose accuracy and correctness of the injection. They all found use of the pen “very convenient”/“convenient” and were all “very satisfied”/“satisfied” with the pen device. Efficacy outcomes {{were consistent with the}} phase 3 Main Study. Conclusions: These findings further support the safety, including immunogenicity, and efficacy of Ovaleap® for stimulation of follicular development in infertile women undergoing ART. The findings support continued use of Ovaleap® for multiple cycles or a switch to Ovaleap® if pregnancy is initially not achieved with Gonal-f®.

Methods: This was a 3 -year, open-label, observational study evaluating data from women undergoing COS for assisted reproductive technology at 31 German fertility centers. Physicians stated their recommended r-hFSH starting dose, then generated a CONSORT-recommended r-hFSH starting dose. Physicians could prescribe any r-hFSH starting dose. The primary objective was to compare the r-hFSH starting dose recommended by the physician with the CONSORT-calculated dose and that prescribed. Statistical analyses were conducted post hoc. Results: Data were collected from 2, 579 patients; the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 30. 5 (2. 93) years (range: 19 – 40 years). The mean (SD) CONSORT-calculated r-hFSH starting dose was significantly lower than the physician-recommended dose (134. 5 [38. 0] IU versus 164. 6 [47. 1] IU; P< 0. 0001); the mean (SD) starting dose prescribed was 162. 2 (48. 4) IU. CONSORT-calculated doses were prescribed for 27. 3 % (number [n] = 677) of patients, and non-CONSORT-calculated doses prescribed for 72. 7 % (n= 1, 800). The mean (SD) number of oocytes retrieved per patient was 10. 6 (6. 15) and 11. 4 (6. 66) in the CONSORT and non-CONSORT groups, respectively; the mean (SD) number of embryos transferred per patient was 1. 98 (0. 41) and 2. 03 (0. 45), respectively. Clinical pregnancy rates per COS cycle were 38. 8 % (CONSORT) and 34. 8 % (non-CONSORT) (P= 0. 142); clinical pregnancy rates per embryos transferred were 45. 0 % and 39. 5 %, respectively (P= 0. 049). Miscarriage occurred in 14. 8 % of all clinical pregnancies (CONSORT: 12. 5 %; non-CONSORT: 15. 3 %). The rate of grade 3 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was 0. 3 % (n= 2) in the CONSORT group and 0. 6 % (n= 11) in the non-CONSORT group. OHSS led to hospitalization in 0. 81 % (n= 21) of cases (CONSORT group: 0. 74 % [n= 5]; non-CONSORT group: 0. 83 % [n= 15]). Conclusion: Physician-recommended r-hFSH starting doses were generally higher than those calculated by CONSORT; most patients were prescribed a higher starting dose than that recommended by CONSORT.
