50|$|Lidar {{systems can}} be used to measure {{concentration}} profiles of atmospheric gases (i.e., water vapor, ozone), and industrial emissions (i.e., SO2, NO2, HCl). Such measurements are performed using two basic types of lidar; Raman <b>lidar</b> and <b>Differential</b> <b>Absorption</b> <b>lidars</b> (DIAL). In the first type, the Raman lidar detects the scattering of the laser beam due to Raman scattering. The frequency shift induced by such scattering is unique for each molecule, and acts as a “signature” to detect its specific contribution. The second type, DIAL systems, emit two beams with two distinct frequencies. One beam is tuned exactly on a molecular absorption line and the other beam is tuned in a nearby wavelength without molecular absorption. By examining the intensity difference of the scattered light at the two frequencies, DIAL systems can separate the contribution of the specific molecule in the atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Following a blind intercomparison {{of ozone}} {{profiling}} {{instruments in the}} Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change at Lauder, New Zealand, revisions to the analyses were made resulting in a new data set. This paper compares the revised results from two <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>lidars</b> (RIVM and GSFC), a microwave radiometer (Millitech/LaRC), and electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) balloon sendes (NIWA). In general, the results are substantially improved compared to the earlier blind intercomparison. The level of agreement was similar both for single profiles and for the campaign average profile and was approximately 5 % for the lidars and the sendes over the altitude range from 15 to 42 km (32 km for sendes). The revised microwave data show a bias of 5 - 10 % high in the region from 22 to 42 km. Starting at 42 km, the lidar errors increase significantly, and comparisons of the microwave results were not possible above this altitude. 1...|$|R

These two systems have been providing high-resolution vertical profiles of ozone number density between 15 - 50 km, several nights a week since 1989 (TMF) and 1993 (MLO). The climatology presented here is typical of early night ozone values with only a small influence of the Pinatubo aerosols and the 11 -year solar cycle. The observed seasonal and vertical structure of the ozone concentration at TMF is consistent with that typical of mid- to subtropical latitudes. A clear annual cycle in opposite phase below and above the ozone concentration peak is observed. The observed winter maximum below the ozone peak {{is associated with a}} maximum day-to-day variability, typical of a dynamically driven lower stratosphere. The maximum concentration observed in summer above the ozone peak emphasizes the more dominant role of photochemistry. Unlike TMF, the ozone concentration observed at MLO tends to be higher during the summer months and lower during the winter months throughout the entire stratospheric ozone layer. Only a weak signature of the extra-tropical latitudes is observed near 19 - 20 km, with a secondary maximum in late winter.
