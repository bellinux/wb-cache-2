5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of <b>economic</b> <b>statistics,</b> so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E
5|$|The dating of recessions {{during this}} period is controversial. Modern <b>economic</b> <b>statistics,</b> such as gross {{domestic}} product and unemployment, were not gathered {{during this period}}. Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, {{which can be used}} to compare recessions.|$|E
5|$|Major modern <b>economic</b> <b>statistics,</b> such as {{unemployment}} and GDP, were not compiled {{on a regular}} and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of the foreign {{exchange}} market, traders liquidate their positions in various currencies to take up positions in safe-haven currencies, such as the US dollar.

500|$|From 1969 to 1984, he edited The Libertarian Forum, also {{initially}} with Hess (although Hess's involvement {{ended in}} 1971). The Libertarian Forum provided {{a platform for}} Rothbard's writing. Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the National Review in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that Ronald Reagan's 1980 election as President was a victory for libertarian principles, and he attacked Reagan's economic program {{in a series of}} Libertarian Forum articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a [...] "fraud" [...] and a [...] "hoax", and accused Reaganites of doctoring the <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> in order to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment.

500|$|Many feminists call {{attention}} to value judgments in economic analysis. This idea {{is contrary to the}} typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners. For example, Geoff Schneider and Jean Shackelford suggest that [...] "the issues that economists choose to study, the kinds of questions they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character." [...] Similarly, Diana Strassmann comments, [...] "All <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition. In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics. [...] Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled." [...] Feminist economists {{call attention}} to the value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.|$|E

2500|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to quantify concepts such as Gross domestic product and per-capita GDP in an age when reliable <b>economic</b> <b>statistics</b> were not gathered, De Vries and Van der Woude have nevertheless ventured to make a number of informed estimates, justified in their view, by the [...] "modern" [...] character of the Dutch economy in this period. They arrive at a size of the economy around 1660 that was approximately 45 per cent of that of Britain (with two-and-a-half times the Dutch population). This works out at a per capita income that is 30 to 40 percent higher than that of Great Britain (admittedly still a premodern economy at the time).|$|E
