We present {{the results of an}} empirical interface refinement study that was conducted to determine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the four change <b>display</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The results show some preference for the symbolic presentation of changes, specifically that most study participants liked the documentation method best.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} effort was to postulate and experi-ment with new techniques for interactively creating <b>data</b> <b>displays.</b> The approach discussed in this report was to explore a auser orien-ted language for specifying <b>data</b> <b>display</b> procedures as opposed to data manipulation procedures that could be specified using conven-tional computer languages such as FORTRAN or ALGOL. In accomplishing this effort the appropriateness of using a list-ol string processing language for programming the users language is discussed. A set of <b>data</b> <b>display</b> language operators is proposed an a subset of these were programmed for a PDP- 1 with COLOR-CRT display using an interpretive language. Experiments were con-ducted to obtain user reaction to the concept. Finally, a formal specification of the <b>data</b> <b>display</b> language syntax rules is developed. The conclusions reached are that such a users oriented display language {{is relatively easy to}} use and meaningful work can be accomplished by combining a few basic operators to form display procedures. Further research in this area should consider the inclusion of mathematical expressions within the <b>data</b> <b>display</b> i 7. 1 pnfyy [...] -...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Data</b> <b>Display</b> Debugger (DDD) {{is a novel}} {{graphical}} {{user interface}} to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers. Besides "usual" features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD provides a graphical <b>data</b> <b>display,</b> where <b>data</b> structures are <b>displayed</b> as graphs. A simple mouse click dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents. Complex data structures can be explored incrementally and interactively, using automatic layout if preferred. Each time the program stops, the <b>data</b> <b>display</b> reflects the current variable values.
