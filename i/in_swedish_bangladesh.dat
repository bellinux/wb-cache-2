40|$|I {{conducted}} 3 -experiments {{to examine}} incidental language learning of two languages by bilingual Swedish- and English-speaking children, monolingual English- speaking children, and monolingual English-speaking adults. More specifically, I {{tested for the}} presence of Naming in English and <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> for all participants. In Experiment 1, I tested {{for the presence of}} Naming <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> and <b>in</b> English for 5 simultaneously bilingual Swedish- and English-speaking preschoolers. Results showed that the Swedish- and English-speaking children performed similarly in both languages. Naming repertoires were balanced across the languages. In Experiment 2, I replicated the first experiment with 5 monolingual English-speaking preschoolers. Results showed that all participants had the listener component of Naming in repertoire for both languages, but results differed for the speaker component of Naming. One participant emitted 0 speaker responses in either language, 3 participants emitted more correct speaker responses in English than <b>in</b> <b>Swedish,</b> and 1 participant emitted more correct speaker responses <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> than <b>in</b> English. In Experiment 3, I tested for the presence of Naming <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> and <b>in</b> English for 30 monolingual English-speaking adults. Results showed that adults listening capability was balanced <b>in</b> English <b>in</b> <b>Swedish,</b> but {{there was a significant difference}} in the number of correct speaker responses in English than <b>in</b> <b>Swedish...</b>|$|R

40|$|Researchers from Mid Sweden University and Kalmar University {{organised}} surveys {{on reading}} skills <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> municipalities. This paper {{will focus on}} the surveys made in four municipalities between 2002 and 2007. All students in grade 8 in these four municipalities participated in the surveys-in total 16, 287 students. These surveys included a reading test for the students and information about the students collected from the teachers, including participation <b>in</b> instruction <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language and in their mother tongues. Students of immigrant origin in Sweden are offered the possibility to participate <b>in</b> instruction <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language and in instruction in the student's mother tongue. No obvious trends over time in the participation <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language and mother tongue instruction were found in the four municipalities on the tests we gave, in spite of national trends. There was no difference in results on the reading tests <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> between those students who participated in mother tongue instruction and those who did not, but there was a difference in test results between those who participated <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language and those who did not. Those who did not participate (<b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language instruction) did, on average, score higher on the test. When different language groups are compared, it can be noted that a majority in all groups of immigrant students neither participate <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language nor in mother tongue instruction. However, there are important differences between boys and girls and between language groups. Girls seemed to be more willing than boys to participate in voluntary mother tongue instruction, while boys more often than girls had to participate in compulsory lessons <b>in</b> <b>Swedish</b> as a second language...|$|R
