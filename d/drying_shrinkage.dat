50|$|The {{chemical}} processes of Portland cement hydration lead to {{another type of}} shrinkage, called theautogeneous shrinkage, which is observed in sealed specimens, i.e., at no moisture loss. It is caused partly by chemical volume changes, but mainly by self-desiccation due to loss of water consumed by the hydration reaction. It amounts to only about 5% of the <b>drying</b> <b>shrinkage</b> in normal concretes, which self-desiccate to about 97% pore humidity.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results from {{a study of the}} possibilities of using red mud, a waste product derived from the digestion of bauxite with a versatile mineralogical composition, as additive in concrete, grout mortar and cement paste. Two types of red mud from China were used in the experiments. Concrete in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the compressive strength and <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of concrete. Grout mortars in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the flexural and compressive strengths, <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and water permeability of mortar. Cement paste in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the capacity of Cs adsorption and ionic leaching. The results show that addition of red mud does not contribute to nor impair the strength of the concrete or grout mortar but instead acts as inert filler. The decrease in compressive strength of concrete with addition of red mud is mainly due to the increased water-cement ratio. There is no significant increase in <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of concrete with addition of red mud, but there is a certain increase in <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of grout mortar, especially when more than 20 % of the binder is replaced by red mud. Addition of red mud in grout mortar significantly increases the water permeability of the mortar due to the increased water-cement ratio. Owing to the fluctuant results from the adsorption test, it is difficult to draw a conclusion of the adsorption capacity for Cs by addition of red mud in concrete. However, the preliminary results from a quick adsorption test indicated a good adsorption behavior of cement with the addition of red mud, especially at a low initial Cs concentration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInitial {{defects and}} water have a {{significant}} influence on the fatigue behavior of RC bridge slab. Specially, since the RC bridge slab has a relatively high surface-to-volume ratio, initial cracks tend to be generated on the surface with respect to <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> during curing stage, and therefore the durability and the long-time serviceability of the bridge slab under severe environmental conditions would be influenced significantly. However {{in the majority of}} practical cases, this risk is generally omitted in the design stage. The object of this work is to establish a quantitative understanding about the influence of initial defects as well as water on the fatigue performance of RC bridge slab. Here, the fatigue behavior of RC bridge slab subjected to central fixed pulsating loads is experimentally investigated and analytically simulated with full three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analysis. 7 full-size slab specimens are systematically designed with initial defects by means of intentionally inducing <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> or artificial damage before loading. Then upper surface of some specimens are implemented to water-exposure condition, while other specimens are loaded in dry condition as comparison. According to experimental results, water is found to cause dramatic reduction in fatigue life of RC bridge slab, at least one order shorter than that of air loading cases. The three-dimensional fatigue damage simulation successfully predicts the characteristic mode of failure under fixed-point pulsation. Importantly, analysis indicates that the initial stiffness is reduced and the ultimate failure mode is altered from flexural to shear punching due to <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> accordingly the fatigue life of RC slabs is clearly shortened...|$|R

We tested the compressive strength (CS), <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> (DS) and frost resistance (FR), using microstructure change analysis combined with component reactions. The crystalline components of raw materials and bricks were examined by X-ray diffraction. Other properties of the brick, including leaching toxicity and radioactivity, were also measured to examine the environmental safety of EMSW steam-autoclaved bricks. The results show that the most appropriate conditions were: EMSW content of 30 - 40 % by mass ratio, cement content of 10. 5 - 12 %, formation pressure of 15 - 20 MPa, W/C ratio of 0. 4 and steam pressure of 1. 2 - 1. 5 MPa. Under those conditions, the compressive strength can be higher than 15 MPa, <b>dry</b> <b>shrinkage</b> lower than 0. 11 %, and compressive strength loss and weight loss lower than 10 % and 2 %, respectively. The compressive strength, leaching toxicity and radioactivity of the brick manufactured under the aforementioned conditions met the standards of GB 11945 - 1999 MU 15, GB 5085. 3 - 2007 and GB 6566 - 2010, respectively.
