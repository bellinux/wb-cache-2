5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were <b>extremely</b> <b>helpful</b> in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} the Inchoatia taxa are very disjunctly {{distributed}} means that attempting to discriminate species as against subspecies is {{even more of a}} subjective opinion than usual, because reproductive isolation under natural conditions cannot be observed. An objective or a generally accepted method to weigh morphological differences does not exist. DNA analyses may be <b>extremely</b> <b>helpful,</b> but cannot always be considered decisive with regard to species or subspecies status. Molecular phylogeny reconstructions made clear that reproductive isolation and lineage splitting do not always run entirely parallel, resulting in paraphyletic species. In Inchoatia, with some island-like distributions of presumably high alpine taxa, this may also be the case.|$|E

40|$|The recent Nonlocal Means filter (NLM) {{exhibits}} exciting {{performance for}} image or video denoising. However, {{the estimation of}} NLM is biased and tends to keep the value of noise. In the process of NLM, the target pixel (the pixel being processed) is involved in patch distance measuring, which, in turn, controls {{the restoration of the}} target pixel. Such design makes the estimation of the target pixel to be biased to the noise. The biased estimation may degrade the reconstruction especially when the noise energy is large. In this paper, the cause and influence of such biased estimation phenomenon is analyzed in detail. We will show that the biased estimation can be <b>extremely</b> harmful or <b>helpful,</b> depending on the degree of noise. Taking advantage of this, a new method is proposed to adaptively control the contribution of target pixel in patch distance measuring.

6000|$|I have doubtless said enough, however, in {{illustration}} of the interest attaching to all this service, a service in which {{not one of the}} forces of social energy and devotion, not one of the true social qualities, sympathy, ingenuity, tact, and taste, fail to come into play. Such an exercise of them, as all the incidental possibilities are taken advantage of, represents for us all, who are happily not engaged in the huge destructive work, the play not simply of a reparatory or consolatory, but a positively productive and creative virtue {{in which there is a}} peculiar honour. We Americans are as little neutrals as possible where any aptitude for any action, of whatever kind, that affirms life and freshly and inventively exemplifies it, instead of overwhelming and undermining it, is concerned. Great is the chance, in fact, for exhibiting this as our entirely elastic, our supremely characteristic, social aptitude. We cannot do so cheaply, indeed, any more than the opposite course is found, under whatever fatuity of presumption, inexpensive and ready-made. What I therefore invite all those whom this notice may reach to understand, as for that matter they easily will, is that the expenses of our enlightened enterprise have to be continuously met, and that if it has confidence in such support it may go on in all the alert pride and pity that need be desired. I am assured that the only criticism the members of the Corps make of it is that they wish more of their friends would come and support it either personally or financially--or, best of all, of course, both.

40|$|Summary: Vocal fold {{injection}} is an <b>extremely</b> {{important and}} <b>helpful</b> procedure {{for a variety}} of voice disorders. Flexible endoscopic guided trans-oral vocal fold injection has the advantages of (1) being minimally invasive (2) avoiding an open surgical procedure; (3) having a short learning curve to accomplish necessary injection technique; (4) direct visualization of injection site (5) safely converting to an office based procedure; (6) reducing the costs associated with a hospital or surgical based procedure and (7) providing the patient a speedy recovery with excellent voice results. The calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) product, Radiesse™, has proven to be an excellent, biocompatible, durable soft tissue augmentation product for this procedure. The physiology of voice production is a complex action beginning in the cerebral cortex with interaction taking place between the brain’s speech centers and other areas, i. e., the motor cortex; motor nuclei in the brain stem and spinal cord. These areas organize and dispatch messages so that vocal activity can be coordinated between the larynx, thoracic and abdominal musculature and voca...|$|R
