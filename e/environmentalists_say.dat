The 40 kilometres from the port to the plant cuts through the Sundarbans and it includes the river flow path. <b>Environmentalists</b> <b>say</b> these coal-carrying vehicles are not often covered as they scatter large amounts of fly ash, coal dust and sulphur, and other toxic chemicals are released throughout the life of the project.

Most polluted is the 100-kilometre downstream stretch—a meandering stream from above the confluence with the Yarmouk to the Dead Sea. <b>Environmentalists</b> <b>say</b> the practice of letting sewage and brackish water flow into the river has almost destroyed its ecosystem. Rescuing the Jordan could take decades, according to environmentalists. In 2007, Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME) named the Jordan River {{as one of the}} world's 100 most endangered ecological sites, due in part to lack of cooperation between Israel and neighboring Arab states. The same environmentalist organization had said in a report that the Jordan River could dry up by 2011 unless the decay is stopped. The flow rate of the Jordan River once was 1.3 billion cubic metres per year; as of 2010, just 20 to 30 million cubic metres per year flow into the Dead Sea. For comparison, the total amount of desalinated water produced by Israel by 2012 was estimated to be about 500 million cubic metres per year.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Environmentalists</b> <b>say</b> the amended {{regulations}} won't remove toxic {{products from}} the shelves and will create [...] "paralysis by analysis," [...] as industries can litigate against DTSC over unfavorable department decisions. Activists say California was poised {{to lead the way}} on toxics regulation but now is faced with potentially one of the weakest chemical-regulatory mechanisms in the nation. [...] According to CHANGE (Californians for a Healthy & Green Economy), the revised regulation is a betrayal of the Green Chemistry promise and ignores two years of public input, while caving to backroom industry lobbying. Furthermore, it is a betrayal to public interest groups, businesses, and residents of California and legislators who supported the intent of this bill, to protect Californians and spur a healthy, innovative green economy. <b>Environmentalists</b> <b>say</b> the toxics department gutted the initiative {{at the behest of the}} chemical industry, and then put out the changes for public comment during a 15-day period just before Thanksgiving. This was a violation of the law requiring a 45-day public comment period when a substantial reworking of state regulations is proposed. The new Director of California's Department of Toxic Substance Control, Debbie Raphael, announced that mid-October 2011 is the new target date for new draft regulations to implement California's Green Chemistry Law and new draft guidelines were issued October 31, 2011. The public comment period for the latest version of the draft regulations ends December 30, 2011.|$|E

This week, researchers around the Basin will give us their view of how their local area has fared in recent years and tell us whether the proposed plan will make things better or worse. Jonathan Sobels, Lecturer in Human Geography at Flinders University, spent the recent drought working with communities in South Australia’s Lower Lakes. Today he tells us their great fear is that they will lose their water again, thanks to a “politician-induced drought”. Read in full Image: Flickr / all shots imaging ...|$|R

50|$|The above {{private sector}} {{activities}} {{have resulted in}} major protests from citizen groups. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests has been urged by 500 residents requesting for abandoning the programme of handing over lakes to privatisation of lakes as they are developed as recreation focal points. Civil rights groups are in the fore front of these protests as they allege that the lake which is a common property resource is illegally fenced off and thus only privileged few could access it While the private developer contends that the lake will be a unique recreational place, the others feel that the entry fee of Rs 20 per person would exclude the traditional users (farmers, fishing communities, cattle herders, washer - men, and casual workers) of the lake. Environmentalists mention that the lake’s wetland ecology sustained scores of water birds but it will soon become only a pretty hygienic bowl. <b>Environmentalists</b> also <b>say</b> that four types of vegetation in the ecosystem grow at different water depths, sustaining about 30 species of birds. Birds such as sandpipers and clovers will find the lake too deep once the lake is deepened by removing the silt. Deep water birds such as ducks and cormorants will be disturbed by boating.|$|R

Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive.

2500|$|Some activists {{disagree}} with the principle of carbon offsets, likening them to Roman Catholic indulgences, {{a way for the}} guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior. George Monbiot, an English <b>environmentalist</b> and writer, <b>says</b> that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution. Proponents hold that the indulgence analogy is flawed because they claim carbon offsets actually reduce carbon emissions, changing the business as usual, and therefore address the root cause of climate change. Proponents of offsets claim that third-party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projects, and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets. On October 16, 2009 responsibletravel.com, once a strong voice in favour of carbon offsetting, announced that it would stop offering carbon offsetting to its clients, stating that [...] "too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries. Global reduction targets will not be met this way." ...|$|R
