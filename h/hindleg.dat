5|$|Along {{with the}} holotype, Russell {{designated}} a specimen collected by Barnum Brown in 1913 as the paratype of D. torosus. This specimen (AMNH 5438) consists {{of parts of}} the <b>hindleg,</b> the pelvis {{and some of its}} associated vertebrae. It was discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. The Dinosaur Park Formation was formerly known as the Upper Oldman Formation and dates back to the middle Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8million years ago. Daspletosaurus fossils are known specifically from the middle to upper section of the formation, between 75.6 and 75.0 million years ago. In 1914, Brown collected a nearly complete skeleton and skull; forty years later his American Museum of Natural History sold this specimen to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. It was mounted for display in Chicago and labeled as Albertosaurus libratus for many years, but after several skull features were later found to be modeled in plaster, including most of the teeth, the specimen (FMNH PR308) was reassigned to Daspletosaurus torosus by Thomas Carr in 1999. A total of eight specimens have been collected from the Dinosaur Park Formation over the years since, most of them within the boundaries of Dinosaur Provincial Park. Phil Currie believes that the Dinosaur Park specimens represent a new species of Daspletosaurus, distinguished by certain features of the skull. Pictures of this new species have been published, but it still awaits a name and full description in print.|$|E

25|$|Tendinitis usually {{involves}} {{disruption of the}} tendon fibers. It is most commonly seen in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in a front leg—the tendon that runs {{down the back of}} the leg, closest to the surface. Tendinitis is uncommon in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of a front leg or either the SDFT or DDFT in a <b>hindleg.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{the horse}} is on a lead, the legs on the inside front and hind, have greater {{extension}} than the outside front and hind. Therefore, a horse on the right lead will have its right hind (beat two) come slightly further under its body than the left <b>hindleg</b> had when it grounded (beat one), and the right foreleg (beat three) will reach further out from the horse's body than the left foreleg had extended (beat two).|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis has <b>hindleg</b> {{proportions}} {{more like}} those of more primitive theropod dinosaurs than avialans, with long legs indicating a fast-running lifestyle. However, while long legs normally indicate a fast runner, the legs and even feet and toes of Anchiornis were covered in feathers, including long feathers on the legs, {{similar to those in}} the hindwings of Microraptor. Long leg feathers on the lower legs may have slowed the running speed of Anchiornis. In modern birds, especially those that live on the ground, the lower legs tend to show reduction or even loss of feathers. The hind wings of Anchiornis were smaller and made of more curved, symmetrical feathers than those of Microraptor, suggesting that they were used mainly for display rather than flight. However, they might still have granted the animal some kind of aerodynamic advantage, even if their primary purpose was for display or some other function.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part the femur and tibia are the longest leg {{segments}} but variations in the lengths and robustness of each segment relate to their functions. For example, gressorial and cursorial, or walking and running type insects respectively, usually have well-developed femora and tibiae on all legs, whereas jumping (saltatorial) insects such as grasshoppers have disproportionately developed metafemora and metatibiae. In aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) and bugs (Hemiptera), the tibiae and/or tarsi of one or more pairs of legs usually are modified for swimming (natatorial) with fringes of long, slender hairs. Many ground-dwelling insects, such as mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae), nymphal cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), have the tibiae of the forelegs (protibiae) enlarged and modified for digging (fossorial), whereas the forelegs of some predatory insects, such as mantispid lacewings (Neuroptera) and mantids (Mantodea), are specialized for seizing prey, or raptorial. The tibia and basal tarsomere of each <b>hindleg</b> of honey bees are modified for the collection and carriage of pollen.|$|E

50|$|The head shape aside (which in {{any case}} is not obvious from all angles), the long-tailed planigale looks rather like a very small mouse with a long, bare tail. The muzzle is pointed, the fur a nondescript and {{variable}} brown, the <b>hindlegs</b> a little bigger than the forelegs, allowing it to stand semi-crouched on <b>hindlegs</b> and tail, rather like a tiny squirrel.|$|R
5000|$|The tarsi {{consist of}} two or three segmnents; two claws are borne on the last tarsal segment of the <b>hindlegs.</b> Though the <b>hindlegs</b> are hairless and appear ill-suited for {{swimming}} compared to the stout [...] "flippers" [...] of the water boatmen (Corixidae) or the backswimmers (Notonectidae), the small size of the pygmy backswimmers makes for different physics and allows them to swim well regardless.|$|R
25|$|Some paleontologists have {{doubted the}} biplane hypothesis, and have {{proposed}} other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander et al. described {{the construction of}} a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several <b>hindleg</b> configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for Microraptor. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on Microraptor and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for Microraptor. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of Microraptor which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur Hesperonychus, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} [...] is a hereditary condition {{which occurs}} in most dog breeds to some extent, according to scores from a 2001 UK Kennel Club scheme, the Clumber Spaniel has the second worst breed mean scores. Furthermore, {{a survey conducted}} by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 45.7% of Clumber Spaniels tested were affected by the condition. Initial signs are usually first noted when the dog is between five and twelve months old, and may include a swaying <b>hindleg</b> gait, <b>hindleg</b> lameness, muscle wastage around the hindquarters, reluctance to and fatigue during exercise, inability to climb stairs or jump up. The dog can appear hunched up with an arched back, and in the very worst cases may wince with pain when moving its hindlegs. Medical treatment can vary from the administration of painkillers to surgical correction depending on the severity of the condition.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1970s, {{there was}} a dearth of {{scientific}} evidence on the welfare impact of coursing. The first thorough study {{was carried out in}} 1977–79 by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW), albeit that it said that it was [...] "not easy to draw conclusions from these reports". According to a review of this study conducted for the Burns Inquiry, [...] "Of the 53hares killed, 43had neck injuries, 18of which were inflicted by the handler (as evidenced from a clean break and no teeth marks). No clean breaks were believed to have been caused by dogs (where tooth marks were evident). The UFAW team's assessment was that all chest injuries would have been quickly fatal (in six cases these included a punctured heart); 10animals without neck injuries had chest injuries. Abdominal injuries included six punctured livers, but generally involved a ruptured gut. In the UFAW team's opinion, <b>hindleg</b> and back injuries could have been extremely painful until chest or neck injuries were inflicted".|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the patagial membranes of gliding vertebrates, the aerodynamic surfaces used by falling wingless ants to direct their aerial descent are unknown. We conducted ablation experiments to assess the relative contributions of the <b>hindlegs,</b> midlegs and gaster to gliding success in workers of the Neotropical arboreal ant Cephalotes atratus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Removal of <b>hindlegs</b> significantly reduced the success rate of directed aerial descent {{as well as the}} glide index for successful flights. Removal of the gaster alone did not significantly alter performance relative to controls. Equilibrium glide angles during successful targeting to vertical columns were statistically equivalent between control ants and ants with either the gaster or the <b>hindlegs</b> removed. High-speed video recordings suggested possible use of bilaterally asymmetric motions of the <b>hindlegs</b> to effect body rotations about the vertical axis during targeting manoeuvre. Overall, the control of gliding flight was remarkably robust to dramatic anatomical perturbations, suggesting effective control mechanisms in the face of adverse initial conditions (e. g. falling upside down), variable targeting decisions and turbulent wind gusts during flight...|$|R

That is what these boards are for. We skin 'em by cutting loose around the feet and then cutting {{down the back}} of the <b>hindlegs</b> to and around the vent and then skin the <b>hindlegs</b> carefully, and also the tail. Then the skin is turned back and {{stripped}} off the body wrong side out to the ears, taking as little fat as possible. The ears are cut off close to the head, and the skin is cut loose around the eyes and nose. The easiest way is to hang the critter up by the <b>hindlegs</b> after skinning out these and the tail.|$|R

2500|$|The imagines {{of these}} beetles are {{generally}} oval in shape, {{with a very}} convex upperside, and are generally [...] long. They are generally yellowish to light brown in color, frequently with light and dark patterns dotted with 10 or more rows of punctures on the elytra. The family's most distinctive characteristic is the large coxal plates of the hindlegs, which are immobile (though not fused in the centerline) and extend back along the underside to cover most of the abdomen base and the <b>hindleg</b> trochanters and femora. They are used as air storage supplementing the air carried under the elytra.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "take-off" [...] {{begins when}} the forelegs leave {{the ground and}} is {{completed}} when the hindlegs leave the ground. Once the horse leaves the ground, {{he is unable to}} influence the trajectory that his center of mass follows through the air, which makes take-off the most critical phase of the jumping process. Most of the energy required to clear an obstacle is produced by the hind legs. The longer the hindlegs are in contact with the ground, the greater their capacity for producing power; the further forward the hindlegs are placed under the body, closer to the obsctacle, the longer this stance phase. Power is produced by the compression of the <b>hindleg,</b> which flexes at the hip, stifle, hock, and fetlock, and then releases energy like a spring.|$|E
2500|$|The {{small head}} has large, wide-set eyes and alert ears. The body is strong, with a broad, deep rib cage, and of medium length. The legs are strong, long from body to knee and hock, but with short cannons with strong, dense bone, and a flat-fronted knee; the foreleg rises to a {{shoulder}} that is well-angled {{and with good}} freedom of movement, and the <b>hindleg</b> rises to a quarter that is well-muscled and rounded in appearance, rather than flat or sloping. The mane and tail should be full and flowing, and the pony's movement free and smooth. The Dartmoor pony has a kind temperament, the ponies being reliable, gentle and calm. Most Dartmoor ponies stand between a pony should stand at no more than 12.2hands under the breed standard, introduced in 1924.

2500|$|Czerkas' {{interpretation}} of the <b>hindleg</b> feathers noted by Norell proved to be incorrect the following year, when additional specimens of Microraptor were published by Xu and colleagues, showing a distinctive [...] "hindwing" [...] completely separate from the forelimb wing. The first of these specimens was discovered in 2001, and between 2001 and 2003 four more specimens were bought from private collectors by Xu's museum, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. Xu also considered these specimens, most of which had hindwings and proportional differences from the original Microraptor specimen, {{to be a new}} species, which he named Microraptor gui. However, Senter also questioned this classification, noting that as with Cryptovolans, most of the differences appeared to correspond with size, and likely age differences. Two further specimens, classified as M. zhaoianus in 2002 (M. gui had not yet been named), have also been described by Hwang and colleagues.|$|E
