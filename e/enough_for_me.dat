5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following Omkara, Kapoor took a {{short break}} from acting, as she felt that [...] "nothing [...] {{challenging}} <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say yes". In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented, [...] "In my initial years in the industry, I pushed myself {{to do a lot}} of work because I was greedy. I did some films—which I now regret—purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films." [...] Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the Farhan Akhtar action-thriller Don (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name).|$|E

I'm using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, which I think are very, very worrying as things stand." [...] Some of this later poetry included [...] "The 'Special Relationship'", [...] "Laughter", and [...] "The Watcher".|$|E

Each of the main developers reflected on what they were proudest of: Naka expressed relief that Sonic Team were able to [...] "get a good overall balance" [...] for the game, whereas Miyoshi thought that the voice navigation system was the strongest aspect. Main programmer Takuya Matsumoto was delighted to see it released before the Saturn's discontinuation, saying [...] "the fact that we've been able to push the Saturn this far is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to die happy". Burning Rangers was released exactly nine months before the Japanese release of the Dreamcast.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1957, Cagney ventured {{behind the}} camera {{for the first and}} only time to direct Short Cut to Hell, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business".|$|E

[...] However, he also added, [...] "so yeah, other than the faked rapes, this was a largely entertaining episode." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was very negative towards the episode, calling it [...] "downright weird" [...] and that it [...] "veers wildly in tone". He also was critical of Hearst's plotline, {{saying that it was}} too referential to real-life events and fictional works to stand well on its own. Concluding, the reviewer wrote, [...] "The oscillations between drama and comedy, normally the show's strength, seem excessive. [...] And the rape storyline continues to be tonally difficult at best, tone-deaf at worst." ...|$|E

500|$|Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune {{wrote that}} [...] " [...] almost as touched and {{relieved}} by the reunion as Desmond and Penny are"; however, {{she did not}} review [...] "The Constant" [...] as favorably as other critics, giving it an [...] "A–". [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal gave [...] "The Constant" [...] a mixed review. [...] He described it as [...] "an entertaining episode [...] a fine acting performance by Henry Ian Cusick", but criticized Desmond's repetitive story arc, criticized Frank's character, said that [...] "Jeff Fahey is a fine actor, but so far, his character just hasn't really evolved <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to care yet" [...] and concluded, [...] "this episode didn't seem to really raise or answer anything of major importance, so I can't help but feel that it {{was nothing more than}} mid-season filler." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy graded it with four out of five stars, and wrote that [...] "a refreshing shift in Lost's tone enabled loyal viewers to have their hearts warmed by the long distance smoochfest between Desmond and his beloved Penny".|$|E

Beauty of conception and style is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> But this book, whose title (Fleurs du mal) says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even {{the knowledge of the}} French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to tell you that}} I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E

Former World Wrestling Federation veteran Tito Santana also made an appearance at the event. Both Santana and himself were quoted by the Cape Breton Post voicing their criticism towards steroid abuse in professional wrestling. Jessome said [...] "I've got size and technical abilities, plus I love to entertain a crowd, so I think that's <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> To put your health at risk just to do something like that, that's not acceptable."

2500|$|Denver's first {{marriage}} was to Anne Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She {{was the subject}} of his hit [...] "Annie's Song," [...] which he composed in only ten minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift after the couple had an argument. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of [...] "Rocky Mountain High", inspired by a camping trip with Anne and some friends, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen continuously until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and girl, Anna Kate, who Denver would say were [...] "meant to be" [...] theirs. Denver once said, [...] "I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be remembered by. That's more than enough." [...] Zachary, who is African-American, {{was the subject of}} [...] "A Baby Just Like You", a song that included the line [...] "Merry Christmas, little Zachary" [...] and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary John Denver: Country Boy (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Anne said that they were too young and immature to deal with John's sudden mega-success. The ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged, he nearly choked Martell, then used a chainsaw to cut their marital bed in half.|$|E
2500|$|Prayer {{seems to}} me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, {{the rules of the game}} as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the {{challenge}} of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws. The ever-sleepless sea in its bed, crying out [...] "how long?" [...] to Time; million-formed and never motionless flame; the contemplation of these two aspects alone, affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime. It {{seems to me}} that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish. I feel no need for such. However, I would not, by word or deed, attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords. It is simply not for me. Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels. The springing of the yellow line of morning out of the misty deep of dawn, is glory <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I know that nothing is destructible; things merely change forms. When the consciousness we know as life ceases, I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world. I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change. I was, when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim. I shall return with the earth to Father Sun, and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire, and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space. Why fear? The stuff of my being is matter, ever changing, ever moving, but never lost; so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men? The wide belt of the universe has no need for finger-rings. I am one with the infinite and need no other assurance.|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
