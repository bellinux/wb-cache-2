These surface oxygen sites can form OH center dot center dot center dot N and O center dot center dot center dot HN hydrogen bonds with NH 3 and enhance charge transfers from NH 3 to the graphene oxide. The dissociation of the adsorbed NH 3 into the chemisorbed NH 2 or NH species through the H atom abstractions leads to hydroxyl group hydrogenation and ring-opening of <b>epoxy</b> <b>group.</b> The reactions of NH 3 with the hydroxyl and epoxy groups are predicted to be exothermic with different energy barriers, depending on the oxidation species and the atomic arrangement of these groups. The hydroxyl group exhibits relatively higher reactivity toward hydrogen abstraction from the adsorbed NH 3 than the <b>epoxy</b> <b>group</b> in GO with a single oxygen group. The presence of a neighboring OH group may activate the oxygen groups to facilitate the surface reaction of NH 3.
