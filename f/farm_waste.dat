In the Philippines, however, {{there is an}} imbalance in the production, conversion, and utilization of these wastes resulting to environmental degradation and climate change [2]. Heavy use of agro-chemicals and intensive rice cultivation resulted to soil fatigue and ecological disturbance in the biodiversity of fauna and flora [4, 5]. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) has been promoting the use of rice straw and rice hull either as mulching and soil amendment materials for organic farming or as feedstock for direct combustion and gasification [1]. However, this intervention is still inadequate and fragmented. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to integrate the management of <b>farm</b> <b>wastes</b> to produce sustainable and ecologically profitable products.

Ethiopia being agriculture-based country with farm and animals, the availability of wastes and manures varies in different regions. This can be used by the farmers for production of organic manures and used to maintain soil fertility and improve crop production. The country faces the soil fertility problems in different regions that can be managed by the use of available organic resources. In addition, the use of expensive chemical fertilizers that reduce the soil fertility can be minimized by developing the on-farm compost methods that help the farmers to use locally available resources.|$|R

40|$|Pollution {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} issues that is currently impeding the development of fish farming. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) has the potential to reduce the accumulation of organic wastes in the environment by using taxa of lower trophic levels such as filter feeders. However, the capacity of filter feeders to assimilate significant quantities of fish <b>farm</b> <b>wastes</b> has not yet been fully tested in situ. We analyzed the stable isotopes δ 13 C and δ 15 N in mussels from six fish farms and from six other areas that were not influenced by fish farming, at two water strata (surface and mid-water) across a marked gradient of eutrophication along more than 900 km of coastline in the Western Mediterranean. We found that the mussels did not directly assimilate fish <b>farming</b> <b>wastes.</b> Consequently, fish <b>farming</b> <b>wastes</b> did not constitute a major component of mussel diet, irrespective of local productivity and depth in the water column. These outcomes do not necessarily mean that IMTA is not suitable in other cases, but rather that there should be a shift in the rationale of IMTA by modifying the concept of direct assimilation of wastes to a more general approach of IMTA based on regional budgets of nutrients.

Paper and clothes can be made of hemp instead of trees and cotton. Tropical foods won't grow in many places in Europe, but they will grow in insulated greenhouses or tents in Europe. Soybean plant cellulose can replace plastic (made from oil). Ethanol from <b>farm</b> <b>waste</b> or hempseed oil can replace gasoline. Rainforest medicine plants grown locally can replace many imported medicines.

50|$|Unfortunately, {{costs of}} {{producing}} ethanol from cellulosic feedstock such as wood chips are still about 70% higher than production from corn, {{because of an}} extra step in the production process, when compared to production of corn-derived ethanol.

Consider: Finding a bacterium from a cow's intestinal tract or from elephant dung that has the correct enzyme to degrade cellulose, and then bringing in geneticists to modify that enzyme kept this discouraging feat from ever-growing beyond its embryonic state. Now, that is all changing with a race by approximately thirty companies attempting to accomplish this alchemical feat, and in the process working directly or coordinating with: environmental groups, biotechnology firms, some major oil companies, chemical giants, auto makers, defense hawks, and venture capitalists.

50|$|Despite {{the success}} of the trout fry {{stocking}} programme, the health of the River Avon continued to decline. The river bed became compacted and many parts of the river turned into muddy, stagnant bogs from all the silt and mud running off the surrounding land and the untreated sewage and <b>farm</b> <b>waste</b> that ended up in the river. The river was rapidly becoming unsuitable for trout. Frank Sawyer undertook a major project in the early 1950s known as ‘the great clean up.’ This involved dredging the worst hit areas of the river to remove mud and silt and return the bed to chalk and gravel. Old sluices and hatch gates that impounded or reduced flow were removed to speed up the flow and scour the beds clear of filth. Old water meadow carrier streams were restored to provide a natural filter and a nursery for small fish and insects. Finally silt catchment pits were dug in the worst hit areas to prevent the silt and run off from reaching the main river. The great clean up had a huge and profound effect on the River Avon. The river returned to its former glory as one of the world’s premier chalk streams. There was no longer a requirement to stock trout as the natural regeneration was sufficient. There was an explosion in fly and other river life and the fishing was described by all SDFFA members as the best {{in the history of the}} river.|$|E
