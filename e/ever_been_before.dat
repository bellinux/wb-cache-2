5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

25|$|On 31 December 1954, Diệm {{established}} the National Bank of Vietnam and replaced currently Indochinese banknote by new Vietnamese banknotes. In early 1955, although American advisors incited Diệm {{to negotiate with}} the leaders of the political-religious forces who threatened to overthrow his position and to forge an anti-communist bloc, he was determined to attack his enemies to consolidate his power. In April 1955, Diệm's army forces took most of Bình Xuyên's posts in Saigon after a victory in the Battle of Saigon. Within a few months, Diệm's troops wiped out the Bình Xuyên's remnants, leaving only a few small bands, who then joined forces with the communists. The failure of Bình Xuyên marked the end of French efforts to remove Diệm. After the defeat of Bình Xuyên, the authority and prestige of Diệm's government increased. Most of Cao Đài leaders chose to rally to Diệm's government. Diệm then further dismantled the private armies of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects. By the end of 1955, Diệm had almost taken control of South Vietnam, and his government was stronger than it had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> In April 1956, along with the capture of Ba Cụt, the leader of the last Hòa Hảo rebels, Diệm almost subdued all of his non-communist enemies, and could focus on his Vietnamese communist opponents. According to Miller, Diệm's capacity in subduing his enemies and consolidating his power strengthened the support to his government of the US—who had planned to withdraw its backing from Diệm during his early difficult years of leadership.|$|E
500|$|In the 1921 season, Waddington took 105 wickets at {{an average}} of 18.94. The {{introduction}} of the pace bowler George Macaulay into the team gave him more support, but according to a later edition of Wisden, Waddington's form was poor that year. The almanack's review of the 1921 season suggested that, when at full strength, Yorkshire had the best bowling attack in the championship, but the team finished third. Both Waddington and Yorkshire were more successful the following year: the county won the first of four successive championships, and Waddington took 133 wickets {{at an average}} of 16.08. He was often effective in the most important matches. Wisden suggested that [...] "Yorkshire were very good at every point, but their main strength lay in the excellence and variety of their bowling... was, on occasions, more successful against strong sides than he had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> He had days of astonishing success and once, at least, bowled with a bewildering swerve [...] that recalled George Hirst at his best." [...] Among his best performances were figures of eight for 34 against Northamptonshire (the best of his career), seven wickets for six runs in a Sussex total of 20 and eight for 35 against Hampshire. His season ended with festival games at Eastbourne, where he represented the North against the South and played for a team of ex-Royal Air Force servicemen.|$|E

Because he {{had only}} been allowed leave {{at the last minute}} his expedition clothing had to be bought at Darjeeling bazaar and it was inadequate. On 20 May 1922 with Mallory, Howard Somervell and Teddy Norton, Morshead was in the first assault team, which attempted the reaching the summit without oxygen. As the party left the North Col to head up towards the north east ridge, Norton's rucksack fell down to the glacier and this reduced the overnight clothing for camp V at [...] The camp was at a higher altitude that anyone had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> The next morning another rucksack was let slip but Morshead climbed down [...] to recover it. However, on resuming the climb Morshead was almost immediately unable to continue and so went down to camp V while the other three continued. The team reached [...] before turning back.|$|E

The lyrics for [...] "Rocket Skates" [...] contained [...] "beautiful yet violent imagery" [...] and were compared to the song [...] "Knife Prty" [...] from White Pony. Deftones also {{thought it would be}} difficult to tour in support of a new album with memories of Cheng attached to it. Commenting on songwriting, Moreno stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|The United States' {{monopoly}} {{on nuclear weapons}} was broken by the Soviet Union in 1949 when it tested its first nuclear explosive, the RDS-1. With this, many in the US Government, {{as well as many}} citizens, perceived that the United States was more vulnerable than it had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> In 1950, during the first big Civil Defense push of the Cold War—and coinciding with the Alert America! initiative to educate Americans on nuclear preparedness The adult-orientated Survival Under Atomic Attack was published and contains [...] "duck and Cover" [...] or more accurately, cover and then duck advice without using those specific terms in its Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks section. 1. Try To Get Shielded 2. Drop Flat On Ground Or Floor 3. Bury Your Face In Your Arms("crook of your elbow"). The child-orientated film Duck and Cover was produced a year later by the Federal Civil Defense Administration in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|His {{analysis}} of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown prior to the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that {{the middle of the}} 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. [...] "The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> or than it has ever been since...." ...|$|E

[...] Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says [...] "It's pathetic. She lets everyone walk all over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason." [...] In [...] "Two to Go", Dark Willow remarks [...] "Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie." [...] Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: [...] "Bored now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fronto's letters {{continued}} through Marcus' early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons {{were more important}} now than they had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b> He believed Marcus was [...] "beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence". Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: [...] "Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape." [...] The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved {{by the people of}} Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: [...] "not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech". Fronto was hugely pleased.|$|E
2500|$|Vine's cricket {{career was}} not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first {{first-class}} match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better than he had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before,</b> scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution a little too far and keep an undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, {{and in the course of}} a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs.|$|E

2500|$|After Dave Malloy first {{performed}} on the Ars Nova stage in 2010, Artistic Director Jason Eagan, was blown away by his originality, range, and rigor, {{which led to a}} curiosity of what else was swirling around his head. Malloy became Ar Nova's 2012 Composer in Residence, giving Malloy access to all of Ars Nova's resources for one year- time, space, money, writing retreats, and a commission to create a new music-driven work to be produced at Ars Nova. When Dave proposed a musical based on Tolstoy's War and Peace Jason knew it was beyond Ars Nova's typical resources, but the project was too good to pass up. Jason knew that Ars Nova could push Dave farther than he had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>before,</b> and Dave could push Ars Nova farther than they had been before. October 2011 commenced the first weeklong workshop used to further develop the characters, story, music, and explore the idea of mixing a concert party and theater into one event. As the workshop ended Jason knew that this production would take more resources than they typically put into each production, and would take Ars Nova's entire production budget, a budget usually reserved for two productions, to accomplish this lofty goal. [...] In April of 2012, the production went through its second workshop to explore how the piece would live on its feet in the space.At the conclusion of the second workshop designer, Mimi Lin was brought on and made the decision to elevate the performers on runways that would swirl around the audience, allowing the performers to move through the space in full view. August 27, 2012, marked the date for the first rehearsal at Ars Nova. It was a month of creatively fueled blood, sweat and tears by a tremendous group of artists giving their all. The show officially opened at Ars Nova on October 16, 2012, {{and by the end of}} that week, the entire run was sold out. The extension sold out within one hour.|$|E
