Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do.

500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon.

2500|$|Ellen E Jones from The Independent though Dyer in EastEnders seemed [...] "inevitable" [...] {{and called}} him [...] "the cockney messiah [...] come to save EastEnders". She said that Dyer walks the [...] "thin line between {{national}} treasure and national laughing stock", so EastEnders—"which works best when it's an overblown cockney pantomime"—would be Dyer's [...] "natural home". Kevin O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror {{said that it would}} take more than hiring Dyer to [...] "stop the rot", as fans were getting [...] "fed up" [...] of watching the show. Katy Brent from the Daily Mirror said: [...] "I'm kind of intrigued to see what Danny Dyer is going to bring to the table, or bar in his case, but I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a little while to be convinced by him. No offence Dan, I'm sure you'll be great, but I'm a little sceptical when 'names' are brought in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{contribution}} in music came after she met William Orbit {{at a party}} and tried to beg a cigarette from him. They began a relationship shortly after, and he encouraged her to do some spoken word for his Strange Cargo project and to sing. Possibly the best-known work from that time is [...] "Water from a Vine Leaf", which she co-wrote and which was released as a limited-edition single. It was also {{at this time that}} Orbit and Orton covered John Martyn's [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil", which was not only the first song that they recorded together, but also their first release in Japan, as a duet called Spill (later re-released in the UK in 1997). She regarded Orbit's influence as very positive, commenting [...] "I think William pulled me out of the crowd and pulled me out of the gutter, in a way. Because I don't know where my enthusiasm was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me,</b> because it was pretty raw to say the least." ...|$|E

It is law, and as law it will be found in the {{criminal}} statutes.|$|E

Now, you may think it impertinence on my part if you choose, but it really does seem to me that you are very much interested in Mrs. Chester.

Newton himself might now resort to any manner he liked. His eyes had raked the floor to recover the position of something dropped or misplaced, and something, above all, awkward or compromising; and he had wanted his companion not to command this scene from the hearth-rug, the hearthrug where he had been just before holding him, hypnotising him to blindness, because the object in question would there be most exposed to sight Mark embraced this with a further drop--while the apprehension penetrated--of his power to go on, and with an immense desire {{at the same time that}} his eyes should seem only to look at his friend; who broke out now, for that matter, with a fresh appeal.

I guess that even if the ladies went upon the theory of the accident, there was always a kind of a merciful uncertainty about it, and that was my wife's notion, too.

"That I cannot say, Guy; but it {{may well}} be that he thinks that this {{marriage}} which has been so long talked of may not take place, and that the negotiations have been continued solely for the purpose of keeping him quiet while France was busied with her own troubles. Moreover, I know that the king has been already enlisting men, that he is impatient at having been put off so often with soft words, and that embassy is intended to bring matters to a head; therefore if, as I gathered from some of my friends at his court, he is eager for fighting, it may be that his ambassadors will demand conditions which he is sure beforehand the King of France will not grant. At any rate I shall ride with Dorset to Paris; whatever the sentiments of the Burgundians or Orleanists may be towards me will matter nothing, riding as I shall do in the train of the earl. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you with <b>me,</b> as well as John Harpen, for I must do as well as others, and have had to lay out a goodly sum in garments fit for the occasion, for the king is bent upon his embassy making a brave show.

You have looked at me with your great eyes, Julia, and at first you saw nothing but a fat, plain old man, with plenty of conceit and a humour for idle speeches. And today you think a little differently, and as the days go on you will think more differently still, for I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you with <b>me,</b> Julia, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep you with me, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep the light in your eyes and the laughter at your lips, in the only way that counts.

I shall take you into the world where the music is born, and your eyes will be closed there, and you will only know that there is another soul there who is your guide, and in whom you trust, and for whom you have a strange feeling. That is how love comes, Julia--the only sort of love which lasts. It isn't born in this land, it doesn't even flourish in this universe. If you don't come up in the clouds to find it, it isn't the sort that lasts. You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find it with me, dear." ...|$|R
