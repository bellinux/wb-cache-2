25|$|A {{full-length}} portrait {{sculpture of}} Junípero Serra {{is on the}} property of the mission. The cast stone sculpture, by Arthur Putnam, was completed in 1909, cast between 1916–1917 and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled. Funding for the piece came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately H. 6ft. 6 in. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a monk's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down,</b> with his head bowed and eyes downward. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is {{one of a series of}} allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well maintained.|$|E

Michael (or [...] "Mikey" [...] as Ben calls him) is Susan and Ben's youngest, a smart, geeky adolescent. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on his family, {{thinking}} {{he is more}} sensible {{than the rest of}} them put together, and often ends up getting them out of trouble. Since starting university he has experimented with bleached hair and piercings. In series 10 Michael comes out and tells his family that he is gay; he is relieved when they accept this.|$|E
