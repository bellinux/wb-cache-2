5|$|Marge and Lisa {{discover}} Bart's {{deception and}} inform the passengers {{that the virus}} is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the <b>ice</b> <b>slide</b> they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the <b>ice</b> <b>slide,</b> with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how much fun his life has been.|$|E
25|$|During {{the holiday}} season (November–January), Knights Plaza {{constructs}} an outdoor ice rink {{in front of the}} arena and hosts events nightly to celebrate {{the holiday season}}. During Light Up UCF, a high tech light show consisting of over 75,000 lights dances around the plaza to holiday music, and live concerts are performed by bands such as the Marching Knights and local artists. During the 2008 inaugural year, it attracted over 150,000 attendees. The 2009 season includes a 20% larger ice rink with the Arctic Guide <b>Ice</b> <b>Slide,</b> the McDonald's Ferris Wheel, Kris Kringle's Carousel, Santa's Village and many more lights to provide more entertainment for attendees.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{two songs}} {{in addition to}} [...] "Enjoy It While You Can". [...] "Boy from School" [...] by English electronic music band Hot Chip is played {{at the start of}} the episode during a montage that shows a boring week in the life of Bart, including his time at school. When the Simpsons go down the penguins' <b>ice</b> <b>slide</b> at the end of the episode, [...] "Winter's Love" [...] by American neo-psychedelia band Animal Collective is heard. [...] "A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again" [...] also includes two classical music pieces. Warburton decided to use French composer François-Adrien Boieldieu's [...] "Concerto for Harp and Strings" [...] for the first shot of the cruise ship in the episode. As described by Ledesma on his blog, this piece reappeared in a [...] "more dire and dark treatment" [...] later in the episode during a shot of the rundown ship. Russian composer Mikhail Glinka's overture from his Ruslan and Lyudmila opera is played over a montage that shows Bart taking part in the fun activities on the cruise.|$|E

60|$|A {{whole family}} of otters, {{three or four}} of them, were fishing there at my feet in utter unconsciousness. The {{discovery}} took my breath away. Every little while the bubbles would shoot across from my side, and watching sharply I would see Keeonekh slide out upon the lower shelf of ice {{on the other side and}} crouch there in the gloom, with back humped against the ice above him, eating his catch. The fish they caught were all small evidently, for after a few minutes he would throw himself flat on the <b>ice,</b> <b>slide</b> down the incline into the water, making no splash or disturbance as he entered, and the string of bubbles would shoot across to my side again.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{mechanistic}} explanation for observed metrics for drumlins, which represent their sizes and shapes. Our explanation {{is based on}} a concept of drumlin growth occurring through a process of instability, whereby small amplitude wave forms first grow as <b>ice</b> <b>slides</b> over a bed of deformable sediments, followed by a coarsening process, in which the wavelength as well as the relief of the drumlins continues to grow. The observations then provide inferences about the growth process itself...|$|R
5000|$|Bad Mr. Frosty - A snowman {{with a bad}} attitude. His special attacks include {{throwing}} snowballs, spitting sharp {{balls of}} <b>ice,</b> <b>sliding</b> along the ground and kicking his opponent, and turning into a snow boulder and rolling into his opponent. His arena in 1-player mode is an icy lake {{in front of an}} ice block castle with penguin spectators.

All furniture is made of ice. As in the Kiruna ice hotel, the bar serves drinks and cocktails in ice glasses.|$|E
40|$|Near the South Pole, a large {{subglacial}} lake exists {{beneath the}} East Antarctic Ice Sheet less than 10 km {{from where the}} bed temperature is inferred to be − 9 °C. A thermodynamic model was used to investigate the apparent contradiction of basal water existing {{in the vicinity of}} a cold bed. Model results indicate that South Pole Lake is freezing and that neither present-day geothermal flux nor ice flow is capable of producing the necessary heat to sustain basal water at this location. We hypothesize that the lake comprises relict water formed during a different configuration of ice dynamics when significant frictional heating from <b>ice</b> <b>sliding</b> was available. Additional modelling of assumed basal sliding shows frictional heating was capable of producing the necessary heat to fill South Pole Lake. Independent evidence of englacial structures measured by airborne radar revel ice-sheet flow was more dynamic in the past. <b>Ice</b> <b>sliding</b> is estimated to have ceased between 16. 8 and 10. 7 ka based on an ice chronology from a nearby borehole. These findings reveal major post-Last Glacial Maximum ice-dynamic change within the interior of East Antarctica, demonstrating that the present interior ice flow is different than that under full glacial conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{title of}} the book is derived from a spider-shaped ice field high on the north face of the mountain, towering above the town of Grindelwald. As Harrer describes, and the climbers discovered, the White Spider is the key to a {{successful}} ascent of the Nordwand. Although physically exhausted by the time they reach that point, climbers must navigate the steep ice-field to reach the peak's summit. The White Spider acts as a funnel, with rock and <b>ice</b> <b>slides</b> channelled through the ice field, putting the climbers in great danger while on the field.|$|R
50|$|Sergei Sergeyevich Bodrov (Серге́й Серге́евич Бодро́в; December 27, 1971 - September 20, 2002), {{also known}} as Sergei Bodrov Jr., was a Russian actor who had lead roles in the films Brother, Prisoner of the Mountains, East/West and Brother 2.

5000|$|... 70 {{percent of}} the {{facilities}} of Star City are covered and air-conditioned. The amusement park introduced various types of rides and attractions in the Philippines. It pioneered the double-deck carousel, 360-degree-loop roller coaster (the Zyklon Loop), and water log ride (the Jungle Splash) in the country. It hosts Snow World, the largest permanent ice entertainment area in the country, which features ice carvings, a snow play area and the country's longest <b>ice</b> <b>slide.</b> Another attraction in the amusement park is the inverted roller coaster Star Flyer.|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} a two-dimensional ice sheet is described. It includes basal <b>ice</b> <b>sliding</b> dependent on the basal water pressure, which itself is described by a simple theory of basal drainage. We show that this simple but sophisticated model predicts surges of the ice mass in realistic circumstances, and we descnbe these surges by solving the problem numerically. We also are able to descnbe some parts of. the surge analytically. The numerical solution of the model IS a delicate matter, and highliIghts pitfalls to be avoided if more complicated models are to be solved successfully...|$|R
50|$|Roller coaster {{amusement}} rides have origins back to <b>ice</b> <b>slides</b> {{constructed in}} 18th-century Russia. Early technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports. The technology {{evolved in the}} 19th century to feature railroad track using wheeled cars that were securely locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century, these elements intensified {{with the introduction of}} steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to invert riders.|$|R
50|$|The {{subject of}} the statues varies and often {{features}} an event, famous building or person from the previous year. For example, in 2004, there were statues of Hideki Matsui, the famous baseball player who at that time played for the New York Yankees. A number of stages made out of snow are also constructed and some events including musical performances are held. At the Satoland site, visitors can enjoy long snow and <b>ice</b> <b>slides</b> {{as well as a}} huge maze made of snow. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of regional foods from all over Hokkaidō at the Odori Park and Satoland sites, such as fresh seafood, potatoes and corn, and fresh dairy products.|$|R
