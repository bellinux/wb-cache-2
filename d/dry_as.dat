It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to <b>dry</b> <b>as</b> separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the <b>dry,</b> <b>as</b> well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E

25|$|Since sesame is a small, flat seed, it is {{difficult}} to dry it after harvest because the small seed makes movement of air around the seed difficult. Therefore, the seeds need to be harvested as <b>dry</b> <b>as</b> possible and stored at 6% moisture or less. If the seed is too moist, it can quickly heat up and become rancid.|$|E

This well was <b>dry,</b> <b>as</b> were two others drilled {{over the next two years}} on Cornwallis and Bathurst Islands. All three wells were technical successes.|$|E
25|$|Designers {{and users}} of UDDTs {{should strive to}} keep the feces pile as <b>dry</b> <b>as</b> {{possible}} as {{this is the key}} factor in prevention of odor and flies (flies are not attracted to dry feces). During storage, the feces’ natural moisture slowly evaporates and is exhausted through the vault’s ventilation system, or is absorbed by the dry cover material. This process is called drying, dehydration or desiccation.|$|E

The Hmong manpower pool was nearly <b>dry,</b> <b>as</b> only teenagers and aging men were still available.

In London, overcrowding was endemic in the slums; a family living in one room was common. Rents were high in London; half of working-class households paid one-quarter to one-half of their income on rent.|$|E

Copper and Bacon creeks, both flowing from North Cascades National Park, merge into the Skagit from the right as it meanders slowly through an agricultural valley, past Marblemount, where the Cascade River joins from the left, and Rockport, where it receives its major tributary, the Sauk River, from the left.|$|E
25|$|By 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as <b>dry</b> <b>as</b> it is today, due {{to reduced}} {{precipitation}} and higher temperatures {{resulting from a}} shift in the Earth's orbit. As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.|$|E
25|$|He saw the sea as {{a remnant}} {{of the mass of}} {{humidity}} that once surrounded Earth. A part of that mass evaporated under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant. He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun. For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go <b>dry</b> <b>as</b> well. According to Aristotle's Meteorology (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.|$|E

25|$|Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) is a government-owned ISO 9002 Certified {{corporation}} in India. One {{of the four}} production plants of IREL is situated near Chavara, {{in the suburbs of}} Kollam city. The plant operates on a mining area containing as high as 40% heavy minerals and extending over a length of 23km in the Chavara belt. The present annual production capacity of Chavara unit engaged in <b>dry</b> <b>as</b> well as wet (dredging/ up-gradation) mining and mineral separation stands at 1,54,000t of ilmenite, 9,500t of rutile, 14,000t of zircon and 7,000t of sillimanite. In addition the plant has facilities for annual production of ground zircon called zirflor (-45 micron) and microzir (1–3 micron) of the order of 6,000t and 500t respectively. The other plants of IREL are Manavalakurichi, OSCOM and Rare Earths Division at Aluva.|$|E
25|$|The {{transitional}} style (640-625 BC) {{linked the}} orientalizing (Proto-Corinthian) with the black-figure style. The old animal frieze {{style of the}} Proto-Corinthian period had run <b>dry,</b> <b>as</b> did the interest of vase painters in mythological scenes. During this period animal and hybrid creatures were dominant. The index form of the time was the spherical aryballos, which was produced in large numbers and decorated with animal friezes or scenes of daily life. The image quality is inferior compared with the orientalizing period. The most distinguished artists of the time were the Shambling Bull Painter, whose most famous work is an aryballos with a hunting scene, the Painter of Palermo 489, and his disciple, the Columbus Painter. The latter’s personal style can be most easily recognized in his images of powerful lions. Beside the aryballos, the kotyle and the alabastron {{are the most important}} vase shapes. The edges of kotyles were ornamented, and the other decorations consisted of animals and rays. The two vertical vase surfaces frequently have mythological scenes. The alabastrons were usually painted with single figures.|$|E
