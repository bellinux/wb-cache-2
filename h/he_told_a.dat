5|$|Over the winter, Aristagoras {{continued}} to foment rebellion. In one incident, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> group of Paeonians (originally from Thrace), who Darius {{had brought to}} live in Phrygia, {{to return to their}} homeland. Herodotus says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the Persian high command.|$|E
5|$|He next {{went down}} to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd {{scattered}} after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area {{at the end of the}} cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> congressional committee {{that a group of}} wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations. A final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} June 2008 Virginia Democratic primary, Moran {{endorsed}} Senator Barack Obama of Illinois {{for the presidency}} over New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton.

Obama won the Virginia primary, and carried the state {{when he won the}} general election in November.|$|E
5|$|The 1966–67 season proved {{frustrating}} for United, despite {{the introduction of}} another club great {{in the form of}} Eddie Gray. Leeds finished fourth, five points behind champions Manchester United, and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals after defeat to Chelsea. They made progress in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, beating DWS (Netherlands), Valencia, Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the final, where they were beaten 2–0 on aggregate by Yugoslavian outfit Dinamo Zagreb. At {{the end of the season}} he was named as the Footballer of the Year, succeeding his brother who had won it the previous year. During the award ceremony <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> number of amusing stories and won a standing ovation from the crowd, this started him on a successful sideline as an after-dinner speaker.|$|E
50|$|In late 2003, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{interviewer}} {{that his}} favorite bassists were Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Johnny Gayden (Albert Collins Band) and Charles Mingus.|$|R

25|$|In March 2015, Knight {{was hospitalized}} after <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> judge {{that he was}} {{suffering}} from blindness and other complications. Knight fired attorneys handling his murder case and claimed he was receiving inadequate medical treatment while in custody.|$|E
25|$|The New York Post {{states that}} {{initially}} Imam Abdul Rauf said {{the project would}} be funded entirely by the Muslim American community, though later <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> London-based Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that he would seek funding from Muslim and Arab nations. The latter story is also reported by NBC.|$|E
25|$|He {{is married}} to Bridget McConnell, and has two adopted {{children}} by that marriage, Hannah and Mark.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{absolutely}} pointless {{story of}} how a man had helped a young woman across the street, and seen her ankle in the process. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> it with immense gusto, laughing and repeating the point at least six times.|$|R
5000|$|Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal agreed. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{audience}} at Gaza’s Islamic University that “responsibility for Palestine {{is bigger than}} one faction alone... Hamas cannot do without Fatah and Fatah cannot do without Hamas.” ...|$|R

25|$|In October 2013, Snowden {{said that}} before flying to Moscow, he gave all the {{classified}} documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, and kept no copies for himself.

During his first American TV interview, in May 2014, Snowden said he had protected himself from Russian leverage by destroying the material he had been holding before landing in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{action of}} his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for {{re-election}} in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> group of African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Ian Brown, John Squire and Mani {{have all}} had {{successful}} careers since the Roses' breakup.

25|$|Charles and Bruce {{were the}} first father-son tandem to serve {{at the same time}} in the history of the Oregon State Senate. In 2003, Charles Starr created some {{controversy}} when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> constituent in a letter to “run - not walk - to remove their children from public schools” in response to the constituent’s opposition to charter schools. At the time, Starr was chairman of the Senate Education Committee, and in June 2003 his lawn was filled with plastic pink flamingos paid for by a fundraising campaign at a local elementary school. Democrats called for Starr to be replaced as chairman of the education committee. During the 2005 legislative session he served as vice chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, and as vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Neil Lake needed three metal plates {{inserted}} {{in his face}} after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake took down the registration of his attacker's Harley-Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had been riding around with the same number plates as him; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> judge he knew {{the identity of the}} actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi who said that he was working in his hometown {{on the day of the}} attack. He would later be one of the three Hells Angels jailed for six years after the brawl with the Outlaws at Birmingham Airport.|$|E
500|$|Baird {{indicated}} afterward {{not only}} that he was loyal to Harper, {{but that he was}} uninterested in ever becoming party leader. In 2011 <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> newspaper, [...] "Some people may have when growing up, always harboured leadership ambitions. I've never harboured leadership ambitions. It is the honest-to-God truth." ...|$|E
25|$|He capped {{off this}} period of intense {{creativity}} with another monograph, a full-length study of Wallace Stevens, with whom he identified {{more than any other}} poet at this stage of his career, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> {{audience}} at the University of Buffalo {{that a lack of}} maternal instincts is due to a deficiency in manganese. When the rat was fed a small amount of manganese chloride, the mothering instinct returned immediately.|$|R

[...] However, in February 2010 <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> Washington Post reporter that he was open {{to the idea of}} running in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Then {{interest}} increased due to {{the politics}} of presidential campaign of 1960. A central plank of John F. Kennedy's campaign was that Eisenhower and the Republicans were weak on defense, and pointed to the B-70 as an example. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>a</b> San Diego audience near NAA facilities, [...] "I endorse wholeheartedly the B-70 manned aircraft."
