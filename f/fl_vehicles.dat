40|$|NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, <b>Fl.</b> The <b>Vehicle</b> (originally Vertical) Assembly Building, or VAB, at NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) {{was used}} to {{assemble}} American manned launch vehicles from 1968 - 2011. The VAB is the largest single-story building in the world, was the tallest building (160. 3 m) in Florida until 1974. The VAB was completed in 1966, to allow for vertical assembly of Saturn V Rocket for the Apollo program. When the Space Shuttle program started it was renamed Vehicle Assembly Building. The American Flag painted on the building was {{the largest in the}} world when added in 1976, along with the star logo which was replaced by NASA insignia in 1998. The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. In the future the VAB will be used to prepare commercial launch vehicles and for the use of NASA new Space Launch system.

40|$|Ports {{are opened}} {{infrastructures}} whose security is infl uenced by a plenty of parameters such as people/ <b>vehicle</b> <b>fl</b> ows. The movement of these fl ows must be accurately checked and controlled {{to ensure a}} correct management of security. In ports characterized by high fl ows, the security management must unavoidably use integrated access control systems that ensure a proper organization of the fl ows them-selves. The present paper illustrates the work made to design and realize the integrated access control system {{of the most important}} commercial and tourist ports of Italy. Since the core of the access control system is represented by a server farm that must operate with a high effi ciency, to guarantee a fast response to the high fl ows of people and vehicles, the system is endowed with a loading balance mecha-nism of server farm itself, based on genetic controller, that ensures optimal operative velocities and performances, as demonstrated in the paper...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} role of fms-like {{tyrosine}} kinase 3 (Flt 3) in the heart. BACKGROUND: Flt 3 is a prominent target of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used for anticancer therapy. TKIs can cause cardiomyopathy, but understanding of the mechanisms is incomplete, partly because the roles of specific TKI target receptors in the heart are still obscure. METHODS: Myocardial infarction was induced in mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by intramyocardial injection of Flt 3 ligand (<b>FL)</b> or <b>vehicle</b> into the infarct border zone. Cardiac morphology and function were assessed by echocardiography and histology one week after infarction. In addition, Flt 3 expression and regulation as well as molecular mechanisms of Flt 3 action were examined in cardiomyocytes in vitro. RESULTS: The intramyocardial injection of FL into the infarct border zone decreased infarct size and ameliorated post-myocardial infarction remodeling and function in mice. This beneficial effect was associated with reduced apoptosis including myocytes in the infarct border zone. Cardiomyocytes expressed functional Flt 3, and Flt 3 mRNA and protein were upregulated under oxidative stress, identifying cardiomyocytes as FL target cells. Flt 3 activation with FL protected cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via an Akt-dependent mechanism involving Bcl- 2 family protein regulation and inhibition of the mitochondrial death pathway. CONCLUSION: Flt 3 is a cytoprotective system in the heart and a potential therapeutic target in ischemic cardiac injury. The protective mechanisms uncovered here may be further explored in view of potential cardiotoxic effects of Flt 3 -targeting anticancer therapy, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease...|$|R
40|$|III Colloquium on Semi-Immersion in CataloniaIII Encuentro sobre Semi-Inmersión en CataluñaMy {{paper is}} drawn from a study on oral foreign {{language}} produced by students in content and language integrated learning (CLIL) classes in Italy. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate teacher-students’ interaction during traditional teacher-fronted lessons in order to explore the possibility of a methodological change towards the implementation of student-centred lessons which promote noteworthy oral interaction by students themselves. Convinced of the importance of using referential questions instead of display questions to push students to use <b>FL</b> as a <b>vehicle</b> of content transmission, I thus observed CLIL-based lessons and analysed data about the types of questions asked by the teachers and the quantity of interaction they produced. In general, students’ oral production has proved to be exceedingly low, regardless of their level of competence in the foreign language or of the content processed. One of the main reasons for the lack of opportunities to practise and improve their speaking skills was that lessons observed were usually teacher-led rather than student-centred: teachers spoke for the most of the lesson time (even over 90 %) and students did not appear to find a reason to intervene. In fact, this is what usually happens in all classrooms for the majority of the time. Furthermore, when students are required to interact, it is usually to give predetermined answers to some (often insignificant) display questions. My paper concludes exploring ways in which questioning can be used not only as a means to promoting learning in CLIL contexts but also as a means to enhancing students’ participation and, as a result, their oral production. I will finally propose some questioning techniques which can facilitate students’ learning process, can sustain the development on higher cognitive-thinking skills and enhance meaningful oral production...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the following problem, which is faced by major forwarding companies active in road transportation (see [2]). A company owning a limited <b>fl</b> eet of <b>vehicles</b> wants to maximize its operational pro fit over an infi nite horizon divided into equal periods (days). The pro fit stems from revenues for transporting full truckloads and from costs derived from waiting idle and moving empty. A decision {{leading to a}} set of actions is made at every period and is based on the dispatcher's information over a restricted horizon, called rolling horizon, which subsequently rolls over period per period. The data provided by the customers concern their prospective loads, or requirements for transportation: locations of departure and destination cities, and a unique pick-up period for each load. Moreover, the dispatcher has data regarding travel times between cities, current location and status (empty or loaded) of trucks. These data are known with certainty and represent the deterministic component of the problem. The stochastic component of the problem arises from the uncertainty on the eff ective materialization of each transportation order. More precisely, the availability of each order can be either con rmed, or denied, a few periods ahead of the loading period (meaning that clients con firm their order, which the transporter may still decide to ful ll, or not). For prospective orders in the remote part of the rolling horizon, the dispatcher only knows the order con firmation probability which represents the stochastic load availability. In this setting, trucking orders are provided by the dispatching center to the drivers and to the customers {{on the eve of the}} pick-up period at the latest. Typically, the loading decisions are made when all orders are con firmed for the next day. The decision problem faced by the dispatcher is to select or to reject loads, and to assign the selected loads to trucks, taking into account con firmed and expected loads as well as the availability and current location of trucks. The main objective of this research is to provide e fficient algorithmic strategies to tackle this multi-period vehicle-load assignment problem over a rolling horizon including prospective transportation orders. This problem is computationally di fficult owing to the large number of possible realizations of the random variables, and to the combinatorial nature of the decision space. The methodology is based on optimizing decisions for deterministic scenarios. By solving the assignment problem for a sample of scenarios, by mixing solutions and by evaluating them at each period, we aim at finding actions per decision period leading to pro table policies in the long run. Several policies are generated in this way, from simple myopic heuristics to more complex approaches, such as consensus and restricted expectation algorithms [3], up to policies derived from network flow models formulated over subtrees of scenarios. Similar approaches have proved eff ective for other problems; see, e. g., [1]. Myopic and a-posteriori deterministic optimization models are used to compute bounds allowing for performance evaluation. Test are performed on various instances featuring di fferent numbers of loads, graph sizes, sparsity, and probability distributions. Performances are compared statistically over paired samples to assess the signi ficance of the observed differences among algorithmic policies. The robustness of various policies with respect to erroneous evaluations of the probability distributions is also analyzed. Numerical experiments show that the best algorithms close a signi ficant fraction of the gap between the worst (myopic) and best (a posteriori) bounds for a broad range of datasets and for several probability distributions. Furthermore, the subtree algorithm remains quite robust against a variety of probability distributions when it is calibrated with a distribution re flecting maximum uncertainty. Acknowledgements.
