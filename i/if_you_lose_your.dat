In general, we have rarely considered the purpose and philosophy of Love and owing to the fact that all logical loves have an expiry date, a considerable percentage of people should expect failure. The solution lies in becoming equipped with the correct worldview about Worldly Love. The application of Worldly Love in Creation is to flourish us and to bring us growth and transcendence. Worldly Love (or Figurative Love) is one of the important factors that prepares us to experience Divine Love.

40|$|The trading {{strategies}} we {{have studied}} point towards possible investment opportunities, but {{usually do not}} tell us how much we should invest in each.

60|$|They are {{probably}} the only short-tempered things in the Summer Islands, where time is so long that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> patience you easily find it again. Sweetness, if not light, {{seems to be the}} prevailing human quality, and a good share of it belongs to such of the natives as are in no wise light. Our poor brethren of a different pigment are in the large majority, and they have been seventy years out of slavery, with the full enjoyment of all their civil rights, without lifting themselves from their old inferiority. They do the hard work, in their own easy way, and possibly do not find life the burden they make it for the white man, whom here, as in our own country, they load up with the conundrum which their existence involves for him. They are not very gay, and do not rise to a joke with that flashing eagerness which they show for it at home. If you have them against a background of banana-stems, or low palms, or feathery canes, nothing could be more acceptably characteristic of the air and sky; nor are they out of place on the box of the little victorias, where visitors of the more inquisitive sex put them to constant question. Such visitors spare no islander of any color. Once, in the pretty Public Garden which the multiple had claimed for its private property, three unmerciful American women suddenly descended from the heavens and began to question the multiple's gardener, who was peacefully digging at the rate of a spadeful every five minutes. Presently he sat down on his wheelbarrow, and then shifted, without relief, from one handle of it to the other. Then he rose and braced himself desperately against the tool- house, where, when his tormentors drifted away, he seemed to the soft eye of pity pinned to the wall by their cruel interrogations, whose barbed points were buried in the stucco behind him, and whose feathered shafts stuck out half a yard before his breast.|$|E
60|$|Twenty {{or thirty}} {{miles across the}} hills, {{on the way to}} the Green Mountains, lie some {{finished}} chapters of pitiful stories--a few score abandoned farms, started in a lean land, held fiercely so long as there was any one to work them, and then left on the hill-sides. Beyond this desolation are woods where the bear and the deer still find peace, and sometimes even the beaver forgets that he is persecuted and dares to build his lodge. These things were told me by a man who loved the woods for their own sake and not for the sake of slaughter--a quiet, slow-spoken man of the West, who came across the drifts on show-shoes and refrained from laughing when I borrowed his foot-gear and tried to walk. The gigantic lawn-tennis bats strung with hide are not easy to manoeuvre. If you forget to keep the long heels down and trailing in the snow you turn over and become as a man who fails into deep water with a life-belt tied to his ankles. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> balance, do not attempt to recover it, but drop, half-sitting and half-kneeling, over as large an area as possible. When you have mastered the wolf-step, can slide one shoe above the other deftly, that is to say, the sensation of paddling over a ten-foot-deep drift and taking short cuts by buried fences is worth the ankle-ache. The man from the West interpreted to me the signs on the snow, showed how a fox (this section of the country is full of foxes, and men shoot them because riding is impossible) leaves one kind of spoor, walking with circumspection as becomes a thief, and a dog, who has nothing to be ashamed of, but widens his four legs and plunges, another; how coons go to sleep for the winter and squirrels too, and how the deer on the Canada border trample down deep paths that are called yards and are caught there by inquisitive men with cameras, who hold them by their tails when the deer have blundered into deep snow, and so photograph their frightened dignity. He told me of people also--the manners and customs of New Englanders here, and how they blossom and develop in the Far West on the newer railway lines, when matters come very nearly to civil war between rival companies racing for the same cañon; how there is a country not very far away called Caledonia, populated by the Scotch, who can give points to a New Englander in a bargain, and how these same Scotch-Americans by birth, name their townships still after the cities of their thrifty race. It was all as new and delightful as the steady 'scrunch' of the snow-shoes and the dazzling silence of the hills.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} to [...] "Love You Lately" [...] is {{available}} on Powter's website and YouTube on the Warner Bros. Records channel. The plot is about a girl (played by Rachael Leigh Cook), from the country-side who moves to the city, seeking a job and possibly a better life. Yet, in doing so, she leaves behind her boyfriend, whom she cannot forget. While in the city, she works as a studio assistant {{on the set of}} Powter's music video for the song, running errands like purchasing coffee. She becomes disillusioned with her job and feels lost, out of place in the strange new world. Both she and her boyfriend (played by Brian Hallisay) cannot seem {{to come to terms with}} their parting, continually looking at past photos and recollecting the beautiful memories of the times shared together. At the end of the video, she decides to pick up the phone to call her boyfriend, who already seems to have anticipated her call. The video ends with Powter alone at his piano and a studio light being left on, tribute to the song's lyrics: 'Cause there's a thousand lights that'll make you feel brand new, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> way, I'll leave one on for you." ...|$|R

Free markets can solve this problem, and provide life-long, portable health security, while enhancing consumer choice and competition. "Heath-status insurance" is the key. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are diagnosed with a long-term, expensive condition, a health-status insurance policy {{will give you the}} resources to pay higher medical insurance premiums. Health-status insurance covers the risk of premium reclassification, just as medical insurance covers the risk of medical expenses. With health-status insurance, you can always obtain medical insurance, no matter how sick you get, with no change in out-of-pocket costs. With health-status insurance, medical insurers would be allowed to charge sick people more than healthy people, and to compete intensely for all customers. People would have complete freedom to change jobs, move, or change medical insurers. Rigorous competition would allow us to obtain better medical care at lower cost. Most regulations and policy proposals aimed at improving long-term insurance [...] including those advanced in Barack Obama's presidential campaign [...] limit competition and consumer choice by banning risk-based premiums, forcing insurers to take all comers, strengthening employer-based or other forced pooling mechanisms, or introducing national health insurance. The individual health insurance market is already moving in the direction of health-status insurance. To let health-status insurance emerge fully, we must remove the legal and regulatory pressure to provide employer-based group insurance over individual insurance and remove regulations limiting risk-based pricing and competition among health insurers...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} meditating, Sarianna, dear, whether {{we might not}} make our summer out at Fontainebleau in the picturesque part of the forest. It would be quiet, and not very dear. And we might dine {{together}} and take hands as at Havre--for we will all insist on Robert's doing the hospitality. I confess to shrinking {{a good deal about}} the noise of Paris--we might try Paris later. What do you say? The sea is so very far--it is such a journey--it looks so to me just now. And the south of France is very hot--as hot as Italy--besides making you pay greatly 'for your whistle.' Switzerland would increase both expenses and journey for everybody. Fontainebleau is said to be delicious in the summer, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> sea bathing, it might answer. Arabel wants me to go to England, but as I did not last year my heart and nerves revolt from it now. Besides, we belong to the nonno and you this summer. Arabel can and, I dare say, will join us. And Milsand? You say 'once in three years.' Not quite so, I think. In any case, it has been far worse with some of mine. All the days of the three times of meeting in fourteen years, can only be multiplied together into three weeks; and this after a life of close union! Also, it was not her fault--she had not pecuniary means. I am bitter against myself for not having gone to England {{for a week or two}} in the Havre year. I could have done it, Robert would have let me. But now, no more. It was the war the year before last, and my unsteadiness of health last year, which kept us from our usual visit to you.
