6000|$|... "Erickson?" [...] Thacher smiled. [...] "You {{look like}} a {{commercial}} man, to me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sample case on the floor. [...] "Am I right?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rochester {{had entered}} the library {{and closed the door}} behind him. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> man who rose slowly to greet him, but ignored his outstretched hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} it was a fool move to let that money lay around loose," [...] was Andy Jimson's comment, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> piles of bank bills.|$|E
60|$|Milton smiled, {{but did not}} reply. <b>He</b> only <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> exhorter, a {{man with}} a puffy jumble of {{features}} and the form of a gladiator, who was uttering wild and explosive phrases.|$|R
60|$|He was a kindly, easy-going man; but, {{after the}} way of a large {{percentage}} of the Western stock, he was undemonstrative. <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door to obey, and paused irresolutely. The look he gave back to Saxon was almost dog-like in gratitude and all-brotherly in love. She felt it, and in spirit leapt toward it.|$|R
6000|$|He {{regarded}} her darkly. [...] "Well, I trust you. You won't give me away. I'm {{not so sure}} of her." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> his head <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open door.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I have kissed her," [...] {{answered}} Ralph, [...] "it is {{with her}} consent, and because she will be my wife; but you worked upon her pity to put her to shame and now you shall pay the price of it. Do you see that whip?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sjambock that {{was lying on the}} grass. [...] "Let him who proves the best man use it upon the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayhap, master. But {{for my part}} I am {{content with}} that of Murgh, which he gave us, you may remember, or so I {{understood}} him. Moreover, did he not teach that he and all are but ministers of Him above? Therefore I {{go straight to the}} head of the stair," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sky. [...] "I am content to skip all those steps which are called priests and altars and popes and saints and such-like folk, living or dead. If Murgh's wisdom be true, as I think, these are but garnishings to the dish which can well be spared by the hungry soul." ...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Edward Wax {{carefully}} {{inserted the}} cassette in the player as {{he glanced at}} the other four sitting around the conference table. 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m glad you could find the time to listen to my problem, 2 ̆ 2 he began. 2 ̆ 2 I realize that the Psychiatric Institute is ordinarily concerned with research into phobias or psychological aberrations that have resisted treatment by the foremost psychiatrists, not the routine neuroses encountered by a GP like myself. Were it not for my neighbor, Mr. Pfund of your Institute, I suppose I should never have been given this hearing. 2 ̆ 2 <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> short cherubic man sitting across from him...|$|E
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> {{his head}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> frosty panes, and wraps {{a sheet of}} {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "You boys {{sure did}} have a day of sport," [...] said Sid Todd, after he had {{inspected}} the fish, the grouse, and the wildcat. [...] "And you've proved that you can shoot," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> slain beast. [...] "I've known many a putty good hunter to get the shakes when he see a bobcat a-glarin' at him from a tree. It ain't no tender sight, is it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for me," [...] quoth King Louis, hastily {{interposing}} in this feminine {{passage of}} arms, [...] "I drink to our gallant Chevalier de St. George, His Majesty King Charles Edward Stuart of England, Scotland, Wales, {{and of the}} whole of that fog-ridden kingdom. Success to your cause, Chevalier," [...] he added, settling his fat body complacently in the cushions of his chair; and raising his glass, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> benignly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> young Pretender.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're yellow," [...] Grimshaw went on, [...] "yellow clean through." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Mariner. [...] "Now there's {{the real thing}} as a man. No yellow in him. He never batted an eye, and I reckon he knew more about the danger than you did. If I was to choose being wrecked on a desert island with him or you, I'd take him a {{thousand}} times first. If--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] he whispered. The girl bent {{her head}} closer to catch the faint message. [...] "I have wronged you--and him," [...] <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> weakly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ape-man. [...] "I loved you so--it is a poor excuse to offer for {{injuring}} you; but I {{could not bear to}} think of giving you up. I do not ask your forgiveness. I only wish to do now the thing I should have done over a year ago." [...] He fumbled in the pocket of the ulster beneath him for something that he had discovered there while he lay between the paroxysms of fever. Presently he found it--a crumpled bit of yellow paper. He handed it to the girl, and as she took it his arm fell limply across his chest, his head dropped back, and with a little gasp he stiffened and was still. Then Tarzan of the Apes drew a fold of the ulster across the upturned face.|$|R
50|$|After {{examining}} the videos, police located the dentist, who alerted his receptionist, who {{gave them the}} name and address of the suspect who had come in to pay his bill that day. After midnight on Tuesday, police also managed to identify the car in the surveillance video as a 1990 gold Honda Accord. Forty-five minutes later, two Flatbush volunteers searching for the missing boy in Kensington spotted the car and sent in the license-plate number, which matched Aron's details. Police went to the suspect's apartment in Kensington around 2 a.m. Wednesday morning. They arrived to an open door, and when they asked Aron where the boy was, <b>he</b> allegedly <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, where the police found blood-soaked carving knives and bloody towels in bags. The boy's severed feet were found in the freezer. The suspect told police where to find the rest of the remains: in a red suitcase thrown in a dumpster on 20th Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Aron was taken into police custody at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} for you that I left him," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tents they had just left. [...] "I {{knew that he could}} hold them longer than I and {{give you a chance to}} escape that I might not be able to have given you. It was I though who should have remained. I heard you call him Korak and so I know now who he is. He befriended you. I would have wronged you. No--don't interrupt. I'm going to tell you the truth now and let you know just what a beast I have been. I planned to take you to London, as you know; but I did not plan to marry you. Yes, shrink from me--I deserve it. I deserve your {{contempt}} and loathing; but I didn't know then what love was. Since I have learned that I have learned something else--what a cad and what a coward I have been all my life. I looked down upon those whom I considered my social inferiors. I did not think you good enough to bear my name. Since Hanson tricked me and took you for himself I have been through hell; but it has made a man of me, though too late. Now I can come to you with an offer of honest love, which will realize the honor of having such as you share my name with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had I my way," [...] {{answered}} the Fool-Killer, [...] "my blade would always drip. It is my master, yonder, who thwarts my duty." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> King Terribus.|$|R
6000|$|Higley had {{the grace}} to stop that. [...] "Let {{up on the}} cuss-words, Sam; there are ladies present," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> Lee. Then <b>he</b> opened upon Cavanagh. [...] "Well, sir, what's all this row? What's your charge against these men?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hester <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{trail that}} wormed {{its way across}} the prairie. A girl was riding toward them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, I've seen him, {{and had a}} plain {{talk with}} him. Nay, I'm {{not going to tell}} thee now what I said; but it bit, and he didn't like it. Ralph, lad,"--and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> me with a chuckle--"his daughter's worth the winning. My own girl says so; and thou shalt have her." ...|$|R
60|$|Kenwyne laughed, and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open window, {{through which}} they {{heard the sound of}} cheerful {{whistling}} approaching them along the trail.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the Jason Jones picture," [...] said an attendant, {{answering}} {{her question}} and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> admiring group; [...] "that's the prizewinner--over there." ...|$|R
60|$|She smiled {{permission}} and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> smoking lanai, {{where they}} found him talking sugar politics with the oldsters when the dance began to break up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shirts for Boo, sir. Four, {{and this}} is the last," [...] she answered, with pardonable pride, as she held it up and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pile in her basket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish you'd step in there," [...] <b>the</b> Squire said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> room {{opposite}} the kitchen, [...] "and bring {{me out the}} Laws of Ohio. You know where it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alec <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> skin {{which was}} to be Spud Ely's. [...] "It's the same one," [...] said he. [...] "I've kept part of him {{ripening}} out in the storehouse against this day," [...] he explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's eyes; I saw {{you lift}} your eyebrows, and <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> carriage, and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again," [...] cried Nat, who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time.|$|R
50|$|Years ago, as {{continuity}} strips {{gave way}} to humor strips, typeset episode subtitles vanished from strips. In a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> classic daily strips of yesteryear, Griffith keeps the tradition alive by always centering a hand-lettered subtitle above each Zippy strip.|$|R
5000|$|When a man puts on this {{authentic}} French farmer's shirt he {{may very}} well find that his hands look bigger....Is that woman over there giving him <b>the</b> eye and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> haystack? Yes, and he knows what to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{pleasant}} to see thee resting, mother, and every {{thing going on}} so well," [...] he said, glancing about the room, where the old lady sat, and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, where Christie was toasting bread in her neatest manner.|$|R
5000|$|The convention's {{purpose is}} to {{celebrate}} science fiction, fantasy, and horror [...] "in all its various forms", but with a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> literary side of these closely related genres. For some years its programming has been built around a different yearly theme.|$|R
50|$|Allium phariense has 1-3 egg-shaped bulbs up to 10 15 mm in diameter. Scape {{is up to}} 15 cm long, usually <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tip. Leaves {{are about}} the same length as the scape. Umbel is a spherical cluster of many white flowers crowded together.|$|R
6000|$|Bridge <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear room. [...] "The stove is in there," [...] he said. [...] "We'd {{better go}} on and make a fire. Draw your pistol--whoever did this has {{probably}} beat it; but it's just as well {{to be on the}} safe side." ...|$|R
6000|$|One day as Becky {{came to rest}} a {{few minutes}} and shell peas, Emily put down her book to help; and as the pods flew, she said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{delicate}} ferns that grew thickly all about the trough, the rock, and the grassy bank,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, so I understood," [...] said Lapham, with a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> son. [...] "I believe Mr. Corey, here, told Mrs. Lapham." [...] He {{leaned back}} in his chair, stiffly {{resolute}} to show that he was not incommoded by the exchange of these civilities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{more than}} grown," [...] she smiled. [...] "I was thirty-one in May. Tell me," [...] she asked, {{choosing}} {{another of the}} beans which he still absently held, [...] "do you get them for these?" [...] And she <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Dalton Street waifs.|$|R
