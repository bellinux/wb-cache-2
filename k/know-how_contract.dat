It is crucial to find out whether the parties of <b>know-how</b> <b>contract</b> have a right to claim damages for non-pecuniary loss in light of the legal nature of knowhow. In this article, I begin by defining the know-how contracts and in particular I will analyze the main obligations of the parties. Secondly, I will deal with the definition and the legal nature of know-how, since considerable uncertainty exists as to the degree or type of protection regarding the legal nature of know-how. There are different opinions put forward, which defines the legal nature of know-how as a property, an intangible asset, a monopoly of fact and a personality right. Finally, and on the basis of the conclusion reached under the previous section, I will discuss whether it is possible for know-how provider to claim damages for non-pecuniary loss...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the efficiency of the poultry farm in Bangladesh and to assess the influence of contract farming system, using a Data Envelopment Analysis. Seventy five commercial poultry farms (25 and 50 independent and contract farms, respectively) were randomly selected. The results reveal that efficiency scores vary across sample farms. To explain some of these variations, the efficiency scores were regressed on some human capital variables and farming system using a Tobit model. The study also estimate elasticities to provide the information on the magnitude of the variables influence on technical, allocative and economic efficiency. The results show that contracting system is positively and significantly related to farm's technical, allocative and economic efficiency. This is expected because under contractual agreement, in order to obtain sufficient supplies of the right quality of poultry meat at the right time, the company provides technical know-how assistance through company's recruited supervisor, production inputs & services, and production credit along with intensive supervision, which in turn improves farm efficiency. Thus, by receiving technical <b>know-how</b> <b>contract</b> farmers have gained more knowledge on their resource and practices, which enables them to use resources more efficiently. Empirical results can provide crucial information to policy makers that improve poultry farm efficiency...|$|E

Observa-se que, com o crescimento econômico dos Estados, e tendo em vista o desenvolvimento tecnológico ocorrido nos últimos dois séculos, a detenção do conhecimento se tornou um bem de crescente importância. Neste contexto, houve o surgimento de uma nova tipologia contratual, encontrando-se, aí, o know-how. Tais contratos têm adquirido uma {{singular}} importância devido à sua freqüente utilização na transferência de conhecimentos científicos ou técnicos entre os contratantes. O alcance deste tipo de contrato vai desde o uso entre particulares até sua aplicação entre países com distintos níveis de industrialização. Apesar do evidente destaque que o instituto passou a deter para a sociedade contemporânea, os estudos a respeito não evoluíram e a legislação brasileira pertinente somente trata da matéria indiretamente. Desta forma, no intuito de acompanhar as repercussões havidas na seara contratual na sociedade globalizada, o presente trabalho tratará de abordar alguns de seus aspectos mais relevantes. Inicia-se a análise do instituto através do fenômeno da globalização, em que evidenciou-se a crescente disseminação tecnológica entre as nações. Passando-se ao estudo do know-how e seus sistemas regulatórios concernentes no Brasil e no direito comparado, reavalia-se a questão se esta tutela é apta ou não a proteger a transferência de tecnologia. The present dissertation {{seeks to}} analise the constitutive {{elements of the}} <b>know-how</b> <b>contracts,</b> either objectives or materials. Considering the economic growth of the states and regarding the technological development ocurred {{in the last two}} centuries, the ownership of knowledge has become na asset of crecent importance. In this context, it was seeing the rising of a new kind of contractual typification, among them, the <b>know-how.</b> Such <b>contracts</b> have acquired a singular importance due to its frequent use in the transfer of cintific or technical knowledge between the parties. The range of this kind of contract goes since the use between privates until its application among countries with different industrialization´s levels. Despite of the clear highlight that the institute has achieved for the modern society, the concerning studies have not evolved and the regarding brazilian law only deals with the theme indirectly. Therefore, with the aim of accompanying the repercussions occured in the contractual field in the globalizaed society, this work will approach some of its more relevant aspects. The analysis of the institute will begin {{in the midst of the}} globalização phenomenon, in which showed the crescent technological transfers between nations. Studying the know-how and its regulatory sistems in the brazilian law and foreign, it is raised the question if such law is able or not to protect efficiently the technology transfer...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to explain the {{determinants}} of contractual completeness in franchise relationships by formulating and testing various propositions derived from transaction cost theory, agency theory, property rights theory, organizational capability theory and relational view of governance. The degree of contractual completeness depends on behavioural uncertainty (negatively), trust (positively), franchisees’ specific investments (negatively), environmental uncer-tainty (negatively), intangibility of system specific <b>know-how</b> (negatively) and <b>contract</b> design capabilities (positively). The hypotheses are tested with a data base consisting of 52 franchise systems in Austria.

These problems exist {{in a variety of}} intellectual property sales ranging from pure ideas to poorly protected inventions and reflect the nonverifiability of key elements of an intellectual property sale.

For the first time in Jordan and may be in the Middle East, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) awarded a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract shared between the Public and Private Sectors for the purpose of rising finance from the private sector and share all kinds of risks, in addition to allow competition in different technology transfer and <b>know-how.</b> The <b>contract</b> includes Funding, Design, Built, Operate and transfer back to the Government of Jordan after 25 years. The project of this contract is a wastewater treatment plant named As-Samra which is the largest wastewater treatment plant in Jordan this pant was constructed in 1985, its original design parameters was 68000 m 3 /day as average daily flow, it needs to be upgraded to 267000 m 3 /day, the cost of this project is $ 169 millions, Government of Jordan is sharing with $ 78 million in this project to alleviate the cost of treating the wastewater of Amman and Zarqa Cities (the two largest cities in Jordan with a population about 3. 5 millions), the consortium of American and French companies who was awarded the contract on July 28, 2002 will share with the rest...|$|R
40|$|Professor Reichman uncovers {{a paradox}} {{at the heart}} of the debate about {{bringing}} international intellectual property relations within a GATT Code of Conduct. On the one hand, the industrialized countries that subscribe to free-market principles at home want to impose a highly regulated market for intellectual goods on the rest of the world, one in which authors and inventors may 2 ̆ 2 reap where they have sown. 2 ̆ 2 On the other hand, the developing countries that restrict free competition at home envision a totally unregulated world market for intellectual goods, one in which 2 ̆ 2 competition is the lifeblood of commerce. 2 ̆ 2 To unravel this paradox, he identifies a set of postulates for negotiators on both sides. Included in this list is the lack of an international norm against misappropriation; a long-term need to assimilate intangible alien property to the international law of state responsibility; the duty to respect soveriegn rights of both rich and poor states to control their own economic destinies; and the emergence of preferential treatment for developing countries as a principle of international economic law. Armed with these postulates, Professor Reichman derives a set of analytical propositions to guide a TRIPs negotiation conducted in the spirit of cooperation and good faith. A crucial move in this analysis is to distinguish between defensive proposals to institute transitional legal barriers to imports of nonqualifying intellectual goods and offensive proposals to establish universal standards of protection that could limit the development strategies even of states that do not export intellectual goods to major markets. As regards proposals for a defensive alliance bolstered by common border control measures and by the dispute settlement machinery of the GATT, Professor Reichman offers a new interpretation of Article XX(d) that minimizes conflict with the basic GATT disciplines. However, Contracting Parties that participate in a defensive alliance must strictly respect their obligations to provide national treatment under the Paris, Berne, and Geneva (U. C. C) Conventions, and they may find the transaction costs of implementing the scheme too high in the end. As regards offensive proposals that pit universal standards of protection against national developmental strategies, Professor Reichman finds that basic GATT rules cannot be overcome unless preferential measures favoring the developing counties are combined with trade concessions off-setting the costs of economic dislocation. Given such an approach, Professor Reichman suggests that Contracting Parties that already adhere to intellectual property conventions can be persuaded to provid adequate, not maximum, levels of protection for the traditional subject matters of those Conventions, and they should renounce systematic misappropriation of applied scientific <b>know-how.</b> <b>Contracting</b> Parties that do not adhere to one or more intellectual property conventions pose a harder case, but Professor Reichman argues that these states cannot expect indefintely to exploit the most valuable alien property of all without paying compensation in one form or another. Professor Reichman fears, however that maximalist illusions will cause the Uruguay Round to produce fewer positive results than could have been attained in a spirit of moderation and compromise. He warns thet continued insistence on universalist these unacceptable to the developing countries risks provoking these countries to form a 2 ̆ 2 Union 2 ̆ 2 of their own in order to curtail rights that the industrialized countries currently enjoy under existing intellectual property conventions. He points out that the real losers in such a confrontation would be those authors, inventors and trademark proprietors whose livelihood depends on the day-to-day operations of the international system that the Paris and Berne Conventions set in place over a century ago...|$|R
