5|$|Orangutans {{are thought}} to be the sole fruit {{disperser}} for some plant species including the climber species Strychnos ignatii which contains the toxic alkaloid strychnine. It does not appear to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> orangutans except for excessive saliva production.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} didn't seem to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Kapeau's {{position as}} acting governor, and in July 1850 {{he became the}} official governor of the island after four years as acting governor.|$|E

5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Colorado law {{currently}} proscribes {{discrimination against}} {{persons who are}} not suspect classes....Of course Amendment 2 {{is not intended to}} <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> this legislation, but seeks only to prevent the adoption of anti-discrimination laws intended to protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines do not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> {{the levels}} of GABA in the brain. Clonazepam {{has no effect on}} GABA levels and has no effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase. Clonazepam does, however, affect {{glutamate}} decarboxylase activity. It differs from other anticonvulsant drugs it was compared to in a study.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include diarrhea, constipation, headache, sleepiness, and itchiness. Serious side effects include QT {{prolongation}} and severe allergic reaction. It {{appears to be}} safe during pregnancy but has not been well studied in this group. It is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It does not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to spending time alone. Freedom {{is considered to}} be one of the benefits of solitude; the constraints of others will not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> a person who is spending time in solitude, therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions. With increased freedom, a person’s choices are less likely to be affected by exchanges with others.|$|E

50|$|Although ginseng {{has been}} used in Chinese {{traditional}} medicine over centuries, evidence from high-quality research that it <b>has</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> health is limited.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that green and black tea may protect against cancer or other diseases such as obesity or Alzheimer's disease, but the compounds found in green tea have not been conclusively demonstrated to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> human diseases. One human study demonstrated that regular consumption of black tea over four weeks had no beneficial effect in lowering blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{late spring}} 1941, the Soviet Union {{made a number}} of {{goodwill}} gestures in order to prevent Finland from completely falling under German influence. Soviet ambassador Ivan Zotov was replaced with the more flexible Pavel Orlov. Furthermore, the Soviet government announced that it no longer opposed a rapprochement between Finland and Sweden. However, these conciliatory measures did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Finnish policy.|$|E
25|$|Despite these developments, {{sometime}} around 1910 the porch {{was added to}} the church building. It did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the building's use, as services already held sporadically at that time appear to have ceased completely afterwards, except for burials of descendants of members who wished to be buried with their families. Nevertheless, a 1930 photo shows the church still in relatively good condition and the surrounding property maintained.|$|E

50|$|Laboratory work is {{examining}} sea buckthorn oil for its potential properties, {{although there is}} no evidence as of 2017 that it <b>has</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> human health.|$|R
25|$|For {{those with}} {{osteoporosis}} but {{who have not}} had a fracture evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. Alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but does not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> other types of fractures. Half stop their medications within a year. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. Another review found tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Once all {{the repairs}} were completed, Novelty {{made a number}} of {{successful}} demonstration runs {{but it was too late}} to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the competition. It is sometimes claimed that one of these demonstration runs included the locomotive reaching a speed of , but there is little to back this up and it may be a misinterpretation of a newspaper report trying to give an impression of the great speeds that the Rainhill engines were achieving.|$|E
25|$|Jelačić and his {{survivors}} joined Archduke John's retreat across Hungary. At the Battle of Raab, {{he commanded}} 7,500 infantry {{of the right}} flank division. With help from the army reserve, his soldiers drove off the first Franco-Italian attack, but the action ended in an Austrian defeat. He commanded his division at the Battle of Wagram but John's army arrived too late on the field to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the outcome. He died on 4 February 1810 at Zalaapáti in modern-day Hungary.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether instruction with the aid of instructional objectives <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> student self-efficacy. Secondary aims were investigated as well. These included whether the use of instructional objectives <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> student achievement, and whether <b>any</b> potential <b>effect</b> of instructional objectives on self-efficacy and achievement was mediated by perceived ability. [...] To do this a two part study dealing with a unit of work on coordinate geometry was taught to four classes of heterogeneously grouped grade nine students. Two classes were taught with the aid of instructional objectives and two were taught without such assistance. [...] From the analysis of variance mixed results were obtained as to whether the use of instructional objectives <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> perceived self-efficacy. However, the results showed that there was a significant difference in achievement levels, but no difference in level of perceived self-efficacy or achievement among students of different ability levels...|$|R
25|$|Ozone is {{similarly}} {{formed in the}} Catatumbo lightning storms phenomenon on the Catatumbo River in Venezuela, though ozone's instability makes it dubious that it <b>has</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the ozonosphere.|$|R

25|$|RISC {{designs are}} also more likely to feature a Harvard memory model, where the {{instruction}} stream and the data stream are conceptually separated; this means that modifying the memory where code is held might not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the instructions executed by the processor (because the CPU has a separate instruction and data cache), at least until a special synchronization instruction is issued. On the upside, this allows both caches to be accessed simultaneously, which can often improve performance.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{had shown}} that adding a {{stabilizer}} system to a vector bombsight would roughly double {{the accuracy of the}} system. This would allow the bombsight to remain level while the aircraft maneuvered, giving the bombardier more time to make his adjustments, as well as reducing or eliminating mis-measurements when sighting off of non-level sights. However, this would not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the accuracy of the wind measurements, nor the calculation of the vectors. The Norden attacked all of these problems.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{agreement}} during the 1990s by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Australian and EU governments, the others' GIs and the nations' traditional terms of winemaking {{were meant to}} have been protected by 1997. However, this has been proceeding slowly, and while some GIs have been protected in Australia, others are still available for use (primarily for products that have always been called that). It seems unlikely it will <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> colloquial speech in the short term.|$|E
