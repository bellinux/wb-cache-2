5|$|Jared's silence {{leads to}} the {{breakdown}} of his relationships with both Rachel and his mother Diane. In the plays last scene Jared confesses to Diane that he witnessed the three youths raping Tracy, {{though he did not}} intervene. He is unsure why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> though he believes it was out of loyalty to the boys who were his mates. Ricko left Jared a suicide note giving him his van, though Jared asks Cherie to dump the keys to the van in the ocean when she goes out surfing.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to support the British war effort. He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's lieutenancy was {{primarily}} {{of a military}} nature; by the early 14th century, Ireland had become a rebellious and unruly dominion for the English crown. In this capacity Gaveston had considerable success, killing or defeating several major insurgents. He fortified the town of Newcastle McKynegan and Castle Kevin, and rebuilt the road from Castle Kevin to Glendalough. This helped pacify the county {{at least as far}} as the Wicklow Mountains, west of Dublin. In the field of administration he made less of a mark. The most notable issue with which he was involved concerned a dispute over murage – a toll on the town walls – between the citizens of Dublin. As during the regency, though, there is no evidence that Gaveston exploited his position for his own advantage and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to alienate the local elite.|$|E

5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily, which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed {{to catch up with}} the expedition before it sailed for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent to him for help, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|OKW {{operations}} chief Alfred Jodl {{was present}} for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, Karl Koller, {{at a meeting}} a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason {{if he tried to}} take power. On the other hand, if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers, the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead. He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.|$|E

25|$|Now {{happy and}} successful, Loos moved to an {{apartment}} in Hollywood, where she was unexpectedly and unpleasantly joined by Emerson.

While Emerson busied himself offering screen tests to young starlets, Loos was now free to see whomever she pleased, including her now quite ill friend Wilson Mizner. Mizner, who had abused his body through drink and drugs, wasted away until dying on April 3, 1932, a date Loos would continue to mark.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, though, Sharpe {{could never}} get into form and he was dropped from the Surrey side long before the season ended. Though he was {{recalled}} in 1893 when Richardson was injured, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> and Surrey released him {{at the end of}} the year. He played for Nottinghamshire a couple of times in 1894, but any hopes he would strengthen their weakening bowling were destroyed very quickly: he took only ten wickets at 28.40 under conditions tremendously favourable to bowlers, and retired at the then-remarkably young age of 28.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{continued}} to promote Huguenots to office in France and to form alliances with Protestant princes abroad. In his home territory of Béarn, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to re-establish free Catholic worship as the pope demanded. It seemed clear to Henry's Catholic opponents {{that he had}} recanted his Protestantism merely for political reasons, {{in order to secure}} the French throne. Rebels and would-be assassins felt justified by what they saw as Henry's manifest failure to comply with the terms of his absolution. In their view, Henry remained a heretic and, therefore, an usurper on the throne of France.|$|E
25|$|In {{his youth}} {{primarily}} a football goalkeeper {{who played for}} some time with Queen's Park Rangers, Nichols' prowess at cricket during the summer {{brought him to the}} attention of the Essex committee during the early 1920s, who recommended him as a left-handed batsman. He was engaged for 1924 but did not gain a regular place in the first eleven that year. The following year, however, Nichols gained a regular place as a promising fast bowler and batted very low in the order. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> sensational apart from playing the primary role in dismissing Kent for 43 on a bad wicket at Southend in late July.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1886, German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. In 1895, Alexander Popov, a physics {{instructor at the}} Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a spark-gap transmitter. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by {{the passage of a}} third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> more with this observation.|$|E

25|$|On August 5, 2011, Winfield, {{charged with}} premeditated murder and {{conspiracy}} to commit murder, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to involuntary manslaughter and use of an illegal controlled substance. The involuntary manslaughter charge stems from Winfield's failure to intervene and prevent the other soldiers from carrying out the attack against the Afghan in U.S. custody. Under the plea deal he didn't admit to the killing of Mullah Adahdad. He claimed that he fired his automatic weapon away from Adahdad but that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to stop the murder. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison. He {{was released from prison}} in August 2012.|$|E
25|$|Queipo de Llano, {{the leader}} of the coup in Seville, claimed that he seized Seville with a small force of 130 {{soldiers}} and 15 civilians. Also, he said that alone and gun at hand he had arrested the republican general Villa-Abrile and after he had convinced the entire garrison to join the rising, but all of this was a lie. The coup in Seville was planned by the chief of staff of Seville, José Cuesta Moreneo, and most of the units of the Seville garrison (4,000 men) were involved in the plot. The commander of the Second Military Division, General Jose Villa-Abrille, was aware of the plotters' preparations, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E

The Government declared those killings to be the outbreak of a new Taranaki war and Grey immediately wrote to the Colonial Office in London, requesting three additional regiments be sent to New Zealand. He also ordered the return to New Plymouth of troops that had been moved to Auckland {{at the close of}} the earlier Taranaki hostilities, where they had been building a road southward in preparation for the invasion of the Waikato.|$|E
