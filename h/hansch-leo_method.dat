40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{predicting}} the solubility of an analyte in {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} is reported. The method is based on determining the hydrophobic interaction and the solubility parameter from easily obtained constants. The simplicity of the method is demonstrated {{with respect to a}} group of substituted benzophenones. Hydrophobicity is derived from log P values as determined by the <b>Hansch-Leo</b> <b>method,</b> whereas the solubility parameter is determined by the method of Fedors. Multilinear regression has indicated a direct correlation between the amount of analyte extracted, expressed as the mole fraction, and the log Pl solubility parameters...|$|E
