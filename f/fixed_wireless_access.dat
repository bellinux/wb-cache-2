40|$|<b>Fixed</b> Broadband <b>Wireless</b> <b>Access</b> (FBWA) {{technology}} {{is designed to}} serve as a wireless DSL replacement to provide broadband Internet access in underserved areas where no other access technology exists. Due to the enormousness of the target service area, relay equipment {{play an important role in}} such networks, and the installation and maintenance cost of the network is directly proportional to the cost of the relay equipment. To minimize the network operational cost, an optimization framework which computes the minimum number of relay stations and their corresponding placements and channel assignments in the network is desired. Because the problem is NP-hard, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on a modified version of Bender’s decomposition to iteratively compute converging bounds to the problem solution. Our numerical results show that by using a few relay stations in a rural community, broadband Internet access can be established in a cost effective manner.

Telecommunication TechnologyWorldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) {{will play}} an {{important}} role in the <b>Fixed</b> Broadband <b>Wireless</b> <b>Access</b> (FBWA) market since it is more cost-effective and faster to set up. WiMAX is a <b>fixed</b> Broadband <b>Wireless</b> <b>Access</b> system (BWA) based on the IEEE 802. 16 standard. The global demand for Internet access services has increased at a notable rate in recent years. The quality of service (QoS) of Voice over IP (VoIP) has become a crucial research topic. One of the challenges to achieve QoS requirements is to determine how to dynamically allocate system bandwidth to various applications. The objective of this research is to propose an adaptive Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) algorithm based on Priority Queuing (PQ) and Custom Queuing (CQ) and also its own soft-threshold feature for the downlink stream in WiMAX systems to achieve main QoS requirements for voice and data services. The proposed algorithm will be developed to achieve high system utilization and access control. Through this research, it is shown that the proposed algorithm fulfils the main QoS requirements and fairness for different traffic. The performance comparisons through simulation experiments verify that the proposed algorithm achieves a high served traffic ratio, high throughput and high bandwidth utilization. The adaptive algorithm is configurable and may be optimised for specific traffic patterns...|$|R
