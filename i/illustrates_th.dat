40|$|This paper {{presents}} a minimal, invariant, coordinate-free description of rigid body motion trajectories. Based on a motion {{model for the}} instantaneous screw axis, a time-based coordinate-free description consisting of six scalar functions of time is defined. Analytical formulas are presented to obtain these functions from the pose or twist coordinates of a motion trajectory. The time-based functions are then stripped from their temporal information yielding five independent geometric functions together with a scalar motion profile. The geometric functions are shown to be invariant with respect to time scale, linear and angular scale, motion profile, reference frame, and reference point on the rigid body used to express the translational components of the motion. An algorithm is given to reconstruct a coordinate representation of a motion trajectory from its coordinate-free description. A numerical example <b>illustrates</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Power-based side channel {{attacks are}} a {{significant}} security risk, especially for embedded applications. To improve the security of such devices, protected logic styles have been proposed {{as an alternative to}} CMOS. However, they should only be used sparingly, since their area and power consumption are both significantly larger than for CMOS. In this paper, we propose to augment a processor, realized in CMOS, with custom instruction set extensions, realized in a protected logic, having both security and performance as the primary objectives. We have devel-oped a design flow based on standard CAD tools that can automatically synthesize and place-and-route such hybrid implementations. The flow is integrated into a simulation and evaluation environment to quantify the security achieved on a sound basis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{greatest}} challenges in protein design is creating new enzymes, something evolution does all the time, starting from existing ones. Borrowing from nature’s evolutionary strategy, we have engineered a bacterial cytochrome P 450 to catalyze highly enantiose-lective intermolecular aziridination, a synthetically useful reaction that has no natural biological counterpart. The new enzyme is fully genetically encoded, functions in vitro or in whole cells, and can be optimized rapidly to exhibit high enantioselectivity (up to 99 % ee) and productivity (up to 1, 000 catalytic turnovers) for intermolecular aziridination, demonstrated here with tosyl azide and substituted styrenes. This new aziridination activity highlights the remarkable ability of a natural enzyme to adapt and take on new functions. Once discovered in an evolvable enzyme, this non-natural activity was improved and its selectivity tuned through an evolutionary process of accumulating beneficial mutations. The impressive catalytic diversity of enzymes <b>illustrates</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{bacterial}} virulence {{factors have been}} observed to adopt structures {{similar to that of}} aerolysin, the principal toxin of Aeromonas species. However, a comprehensive description of architecture and structure of the aerolysin-like superfamily has not been determined. In this study, we define a more compact aerolysin-like domain – or aerolysin fold – and show that this domain is far more widely spread than anticipated since it can be found throughout kingdoms. The aerolysin-fold could be found in very diverse domain and functional contexts, although a toxic function could often be assigned. Due to this diversity, the borders of the superfamily could not be set on a sequence level. As a border-defining member, we therefore chose pXO 2 - 60 – a protein from the pathogenic pXO 2 plasmid of Bacillus anthracis.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} evolution of phenotypic characters is very complex and is poorly understood with few examples documenting the roles of multiple genes. Considering that a single gene cannot fully explain the convergence of phenotypic characters, we choose to study the convergent evolution of rod vision in two divergent bats from a network perspective. The Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) are non-echolocating and have binocular vision, whereas the sheath-tailed bats (Emballonuridae) are echolocating and have monocular vision; however, they both have relatively large eyes and rely more on rod vision to find food and navigate in the night. We found that the genes CRX, which plays an essential role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells, SAG, which is involved in the desensitization of the photoactivated transduction cascade, and the photoreceptor gene RH, which is directly responsible for the perception of dim light, have undergone parallel sequence evolution in two divergent lineages of bats with larger eyes (Pteropodidae and Emballonuroidea).

40|$|These {{excerpts}} from Sidra’s five-and-a-half page {{account of her}} transition from Pakistan to Canada provide {{a glimpse into the}} inner world of an English language learning (ELL) student. Sidra highlights themes that are notably absent from the “scientifically-proven ” prescriptions of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). She talks about the struggle to express herself, not just linguistically, but also culturally. Her “cultural clothes ” are an expression of her identity that is rejected by peers, causing her to feel “really, really left out. ” She realizes early that difference often leads to exclusion. However, the rejection by peers is offset by the affirmation from teachers. Respect from teachers {{played a crucial role in}} welcoming her into the learning community of the school. This respect manifested itself in genuine interest on the part of teachers in her prior experiences, her culture and religion. In short, Sidra expresses vividly the importance of human relationships in children’s adjustment to schooling. She illustrates how engagement in learning, particularly for ELL students, is fueled as much by affect as by cognition. Despite her still limited access to academic English, she writes extensively because she has a lot to share and she knows that her teacher (Lisa Leoni) is genuinely interested in her experiences and insights.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in genome inspired target discovery, small molecule screens, development of biological and nanotechnology {{have led to}} the introduction of a myriad of new differently sized agents into the clinic. The differences in small and large molecule delivery are becoming increasingly important in combination therapies as well as the use of drugs that modify the physiology of tumors such as anti-angiogenic treatment. The complexity of targeting has {{led to the development of}} mathematical models to facilitate understanding, but unfortunately, these studies are often only applicable to a particular molecule, making pharmacokinetic comparisons difficult. Here we develop and describe a framework for categorizing primary pharmacokinetics of drugs in tumors. For modeling purposes, we define drugs not by their mechanism of action but rather their rate-limiting step of delivery. Our simulations account for variations in perfusion, vascularization, interstitial transport, and non-linear local binding and metabolism. Based on a comparison of the fundamental rates determining uptake, drugs were classified into four categories depending on whether uptake is limited by blood flow, extravasation, interstitial diffusion, or local binding and metabolism. Simulations comparing small molecule versus macromolecular drugs show a sharp difference in distribution, which has implications for multi-drug therapies. The tissuelevel distribution differs widely in tumors for small molecules versus macromolecular biologic drugs, and this should be considered in the design of agents and treatments.

40|$|Abstract: Smart {{clothing}} {{represents the}} future of both the textile/clothing industry and electronic industry. As the convergence between these two industries brings large opportunities and challenges, it draws great attention and investment from many organisations in different fields, e. g. academic institutes, governmental organisations, private companies and laboratories. Currently, none of smart clothing applications is considered a full integration of high technology and fashion design, since most research attempts are focusing on solving technical problems such as integrating microchip and computer systems into clothing or overcoming wash-and-care issues. Consequently, the current applications are unable to attract the mass market. The imbalanced contribution from electronics and fashion industries and the users is the main problem of smart clothing development at this stage. Moreover, the research reveals that the strategic thinking which helps in defining true benefits or core values of smart clothing and may lead to better outcomes is still lacking. As the approach has recently changed from the technical one to a user-centred one, strategic thinking and a New Product Development (NPD) process addressing key elements from both industries are required. As a result, {{the key question is}} identifying and optimum balancing these key elements in the new approach and the NPD process. Nevertheless, fashion design and product design are established fields of their own, it is difficult to adopt or switch to the others ’ work methods. Therefore, the new approach and the NPD process should encourage the development team to think in a different way and go beyond their current creative boundaries.
