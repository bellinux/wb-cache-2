50|$|The {{origins of}} the MAC lay in the 1960 {{independence}} of the Belgian Congo and the resulting Congo Crisis which saw {{the vast majority of}} white colonials, who were largely French-speaking, return to Belgium. From within this group a number of extremist organisation began to grow up, most notably the Comité d'Action et de Défence des Belges d'Afrique (CADBA or Committee for Action and the Defence of African Belgians), which had worked against the decolonization of the Belgian Congo. When this aim was not forthcoming (and became increasingly undesirable due to the trouble in Congo and the return of most Belgians) CADBA reinvented itself as the MAC, becoming more of an <b>extremist</b> white <b>armed</b> <b>group.</b> A minor movement, it worked with Jeune Europe domestically, as well as the British Union Movement and the Organisation armée secrète in France and was a founder member of the National Party of Europe.|$|R

50|$|SOG (Special Operations Group) is the Special Forces {{element of}} the Odisha Police. The SOG was formed in August 2004 on the orders of the Government of Odisha Home office with the {{objective}} of neutralising any terrorist, insurgent, <b>extremist</b> or illegal <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> operating in Odisha. The SOG originally had 462 regular active posts which by 2009 had grown to 1,370 personnel. It does not recruit personnel directly, instead personnel are drawn from various state police units and the assignments are based on tenures with a maximum period of 3 years. It also allows hiring of operatives from the armed forces, central paramilitary forces and police units of other states. Operatives receive training at a special school in Chandaka and also from the Indian army based in Jabalpur. The main role of the SOG is counter-insurgency operations but handling hostage situations and hijackings also come under its responsibility. It works closely with the Special Intelligence Wing of the Odisha Police.|$|R
40|$|During {{the late}} 1970 s, Turkey {{experienced}} a major campaign of political terrorism that was waged by {{a multiplicity of}} leftist, ultranationalist, and separatist groups. Between 1976 and 1980, more than 5000 people {{lost their lives in}} hundreds of terrorist incidents. The steady escalation of violence amidst a major political and economic crisis undermined the country's fragile democratic system and paved the way for a military coup in September 1980. This study examines the origins and growth of the terrorist movement in Turkey, the main characteristics of political violence, and the causes of the dramatic escalation of terrorism in the late 1970 s. The study suggests that although state-sponsored terrorism against Turkey facilitated the rapid proliferation of leftist, rightist, and separatist <b>armed</b> <b>extremist</b> <b>groups,</b> the drift into total terrorism was largely the product of domestic political and social developments...|$|R
50|$|Ivica Rajić, {{commander}} of the HVO Central Bosnia Operational Zone's Second Operational Group, traveling through friendly Serb territory had reached Vareš on or before 20 October and changed the situation greatly. In Vareš he and an <b>armed</b> <b>extremist</b> <b>group</b> carried out a local coup, jailing and replacing the mayor and police chief. The municipality's large Bosniak population was then harassed, robbed, and systemically forced from their houses. Within days {{the majority of the}} Bosniak population had relocated south to the village of Dabravina. Rajić established a hardliner government while the ARBiH was preparing to attack Vareš. The ARBiH began with the town of Ratanj between Kakanj and Vareš and moved on to the predominately Croat village of Kopjari where three HVO soldiers were killed and the town's population was forced to flee. The attack infuriated Rajić and ordered that the HVO assault a Bosniak village in retaliation.|$|R

40|$|Non-State <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> exert {{extensive}} {{influence on}} populations around the world. However, international {{law does not}} effectively regulate the relationship between <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and populations subject to their authority or influence and {{so much of this}} interaction occurs in a legal vacuum. This chapter proposes international human rights law as a solution. The application of international human rights law obligations to <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> is increasingly accepted, but the precise content of the resultant obligations is unclear. Significantly, the development of the law in this regard presents a unique opportunity to actively engage <b>armed</b> <b>groups,</b> and to encourage their compliance with human rights law, and international law more broadly. It is suggested that if the practice of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and their motivations are incorporated into the development of human rights obligations, then the resultant obligations can be used not only to regulate <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> activity but also to guide it. Human rights law can be used to demonstrate to <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> how they can govern {{in the best interests of}} the affected population—thereby promoting human rights protection—and why it is in their interest that they do so—thereby promoting compliance. This chapter examines armed groups’ practice, motivations, and ideology and discusses <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> governance activities related to the administration of justice and service provision in order to illustrate how the proposed approach could proceed. Although the focus is on international human rights law, where international humanitarian law is applicable it must also inform the development of any obligations...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is common}} for <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> to {{splinter}} (or “fragment”) during contexts of multi-party civil war, current guidance on Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) does not address the challenges that arise when recalcitrant fighters, unwilling to report to DDR, break ranks and form new <b>armed</b> <b>groups.</b> This Practice Note addresses this issue, drawing lessons from the multi-party context of the DRC and from the experiences of former members of three armed groups: the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma), the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), and the DRC national army (FARDC). While the findings indicate that the fragmentation of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> may encourage desertion and subsequent participation in DDR, they also show that active <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> may monitor DDR programs and track those who demobilize. Remobilization may follow, either as active <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> target ex-combatants for forced re-recruitment or as ex-combatants remobilize in <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> of their own choice. Given these dynamics, practitioners in settings of partial peace may find it useful to consider non-traditional methods of DDR {{such as the use of}} mobile patrols and mobile disarmament units. The temporary relocation of ex-combatants to safe areas free from <b>armed</b> <b>groups,</b> or to protected transitional assistance camps, may also help to minimize remobilization during the reintegration phase...|$|R
40|$|Most {{contemporary}} armed {{conflicts are}} not of an international character. International Humanitarian Law (IHL) applicable to these conflicts is equally binding on non-State <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> {{as it is on}} States. The legal mechanisms for its implementation are, however, still mainly geared toward States. The author considers that the perspective of such groups and the difficulties for them in applying IHL should be taken into account {{in order to make the}} law more realistic and more often respected. It is submitted that the law is currently often developed and interpreted without taking into account the realities of <b>armed</b> <b>groups.</b> This contribution explores how <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> could be involved in the development, interpretation and operationalization of the law. It argues that <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> should be allowed to accept IHL formally, to create – amongst other things – a certain sense of ownership. Their respect of the law should also be rewarded. Possible methods to encourage, monitor and control respect of IHL by <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> are described.

40|$|The {{starting}} point for this NWOI funded Ph. D. research is the observation that although UN accountability mechanisms are increasingly holding <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> ‘accountable’ under human rights law, the legal basis for the responsibility of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> under human rights law remains controversial Structured into four parts, this study addresses the uncertainty {{at the core of}} the debate about whether and when <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> are bound by human rights obligations. Part I of the study identifies the normative value that human rights law brings to the legal framework that applies in non-international armed conflicts vis-a-vis international humanitarian law. It shows that human rights law brings most value to activities connected to the exercise of authority over persons or territory, the maintenance of public order and the suppression of criminal activity outside the conduct of hostilities. Drawing on social science literature on rebel governance and armed conflict generally, the study demonstrates that there is significant added value in holding <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> to account under human rights law. Part II of the study brings clarity to the circumstances in which <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> can acquire obligations under international human rights law. It does this by conducting a comparative and theoretical analysis of the legal personality of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> under international humanitarian law, the law of belligerency and the law of insurgency. By analysing these legal frameworks, the study draws conclusions about the material and theoretical circumstances which are required for an <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> to acquire legal personality under human rights law. Part IV of the study brings clarity to how and when <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> can be held bound by human rights norms. In doing so, the study considers whether the source of an <b>armed</b> <b>group’s</b> legal obligations under international law are most likely rooted in treaty law, its control of territory, international criminal law or customary international law. Part IV of the study synthesises the study’s findings to draw conclusions about the circumstances in which it may be justifiable for UN accountability mechanisms to hold <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> responsible under human rights law...|$|R

40|$|Civil wars {{involving}} non-state <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> in Burma {{have been}} driven by a complex mix of historical socio-political grievances and economic factors. The central government and its armed forces have conducted counterinsurgency campaigns against myriad rebel groups in ethnic areas virtually since independence in 1948. Civilian populations caught in these conflicts have suffered immensely as a consequence. The government and army have never completely controlled all the territory and people of the internationally recognised state as it exists on the map. Instead, in some areas it has been <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and welfare actors associated with them that {{have been responsible for}} limited administration and service provision to conflict-affected populations. Despite tolerance or support for this non-state governance in some areas, <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> still present threats to the security of the constituencies they also claim to represent. This thesis assesses the factors that have facilitated or obstructed armed groups’ actions and the extent of their compliance (or not) in response to the norms against landmine use and the recruitment of children. While studies in other regions on <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and humanitarian norms have tended to consider policies of violence deliberately directed against civilians, the present study considers these less deliberate threats that <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> in Burma present to the security of their own constituencies. It explores a set of theoretical propositions drawn from literature that has addressed <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> from the perspectives of humanitarian engagement, sociology and political economy analysis of armed conflict. These contrasting approaches offer a more inclusive framework for analysis, considering the social, economic and coercive military and political structures influencing <b>armed</b> <b>groups,</b> affected populations and humanitarian actors engaging with them in relation to these issues. This thesis contends that perceived legitimacy and the role of <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> associated welfare and civil society actors have been significant influences on attempts to ameliorate the impact of these issues. The perspectives and influences of legitimacy diverge, however, between international support for the prohibition of landmine use and underage recruitment, and local perceptions, from <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> constituencies and the government, of the <b>groups</b> as credible <b>armed</b> actors. Localised economic agendas combined with geographical dispersion and weak organisational cohesion have also been factors leading to less compliance with these protection norms. The findings indicate that there is also considerable divergence in the extent of compliance between the two norms. Whereas landmine use remains perceived as militarily necessary to most <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> in Burma and related to their maintenance of local legitimacy, children involved with <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> are seen as less vital militarily, and external engagement with <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> to address this issue has met with more acceptance over time. In the light of bilateral ceasefires and ongoing negotiations since 2012, the willingness and capacity of the <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and their welfare wings to address these concerns for conflict-affected populations will be important for their future support and for lasting political settlements...|$|R
