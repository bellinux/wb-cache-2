25|$|It {{makes good}} sense, for example, to say of the {{extensive}} variable , or {{of the extensive}} variable , {{that it has a}} density per unit volume, or a quantity per unit mass of the system, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, {{which in turn is}} why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{profitable}} and requiring little oversight, an official statement was never given on why Pearl purchased Judson. Other than support for Judson, Pearl never branded their name {{on any of}} the candy products, even in an era when it was completely acceptable for celebrities and popular cartoon characters to push adult-oriented items such as alcohol and cigarettes. [...] From the surface, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> that a major brewery would enter a completely foreign market to buy a company and support it, yet not use the purchased company in the larger company's goals. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> at all, that is until one looks at the purchase {{in the context of the}} feud between Pearl and Lone Star.|$|R
500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting {{to say one}} thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} no way to fix which square root of {{negative}} one will be meant by the symbol [...] (<b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of [...] "the positive square root" [...] since only real numbers can be positive, similarly <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say [...] "rotation counter-clockwise", because until [...] is chosen, {{there is no}} fixed way to draw the complex plane), and hence one occasionally sees the Fourier transform written with [...] in the exponent instead of , and vice versa for the inversion formula, a convention that is equally valid as the one chosen in this article, which is the most usual one.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Scruton, the British philosopher, {{argues that}} rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes {{a burden on}} the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, [...] "your right may be my duty." [...] Scruton {{therefore}} regards {{the emergence of the}} animal rights movement as [...] "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> spread them beyond our own species.|$|E

50|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behaviour, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|R
2500|$|For example, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> {{ask whether}} 1 hour is more, the same, {{or less than}} 1 kilometer, as these have {{different}} dimensions, nor to add 1 hour to 1 kilometer. [...] However, {{it makes perfect sense}} to ask whether 1 mile is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer being the same dimension of physical quantity even though the units are different. On the other hand, if an object travels 100km in 2 hours, one may divide these and conclude that the object's average speed was 50km/h.|$|E
2500|$|The title essay and an {{additional}} essay, [...] "Jerry Falwell's Mother," [...] focus on free speech issues. [...] In the latter piece, Fish argues that, if one has some answer in mind to the question [...] "what is free speech good for?" [...] {{along the lines of}} [...] "in the free and open clash of viewpoints the truth can more readily be known," [...] then <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> defend deliberate malicious libel (such as that which was at issue in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell) in the name of [...] "free speech." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{interpretation}} (and {{the criticism}} of Wittgenstein that arises from it) {{is based on a}} complete misreading, however, because Wittgenstein's argument {{has nothing to do with}} the fallibility of human memory, but rather concerns the intelligibility of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It is not that we will not in fact remember the sensation correctly, but rather that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> talk of our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case. The point, as Diego Marconi puts it, is not so much that private language is [...] "a game at which we can't win, it is a game we can't lose".|$|E

If you don't see results and you begin to start doing the same thing, people get bored of you too. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b> That was our situation, but I think that anyone, if he gets into a certain routine, in the end he gets frustrated and has no motivation." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{alternate}} translation of Genesis 4:17, endorsed by {{a minority of}} modern commentators, Cain's son Enoch builds a city and names it after his son, Irad. Such a city could correspond with Eridu, {{one of the most}} ancient cities known. [...] Philo observes that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for Cain, the third human on Earth, to have founded an actual city. Instead, he argues, the city symbolizes an unrighteous philosophy.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} other hand, in October 2013, during a notable {{interview}} with the founder of la Repubblica newspaper Eugenio Scalfari, Francis stated: [...] "I believe in God, not in a Catholic God, there is no Catholic God", and [...] "Proselytism is solemn nonsense, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b> We {{need to get to}} know each other, listen to each other and improve our knowledge of the world around us".|$|R
2500|$|Although Wittgenstein {{certainly}} {{argues that}} the notion of private language is incoherent, because {{of the way in which}} the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. [...] This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of [...] "meaning". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent [...] "sample" [...] or [...] "object" [...] that we can call [...] "meaning". Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a social event; meaning happens between language users. As a consequence, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> talk about a private language, with words that mean something in the absence of other users of the language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{comparison}} {{was also}} made by other critics such as journalist Stephen Totilo and IGN's Cindy White. Totilo wrote that HAL was {{an influence on}} GLaDOS' [...] "psychotic breakdown" [...] seen {{near the end of}} the first Portal title. White wrote HAL and GLaDOS were similar due to both having [...] "a calm, almost childlike, demeanor" [...] which [...] "hides nefarious intentions". She added that [...] "the prospect of being shut down causes them to act out in deadly ways". [...] GamesRadar editor Tyler Wilde stated that while the staff of GamesRadar loves GLaDOS, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> insert a personality core into a robot. He suggested that the scientists either never read 2001: A Space Odyssey, or read it too much. Empire Online listed her as the 12th-best video game character of all time, describing her acts as [...] "HAL-like conduct". Writer Stephen Totilo alluded the final battle with GLaDOS to the scene of David from 2001 disabling HAL, with both scenes involving de-evolving the respective characters.|$|E
2500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was actively}} advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. [...] Quine advanced {{the view that}} in predicate-language sentences like Fx the [...] "x" [...] is {{to be thought of}} as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in [...] "For all things, it is the case that [...] [...] [...]" [...] but the [...] "F" [...] is {{to be thought of as}} an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). [...] For example, it might mean [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.|$|E
5000|$|On the ship, an {{agitated}} River dismantles Shepard Book's Bible, {{insisting that}} <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> {{and that she}} has to [...] "fix" [...] it. Book manages to calm her down and explains that the Bible is not about making sense in a logical or scientific sense, but rather about faith that fixes people rather than needing fixing itself. Later, she attempts to repair and return it to him, but panics when she sees his wild head of hair that he normally keeps in a tight bun.|$|R
50|$|The infamous {{night vision}} {{sequence}} {{was actually a}} re-shot version of the scene. After realizing that they shot the original version of the scene to look too dark, filmmakers had to return and re-shoot the entire sequence, delaying the movie's release for six months. But due to the budget issues this scene couldn't be finished properly so {{it was decided to}} add green visual tint to the scene to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look like it was night vision, even though <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for why would this scene would have that look.|$|R
40|$|When {{you think}} about <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense.</b> But in the United States, we’ve been doing it this way {{for well over a}} century—everybody in a single cohort is taught the same thing at the same time. Students quickly learn they may speak if they have a good {{question}} or the right answer. Teachers take courses in how to conduct courses such as these, learn the addresses of publishers and organizations that will sell them ready-made curricular materials, determine the clerical skills to compute grades, to track attendance, to keep classroom order...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{explosion}} of use and interest in SSRIs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focused especially on Prozac, interest grew as well in discontinuation syndromes. In the late 1990s, some investigators thought that symptoms that emerged when antidepressants were discontinued, might mean that antidepressants were causing addiction, and some used the term [...] "withdrawal syndrome" [...] to describe the symptoms. Addictive substances cause physiological dependence, so that drug withdrawal causes suffering. These theories were abandoned, since addiction leads to drug-seeking behavior, and people taking antidepressants do not exhibit drug-seeking behavior. The term [...] "withdrawal syndrome" [...] is no longer used with respect to antidepressants, to avoid confusion with problems that arise from addiction. There are case reports of antidepressants being abused, but these are rare and are mostly limited to antidepressants with stimulant effects and to people who already had a substance use disorder. A 2012 comparison {{of the effects of}} stopping therapy with benzodiazepines and SSRIs argued that because the symptoms are similar, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say that benzodiazepines are addictive while SSRIs are not. Responses to that review noted that {{there is no evidence that}} people who stop taking SSRIs exhibit drug-seeking behavior while people who stop taking benzodiazepines do, and that the drug classes should be considered differently.|$|E

50|$|In the 41-page {{opinion in}} the case brought by the Episcopal Church and its Diocese of San Joaquin, Fresno County Superior Court Judge Donald S. Black also said that “because a diocese is a {{geographical}} construct of the Church, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> that a diocese can ‘leave’ the Church; it does not exist apart from the Church.” On August 18, 2014, {{in a letter to}} the Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin, Bishop Eric Menees announced that he has decided to appeal this decision to the Fifth District Court of Appeals.|$|R
50|$|In {{his role}} as Sikyong, Sangay has {{emphasized}} the importance of seeking a peaceful, non-violent resolution of the Tibet issue. He has supported the Dalai Lama's call for a so-called “Middle Way” approach “that would provide for genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of Chinese constitution.” Noting that China has established “one country, two systems” mechanisms in Hong Kong and Macau, he has argued that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for China to continue to resist a similar solution for Tibet, which, he emphasizes, would be a “win-win” result.|$|R
5000|$|Right now, {{the peace}} talks are based only one thing, only on peace talks. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> {{at this point to}} talk about the most {{contractible}} issue. It's Jerusalem or bust, or right of return or bust. That has led to failure and is likely to lead to failure again....We must weave an economic peace alongside a political process. That means that we have to strengthen the moderate parts of the Palestinian economy by handing rapid growth in those area, rapid economic growth that gives a stake for peace for the ordinary Palestinians.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} no way to fix which square root of {{negative}} one will be meant by the symbol [...] (<b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of [...] "the positive square root" [...] since only real numbers can be positive, similarly <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say [...] "rotation counter-clockwise", because until [...] is chosen, {{there is no}} fixed way to draw the complex plane), and hence one occasionally sees the Fourier transform written with [...] in the exponent instead of , and vice versa for the inversion formula, a convention that is equally valid as the one chosen in this article, which is the most usual one.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{diseases}} are defined only clinically, like AIDS being opposed to HIV infection. Therefore <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak about [...] "asymptomatic AIDS". This concept of clinically defined diseases is related {{in some way}} to the concept of syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|The {{band had}} few {{performances}} between 2007 and 2010. After an unsuccessful 15th anniversary concert, Levente Kovács declared {{in an interview}} that, [...] "I don't see any chance to perform on stage {{under the name of}} FreshFabrik anymore to play TapTap. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for me. <b>It's</b> only my opinion, {{there are many ways to}} do FreshFabrik without me, and maybe they will." [...] So he left the band for one year, but Andras and Szabolcs, with former bass player Reka Hain played some shows with moderate success.|$|R
5000|$|Henceforth, {{one might}} draw the {{conclusion}} that pessimism about philosophical progress allows for a sort of liberation from the expectations for scientific progress, and thus for a reasoned optimism about philosophy. Philosophers in this camp argue that once we recognize that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for philosophy to make scientific-technical progress, we ought to also realize that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for philosophy to aspire to it either. In other words, philosophy is not science, and shouldn't imitate sciences. Rather than expect philosophy to prove its worth with scientific-technical progress, and then judge it worthless when it fails to, these philosophers argue that philosophical inquiry must be worthy in its own right. The perceived need for philosophy to prove itself in terms {{of some sort of}} scientific-technical progress is often diagnosed as a sort of creeping scientism, and repudiated as a drastic oversimplification of our intellectual life. This may have been the position of Wittgenstein against the Vienna positivists--although if Wittgenstein saw any intrinsic value in philosophical inquiry he certainly didn't think that most people could profit from it. In any case, it was certainly the position of latter Wittgensteinians such as Peter Winch, as well as other contemporary philosophers such as Heidegger. The view also, its proponents argue, represents a [...] "return" [...] to the conception of philosophy and its value found in ancient philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.|$|R
30|$|While {{the right}} can cope with authoritarian populism, {{the left is}} caught in a trap, since many of its {{supporters}} are drawn to right-wing populism. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> calling for anti-populist politics, when the discontent that fuels it is not given an alternative political form. While there are some examples of left-wing populism, they are relatively marginal {{and do not have}} the capacity to mobilise mass publics around a different set of values. Public discussion on the pros and contras of European integration concentrate too much on mobility and, as the Brexit issue revealed, too much on its economic merits.|$|R
