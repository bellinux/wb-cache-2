5|$|The {{government}} led by Montfort soon {{ran into}} problems; he faced poor finances, general disorder, {{and the threat}} of invasion from exiled royalists in France. It was decidedsince the French arbitration committee had come to nothingto set up a provisional administration, consisting of Montfort, the young Earl of Gloucester, and the Bishop of Chichester. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached. By the Peace of Canterbury in August, Henry and Edward were forced to accept even stricter terms than those of the Mise of Lewes. According to this new agreement, the current form of government was to remain in force throughout the reign of King Henry, and into that of Edward. To keep the borders safe, Montfort had been forced to release Roger Mortimer and other royalist Marcher lords after the Battle of Lewes. In December, Montfort forced Mortimer, Roger de Clifford and Roger de Leybourne to promise to leave the country for Ireland. Then, in January, he summoned a parliament at Leicester which became known as Montfort's Parliament, including representatives from the shires and boroughs; an innovation in English <b>government.</b> <b>Here</b> Montfort secured the support of the community of the realm for his continued reign.|$|E

500|$|Smith, {{a farmer}} from the Midlands town of Selukwe {{who had been}} seriously wounded while serving in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia's first {{native-born}} Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a [...] "raw colonial"—when he took over, Smith's personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF's replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader Harold Wilson called it [...] "brutal", while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as [...] "a suicide squad... {{not interested in the}} welfare of all the people but only in their own". Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black nationalist rule and apartheid so that there would still be [...] "a place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed. He held that the government should be based [...] "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be [...] "no African nationalist <b>government</b> <b>here</b> in my lifetime".|$|E

500|$|Most of the Southern Rhodesian press {{predicted}} that Smith would not last long; one column called him [...] "a momentary man", {{thrust into the}} spotlight by the RF's dearth of proven leaders. His only real rival to replace Field had been William Harper, an ardent segregationist who had headed the Dominion Party's Southern Rhodesian branch during the Federal years. Some reporters predicted Welensky's imminent introduction to Southern Rhodesian politics {{at the head of}} an RF–UFP coalition government, but Welensky showed little interest in this idea, saying he would be unable to manoeuvre in an RF-dominated House. The RF's replacement of Field with Smith drew criticism from the British Labour leader Harold Wilson, who called it [...] "brutal", while JB Johnston, the British High Commissioner in Salisbury, indicated his disapproval by refusing to meet Smith for two weeks after he took office. The ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo branded the new Smith Cabinet [...] "a suicide squad... interested not in the welfare of all the people but only in their own", and {{predicted that}} the RF would [...] "eventually destroy themselves". Asserting that a lasting [...] "place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia would benefit all of the country's people, the new Prime Minister said the government should be based [...] "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be [...] "no African nationalist <b>government</b> <b>here</b> in my lifetime".|$|E
500|$|The American War of Independence was the {{culmination}} of the civil and political American Revolution resulting from the American Enlightenment. Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament, which was seen as a denial of their rights as Englishmen and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent, the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the Boston Tea Party. Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774. Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. After petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament were ignored, the rebel leaders were declared traitors by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued. The colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, [...] "He has abdicated <b>Government</b> <b>here...</b> He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people." [...] The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.|$|E

Shortly before the coup attempt, Chávez dismissed possible hostility from the United States, since [...] "times had changed." [...] After the coup, however, Chávez asserted numerous times that United States government officials knew about plans for a coup, approved of them, and assumed they would be successful, alleging that [...] "two military officers from the United States" [...] {{were present in the}} headquarters of coup plotters. Chávez would also state after the coup that there was [...] "little evidence" [...] that the United States orchestrated the plan.

According to Fitzwilliam they decided that: [...] "Roman Catholick [...] not to be brought forward by Government, that the {{discussion}} of the propriety may be left open". Fitzwilliam claimed this meant that whilst the administration would not put forward Emancipation, they would not obstruct it should it pass the Irish Parliament. Lord Grenville however interpreted the meeting as deciding that Fitzwilliam [...] "should, as much as possible, endeavour to prevent the agitation of the question during the present session; and that, in all events, he should do nothing in it which might commit the king's <b>government</b> <b>here</b> or in Ireland without fresh instructions from hence". On 18 November Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke to reassure him: [...] "the business is settled: that I go to Ireland—though not exactly upon the terms I had originally thought of, and I mean particularly in the removal of the Chancellor, who is now to remain, Grattan and the Ponsonbys desire me to accept: I left the decision to them".|$|E
