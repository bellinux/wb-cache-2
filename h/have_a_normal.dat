5|$|Most {{people with}} HHT <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> lifespan. The skin lesions and nosebleeds tend to develop during childhood.

5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Most men <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, {{determining}} that Wayne is a Czech immigrant {{by the name}} of Ivan Veles, reaches the conclusion that Wayne is a demon who is trying to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> baby, and suspects that he terminates pregnancies when the fetus exhibits demon-like traits. Betsy has a dream similar to Laura's, but recognizes the dream-demon as her husband. Nevertheless, she loses her baby and tracks down Mulder and Scully. The two seek out Weinsider and catch him digging in Betsy's backyard. After a short conversation, the sheriff arrives at the house and shoots Weinsider. He is taken to hospital and placed in a bed next to Laura. A mist passes from Weinsider's body into Laura's, at which point Weinsider dies and Laura recovers.|$|E

5|$|Reed and Sue {{contemplate}} abandoning {{their lives}} as superheroes in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> life and raise a family, but are unaware Johnny is listening. With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in London. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the River Thames, but they manage to prevent the London Eye from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend Victor Von Doom, freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{invites the}} {{orphaned}} Dick {{to stay at}} Wayne Manor. Dick, still troubled by {{the murder of his}} family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma turns himself into a criminal called the Riddler and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device. At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman, but she soon discovers that they are one and the same. Bruce decides to stop being Batman in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> life with Chase and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick angrily runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler destroys the Batcave. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce and the Riddler leaves him an another riddle.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study on}} the Circle of Willis and its {{relation}} to cerebral vascular disorders, a comparison on various anomalies between normal brains (those without the condition of cerebral softening) and brains with cerebral softening were looked at to observe trends in the differences of the anatomical structure of the Circle of Willis. Statistically significant results were found in the percentage of <b>normal</b> brains that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Circle of Willis and those that had cerebral softening and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Circle of Willis. The results yielded 52% of <b>normal</b> brains <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Circle of Willis, while only 33% of brains with cerebral softening <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Circle of Willis. There were also a higher number of string-like vessels in brains with cerebral softening (42%), than there were in normal brains (27%). These results point to an assumption of a higher incidence rate of anomalies in brains with cerebral softening versus those that do not have cerebral softening.|$|R
