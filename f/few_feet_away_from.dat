5|$|The Corinthians {{gained a}} corner kick early on, and Cardiff cleared. This was {{followed}} up by a further {{attack by the}} amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot went straight to Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being only a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.|$|E

5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E
25|$|As an officer, Castro was not {{required}} to personally provide fire support to fellow soldiers in the exposed housetop position. Nonetheless, he volunteered for the mission and was accompanied by Sergeant Ralph Porras and Private First Class Justin Dreese. A mortar round landed a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, killing Sergeant Porras and PFC Dreese and severely wounding Castro. Shrapnel tore through his body, damaging a shoulder, breaking an arm, fracturing facial bones and collapsing his lungs. The blast also drove the frame of his protective eyewear into his face.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2017, {{a statue}} of Clarence Darrow was {{unveiled}} in Dayton, Tennessee on the Rhea County Courthouse lawn, funded by a $150,000 donation from the FFRF.

25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded only a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge.

25|$|The only {{recorded}} {{evidence of}} his pitching speed stems from 1958, when Dalkowski was sent by the Orioles to Aberdeen Proving Ground, a military installation. Here, using a radar machine, he was clocked at , a fast but not outstanding speed for a professional pitcher. However, several factors worked against Dalkowski: he had pitched a game the day before, he was throwing from a flat surface instead of from a pitcher's mound, {{and he had to}} throw pitches for 40minutes at a small target before the machine could capture an accurate measurement. Further, the device measured speed from a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the plate, instead of 10 feet from release as in modern times. This cost Dalkowski approximately 9 MPH, not even considering the other factors.|$|E

50|$|The island sits a <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Hatteras Island, {{with water}} at depth {{of no more}} than 5 ft. The {{surrounding}} area {{is referred to as the}} Graveyard of the Atlantic. Small landmasses frequently appear and vanish in this area, but Shelly Island is notable for its size and the speed with which it formed. As long as the island remains detached, it falls under the jurisdiction of Dare County, North Carolina. If it grows enough to merge into Hatteras Island, it will potentially come under federal jurisdiction and become part of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The island will likely not last a full year as a separate landform.|$|R

500|$|The TARDIS on {{the cloud}} was {{achieved}} through {{a mix of}} fog on the studio floor and post-production special effects. Director Saul Metzstein explained {{that it was difficult}} to achieve the desired look for the snowmen; the first ones he likened to Zippy from Rainbow which was too [...] "cute" [...] an appearance, and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces. Clara's introduction to the TARDIS introduced two novel effects for the show. The first was a single-shot camera tracking from a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the TARDIS to its interior, with the implication of the TARDIS's trans-dimensional nature shown to the audience. In the following shot, the camera does a complete circle of the TARDIS console, an effect not seen {{since the early days of}} the show. Metzstein wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the [...] "bigger on the inside than the outside" [...] nature of the time machine.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} final, Artur Jorge left Porto to coach French team Matra Racing; his {{substitute}} was [...] Tomislav Ivić. As European Cup winners, Porto contested the 1987 European Super Cup against Ajax, the 1986–87 Cup Winners' Cup holders. Porto {{won the first}} leg 1–0 in Amsterdam, and two months later repeated the result at home, becoming the competition's first Portuguese winners. In between, Porto traveled to Japan to contest the 1987 Intercontinental Cup against the 1987 Copa Libertadores winners, Peñarol of Uruguay. A severe snowstorm hit Tokyo {{on the day of}} the match, which nearly forced its postponement. Despite the poor weather conditions, the game went ahead. Porto took the lead just before half-time but conceded the equaliser in the final minutes of the second half. In extra-time, Madjer lobbed a ball from the midfield over Peñarol's goalkeeper; it landed on the snow a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the goal line, but with enough impulse to roll into the goal and secure Porto's (and Portugal's) first Intercontinental Cup title.|$|E

5000|$|Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave a B+ {{grade to}} the episode saying: [...] "When a sitcom gets all its major {{characters}} {{together in a}} single, extended, episode-long scene, {{you can be sure}} of one thing: They will form into groups, stand a <b>few</b> scant <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> another character, and talk about that character as if they can’t be heard. I love this trope. ... Every time it happens, I’m reminded of the artificiality of the entertainment format that I’m enjoying, its conventions, tricks, and shortcuts. The single-camera laugh-track-less sitcom dispenses with so many of those concessions to theatrical necessity, that I find myself appreciating them even more when they appear. Those moments are a signal that the creative team is celebrating the sitcom form, not fleeing it. ... Sometimes the old ways are the best. Modern Family has that venerable sitcom DNA despite its 21st century trappings, and “Yard Sale” continues a concerted season four effort to stay close to those roots." ...|$|R

The location is about 4 kilometers west and south of the ring fault of the enormous Jemez Caldera in the northcentral part of New Mexico. It is shown that geothermal energy may be extracted from hot rock that does not contain circulating hot water or steam and is relatively impermeable. A fluid is pumped at high pressure into an isolated section of a wellbore. If the well is cased the pipe in this pressurized region is perforated {{as it is in the}} petroleum industry, so that the pressure may be applied to the rock, cracking it. A second well is drilled a <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the first. Cold water is injected through the first pipe, circulates through the crack, and hot water returns to the surface through the second pipe. Results are described and circumstances are discussed under which artiflcial geothermal reservoirs might be created in the basaltic rock of Hawaii. (MCW) USDO...|$|R
