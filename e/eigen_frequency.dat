50|$|There are {{two main}} {{technologies}} of vibration drilling: self-maintained vibration systems and forced vibration systems. Most vibration drilling technologies are still at a research stage. It {{is the case of}} the self-maintained vibrations drilling: the <b>eigen</b> <b>frequency</b> of the tool is used {{in order to make it}} naturally vibrate while cutting; vibrations are self-maintained by a mass-spring system included in the tool holder. Other works use a piezoelectric system to generate and control the vibrations. These systems allow high vibration frequencies (up to 2 kHz) for small magnitude (about a few micrometers); they are particularly suitable for drilling small holes. Finally, vibrations can be generated by mechanical systems: the frequency is given by the combination of the rotation speed and the number of oscillation per rotation (a few oscillations per rotation), the magnitude is about 0.1 mm.|$|E

40|$|The {{graphene}} membrane irradiated by weak activating alternative {{electric field}} in terahertz range was considered. The quantum approach {{based on the}} time-dependent density matrix method was used. The exact solution was obtained for graphene membrane density matrix equation in linear on the external field approximation. The graphene electromagnetic response was studied i. e. the formulae for the induced current and conductivity were found and analyzed neglecting loss. The obtained formula for the conductivity showed that the graphene membrane was an oscillating contour and its fundamental <b>eigen</b> <b>frequency</b> coincided with a singularity point of the conductivity. This formula allowed us to calculate the graphene membrane inductivity and the capacitance. So the graphene membrane {{could be used as}} an antenna or a transistor. It was shown that its <b>eigen</b> <b>frequency</b> could be tuned by doping as its value was found to depend on electrons concentration. It was obtained that the <b>eigen</b> <b>frequency</b> could be tuned in a rather large frequency range 1 - 100 terahertz as electrons concentration in graphene may differ considerably. The found dependence on concentration correlates with experiments. It would be useful to take the obtained results into account when constructing devices containing graphene membrane nanoantenna allowing wireless communications among nanosystems. This could be promising research area of energy harvesting applications. Comment: 8 page...|$|E

It ismade to give {{a better understanding of}} the transition zones impact on a bridge. Abridge structure is complex, depending on several interacting parts as soil-structure and rail-ballast. Simplifications are made in the work with the ground rule to simplify calculations but minimizing impact on basic structural behavior. In principal the impact of a transitions zone has been studied by creating a representative model, verifying the model, performing a parametric study and then evaluation using design of experiment. Limitations are made by using a 2 -dimensional bridge in a single span, modeled linear elastic. The load is considered as a series of moving point loads. The result shows that a transition zone impact the structures dynamic behavior.

40|$|Abstract—An {{accurate}} {{procedure to}} determine free vibrations of beams and plates is presented. The natural frequencies are exact solutions of governing vibration equations witch load to a nonlinear homogeny system. The bilinear and linear structures considered simulate a bridge. The dynamic behavior {{of this one}} is analyzed by using {{the theory of the}} orthotropic plate simply supported on two sides and free on the two others. The plate can be excited by a convoy of constant or harmonic loads. The determination of the dynamic response of the structures considered requires knowledge of the free frequencies and the shape modes of vibrations. Our work is in this context. Indeed, we are interested to develop a self-consistent calculation of the <b>Eigen</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The formulation is based on the determination of the solution of the differential equations of vibrations. The boundary conditions corresponding to the shape modes permit to lead to a homogeneous system. Determination of the noncommonplace solutions of this system led to a nonlinear problem in <b>Eigen</b> <b>frequencies.</b> We thus, develop a computer code for the determination of the eigenvalues. It is based on a method of bisection with interpolation- 12 whose precision reaches 10. Moreover, to determine the corresponding modes, the calculation algorithm that we develop uses the method of Gauss with a partial optimization of the "pivots" combined with an inverse power procedure. The <b>Eigen</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a plate simply supported along two opposite sides while considering the two other free sides are thus analyzed. The results could be generalized with the case of a beam by regarding it as a plate with low width. We give, in this paper, some examples of treated cases.
