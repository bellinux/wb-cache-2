25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh woke up to find Nowell lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled up on the bed whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E

500|$|An American sailor, Tom Wilson (Frank Borzage), whose {{ship has}} been wrecked {{in a storm}} comes to them for help and shelter. Wilson {{falls in love with}} Toya and teaches her about Christianity. To the consternation of her father, Toya decides to convert and marry Tom at the local Japanese-American mission. However, her father also converts. The locals, who have been stirred up by Takeo, go on a murderous rampage against the family. They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and so they <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> house instead. When the mob reaches his house, Yamaki throws out the Buddha statue he had set up in his house and puts a cross in its place. The villagers are infuriated by this; they beat him to death beneath the cross and burn his house. Eventually, the volcano erupts and the village is {{destroyed}}, and Takeo dies in an avalanche. Only Tom Wilson and Toya San survive. They are taken away from the destroyed village by a United States merchant vessel. At the end of the film, Tom tells his bride, [...] "Your gods may be powerful, Toya San, but mine has proved his omnipotence. You are saved to perpetuate your race." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following that gig, Soda Stereo {{would gain}} slow {{traction}} throughout the underground rock scene of Buenos Aires, making {{a name for}} themselves alongside other emerging bands at the time, such as Sumo, Los Twist, Los Encargados (with Daniel Melero), and other bands. Soda would take up residency at the traditional and deteriorated Cabaret Marabú club in Maipú 359, a small autonomous city in Argentina. At these early shows, Soda would play songs like [...] "Héroes de la Serie" [...] (Heroe of the series), [...] "La Vi Parada Alli" [...] (I saw her standing there), and [...] "Vamos a La Playa" [...] (Let's <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach),</b> along with other songs that appeared on their second demo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Mathew Cullen and {{was inspired by the}} work of Will Cotton, who was also the Artistic Director of the video. Filming of the video began on May 14, 2010. It premiered on June 15, 2010. Perry explained the use of a candy theme rather than a beach theme for the video, saying, [...] "It's definitely something to watch when you have the munchies. ... It's all edible. We named it 'Candyfornia' instead of 'California', so it's a different world," [...] she said. [...] "It's not just like, 'Oh, let's <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and throw a party and then shoot a music video!' It's more like, 'Let's put us California Gurls in a whole different world!" ...|$|E

60|$|When he had {{a little}} time to himself, Theodore Roosevelt would gather a few friends around him, and either <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to bathe or go off on a long horseback ride.

60|$|And Pau Amma?

But once a year all Pau Ammas must shake off their hard armour and be soft-to remind them of what the Eldest Magician could do. And so it isn't fair to kill or hunt Pau Amma's babies just because old Pau Amma was stupidly rude a very long time ago.|$|E
60|$|But Owen Davies {{was not in}} {{the least}} mad, at any rate not then; he was only a {{creature}} of habit. In due course, his agreement fulfilled, he sailed his brig home from the West Indies (for the captain was drowned in a gale). Then he took a second-class ticket to Bryngelly, where he had never been in his life before, and asked his way to the Castle. He was told to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> and he would see it. He did so, leaving his sea-chest behind him, and there, about two hundred paces from the land, and built upon a solitary mountain of rock, measuring half a mile or so round the base, he perceived a vast mediæval pile of fortified buildings, with turrets towering three hundred feet into the air, and edged with fire by the setting sun. He gazed on it with perplexity. Could it be that this enormous island fortress belonged to him, and, if so, how on earth did one get to it? For some little time he walked up and down, wondering, too shy to go to the village for information. Meanwhile, though he did not notice her, a well-grown girl of about fifteen, remarkable for her great grey eyes and the promise of her beauty, was watching his evident perplexity from a seat beneath a rock, not without amusement. At last she rose, and, with the confidence of bold fifteen, walked straight up to him.|$|E

6000|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Saifaleupolu and the burning of Manono had thus passed off without the least {{advantage}} to Tamasese. But he still held the significant position of Mulinuu, and Brandeis was strenuous to make it good. The whole peninsula was surrounded with a breastwork; across the isthmus it was six feet high and strengthened with a ditch; and the beach was staked against landing. Weber's land claim--the same that now broods over the village {{in the form of}} a signboard--then appeared in a more military guise; the German flag was hoisted, and German sailors manned the breastwork at the isthmus--"to protect German property" [...] and its trifling parenthesis, the king of Samoa. Much vigilance reigned and, in the island fashion, much wild firing. And in spite of all, desertion was for a long time daily. The detained high chiefs would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> on the pretext of a natural occasion, plunge in the sea, and swimming across a broad, shallow bay of the lagoon, join the rebels on the Faleula side. Whole bodies of warriors, sometimes hundreds strong, departed with their arms and ammunition. On the 7th of September, for instance, the day after Leary's letter, Too and Mataia left with their contingents, and the whole Aana people returned home in a body to hold a parliament. Ten days later, it is true, a part of them returned to their duty; but another part branched off by the way and carried their services, and Tamasese's dear-bought guns, to Faleula.|$|E
