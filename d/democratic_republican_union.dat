In 1923, the URL loosely allied itself to the conservative Republican Federation {{became known as the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (URD) in 1929. The URL-URD evolved to become more of an electoral coalition rather than an organized political party, an evolution all too common in France at the time.

5000|$|So two factions {{developed}} in the Union: Méline's supporters, who were generally anti-Dreyfusard and anti-socialist, and Barboux's liberals, who supported the government. However, {{after the fall of}} Waldeck-Rousseau Cabinet in 1902, the Liberal <b>Republican</b> <b>Union</b> returned to opposing both socialists and nationalists. In the early 1900s, with the formation of the first political parties in France, the Radical-Socialist Party (PRRRS) and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republican</b> Alliance (ARD), the Union tried to create a [...] "Progressive Party", which would have personified the conservative spirit of the Republic, along with the liberal ARD and the radical PRRRS. Jacques Piou, member of the [...] "Rallies", supported the idea of a [...] "Tory party" [...] in France, born by the fusion of conservative republicans and the rallies. The journalist Ernest Daudet also supported this idea, and in 1902 many progressives joined the new Liberal Action of Piou. The following year year, in 1903, the Liberal <b>Republican</b> <b>Union</b> merged with the National Republican Association to form the liberal-conservative Republican Federation, led by Auguste Isaac.

This period, known as the [...] "Fourth Republic", is marked by the development of the 1958 Punto Fijo Pact between the major parties (originally including the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Union,</b> which later dwindled in significance), with the notable exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela.|$|E

Three members of each party signed the pact. These men included Rómulo Betancourt of AD, Rafael Caldera of COPEI, and Jóvito Villalba of the URD. Both Betancourt and Caldera would go on to become presidents of Venezuela. The pact served to deepen democracy in the region in that it ensured respect of the democratic process of the election. This allowed for the uncontested democratic election of Rómulo Betancourt ...|$|E

In 1956 he became a reporter for El Nacional, based in the Miraflores Palace, and used this position to help organise the end of Jiménez' rule. On 11 June 1957 Ojeda invited two other URD members and a Communist, Guillermo García Ponce, to his home, and they agreed that the time was ripe to form a multi-partisan organisation aiming to overthrow Jiménez. The Patriotic Junta was soon joined by Democratic Action and COPEI, and used the only clandestine press left in Venezuela, that of the Communist Party of Venezuela, to publish a manifesto. The Junta ultimately played a leading role in coordinating the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état the following January, including organising a general strike on 21 January. As the head of the Patriotic Junta, Ojeda emerged from the Jiménez dictatorship as the most important URD member after its leader, Jóvito Villalba.|$|E

By the end of the 1990s, however, the now two-party system's credibility was almost nonexistent, mostly because of the corruption and poverty that Venezuelans experienced because of the debt crisis {{developed during}} the 1980s. Democratic Action's last president (Carlos Andrés Pérez) was impeached for corruption in 1993, and spent several years in prison as a result. The other main traditional party Copei, provided two Venezuelan presidents (Rafael Caldera, 1969-1974, and Luis Herrera Campins, 1979-1983).|$|E

Over time, he progressively became a strong opponent of the government of Rómulo Betancourt (second presidency 1959-1964) over its opposition to the Cuban government under Fidel Castro and its alleged repression of leftwing political groups. However, Miquilena never agreed with guerrillas, calling them a [...] "respectable mistake", saying [...] "A 20 year old who decides to risk his life deserves respect. That's what made me a defender {{of the people who were}} fighting the battle against the armed forces, even though in privacy I was a fierce enemy of the guerrilla. It was a mistake that cost us a lot. If we channeled the democratic struggle from the beginning, with all the strength we had, through a rational and institutional way, who knows if the story would be different." [...] In 1961, Miquilena joined the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Union</b> (URD) party and he became a Representative for the state of Falcón in the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies. In 1964, he left the staff of El Clarín, quit the URD, and retired from political life. For the next 30 years, he dedicated himself to business, becoming a landowner and industrialist.|$|E
