50|$|The {{people of}} Kilu Cave {{exploited}} {{a wide range}} of <b>terrestrial</b> and marine <b>animals</b> for food. Most of the animal bones found at Kilu Cave were probably due to human predation. The site contains a large assemblage of shell, fish bones and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> remains. The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> remains came from mammals and reptiles. The mammalian remains were dominated by rodents, followed by bats. The reptilian remains came primarily from lizards, followed by snakes, with some coming from turtles and frogs. The lizard assemblage mostly came from varanids and skinks, with some coming from agamids.|$|R

40|$|Body size often plays a {{significant}} role in community assembly through its impacts on the life history and ecological attributes of species. Insight into the importance of size in structuring communities can be gained by examining the distribution of sizes of individuals(i. e., the individual size distribution (ISD) or size spectrum) in a community. ISDs have been studied extensively in aquatic and tree communities, but have received little attention in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> communities. Here, we conduct the first macroecological analysis of ISDs in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> communities to determine whether they show broad-scale consistency in shape...|$|R
30|$|The marine {{reservoir}} {{effect in}} pottery {{should not be}} neglected, though. A special risk {{lies in the fact}} that partly marine food crusts can have the same δ 13 C values as the bone collagen of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals.</b> For example, δ 13 C values between - 22.0 and - 24.7 ‰ of food remains on pottery belonging to the Pitted Ware Culture were interpreted as reflecting terrestrial origin, although the radiocarbon dates were older than expected [83]. However, terrestrial plants and fat and flesh of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> usually have more negative δ 13 C values, around ca. - 25 ‰, while the bone collagen of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> is more enriched. Food crust values which are more enriched than - 25 ‰ indicate therefore the presence of marine resources. Similarly, the δ 13 C values of food crusts from Tybrind Vig, mean δ 13 C = - 23 ± 1 ‰, indicate a strong marine component [84], but were originally interpreted as being terrestrial [85].|$|R
40|$|Rinderpest, {{also known}} as cattle plague, is a {{contagious}} viral disease affecting clovenhoofed animals mainly cattle and buffalo. Rinderpest {{is caused by a}} virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. Many species of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals including sheep and goats, show milder symptoms of the disease when infected, but the mortality rate can reach up to 100 per cent in highly susceptible cattle or buffalo herds. The OIE <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Animal</b> Health Code contains detailed recommendations on prevention and control of rinderpest. Rinderpest was one of the diseases for which the OIE established procedures of official recognition of the sanitary status of countries and zones. Rinderpest is a listed disease in the World Organisation for <b>Animal</b> Health (OIE) <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Animal</b> Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (OIE <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Animal</b> Health Code). 1 General Disease Information Sheets Where is the disease found?

25|$|Aerobic diving {{capacity}} {{is limited by}} available oxygen and {{the rate at which}} it is consumed. Diving mammals and birds have a considerably greater blood volume than <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> of similar size, and in addition have a far greater concentration of haemoglobin and myoglobin, and this haemoglobin and myoglobin is also capable of carrying a higher oxygen load. During diving, the haematocrit and haemoglobin are temporarily increased by reflex splenic contraction, which discharges a large additional amount of red blood cells. The brain tissue of diving mammals also contains higher levels of neuroglobin and cytoglobin than <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
30|$|The precise role of TCS on the {{selection}} of antibiotic resistance genes as well as multidrug resistance genes in the environment needs be elucidated. The concentration of TCS that is required for resistance selection in environmental communities also needs be worked out. The relationship between TCS exposure and bio-accumulation in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> is still inconclusive (Higgins et al. 2011) and would require expansive work which should include the kinetics of TCS conversion in the soils to its primary metabolite and uptake by such <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals</b> as earthworms and snails which among others are important in agriculture and nutrition.|$|R
40|$|What is Classical {{swine fever}}? Classical swine fever (CSF), {{also known as}} hog cholera, is a {{contagious}} viral disease of domestic and wild swine. It {{is caused by a}} virus of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, which is closely related to the viruses that cause bovine viral diarrhoea in cattle and border disease in sheep. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV). CSF is a disease listed by the OIE World Organisation for <b>Animal</b> Health (OIE) <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Animal</b> Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (OIE <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Animal</b> Health Code) ...|$|R

40|$|Finite {{difference}} calculations {{describing the}} impact mechanics {{associated with a}} 10 to 30 km diameter silicate or water object impacting a 5 km deep ocean overlying a silicate solid planet demonstrate that from 12 to 15 % of the bolide energy resides in the water. It is speculated that minimal global tsunami run-up heights on the continents would be 300 - 400 meters, and that such waves would inundate all low altitude continental areas, and strip and silt-over virtually all vegetation. As a result the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animal</b> food chain would be seriously perturbed. This could in turn cause extinction of large <b>terrestrial</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R
