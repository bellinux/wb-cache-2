25|$|Jarvis was a {{proposed}} American medium-lift launch vehicle for space launch, designed by Hughes Aircraft and Boeing during the mid-1980s {{as part of}} the joint United States Air Force (USAF)/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Advanced Launch System (ALS) study. Intended to utilize engines and tooling in storage from the Saturn V rocket program along with Space Shuttle components, and projected to be capable of carrying up to six satellites into multiple orbits using a single launch (e.g. <b>GPS</b> <b>constellation),</b> the proposal failed to meet the ALS requirements, and the Jarvis rocket was never built.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin {{appointed}} Schlesinger {{to be the}} Chairman of the National Space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Advisory Board.

2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the Jarvis vehicle was {{designed}} to use two Rocketdyne F-1 engines, powered by RP-1 rocket fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX); these were the same engines used by the Saturn V's first stage. The second stage would use a single Rocketdyne J-2 LOX/liquid hydrogen (LH2) engine, while the third stage was intended to utilise eight Marquardt R-4D reaction control system thrusters, fueled by a hypergolic mix of nitrogen tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine (N2O4/MMH), to provide final boost, and {{to allow for the}} deployment of multiple payloads into different orbits. Jarvis was designed to be capable of carrying payloads of up to [...] in diameter; as many as six satellites could be carried on a single rocket, and it was suggested that the Global Positioning System (<b>GPS)</b> <b>constellation</b> be deployed in this manner.|$|E

50|$|Decades later, {{during the}} early years of GPS, {{civilian}} surveying became one of the first fields to make use of the new technology, because surveyors could reap benefits of signals from the less-than-complete <b>GPS</b> <b>constellation</b> years before it was declared operational.

50|$|With {{the arrival}} of Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Satellite {{navigation}} has become accurate enough for altitude as well as positioning use, and is being used increasingly for instrument approaches as well as en-route navigation. However, because the <b>GPS</b> <b>constellation</b> is a single point of failure, on-board Inertial Navigation System (INS) or ground-based navigation aids are still required for backup.|$|E
