5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E

25|$|In the endgame, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to a race {{over who}} can checkmate the {{opponent}} first. A tactic known as speed counting {{plays an important}} role in the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.|$|E

25|$|To {{grip the}} ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam {{parallel}} to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and {{the third and fourth}} fingers close together and rest {{against the side of the}} ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.|$|E

500|$|Carlsen had an {{aggressive}} {{style of play}} as a youth, and, according to Agdestein, his play was characterised by [...] "a fearless readiness to offer material for activity". Carlsen found as he matured that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the world elite. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting much out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus {{making it harder for}} opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis. He has said the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to [...] "pure chess".|$|E
500|$|Karina Longworth notes how [...] "external" [...] Streep's {{performances}} are, [...] "chameleonic" [...] in her impersonation of characters, [...] "subsuming {{herself into}} them, rather than personifying them". In her early roles such as Manhattan and Kramer vs. Kramer, she {{was compared to}} both Diane Keaton and Jill Clayburgh, in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy. Streep has stated that many consider {{her to be a}} technical actor, but she professed that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to her love of reading the initial script, adding, [...] "I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable".|$|E

The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give {{me the opportunity to}} show people what I can really do." ...|$|E

Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action.

Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to." ...|$|E
500|$|Like the band's earlier releases, {{the album}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} guitar configurations as well as electronic synths. Erikson said that initially they gather with the standard guitar-bass-drum and keyboard gear, and as they pass around different ideas and implement them the songs take form in any which way a session takes them. [...] "Once we started on the album proper, it became a Garbage record, which is any number of approaches to writing a recording. There were no rules, certainly", he explained. A song like [...] "Automatic Systematic Habit" [...] features more electronics than guitars, and [...] "Big Bright World", a guitar-heavy song, involves configurations that make some of the guitars sound like synths. Guitar parts are normally divvied between guitarists Marker and Erikson. Erikson said <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to [...] "Whoever comes up with what at any given time. There's no job description as far as lead guitar/rhythm guitar. It's just whoever has an idea as a articular [...] moment. It's usually about 50/50".

Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an [...] "utter triumph", and writer Philip French of The Guardian {{noted in a}} review of the second film that [...] "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, what <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality." [...] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.|$|E
500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to what you hear. [...] She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E

Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake." ...|$|E

DeLonge learned of the crash via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight. He landed and mailed a letter and two photographs to Barker: a photo of Blink aboard a submarine in the Middle East and another of himself and his two kids. [...] "One was 'Do you remember who we were?' and the other was 'This is who I am now,' [...] " [...] DeLonge said DeLonge also commented that, no matter what happened between himself and Barker in the past, [...] "none of it matters when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to somebody getting hurt." [...] Hoppus first spoke on the matter in a blog post in November 2008, writing that he [...] "hadn't had it in him" [...] to post, adding that [...] "these past two months have been the hardest times I can remember." [...] He also revealed that he, DeLonge, and Barker had all spoken in the aftermath. Barker quashed reunion rumors in December, but noted that they had been getting along.|$|E

As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride.
