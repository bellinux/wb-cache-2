25|$|Catherine Elizabeth Middleton {{was born}} at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 to an upper-middle-class family. She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982. She is the eldest of three {{children}} born to Michael Middleton (b. 1949), and his wife, Carole (née Goldsmith; b. 1955), a former <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> and flight attendant, respectively, who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a mail order private company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of £30million. The family of her father Michael has ties to British aristocracy and benefited financially from trust funds which they had established over 100 years ago.|$|E
25|$|At 15:36, <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> J. Coleman {{presented}} the load sheet to Key whose request for engine start clearance was granted three minutes later. As {{the doors were}} about to close, Coleman asked Key to accommodate a BEA flight crew that had to collect a Merchantman aircraft from Brussels. The additional weight of the three crew members necessitated the removal of a quantity of mail and freight from the Trident to ensure its total weight (less fuel) did not exceed the permitted maximum of 41,730kg. This was exceeded by 24kg, but as there had been considerable fuel burnoff between startup and takeoff, the total aircraft weight (including fuel) was within the maximum permitted take-off weight.|$|E
25|$|On July 30, 1971, Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747 (registration: N747PA, name: Clipper America), struck {{navigational aids}} {{at the end}} of runway 1R on takeoff for Tokyo. The aircraft's landing gear and other systems were damaged. Two {{passengers}} were seriously injured by metal components of the runway approach light pier entering the cabin. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean to dump fuel to reduce weight for an emergency landing. Emergency services deployed at the airport, and the plane returned and landed on runway 28R. During landing the aircraft veered off the runway. There was no fire. After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of the additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard. An investigation determined that the cause of the accident was erroneous information from the <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> to the crew members regarding weight and runway length.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>dispatchers</b> in {{a typical}} airline are {{generally}} responsible for overseeing anywhere from 10 to 20 flights simultaneously, and are constantly planning new flights while monitoring current ones. <b>Flight</b> <b>dispatchers</b> {{are expected to have}} a big picture view of weather conditions, aircraft status, fuel planning, and other operational aspects of maintaining smooth airline operations. Because of the constantly changing nature of airline operations, <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers</b> experience a high level of stress in the workplace, as they balance operational constraints and pressures with the overriding safety mandate of the job.|$|R

500|$|With {{the attacks}} unfolding, air traffic {{officials}} began issuing warnings through the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS). Ed Ballinger, the United <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher,</b> began sending text cockpit warnings to United Airlines flights at 09:19, 17 minutes {{after he became}} aware of Flight 175's impact. As Ballinger was responsible for multiple flights, he did not send the message to Flight93 until 09:23. Ballinger received a routine ACARS message from Flight93 at 09:21. At 09:22, after learning of the events at the World Trade Center, LeRoy Homer's wife, Melody Homer, had an ACARS message sent to her husband in the cockpit asking if he was okay. At 09:24, Flight93 received Ballinger's ACARS warning, [...] "Beware any cockpit intrusion—two a/c [...] hit World Trade Center". At 09:26, Captain Jason Dahl sent an ACARS message back, [...] "Ed, confirm latest mssg plz —Jason". At 09:27:25, the flight crew responded to routine radio traffic from air traffic control. This was the last communication made by the flight crew before the hijacking.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> was {{informed}} that the local airspace would be traversed by military aircraft at an altitudes of [...] On the same day, at 16:00 and 16:01 local time two Tupolev Tu-16K left Zavitinsk air base for weather reconnaissance. At 16:21 local time one of them (serial number 6203106) collided with the Aeroflot An-24RV, 70 km east of Zavitinsk air base. The collision occurred in good lighting conditions, with a visibility of over 10km. Savitskaya was sound asleep at that moment. The Tu-16K razed off the An-24RV's roof and severed both wings. The temperature inside An-24RV's cabin dropped from [...] to [...] Both aircraft disintegrated and fell on taiga terrain. The fragments of Antonov An-24RV were scattered in a south-western direction, 1020 m from the collision point, on a 2500х900 m area. The Tu-16K exploded after the ground impact, its fragments were scattered approximately 2000 m from the collision point.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to attempt in Hong Kong to collect data about flight {{dispatch}} training for airlines. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the learning experiences of <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers</b> when using different learning approaches and instructional methods for learning. In the light of an analysis of the training practices linked to the theory of adult learning, self-directed learning, learning style and learning satisfactions, we can determine the beliefs, expectations, and desires of flight dispatch trainees. This thesis argues that effective flight dispatch training goes beyond traditional instructor-centred teaching strategies (pedagogical approach). The new way of thinking about teaching <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers</b> should also be based on adult learning theory and principles of andragogy. In addition, this thesis argues that flight dispatch training today is likely to be designed according to the needs and preferences of all stakeholders, rather than only according to the requirements of aviation regulators. The research questions are: What are <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers,</b> trainers and <b>flight</b> dispatch managers' perceptions and expectations regarding the use of instructional methods and strategies currently used in flight dispatch training? What are <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers,</b> trainers and <b>flight</b> dispatch managers' attitudes towards the use of computer-based training as an alternative instructional tool to replace classroom training? The research methodology adopted uses a mixed-method, sequential explanatory approach. Survey results have shown clear evidence that andragogy, self-directed learning and learning satisfaction play vital roles in the process of flight dispatch training. The results indicated that flight dispatchers' preferred mode of delivery is independent of their learning style, and classroom training had a more favorable reaction than did computer-based training, as demonstrated via quantitative and qualitative analyses. Those taking the computer-based course scored an average of 1. 53 (effectiveness) and 0. 65 (satisfaction) points lower than did those experiencing classroom training. The survey results did not support the findings from the literature that indicated all adults preferred self-directed learning. This study also included a qualitative analysis to address considerations of computer-based training as an alternative flight dispatch training delivery method. Although most trainees in the study said they preferred classroom training or on-the-job training, the majority felt that computer-based training was an appropriate delivery method to complement other, traditional methods of delivering flight dispatch training. Furthermore, the analysis of variances (ANOVA) for computer-based training satisfaction mean scores and generational group (novice and experienced <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers)</b> were calculated. The results indicated that flight dispatch experience did not influence levels of satisfaction. To enhance or increase the creativity, innovativeness, and learning capacity of the workforce, a well-balanced training approach between formal classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training should be encouraged in order to harness the advantages of both formal and informal learning...|$|R
50|$|A <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> (also {{known as}} an {{aircraft}} dispatcher, airline dispatcher, flight follower or flight operations officer) assists in planning flight paths, taking into account aircraft performance and loading, enroute winds, thunderstorm and turbulence forecasts, airspace restrictions, and airport conditions. Dispatchers also provide a flight following service and advise pilots if conditions change. They usually work in the operations center of the airline. In the United States and Canada, the <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> shares legal responsibility with {{the commander of the}} aircraft (joint responsibility dispatch system).|$|E

50|$|A {{licensed}} <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher</b> or {{flight operations}} officer is {{required by law to}} carry out flight planning and flight watch tasks in many commercial operating environments (e.g., US FAR §121, Canadian regulations). These regulations vary by country but more and more countries require their airline operators to employ such personnel.|$|E
50|$|In some jurisdictions of the US, similar {{duties and}} {{responsibilities}} are designated to flight followers. The main {{difference between the}} aircraft <b>dispatcher</b> and the <b>flight</b> follower is that the latter does not share legal responsibility for the operation of a flight. During the <b>flight,</b> the <b>dispatcher</b> is required to monitor and advise the crew of changes affecting safety of flight. In flight following, ultimate responsibility and operational control of the flight rests with the Pilot in command and Director of Operations (DO). Flight followers work for the Director of Operations and are tasked with carrying out operational control functions. Flight followers {{are not required to}} attain a <b>flight</b> <b>dispatcher's</b> certificate, although they are usually encouraged to do so.|$|R
5000|$|Airline {{ground crew}} members include: {{airframe}} and powerplant technicians, avionics technicians, ramp agents, customer service agents, and <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers.</b> Ground crew members {{are responsible for}} clearing the runway and gate area of any debris or garbage, {{in order to prevent}} foreign object damage by an object being sucked into an engine. The crew visually inspects the tarmac and removes any items found; this is typically called a [...] "FOD walk" [...] and is done prior to an aircraft's arrival and departure.|$|R
50|$|On {{congested}} routes, {{air traffic}} control may require that an aircraft fly lower or higher than optimum. The total weight of passengers and cargo might not be known {{at the time the}} flight plan is prepared. To allow for these situations a flight planning system may produce summaries showing how much fuel would be needed if the aircraft is a little lighter or heavier, or if it is flying higher or lower than planned. These summaries allow <b>flight</b> <b>dispatchers</b> and pilots to check if there is enough reserve fuel to cope with a different scenario.|$|R

In the latter case this is a clearance to the VOR (VHF beacon) serving the region, which continues to be named Torbay on all official aeronautical charts.. In addition to tradition, this usage avoids confusion with Saint John, New Brunswick, also in Atlantic Canada. Additionally the [...] "T" [...] in airport codes CYYT and YYT continues to reflect the Torbay origin.|$|R
