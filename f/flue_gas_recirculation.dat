40|$|<b>Flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> in the {{incinerator}} {{combustion chamber}} is an operative technique that offers substantial benefits in managing waste incineration.

Simulations of two incineration processes, with and without <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> have been carried out by using a commercial flowsheeting simulator. The results of the simulations demonstrate that, from an economic point of view, the proposed technique permits a greater level of energy recovery (up to + 3 %) and, at the same time, lower investment costs as far as the equipment and machinery constituting the air pollution control section of the plant are concerned. At equal treatment system efficiencies, the environmental benefits stem from the decrease in the emission of atmospheric pollutants.

40|$|This master thesis uses process {{modelling}} to investigate energy efficiency {{measures in the}} grate-kiln process for iron ore production; specifically, how waste heat contained in flue gas could be recirculated {{in order to achieve}} a decrease in specific fuel consumption. Consequently, fossil carbon emissions would be reduced as the grate-kiln units are fired with coal or oil. The implementation of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> is simulated with a process model in EBSILON Professional 10. 0. Process concepts which make use of available waste heat are developed and their impact on fuel usage, pellet temperature profiles and the magnetite oxidation process is evaluated. Aside from partial <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> a heat recovery concept is investigated. Both concepts are applied to decrease the fuel consumption by increasing the temperature and oxidation on the grate and to recover heat at a high temperature. To minimize the effect of recirculation and heat recovery on the pellet heat treatment process, concepts that use intercooling before the grate are also evaluated. The implementation of heat recovery affects the performance of the pellet cooler. The cooler’s operation is studied in detail with a cooler model developed in MATLAB. The cooler model is evaluated, and a sensitivity analysis is made to determine which parameters have a crucial impact on the pellet cooling. The results indicate that waste heat utilization can reduce the fuel consumption by up to 30 % if a heat exchanger is used. It was revealed that increased temperature into the cooler’s hottest section elevates the temperature levels on the grate, which lowers the fuel usage. Direct <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> lowers the oxygen content in the air passing the kiln and grate, which has a negative impact on the oxidation process and the overall heat balance.
