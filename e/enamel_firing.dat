40|$|Abstract. The {{as-rolled}} and enamel fired microstructure {{and mechanical}} properties of two low carbon steels with different compositions were analysed in the paper. The {{results show that}} the grains do not coarsen in lab firing process, and could be refined after industrial <b>enamel</b> <b>firing</b> process. The strength can keep stable in the firing process and the impact energy could be enhanced greatly under the industrial <b>enamel</b> <b>firing</b> process. The surface decarburized layer was occurred as a result of chemical reaction among the carbon in steel and water, oxides in the enamel frit...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the report {{is to find out}} what happens to <b>enamel</b> <b>fired</b> as a plique-à-jour. Why this happens, and how this {{information}} can be used for the production of plique-àjour- work. The dissertation only deals with basic processes within the subject, and is meant as a low-threshold introduction to the essentials in working with plique-à-jour. Only surface tension of the enamels is used as the sole aid, and none of the techniques that use temporary backing will be explored. Such techniques will be a natural step forward, following this exploration. The method of acquiring this information or, rather, the knowledge is a Practice as Research (PaR) methodology, which is based on actions that are largely regarded as implicit knowledge, and through critical reflection and contextualization are formulated and conveyed as explicit knowledge. The results show that extensive knowledge about the <b>firing</b> of the <b>enamels</b> from start to end, the different stages and properties associated with them, as well as temperature control, are the most important factors for understanding what happens when making plique-à-jour. Understanding the process gives the opportunity to influence the outcome in a positive direction depending on the situation, in an otherwise very volatile field...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} 120 W {{high power}} diode laser (HPDL) {{has been successfully}} used {{for the first time}} to <b>fire</b> an <b>enamel</b> glaze onto the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete. The enamel glazes were generated with laser power densities as low as 1 kW/cm 2 and at speeds of up to 780 mm/min, yielding a possible maximum coverage rate of 0. 34 m 2 /h. The enamel glazes were typically 750 m in thickness and displayed no discernible microcracks or porosities. Owing to the wettability characteristics of the OPC, it proved necessary to laser treat the OPC surface prior to <b>firing</b> the <b>enamel.</b> Mechanical testing of the HPDL <b>fired</b> <b>enamel</b> glazes revealed that the average rupture strength was 2. 8 J, whilst the rupture strength of the untreated OPC surface was some 4. 3 J. The average bond strength of the glaze was recorded as 2. 4 MPa as opposed to 6. 3 MPa for the untreated OPC. The HPDL <b>fired</b> <b>enamel</b> glazes exhibited exceptional wear and corrosion resistance, wearing by only 3. 3 mg/cm 2 after 8 h and showing no discernible morphological or microstructural changes when exposed to acid, alkali and detergent. In contrast, the untreated OPC surface was attacked almost immediately by the reagents used and was worn by 78 mg/cm 2 after 8 h. In addition, the HPDL <b>fired</b> <b>enamel</b> glaze afforded the concrete bulk complete resistance to water absorption. The findings of life assessment testing revealed that the HPDL <b>fired</b> <b>enamel</b> glaze effected an increase in the wear life of the concrete by 4. 5 to 52. 7 times over an untreated OPC surface, depending on the corrosive environment...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the lead}} oxide {{present in the}} yellow, green, and white enamel {{matrices}} acts as a flux reducing the enamels’ softening temperatures: the higher the amount of lead oxide, the lower the softening temperature of the enamel [7, 29]. Often referred to as low-fire or “soft” enamels [10, 19, 31], these lead-rich <b>enamels</b> can be <b>fired</b> at relatively low temperatures, well below the softening temperature of the blank itself. Because the blank is unlikely to deform, “soft” <b>enamels</b> can be <b>fired</b> onto a stationary object using a kiln. Conversely, high-fire or “hard” enamels, having no or low lead oxide content, must be fired at higher temperatures and for sufficient time to allow the enamels to fully fuse. For the furnace-firing of “hard” enamels, the decorated blank {{is attached to a}} pontil rod {{so that it can be}} rotated and, in some cases, shaped at the furnace to prevent the vessel from collapsing.|$|R

His Bristol pieces {{are the only ones}} he signed e.g., [...] "Pardoe Bristol". I assume that only the signatures that include the word [...] "fecit" [...] are ones he decorated, other inscriptions simply indicating retailing. According to Pountney the <b>enamel</b> was <b>fired</b> at the Temple Pottery. He also worked on glass, as the directory listing for 1813 describe him as a [...] "China and glass enameler and gilder, wholesale and retail". He also retailed pieces decorated at John Rose's factory, and probably from the rival Coalport factory operated by John's brother Thomas. Pardoe is particularly associated with botanical scenes.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} of porcelain enamelled products on an industrial scale first began in Germany in 1840. The method used was very primitive compared to modern methods: {{the product was}} heated to a very high temperature and dusted with <b>enamel,</b> then immediately <b>fired.</b> This frequently resulted in poor adhesion or a spotty coat; two coats were always required to achieve a continuous, corrosion-resistant surface. It could only be applied to cast- and wrought-iron, and only used for relatively simple products like pots and pans.|$|R

Above the counter, the name Rousseau is <b>enameled</b> with <b>fire</b> on a plaque. The jury awarded him a bronze medal (because Rousseau was merchant and not manufacturer). The gold medal was awarded to the manufacturers Lebeuf and Milliet. The service also boasted two novelties: the first was that everyone was free to compose his service according to his tastes and personal use. Rousseau suggested [...] "the barnyard for meat, Crustaceans for fish and flowers for dessert." [...] The second was that the service was adapted to wider circles: [...] "for its sumptuousness to the bourgeoisie, and for its aspect serving as a hunt for the nobility." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{decorated}} blank {{was fired}} to adhere the gilding and fuse the enamels. Although the softening temperatures of the enamels differ {{due to their}} varying lead contents, Mamluk glassmakers likely applied all colors together, affixing them with a single firing. The complex pontil mark visible {{on the bottom of}} the vessel indicates that a pontil was reattached to the decorated vessel to reintroduce the object into the furnace, technology consistent with Mamluk manufacture, as opposed to stationary kiln firing not practiced until the 19 th century. The apparent double, but not triple or quadruple, pontil mark on the Brooklyn Museum lamp supports the hypothesis that all decorative materials were simultaneously fired. Evidenced in the enamel samples analyzed, the lamp’s red and white enamels are intimately mixed despite their differing lead contents, suggesting that these “hard” and “soft” <b>enamels</b> were <b>fired</b> together. The occurrences of decorative material contaminants in the enamels, such as the tin-rich and iron-rich inclusions identified in the blue enamel and the lazurite particle in the white enamel, also suggest simultaneous application and firing of the various decorative materials.|$|R
40|$|The final color {{matching}} of porcelain crowns {{depends upon the}} accuracy of the original shade matching by the dentist and variables introduced during processing. Possible sources of processing variables include thickness and color of the opaque, thickness, color, and translucency of the body and <b>enamel</b> layers, <b>firing</b> temperature, and number of firings (Miller, 1987). These processing variables can lead to an error in shade match. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify, in CIE [Delta]E units: (1) the shade variations when the same batches are fired, (2) the shade variations between different batches, and (3) the differences in color produced by the multiple firing. Three lots of six shades of four commercial brands were included in this study. The color variation of the opaque samples (mean [Delta]E was 0. 46) was generally lower than that of the body/opaque samples (mean [Delta]E was 0. 86). The average color variation for three different batches of the body/opaque samples was 1. 44. The average color difference produced as a result of multiple firings was 1. 00 after six firings, compared with the color after three firings...|$|R
5000|$|The enamel lies {{flush with}} the gold surfaces; it was a {{preparation}} of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired.

40|$|Porcelain {{enameled}} 316 L {{stainless steel}} with different surface pretreatments {{was produced by}} a slurry-fusion technique for evaluation of the enamel/steel adherence using an electrical conductivity meter. From the measured results, {{it is found that}} the adherence of the porcelain enamel to the steel depends on the roughness of the enamel-steel interface, which, in turn, is controlled by surface pretreatments of the steel substrates. The difference in the adherence of the enameled steel can be explained from an examination of the microstructure of enamel-steel interfaces by scanning electron microscopy. Good adherence is associated with those specimens that have a long enamel-steel interface contour, i. e., rough interfaces. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis of the delaminated enamel fragments upon impact deformation reveals that failure of the enamel coatings in an oxidized steel occurred at the oxide-steel interface which is supposed to have strong chemical bonding, and that the oxide scales present before enameling are partially dissolved in the <b>enamel</b> during <b>firing.</b> The difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion among enamel, oxide, and steel is likely {{to play an important role}} in determining the failure mode of the enameled stainless steel. In summary, these results suggest that the adherence of the porcelain enamel to the 316 L stainless steel is mainly controlled by a mechanism of mechanical interlocking.

40|$|The Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England has {{recently}} installed a large-scale kiln for <b>firing</b> <b>enamel</b> on metal panels used in public art projects.
