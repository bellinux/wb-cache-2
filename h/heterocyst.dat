Cyanophycin synthetase and cyanophycinase are present at high levels in the <b>heterocysts.</b> Here we created a deletion mutant of gene all 3922 encoding isoaspartyl dipeptidase in the model heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.

Here we investigated whether these terminal <b>heterocysts</b> are the exclusive sites for dinitrogen fixation in C. raciborskii. The highest nitrogenase activity and NifH biosynthesis (western-blot) were restricted to the light phase of a 12 / 12 light/dark cycle.

Carbohydrate, probably in the form of glurose, is synthesized in vegetative cells and moves into heterocysts. In return, nitrogen fixed in heterocysts moves into the vegetative cells, at least in part in the form of amino acids.|$|E

Heterocysts function to convert environmental nitrogen (N2) into compounds such as ammonia or nitrate. Nitrogenase, an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, is essential to this conversion. For the proper functioning of nitrogenase, the intracellular environment of the <b>heterocyst</b> must be anaerobic, a task achieved by the oxygen-impermeable structure of the <b>heterocyst</b> wall.
