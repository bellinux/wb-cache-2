The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had <b>discussed</b> <b>it</b> with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar's usual composer, Devi Sri Prasad, {{was chosen}} for the film's soundtrack and score in Prasad's first Mahesh film. He went through the script and <b>discussed</b> <b>it</b> with Sukumar, who felt that Prasad {{translated}} his vision in the background score. Prasad finished re-recording the film's second half in four days. Eleven-year-old journalist Smrithika Thuhina's father was an {{associate director of the}} film, and Prasad emailed him the rhyme's tune with several stills from the scene; his daughter wrote the lyrics for the rhyme. P. Madhusudhan Reddy was the film's audiographer.|$|E
5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} <b>discussed</b> <b>it</b> {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who grow up under a totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997. Müller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|B. Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the {{production}} of Mane Thumbida Hennu (1958), the latter's directorial debut in Kannada cinema. As an act of gratitude, Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy. Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged person as her step-daughter's life partner. Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and <b>discussed</b> <b>it</b> with D. V. Narasa Raju; {{it was the first time}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film. After the script was ready, Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy. Pullaiah was not appreciative of Narasa Raju's treatment of the script and Nagi Reddy met his partner Aluri Chakrapani to develop the script further.|$|E
5|$|Maheshinte Prathikaaram {{is based}} on an {{incident}} in screenwriter Syam Pushkaran native village. During the filming of Aashiq Abu Idukki Gold (2013), Pushkaran <b>discussed</b> <b>it</b> with Abu's associate-director Dileesh Pothan, who decided to make his directorial debut with it. The idea for a film was developed; it was decided to set and shoot it in Idukki, since they believed it was a good location for a story about people living in the countryside. In August 2014, Fahadh Faasil was reported to star in the film, with Abu bankrolling it through his production house OPM Dream Mill Cinemas. It was Faasil's second film for Abu after 22 Female Kottayam (2012). Bijibal was signed as the film's composer and Shyju Khalid as its cinematographer. Filming was planned to start {{in the first week of}} December 2014. Maheshinte Prathikaaram was Pushkaran's first independent screenplay. In September 2014, Faasil was reported to join the project after completing Anwar Rasheed's Maniyarayile Jinnu. Because of Faasil's scheduling conflicts, production was postponed until early June 2015. It was postponed again when the actor was unavailable due to a conflict with Naale and Ayal Njanalla. Maheshinte Prathikaaram began production in early August 2015 for a planned Christmas release.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the {{settlement}} of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had <b>discussed</b> <b>it</b> with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, {{and he did not}} want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine <b>discussed</b> <b>it,</b> in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E
