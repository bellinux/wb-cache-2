5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>active,</b> ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E

5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E

They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during the conflict and took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports, including Tripoli. During World War I, Sardegna was used as a guard ship in Venice, while Re Umberto served as a floating battery in Brindisi and Sicilia was reduced to a depot ship.

The ship was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914–15, but the need for warships granted Ammiraglio di Saint Bon a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice and, after April 1916, was used primarily as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
