5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to college with {{the same sort of}} look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
500|$|It {{is a great}} outlet <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into the}} studio and write a song like 'Petals', {{which is one of}} my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E
500|$|According to Hughes, {{the scene}} at the Art Institute of Chicago was [...] "a self-indulgent scene of mine—which was a place of refuge for me, I went there quite a bit, I loved it. I knew all the paintings, the {{building}}. This was a chance <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back into this building and show the paintings that were my favorite." [...] The museum had not been shot in, until the producers of the film approached them. [...] "I remember Hughes saying, 'There {{are going to be more}} works of art in this movie than there have ever been before,'" [...] recalled Jennifer Grey.|$|E

500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 20 {{years and}} 73 days, Asenate Manoa was the {{youngest}} athlete to represent Tuvalu at the London Summer Games. She had previously participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Manoa qualified for the Games through a wildcard place because her fastest time of 13.82 seconds, recorded on 21 June 2011 in Apia, Samoa, was 2.44 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the women's 100 metres sprint. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph before the Games {{she said she had}} been nervous taking part in Beijing but was looking forward to participating in London. Manoa was drawn in the second heat of the preliminary round, finishing seventh out of eight runners, with a time of 13.48 seconds. Her time established a new Tuvaluan national record in the displicine. She was behind Nafissa Souleymane of Niger (12.81 seconds) but in front of Yemen's Fatima Dahman (13.95 seconds) in a heat led by Delphine Atangana from Cameroon (11.71 seconds). Manoa finished 73th overall out of 78 competitors, and was unable to progress into the first round after finishing 1.48 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in her heat who made the later stages. She was pleased with her performance, saying that she felt she could run quicker: [...] "I know what I need to work on, in order <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> faster and get another National Record. I hope everyone in Tuvalu is proud of me." ...|$|E

He told {{me that this was}} a better plan and found scholarship money <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to college." [...] Lamm also helped her overcome her family's initial misgivings.|$|E

He replied, [...] "I have no intention of leaving. It would be different if the players were saying it is time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but that is not the case." [...] On 1 May 2008, it was reported that Rijkaard allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as Barcelona manager {{at the end of the}} season, but 24 hours later, he stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the club.|$|E

2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year.

[...] It makes it possible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture with almost no changes. [...] In the old days I had to keep my nose to the grindstone continually so as to finish the eight pictures in time for the different directors for whom I was writing.|$|E
2500|$|Rodney Hogg was {{interested}} in touring South Africa. He met with Ali Bacher in London during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. [...] "I was pretty much in from day one," [...] said Hogg.

Had it been on in 1983, I'd have been less interested as I was still in the Test side and doing well at the time.... I was pretty happy with the money on offer. My career was pretty much over by then. Fast bowlers don't last forever. Prime minister [...] Hawke called us traitors.

2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go.

2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff.

2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer and I think she was eager <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People said to my mother, 'Are you letting that girl go to that awful place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
