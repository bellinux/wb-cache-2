40|$|It {{is known}} that during {{the last quarter of}} the 20 th century, transformations towards {{globalisation}} is realized. Such a process has the quality changing the utilization form of the political power. In other words it indicates to a positive progression in democratization. Especially tendencies of "localization" is widely adopted beginning from international agreements like the European Charter for Local Self-Government and <b>European</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Charter.</b> When localization is defined as the liberalization of the local-government from the hegemony of the central and subsidiarity with the participation and the control of the citizens, autonomy of the local governments gains importance. Parallel to this fact, a transformation from the government to governance is at the agenda of Turkey. In this sense, the concept of locality and its components (social/space wise processes locally originated) is revealed. Therefore, the continuity/conservation of cultural properties of a special place can not be managed with the continuity understanding of a central governmenti, as it can be mentioned that in conservation the economic/social/government aspects and even the lives of the users is substituted according to the needs of the day. Such a reality can only be known in place and be evaluated by the related citizens. The paper will include the situation in Turkiye in exemplary cases. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{foundation}} of modern local governments in Turkey was laid with an imperial edict in 1839. This reform also called Gulhane Hatt-i Hümayunu or Tanzimat Edict, {{paved the way}} for local and regional councils. Since the 1850 s, the municipalities have been established. However, {{it is not possible to}} talk about the functionality of these municipalities in current terms. Since the proclamation of the Turkish Republic, modern laws regulating local governments were issued. Village Law and Municipal Law are the first examples of these reformations. With the 1961 Constitution, modern participatory local government approach was adopted and mayors began to be elected directly by people for the first time. From 1960 to present, many local government reforms were made, but none of them were so fundamental as in 2012. With this reform, local government system has completely changed. Aim of this study is investigation of results of this reform and find out needs for a new wave of reform. New Metropolitan Municipalities Law is problematic in terms of local governance and local participation. Although European Charter of Local Self-Government and the <b>European</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Charter</b> paying special importance to citizen’s participation, last developments in Turkey as a European Union candidate continues in the opposite direction. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss all aspects of the new regulation. So that, field researches will be analyzed and recommendations will be presented in the light of these field studies relevant to the reforms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contends that}} {{participatory}} action and public engagement are crucial elements in tactical urbanism. Based on an action research workshop that he coordinated {{as part of}} an architectural design studio, the author argues that students, professionals and “the public” need to familiarize themselves with public involvement strategies and tactics in order to cope effectively with contemporary urbanism. The most overwhelming urban transformation since the 1992 <b>European</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Charter</b> has been an exacerbated socio-economic polarisation in cities. The resulting conditions of temporality, multiplicity and simultaneity deeply affect practices of place-making and urban coherence. Today’s fragile and ever-fleeting urban realities call for responses of the “lighter-quicker-cheaper” (LQC) type favoured by planning approaches commonly known as Tactical Urbanism or DIY Urbanism. Mastering these approaches – like any skill – requires practice. As an integral part of a design studio revolving around current and anticipated threats to Brussels’ urban cohesion, the one-week “crossing” workshop sought to integrate (action) research into architectural design and professional practice. It created an opportunity for students to design an on-site installation through which they could try out the vision they had elaborated after group-work analysis of a project site. It also allowed them to collect feedback and comments that could make their individual design firmly “rooted” in urban reality. These experiments did not necessarily seek to re-establish urban coherence: some merely sought to collect people’s ideas for change or attract their attention to discarded places. Whilst short-lived and modest, the interventions underlined the importance of small-scale, step-by-step approaches where neighbours get to know each other, work together and acquire a sense of ownership and pride in what they do. Moreover, they foreshadowed architects’ and urban professionals’ practices where students, neighbourhood dwellers and professionals join hands in realizing effective change. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Estimates using admissions lotteries {{suggest that}} <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools boost student achievement, while charter schools in other {{settings}} do not. Using the largest available sample of lotteried applicants to charter schools, we explore student-level and school-level explanations for this difference in Massachusetts. In an econometric framework that isolates sources of charter effect heterogeneity, we show that <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools boost achievement well beyond that of urban public school students, while non-urban charters reduce achievement from a higher baseline. Student demographics explain some of these gains since <b>urban</b> <b>charters</b> are most effective for non-whites and low-baseline achievers. At the same time, non-urban charter schools are uniformly ineffective. Our estimates also reveal important school-level heterogeneity within the <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> sample. A non¬-lottery analysis suggests that <b>urban</b> <b>charters</b> with binding, well-documented admissions lotteries generate larger score gains than under-subscribed <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools with poor lottery records. Finally, we link charter impacts to school characteristics such as peer composition, length of school day, and school philosophy.

Ineffective collaborative leadership practices may lead to achievement deficits particularly for many <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools operated by educational management organizations. The purpose of this case {{study was to explore}} collaborative leadership practices educational management organization leaders need to assist school principals in low-performing K- 12 <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools to improve academic achievement. Guided by Fiedler 2 ̆ 7 s contingency theory, this case study explored the successful collaborative leadership practices of educational management organization leaders and school principals in a midwestern <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> school to improve academic achievement.

40|$|Researchers {{have noted}} that {{educational}} manager and instructional leadership roles are vital to achieving sustainable student achievement. Ineffective leadership practices may decrease students 2 ̆ 7 academic success and are a continuous concern for educators, especially for those of <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore practices that leaders of <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> middle schools have implemented to advance their schools from a priority school to a focus school designation. This multiple case study sought to identify and clarify leadership practices of successful leaders in <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> middle schools. Leithwood and Riehl 2 ̆ 7 s core leadership practices model served as the basis for understanding successful leadership practices in 3 Midwestern <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> middle schools that progressed from a priority school to a focus school category. Data included semistructured interviews with 3 principals, 3 focus groups with a total of 16 teachers, and a review of relevant documents at each school. Data analysis entailed coding and theming significant statements for emerging patterns related to successful leadership practices until reaching data saturation. Emerging themes included leadership practices, professional development, student academic achievement, parental involvement, and redesigning the schools. Findings from this study resonate with Leithwood and Riehl 2 ̆ 7 s leadership model and indicate the efficacy of core leadership practices to meet state and national guidelines.

40|$|Retaining {{effective}} teachers in today 2 ̆ 7 s classrooms, {{especially those in}} urban schools, remains a priority for school leaders. While the charter school movement is intended to address many challenges faced by traditional urban public schools, {{research has indicated that}} retaining {{effective teachers}} may be even more challenging for charter schools. To better support the teaching and learning within <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools, including the achievement of the students, it is necessary to better understand the decisions made by teachers who work in those schools. ^ Grounded in phenomenology and using narratives, this research explores the individual experiences of seven teachers working in <b>urban</b> public <b>charter</b> schools and how those experiences influenced the resilience of these teachers to continue working in their classrooms. The teachers who participated were interviewed extensively about their own education to their decision to become a teacher to their experiences in the classroom. While differences such as years of teaching, education, and demographic information are present among the seven teachers, similar experiences related to their work in <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools became apparent. This research was an exploration of the complex nature of teachers 2 ̆ 7 experiences working in <b>urban</b> public <b>charter</b> schools and complicated the picture of how perceptions held by these teachers were either reinforced or challenged, especially those related to self, urban schools and the students and families in those schools. ^ Based on the data, the themes that emerged about a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s decision to remain at a particular school, as well as perceptions related to working in an <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> school, were: (a) the school environment created by school leaders, especially around professional development; (b) the influence of relationships with both colleagues and students; and (c) the importance of having multiple opportunities to productively struggle and reflect on issues related to difference and identity. Working to understand the decisions and resilience of teachers related to working in an urban school, including exploring any held perceptions, charter school leaders, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of teacher education may aid in learning how to better influence the decisions of teachers to remain at these <b>urban</b> <b>charter</b> schools, and therefore, increase rates of retention. ...|$|R
