500|$|All {{acknowledged}} subject {{experts and}} authorities {{agree that there}} is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of [...] "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.|$|E

5000|$|The French news website Rue 89 {{commented that}} the episode {{provided}} <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> with {{a good opportunity to}} mock all the French clichés, including the accent, the cheese, the cheek kissing between men, and the supposed nymphomania.

5000|$|Historically, {{because of}} the amount of leisure time and {{education}} required to write extensive works like novels, most novelists have come from communities with large economic or cultural capital, such as the upper classes or college educated middle class. However, some groups of novelists made their reputation as being from the working classes, and thus are treated as representing that portion of <b>the</b> population. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> identified as <b>the</b> [...] "Angry young men" [...] of the 1950s in British literary circles, included a number of novelists, such as Alan Sillitoe and Kingsley Amis, whose background, identity as authors, and literary subject matter focused on the working classes and had foundations in working class culture.|$|R

5000|$|The {{solutions}} the Meridionalists proposed varied considerably due {{to their}} different viewpoints and political affiliations. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> and politician Napoleone Colajanni (1847-1921), a positivist and socialist, supported state intervention in the south {{as the only way}} to develop the area.

500|$|The plots for Bedsitcom were {{devised by}} a team of writers (led by Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and {{producer}} Matt Crook) located in a garage {{on the ground floor of}} the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. <b>The</b> <b>writers</b> would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was.

30|$|The level {{refers to}} the {{distance}} of the revisions from the point of text production.

50|$|After {{the use of}} Latin as an {{everyday}} language died out, even among scholars, the Holy See has for some centuries usually drafted papal other documents in a modern language, but the authoritative text, the one published in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, generally appears in Latin, even if the translation is available only later. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> of <b>the</b> Catechism of the Catholic Church drafted it in French, the language in which it appeared in 1992. The Latin text appeared only five years later, in 1997, and the French text was corrected to match the Latin version.

50|$|As it's {{discussed}} in the above sections, Sheikh Muhammad Rashid had stopped the regular teaching sessions because of health problems.

500|$|Writing {{segments}} for [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] {{was much}} different from normal episodes; <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> only had one day to outline each segment's plot, and three to four days to write {{the first draft of}} each script, which is much less time than <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> usually get for an episode.

[...] "We wanted to cram in every single [...] as we could", Selman said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} journalistic {{translation}} was the newspaper The Swedish Intelligencer, created by William Watts.

50|$|Pokrov Cemetery became Riga's Russian community's main cemetery. The base of this commune {{had been}} {{established}} from centuries of Russian families living in the land, as well as cultural workers and scientists escaping the USSR in the early half of the 20th century. The members of community held the cemetery in high standing, <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> former <b>writer</b> and commandant of Daugavgrīva stronghold Jurijs Gončarenko-Galičs secured himself {{a spot in the}} cemetery before shooting himself knowing that after Soviet occupation he would be harshly prosecuted.|$|R
5000|$|Bowser created her own company, Sister Lee Productions, which {{produced}} or co-produced her later shows, Living Single and Half & Half.

50|$|Because oral {{interpretation}} {{is an essential}} dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are interpreters - but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on. When, <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> David Sedaris reads one of his stories on stage, or when Leonard Cohen performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged {{in the art of}} oral interpretation. But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that he is no singer.|$|E
50|$|Practitioners in {{this field}} believe psychological, social, {{cultural}} and political forces support the splitting and fragmentation of the mind-body unity. These pressures affect an individual’s mental, biological, and relational health. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> Alice Miller in her recent book 'The Body Never Lies' says, Ultimately the body will rebel. Even {{if it can be}} temporarily pacified with the help of drugs, cigarettes or medicine, it usually has the last word because it is quicker to see through self-deception than the mind. We may ignore or deride the messages of the body, but its rebellion demands to be heeded because its language is the authentic expression of our true selves and of the strength of our vitality.|$|E
5|$|The tablets were {{produced}} in periods 2 and 3 (c.AD92–103), {{with the majority}} written before AD102. They were used for official notes about the Vindolanda camp business and personal affairs of the officers and households. The largest group is correspondence of Flavius Cerialis, prefect of the ninth cohort of Batavians {{and that of his}} wife, Sulpicia Lepidina. Some correspondence may relate to civilian traders and contractors; <b>for</b> <b>example</b> Octavian, <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> of Tablet 343, is an entrepreneur dealing in wheat, hides and sinews, but this does not prove him to be a civilian.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{this modern}} {{origin of the}} popular phrase, the {{sentiment}} has been expressed by earlier <b>writers.</b> <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>writer</b> Ivan Turgenev wrote (in Fathers and Sons in 1861), [...] "The drawing shows me at one glance what might be spread over ten pages in a book." [...] The quote is sometimes attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, who said [...] "A good sketch {{is better than a}} long speech" [...] (Un bon croquis vaut mieux qu'un long discours).

This act is popularly said to be the beginnings of Rugby football, but the evidence for this bold act does not stand up to close examination and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. In older forms of football, handling the ball was allowed, or even compulsory; <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> English <b>writer</b> William Hone, writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir Frederick Morton Eden, regarding [...] "Foot-Ball", as played at Scone, Scotland: ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in France since the French Third Republic (1870).

5000|$|In {{the course}} of time the {{population}} has grown. In 1960, Heerhugowaard had 6,800 inhabitants; this number became 25,000 in 1975, 47,239 in 2004 and 48,267 in 2005. In May 2007, Heerhugowaard welcomed its 50,000th inhabitant. Currently, Heerhugowaard has approximately 55,000 inhabitants. For several years in the 1970s, Heerhugowaard was the fastest growing municipality in the Netherlands. It is intended that Heerhugowaard eventually will have at least 60,000 inhabitants. The general expectation is that around 2050, Heerhugowaard will be the size of the nearby located City of Alkmaar, and will have approximately 100,000 inhabitants. There are problems with retaining the youth however, so that this number might never be reached. As young people leave their parents' homes, they prefer to move to other places such as Alkmaar or Amsterdam. The major part of the inhabitants lives in so-called Vinex-districts. The rural core of the North lies in the Middenwaard. The core of the south is at Stationsweg by the old church. In the polders there are small hamlets. The greater part of the town is new developments. The best rural core is in the villages of Centrumwaard and De Noord. Heerhugowaard has a small shopping area in Centrumwaard, and a large shopping centre in the district of Middenwaard. There is a cinema. Since 2004 there has been a coffee shop in Heerhugowaard. This coffee shop however, has met with fierce opposition from some of the local population, who have bombarded the coffee shop with stones several times. The other part realizes this establishment is there to make sure the laws are respected (e.g. no sales to 18- [...] ) and to make sure there is no cross pollination between soft and hard drugs. Heerhugowaard has a number of subdivisions which were set up the same as in Almere, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> district, the tree district, the planet district, and the nature area of Butterhuizen. In two of the newest districts, called Stad van de Zon I and II (= City of the Sun I and II) the energy supplies for a considerable part comes from solar energy. Within a couple of years Heerhugowaard will have a large medical centre. The old hospital in the city of Alkmaar will be rebuilt in Heerhugowaard, adjacent to the N242.|$|E
5000|$|Eblana is {{the name}} of an ancient Irish {{settlement}} which appears in the Geographia of Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy), the Greek astronomer and cartographer, around the year 140 AD. It was traditionally believed by scholars to refer to the same site as the modern city of Dublin. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> 19th-century <b>writer</b> Louis Agassiz used Eblana as a Latin equivalent for Dublin. More recent scholarship however favours the north County Dublin seaside village of Loughshinny due to its proximity to Drumanagh, an important trading site with strong links to Roman Britain; it has even been described as a bridgehead of a possible Roman invasion. There is no definitive proof to tie Eblana with any location, however, so its exact identity is still a matter of speculation.|$|R
50|$|Herbs {{and other}} plants were used heavily in the {{delivery}} process, a practice also linked to religious belief. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> a drink sprinkled with powdered sow’s dung was given to relieve labor pain, and fumigation with the fat from a hyena was thought to produce immediate delivery.
