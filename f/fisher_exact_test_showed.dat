40|$|Abstract BackgroundYazd {{province}} {{which is}} the host of local and foreign immigrants may be faced with contacting malaria. Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major cause of mortality throughout in the tropical regions of the world. Pthophysiologic mechanisms of anemia in malaria is such as direct invasion of Red cells, anemia of chronic disease hypersplenism, Hemophagocytic syndrome and erythrophagocytosis, dyserythropoirsis, immune haemolysis and cytokine deregulation anemia of chronic disorder is characterized by moderate to mild normocytic, normochromic anemia along with microcytic hypochromic cells. Malaria occurs predominantly in children in {{the first three years of}} life. The purpose of this study was Demographic study of malaria during 2008 to 2012 in Yazd. Materials and MethodsThis study was an analytic-descriptive and manner descriptive study. All episodes (Imported Malaria) of disease from 2008 to 2012 which were documented in Yazd Central Health Service were carefully studied and reported. ResultsA total of 206 confirmed reported malaria patients from 2008 to 2012 were studied; Plasmodium (P). vivax species was mostly, 187 (90. 78 %) and Plasmodium (P). Malaria species was Lesley, 1 (0. 49 %). The mean age groups, accommodation with local malaria and years of reported outbreaks of different strains of the parasite conducted by <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>Test,</b> <b>showed</b> no significant difference(P-value> 0. 05), but the mean of foreigner immigrants of outbreaks of different strains of the parasite conducted by <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>Test,</b> <b>showed</b> significant difference (P-value= 0. 01). ConclusionAlthough malaria has been designed on elimination program in Iran, but in the province of Yazd is reported imported malaria and its importance in causing anemia and other blood disorders is not negligible...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare PA and CBCT healing after EMS using MTA or ERRM as root-end filling {{materials}} in a randomized clinical trial. Materials and Methods: EMS was performed on patients with persistent or recurrent AP. The root-end filling material was randomly assigned. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled 6 months, 1 and 2 years. PA and CBCT were taken and the tooth was investigated clinically. Results: Regardless of the material, the overall PA and CBCT success rates were 95. 6 % and 89. 1 % respectively with no statistical significant difference. Evaluating each material separately, MTA success rate was 95. 5 % and 89. 3 % as assessed by PA and CBCT respectively. ERRM success rate was 95. 8 % and 88. 7 % as assessed by PA and CBCT respectively. <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> no statistical significant difference between the 2 materials. Pre-operative prognostic factors such as microsurgical classification, presence of cortical, size of lesion and root canal filling quality had significant effect on outcome. Follow-up factors such as alignment and depth of filling material and root fractures also had significant effect on outcome. Conclusion: The null hypothesis is accepted: there is no statistical significant difference in EMS outcome using RRM or MTA as retro-filling material. However, certain factors were found to have a significant association with outcome...|$|E
40|$|Essential thrombocythemia (ET) {{may occur}} in {{women of childbearing}} age. To {{investigate}} the risk of pregnancy complications, we studied 103 pregnancies that occurred in 62 women with ET. The 2 -tailed <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that pregnancy outcome was independent {{from that of a}} previous pregnancy. The rate of live birth was 64 %, and 51 % of pregnancies were uneventful. Maternal complications occurred in 9 %, while fetal complications occurred in 40 % of pregnancies. The Mantel-Haenszel method showed that fetal loss in women with ET was 3. 4 -fold higher (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3 - 3. 9; P F) mutation, and a multivariate logistic regression model identified this mutation as an independent predictor of pregnancy complications (P =. 01). Neither the platelet count nor the leukocyte count was a risk factor. JAK 2 (617 V>F) -positive patients had an odds ratio of 2. 02 (95 % CI: 1. 1 - 3. 8) of developing complications in comparison with JAK 2 (617 V>F) -negative patients. Aspirin did not prevent complication in JAK 2 (617 V>F) -positive patients and appeared to worsen outcome in JAK 2 (617 V>F) -negative patients. A relationship was found between JAK 2 (617 V>F) and fetal loss (P =. 05).

40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{kidney disease}} is a slow, progressive, and {{irreversible}} deterioration in renal function. Ultimately, it leads to end stage renal disesase which in this condition need for haemodialysis therapy to replace renal function. The coping of patient who undergo haemodialysis therapy {{is very important to}} promote the success of the therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out the correlation between coping and quality of life in chronic haemodialysis patient. Method: This study was a cross sectional study. The sample were 13 patients with chronic kidney disease who undergo haemodialysis therapy. Samples were taken by purposive sampling. Independent variable was coping, and the dependent variable was quality of life. The data were collected using questionnaire and analyzed using chi square test or fisher exact test as alternative test from chi square test. Result: The result showed that most of respondents had adaptive coping and good quality of life. The result of <b>fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that p = 0, 038 (p < 0. 05), it means that there was significant correlation between coping and quality of life of patient with chronic kidney disease who undergo haemodialysis therapy.

Further studies are recommended to extend this research using another design and sampling, and observe physical and laboratory examination for measuring quality of life to get better understanding...|$|E
40|$|Objective Traditionally, direct {{laryngoscopy}} confirms {{stage and}} tissue diagnosis prior to treatment planning. Patients who are frail or have tenuous airway anatomy may incur risks while undergoing anesthesia. Further, direct laryngoscopy is scheduled after initial examination, introducing diagnosis delay. This study investigates {{the impact of}} ultrasound examination with guided needle biopsy compared with traditional operative biopsy. Study Design Case series. Setting Tertiary head and neck clinic. Subjects and Methods The records of patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Memphis and Regional One Health who had supraglottic, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer that was diagnosed by ultrasound needle biopsy were reviewed from 2011 to 2016. Demographics, stage, biopsy results, and treatment were abstracted. Results Seventeen patients who underwent ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the primary site were included. Average age was 63 years old, and 65 % of patients were stage T 4 (11 / 17). Needle biopsy yielded malignant cells in 76 % (13 / 17). Eleven patients were included in subsequent analysis because 6 patients underwent needle biopsy only. <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> {{no difference between the}} 2 methods (P =. 27). Sensitivity was 86 % and specificity was 100 %. Seven patients had a median potential delay in diagnosis of 10 days. Conclusions Ultrasound can be used effectively to obtain a tissue diagnosis, circumventing an operative biopsy. Moreover, ultrasound may provide additional imaging details to support accurate staging. This strategy may prove worthwhile to cut costs and reduce delay to staging, reduce risk for those with contraindications to anesthesia, and increase staging accuracy via enhanced imaging details...|$|E
40|$|Background: Stunting {{according}} to World Health Organization’s standard is a linear growth failure {{identified by the}} Z-score value of proportioned height by age (Body Height/Age) that less than - 2 of standard deviation. Indonesia has the fifth largest number of stunted children {{in the world right}} after India, Nigeria, Pakistan and China. Posyandu service utilization is one of stunting determinants. A number of visits and the activity of infants in using Posyandu services will help the observation of children’s health and nutrition status. Through thoroughly observation chronically malnourished and stunting could be earlier identified, thus the growth failure could be prevented. Objective: to identify the stunting proportion difference of 12 - 24 months children {{according to}} Posyandu services use. Method: Study was conducted by using an observational method and cross-sectional research design. Subjects of study are 12 - 24 month children in Jayapura Regency. Cluster random sampling method was used to identify 313 children as samples. Observation data was analyzed by using chi-square test and fisher exact test due to a not normally distributed population.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{catheter}} material on intravenous catheterisation complications in horses are unknown. This study evaluated {{the presence of}} bacterial colonisation on Teflon® and polyurethane short term intravenous catheters in healthy adult horses undergoing elective surgery. Horses on admission for elective surgery were randomly allocated according to catheter type. Sixteen horses received Teflon® catheters and 19 received polyurethane. Aseptic catheter placement and removal was standardised, however systemic antibiotic treatment was case dependant and at the clinician’s discretion. To simulate routine clinical practice, face masks were not worn during placement nor were the catheters bandaged. Catheters were maintained for 74 hours and assessed for clinical evidence of catheter site reaction, phlebitis or thrombosis twice daily. Bacteria were cultured from 69 % of Teflon® and 89 % of polyurethane catheters. Multiple isolates were found in 31 % of Teflon® and 42 % of polyurethane catheters The <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> {{no difference between the}} proportion of catheters with colonisation (P= 0. 28) or multiple isolates (P= 0. 76).

Methods: A descriptive study {{was conducted on the}} adequacy of food commercials directed to children and aired by six pay-television broadcasters according to two parameters: "The Food Guide for the Brazilian Population, 2014 ", and the National Council on Children's and Adolescents' Rights Resolution nº 163 of 2014 about food advertising. The advertisements were recorded in July 2015, at different times and days of the week. Results: One hundred and sixty-two hours were recorded, registering 3, 468 commercials: 1, 850 were related to internal programming and 1, 618 advertised toys (22. 15 %), food and beverages (5. 61 %), applications for electronic devices (5. 58 %), and entertainment/events (5. 56 %). The <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> fewer number of food commercials compared to other types of commercials (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: The study evaluates whether facial {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} an appropriate laryngoscope blade length for oral endotracheal intubation in children. We tested the hypothesis that the laryngoscope blade measuring 10 mm or less distal or proximal to the angle of the mandible (when the flat portion of the blade follows the facial contour from the upper incisor teeth to the angle of the mandible) will demonstrate greater success and ease of oral tracheal intubation. Methods: In an observational and prospective study, 60 children 8 years old or younger were undergoing direct laryngoscopy for oral endotracheal intubation in the operating room, were enrolled in the study. Intubation at first time considered successful and intubation with more than one attempt considered unsuccessful. Ease and success of oral tracheal intubation were compared with distance measurements from the angle of the mandible to the tip of the laryngoscope blade. Blade lengths considered too short (blade lengths > 10 mm proximal to the angle of the mandible) and too long extending longer than 10 mm past the angle of the mandible. Finding: Only 66 % of the intubations using the shorter blade were performed on the first attempt as compared with 88. 3 % of the intubations using the recommended length or 81. 2 % of the intubations using blades extending longer than 10 mm past the angle of the mandible (Chi-square, p= 0. 02). <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that recommended blade was more successful than longer blade (p= 0. 048). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that facial landmarks seem to be excellent clinical criteria for laryngoscope blade length selection for pediatric intubations.

40|$|Background: Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), {{and their}} complications, cause serious health problems, which affect {{millions}} of people every year. Infections of the urinary tract are {{the second most common}} type of infection in the body and approximately 20 % of women are especially prone to UTIs for reasons not yet well understood. Urinary Tract Infections in men are not as common as in women yet can be very serious when they do occur. Accurate identification of bacterial isolates is an essential task of the clinical microbiology laboratory. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the incidence and variety of the causative microbial agents of UTIs in patients who had referred to a medical laboratory of Kashani and Hajar hospital in Shahrekord, Iran. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 147 urine samples of patients (urine test results were positive for UTIs) were examined during April to September 2013. A total of 147 urine samples of patients with clinical symptoms of UTI who had been referred to a medical laboratory of Kashani and Hajar hospital in Shahrekord (Iran), were collected and processed immediately for laboratory analysis. Results: Escherichia coli was identified as the most common causative agent of UTIs (51. 70 % of total isolates in both sexes), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. Pneumoniae) (16. 32 %). Frequency of Proteus spp., Acinetobacter spp., Entrobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Providencia spp. was 10. 88 %, 6. 12 %, 5. 44 %, 4. 08 %, 3. 40 % and 2. 04 %, respectively. Statistical analysis by <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that there was no significant relationship between the type of bacteria and gender (P > 0. 05). Chi square test showed that there was no significant relationship between the type of bacteria and the use of catheter and age group (P > 0. 05). However, there was a significant relationship between the type of bacteria and the history of hospitalization (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: Our findings implied that a wide range of bacteria could be involved in creating urinary tract infection in patients referred to a medical laboratory of Kashani and Hajar hospital in Shahrekord, Iran. Regardless of age, sex and the use of catheter, a wide range of bacteria could be involved in urinary tract infections...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a express??o imuno-histoqu??mica do MAGE (Y- 18) em LPM e malignas de pacientes com e sem fator de risco associado, bem como verificar a variabilidade interexaminadores na classifica????o histol??gica das displasias epiteliais orais. Foram utilizadas amostras inclu??das em parafina de 20 casos de displasia severa/{{carcinoma}} in situ e 20 casos de CEC intraoral, sendo que em cada grupo as amostras estavam distribu??das entre pacientes com e sem fator de risco associado ?? ocorr??ncia da les??o (tabaco e ??lcool). A express??o imuno-histoqu??mica positiva de MAGE (Y- 18) foi definida por um padr??o de colora????o citoplasm??tico, sendo utilizado um sistema de pontua????o considerando a homogeneidade da rea????o. Para classificar as displasias epiteliais orais, 75 casos de les??es orais potencialmente malignas foram selecionados de um servi??o de refer??ncia em patologia bucal. Tr??s patologistas analisaram as l??minas de forma independente e cega em dois momentos. Na primeira etapa foram disponibilizadas aos examinadores as l??minas coradas em H&E juntamente com as informa????es cl??nicas de cada caso e os patologistas classificaram as les??es em sem displasia, displasia leve, moderada, severa ou carcinoma in situ. Na segunda etapa, os avaliadores n??o tiveram acesso ??s informa????es cl??nicas e classificaram as l??minas em duas categorias: baixo risco (les??o n??o displ??sica/displasia leve) e alto risco (displasia moderada/severa/carcinoma in situ). A an??lise das rea????es imuno-histoqu??micas demonstrou positividade em 4 / 20 LPM e 17 / 20 CEC. Pelo teste de Kruskall-Wallis observou-se diferen??a estatisticamente significativa (p< 0, 05) entre os grupos de CEC e o grupo das les??es potencialmente malignas sem fator de risco. O teste de Mann-Whitney verificou diferen??a estatisticamente significativa entre os carcinomas e as les??es potencialmente malignas (p< 0. 001). O teste Exato de Fischer n??o demonstrou diferen??a estatisticamente significativa entre as les??es de mesmo diagn??stico histol??gico quando comparadas nos subgrupos de fator de risco associado (p= 1). Nossos resultados sugerem que a detec????o do ant??geno MAGE pode ser ??til na identifica????o de LPM com maior risco de progress??o para o CEC invasivo, mas parece n??o ter rela????o com a exposi????o aos fatores de risco mais conhecidos. Quando na classifica????o das displasias, independente do sistema de classifica????o utilizado, a concord??ncia entre os avaliadores e o padr??o ouro variou de fraca a moderada. Na primeira etapa, o Coeficiente de Correla????o Intraclasse demonstrou uma concord??ncia moderada entre os avaliadores 1 e 3 (r= 0, 479 e r= 0, 544) e uma concord??ncia baixa do avaliador 2 (r= 0, 384). No segundo momento observou-se uma concord??ncia moderada entre os examinadores 2 e 3 e o padr??o ouro (k= 0, 433 e k= 0, 422) e uma baixa concord??ncia entre o avaliador 1 e o padr??o ouro (k= 0, 186). Tendo em vista que a gradua????o da displasia ?? um processo subjetivo, e que ainda n??o dispomos de nenhum exame que supere a observa????o histol??gica no diagn??stico das displasias epiteliais orais, entendemos que o processo de gradua????o entre dois ou mais observadores deve ser incentivado, a fim de auxiliar na defini????o mais precisa do diagn??sticoThis study aims {{to evaluate}} the immunohistochemical expression of antibodie MAGE-(Y 18) in potentially malignant oral lesions and malignant lesions in patients with or without factor risk, and also to check the interexaminers variability on histological classification of oral epithelial dysplasia. Paraffin-embedded samples of 20 cases of severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and 20 cases of intraoral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) {{were used in the}} study, and in both groups the samples had been distributed between patients with and without other risk factors associated with the occurrence of injury (tobacco and alcohol). The positive immunohistochemical expression of MAGE(Y- 18) was defined by a cytoplasmic staining pattern, and it was used a scoring system considering the homogeneity of the reaction. In order to verify the interexaminer variability when performing a histological classification of oral epithelial dysplasia, 75 cases of potentially malignant oral lesions were selected from a referral service in oral disease. Slides were read independently and blindly by three pathologists in two stages. In the first stage it was made available to examiners the slides stained with H & E along with the clinical information of each case, and pathologists had to classify the lesions: no dysplasia, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. In the second stage, it was not given access to clinical information to the examiners, and they had to classify slides into two categories: low risk (non-dysplastic lesions / mild dysplasia) and high risk (moderate or severe dysplasia / carcinoma in situ).. The results were positive in 4 / 20 PML and 17 / 20 SCC. Through the Kruskal-Wallis test, it was observed a statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) between groups of CPB and the group of potentially malignant lesions (PML) without the risk factor. The Mann-Whitney test found a statistically significant difference between carcinomas and potentially malignant lesions (p< 0. 001). The <b>Fisher</b> <b>Exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> no statistically significant difference between the lesions that had the same histological diagnosis when compared in subgroups of associated risk factor (p= 1). Detection of MAGE antigen may be useful in identifying LPM that has a higher risk of progression to invasive SCC, but it seems to be unrelated to exposure to popular risk factors The agreement between the examiners and the gold standard ranged from low to moderate, regardless of the classification system that was used. In the first stage, the intraclass correlation coefficient showed a moderate agreement between examiners 1 and 3 (r = 0. 479 and r = 0. 544) and, a low agreement of the examiner 2 (r = 0. 384). In the second phase, it was observed a moderate agreement between examiners 2 and 3 and the gold standard (k = 0. 433 k = 0. 422) and, a low concordance between the examiner 1 and the gold standard (k = 0. 186). Taking into account that grading dysplasia is a subjective process and still there is no test that outperforms the histological observation on diagnosis of oral epithelial dysplasia, it is understood that the process of grading made by two or more examiners should be encouraged, in order to assist in defining more precisely the diagnostic...|$|E

Seventy cervical restorations (35 resin composite - RC- restorations and 35 RMGIC restorations) were placed by a single operator in 30 patients under rubber dam isolation without mechanical preparation. All restorations were evaluated blindly by 2 independent examiners using the modified USPHS criteria at baseline, and after 6, 12 and 24 months. Data were analyzed statistically by <b>Fisher's</b> <b>exact</b> and McNemar <b>tests.</b> After 2 years, 59 out of 70 restorations were evaluated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of home-use {{bleaching}} agents containing 10 % carbamide peroxide and 7. 5 % hydrogen peroxide on enamel microhardness and surface micromorphology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enamel slabs (n= 10) received the bleaching agents for 1 h/day and remained in artificial saliva solution for 23 h/day, during a total period of 21 days. Control group was composed of enamel slabs that were not subjected to treatment with the agents and were maintained in artificial saliva solution. Microhardness tests were performed before treatment application, 21 days of treatment and 14 days after the end of treatment. Scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed after 14 days after the end of bleaching treatment by 3 calibrated observers who attributed scores. RESULTS: The Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05) showed no significant differences in microhardness values among bleaching agents, at 21 days of treatment and a significant increase in microhardness for different agents after 14 days from the end of treatment. <b>Fisher's</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> differences in micromorphology of enamel between control and experimental groups (p= 0. 0342).

40|$|Background: Synovial sarcoma is an {{aggressive}} tumor {{and has two}} common histological subtype, biphasic and monophasic. It has SYT-SSX gene fusion that decreases expression of p 53 tumor suppressor. The prognosis is associated with mitosis and tumor diameter. Therefore this study conducted to know the pattern of p 53 expresion and its association with mitosis, histological subtype, and other prognosis factors. Methods: Twenty synovial sarcoma cases consisted of 4 monophasic and 16 biphasic cases from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital – Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia (CMHospital-FMUI) 2005 - 2011 were analyzed for association of p 53 expression and mitosis as prognostic factor. Haematoxylin-eosin slides were used to count mitosis. Paraffin block materials were used to analyze p 53 expression by immunohistochemistry and to detect SYT gene translocation by FISH (Fluorescein in situ Hybridization). Results: The <b>Fisher’s</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that positive p 53 expression was associated with tumor diameter < 5 cm {{although it was not}} associated with mitosis.

40|$|Abstract. Synurbic {{populations are}} ecologically and ethologically {{different}} from populations inhabiting natural sites. The differences include factors which {{could affect the}} genetic diversity of population- more sedentary life style, decreasing proportion of breeding individuals, high re-occupation rate, higher longevity or lower natural selection. Additionally, urban populations can be isolated from rural ones and thus suffer from genetic drift and inbreeding resulting in low level of genetic variability. This report is based on preliminary results, obtained from analysis of three microsatellite loci in Kestrels inhabiting two areas of Warsaw: city centre {{of the city and}} outskirts. Two hypotheses were tested: (i) genetic variability of birds inhibiting the centre of Warsaw is lower than that of birds from the outskirts due to a stronger isolation of the centre population from wild conspecifics; (ii) indices of genetic variability reach similar values in populations from the centre and from the outskirts of Warsaw. While mean allelic diversity is slightly higher at the outskirts, the mean heterozygosity reached a higher value in the population from the centre of Warsaw. The differences in frequency of particular alleles between the studied areas were observed and the <b>Fisher</b> <b>exact</b> <b>test</b> <b>shows</b> a highly significant genetic differentiation between investigated groups of Kestrel for each locus.
