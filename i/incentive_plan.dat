25|$|Initially, in May 2001, it {{was noted}} that since the opera house was a Heritage building, it could not be redeveloped but only restored. Even for restoration, funds needed to be found. With these two basic aspects in view, the {{planning}} dictum followed was that: The historicity of the building and its architecture will be lost if it is not used as a theatre and there should not be a change of user. The initial plan proposed was to convert a part of the open plot to be developed commercially to generate funds, which could self sustain the expenditure involved in the restoration and maintenance of the existing heritage building. To proceed further with this plan, it was also considered essential to negotiate with the existing owner Maharaja Vikramsinghji Bhojraji of Gondal to get his consent to the <b>incentive</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, stock <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> {{have been}} used by American {{companies}} for two primary purposes: as tools of corporate governance to align the interests of top managers and shareholders, and to motivate managers to maximize shareholders’ value. Recently, just as the misuse of stock option plans is the subject of scathing criticism, such plans are seeing widespread dissemination in several European countries. Empirical studies conducted by both consulting companies and management scholars outline the increasing diffusion of stock <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> designed by European companies and the main features of these plans. The characteristics of the process through which they are designed and of the equity incentives implemented raise the concerns of investors and academics about the ability of such plans to align managers’ interests to shareholders’. Since stock <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> were created and developed in the Anglo-Saxon capitalistic system, {{the last part of the}} paper reviews the reasons why firms should set up these plans. The aim is to ascertain whether European companies have good reasons to create SIPs and if the features of the <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> designed by these executives are consistent with achieving these goals. To answer these questions, a theoretical model is presented to provide a framework for designing stock <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> that are tailored to the characteristics of the company, specific aims it wishes to pursue, and the relative institutional environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Pay-for-performance {{plans are}} some of widely used human {{resource}} practices in many firms, including shipbuilding, for productivity and motivational improvement purposes. Such plans {{play an important role}} in industries that are highly labor-intensive, and where effective management of human resources is critical to business operations, such as the shipbuilding industry. Those practices can have large impact on employee performance and ultimately company competitiveness. Research studies that show how such <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> improve productivity and reported pattern of adoption by firms have spurred the use and adoption in many firms. However, there are also researchers who point out that there are negative consequences to using <b>incentive</b> <b>plans.</b> Therefore it is important for companies to carefully consider the practices they use. In this paper, I discuss research findings that support the practices and critical viewpoints related to pay-for-performance plans. Research findings from Korean literature are, then, discussed. The shipbuilding industry is chosen because proper human resource management is critical in reducing turnover and increasing employee satisfaction. Through a shipbuilding company case, problems related to using pay-for-performance <b>incentive</b> <b>plans</b> and how they affect work-related issues of employee morale, cooperation, and teamwork will be discussed. While positive aspects have been emphasized to drive greater adoption among firms, the resulting consequences of the pay plans need to be seriously considered and improvements upon the plans made by firms. Improvement suggestions are discussed in the conclusions and implications. Key words: shipbuilding, pay-for-performance evaluation practice, compensatio...|$|R
