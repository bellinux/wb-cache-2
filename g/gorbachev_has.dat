25|$|According to Gorbachev, Yeltsin {{kept the}} {{plans of the}} Belovezhskaya meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union was to get rid of Gorbachev, who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>has</b> also accused Yeltsin of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the Soviet Union united. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It also ordered the Russian deputies in the Council of the Union to cease their work, leaving that body without a quorum. In effect, the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded.|$|E

At Nazarbayev's insistence, Moscow surrendered control of the republic's mineral resources in June 1991 and Gorbachev's authority crumbled rapidly throughout the year.
