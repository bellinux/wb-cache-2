5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> and paler, and P. d. parkini <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E

Alexander H.

Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth.

T.foliacea <b>is</b> <b>larger,</b> brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface.
