40|$|The {{performance}} {{implications of}} changing rear foot joint angles in the kick start were evaluated using a replicated {{version of the}} Omega OSB 11 starting block. Maximal effort dives were collected for twenty-six competitive swimmers. The block was equipped with two tri-axial force plates to differentiate between forces applied to the rear foot rest and forces applied to the block. Two high-speed video cameras recorded hind-foot eversion and dorsiflexion angles. Competitive swimmers with larger hind-foot eversion movement have larger lateral <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> forces, longer <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> times, and larger contributions of the <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> to total impulse. These swimmers also have larger dorsiflexion movements. Improved start performance (defined by faster predicted time to two meters and higher normalized power) is associated with applying high normalized peak posterior <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> force {{as quickly as possible}} while using the front leg as the dominant contributor to total impulse...|$|R

5000|$|Built from March 1950. Upper grille {{started out}} horizontal, as in early Phase I; from March 1951, some {{locomotives}} were built with vertical-slotted [...] "Farr-Air" [...] grilles, and by October 1951, all had them. Cab doors became round-cornered, and the <b>kick</b> <b>plates</b> were deleted. The wing windows became taller, with round corners. Two drip strips; one over cab windows, second over door. The end door window became round after November 1950.|$|E
50|$|The Business was {{introduced}} in July 1953, in four-door sedan form only, as a better equipped version of the basic Holden 48-215 series sedan introduced in 1948 and was specifically aimed at the taxi market. Improvements included passenger grab rails, door pull handles, seat <b>kick</b> <b>plates,</b> heavy-duty seats, floor mats, a heavy-duty battery and a boot lid handle. The Business Sedan was officially designated as model 48-215-257. Like the basic Holden sedan, it was powered by a 132.5 cubic inch six cylinder engine.|$|E

Both the sporting and the Abarths were available with ABS, air-conditioning and Power steering but due to cost not very many owners took up the options.|$|E
50|$|A skidpad or skidpan is a {{circular}} area of flat pavement used for various tests of a car's handling. The most common skidpad use is testing lateral acceleration, measured in g. This usage {{is similar to}} that of a <b>kick</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sport wheelchairs are {{designed}} for the requirements of specific sports.

40|$|In 2009, the {{international}} governing body of swimming approved {{the use of}} the Omega OSB 11 platform. It features a back foot <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> that can be shifted into five positions. The purpose of this thesis is to identify set stance characteristics of the track start that may produce a faster start from the OSB 11. The first project evaluated: optimal <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> location, its relationship to segment lengths, and rear foot position as high and low on the <b>kick</b> <b>plate.</b> The swimmers demonstrated significantly greater horizontal take-off velocity and decreased time to 2 m with the rear foot in the high position. However, no moderate or strong relationships were detected between optimal <b>kick</b> <b>plate</b> location and segment lengths. The second study examined the power limb position. The swimmers were tested for limb power using the single-leg triple hop for distance. They had a significantly greater horizontal take-off velocity when the power limb was placed at the front edge of the platform in the track start. The third study examined optimal, rear- and front-weighted center of mass (COM) location in the set stance. The rear-weighted start had a significantly greater horizontal take-off velocity and reaction time than the front-weighted. However, front-weighted track starts showed a significantly shorter block time than in the rear-weighted position. Most swimmers in the group demonstrated optimal performance when the COM locations were in a mid-weighted stance. The final project compared: coached and kinetic feedback (round 1), and the two forms of feedback in different orders (round 2) on 2 m time performance. After the first round, the kinetic group showed a significant increase in time but no significant change was found in the coached group. After the second round, {{there were no significant differences}} between groups. However, each group demonstrated a significant increase in time from the pre-test. Overall the thesis suggests that changes in start stance can impact performance. In addition, optimal positioning may also be unique to each swimmer which requires testing, and feedback and practice should be routine. The findings of this thesis support the need for future work to establish methods of determining optimal start positions for individual swimmers...|$|R

Tall, arched windows and large, rectangular skylights bordered in a geometric pattern also illuminate the courtrooms.|$|E
5000|$|Many ice resurfacers are {{fitted with}} a [...] "board brush", a rotary brush powered by a {{hydraulic}} motor. The board brush is extended and retracted {{on the left side}} of the machine by a hydraulic arm. This allows the operator to collect ice shavings and debris that accumulate along the edge of the rink (along the <b>kick</b> <b>plates</b> below the dasher boards of the rink) where the conditioner cannot easily reach. The brush sweeps the accumulations into the path of the conditioner, which removes them from the ice. The use of a board brush can dramatically reduce the need for edging of the rink.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} to detect doors in images. The {{key to the}} algorithm’s success is its fusion of multiple visual cues, including standard cues (color, texture, and intensity edges) {{as well as several}} novel ones (concavity, the <b>kick</b> <b>plate,</b> the vanishing point, and the intensity profile of the gap below the door). We use the Adaboost algorithm to determine the linear weighting of the various cues. Formulated as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) problem, a multi-cue functional is minimized by a data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) process that arrives at a solution that is shown empirically to be near the global minimum. Intensity edge information is used in the importance probability distribution to drive the Markov chain dynamics in order to achieve a speedup of several orders of magnitude over traditional jump diffusion methods. Unlike previous approaches, the algorithm does no...|$|R
40|$|Washing machine {{manufacturers}} are working towards producing quieter appliances {{as many people}} consider noise emission a key factor when buying. Although the spinning cycle is the noisiest, the amount of noise the pump makes is the cause for many users’ complaints. In an attempt to reduce the noise emitted when a washing machine is pumping out, an experimental study was performed. First, the measurement of the sound pressure allowed us to identify the main sources of noise as the electric motor and the vibration of the cabinet. Next, a detailed analysis based on the measurement of the vibration of the cabinet provided information about the predominant radiating panels. It was also inferred that the electromagnetic noise is {{drowned out by the}} structure-borne noise. Finally, several proposals to diminish the sound power were analyzed, and a reduction of 3 dBA was achieved by decreasing the contact zone of the pump with the <b>kick</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

These modifications included a bigger front bumper/spoiler, a modified (larger and higher) rear spoiler with end-plates (these spoilers {{were designed by}} Stevens to create zero lift rather than ultimate downforce), a high-lift inlet camshaft (taken from the 1997 1.8-litre Lantra engine) and a 6"x4" [...] freeflow exhaust by Magnex (suppliers to Aston Martin). Wheels were 16" [...] diameter x 7.0J 5-spoke alloys manufactured by TSW (with Yokohama 205/45/16 tyres). There were [...] "F2 Evolution" [...] badges on the front wings and rear valance.
