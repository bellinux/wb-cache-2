5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E

The original edition, mostly based on the OED1, was edited by Francis George Fowler and Henry Watson Fowler and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.

25|$|One of his {{earliest}} film scores was the British sex comedy <b>Keep</b> <b>It</b> <b>Up</b> Downstairs (1976), {{and he has}} since scored numerous films, many of them European art films, including several of those directed by Peter Greenaway. Nyman drew frequently on early music sources in his scores for Greenaway's films: Henry Purcell in The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989) (which included Memorial and Miserere Paraphrase), Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber in A Zed & Two Noughts (1985), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Drowning by Numbers (1988), and John Dowland in Prospero's Books (1991), largely {{at the request of}} the director. He wrote settings to various texts by Mozart for Letters, Riddles and Writs, part of Not Mozart. He also produced a soundtrack for the silent film Man with a Movie Camera. Nyman's popularity increased after he wrote the score to Jane Campion's award-winning 1993 film The Piano. The album became a classical music best-seller. He was nominated for both a British Academy Award and a Golden Globe.|$|E
25|$|Silas {{returns to}} Hollyoaks in January 2016 as he visits Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison {{under the name}} Mr. E Mann (Mystery Man). It is {{revealed}} that Silas had been writing to Trevor as he heard about the Gloved Hand Killer who had murdered seven residents throughout 2015. As Silas asks Trevor disturbing questions, Trevor tells Silas to back off and never contact him again. Silas leaves but has a feeling that Trevor is innocent and is determined {{to find out who}} the real killer is. Silas returns to Hollyoaks again in February, this time for an appointment with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis), a nurse at Dee Valley Hospital. During the appointment, Silas tells Tegan he believes that the killer is one of the nurses or doctors who work at the hospital as medical equipment mysteriously disappeared {{during the time of the}} murders. Silas's interrogation about the murders makes Tegan uncomfortable and she leaves briefly, and once she returns Silas has already left. Silas visits Dee Valley Hospital again a few weeks later, this time imitating a human resources officer while visiting Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) in her office. After she confides in him about her feelings on her sister Kim Butterfield's (Daisy Wood-Davis) arrest for the murders, he leaves with the chilling parting words that he is a keen admirer of her good work and to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> implying that he knows she is the real killer.|$|E

500|$|Previewing {{the episode}} {{as one of}} his TV choices for the day, The Guardians Gareth McClean stated that amongst [...] "the snarling, {{shouting}} and awful, contrived sexual tension between Captain Pratt and the team, there's an interesting idea here— the consequences of leading a double life." [...] He described Gwen as [...] "the moral centre of the show" [...] and joked that her [...] "nice-but-dim boyfriend" [...] must be the last person in Cardiff not to know of Torchwood's existence. [...] He concluded by stating [...] "that a giant telepathic alien manatee is involved should by no means discourage viewing." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon also selected the episode as her single pick of the day, praising scenes where Rhys and Torchwood formulate their infiltration plan as containing [...] "the kind of sharp, sarcastic banter that made Buffy such fun to watch". However, she felt that it was a [...] "shame they can't <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for the entire episode." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, feeling it to be a [...] "juicy treat to devour, combining heightened drama, genuine emotion and nice touches of humour." [...] He praised the decision to foreground the character of Rhys, the contrast he provided to the operations of the Torchwood team and the realism of the arguments between him and Gwen. He also felt that the episode's [...] "eco-friendly plot" [...] made it easy to sympathise with the alien space whale stating [...] "the emotive howls of pain, big puppy-dog eyes and heartfelt score all [...] to test the tear ducts." [...] However, he criticised the human antagonists for being [...] "two-dimensional plot functions rather than humans" [...] and pointed out the [...] "moral black hole" [...] of Torchwood continuing to buy meat products despite condemning the plight of the space whale. Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave the episode four stars, feeling it highlighted how the [...] "series has evolved" [...] in that [...] "the in-fighting and gratuitous swearing have been replaced with slick dialogue that sizzles with humour and drama– not to mention a team that feels like a properly cohesive unit." [...] He also praised the increased role of Rhys and opined that the episode made the relationship between him and Gwen [...] "the show's most believable." [...] However, he felt that Jack, as the leader of a top secret organisation, should have pressed harder to have Rhys' memory wiped.|$|E

In later life Ethel became known as The Dragon, and then The Grand-Dragon to her grandchildren.

[...] In 1938, with several friends, he formed the Futurians—arguably the best-known of the science fiction clubs. At one time or another, the membership included Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, Cyril Kornbluth, James Blish, John Michel, Judith Merril, Robert A. W.

2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp.

2500|$|Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent {{to form a}} settlement, in such {{a country}} as Tasmania {{was in the middle}} of the last century.

The colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy. [...] They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> in watchful antagonism to the old regime.
