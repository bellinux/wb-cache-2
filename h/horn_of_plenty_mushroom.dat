5000|$|Following {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plenty</b> in 2004, Grizzly Bear {{expanded}} {{from being the}} solo moniker for vocalist Ed Droste into a full band, with the addition <b>of</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plenty</b> collaborator Christopher Bear, bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, and guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen. Christopher Bear noted, [...] "Getting together the band for the live show changed things quite a bit, in terms of dynamics and instrumentation used. The songs <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plenty</b> were quite simple and open ended so it left {{a lot of room}} for interpretation, which was great because it allowed us to get a band sound happening and working on a very reactionary level." ...|$|R
