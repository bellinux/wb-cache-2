When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale).

40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) correlate with renal function in cats and SDMA {{has been shown}} to be a more reliable and earlier marker for chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with serum creatinine (Cr). Calcium oxalate uroliths tend to develop in mid-to-older aged cats and <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> may cause a reduction in renal function with increased SDMA, but normal serum Cr. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if cats with <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> had increased serum SDMA concentrations, and whether SDMA increased earlier than serum creatinine concentrations. Cats in the colony with <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> diagnosed between August 2010 and December 2015 (n = 43) were compared with healthy geriatric cats (n = 21) without <b>kidney</b> <b>stones.</b> Serum SDMA concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and serum Cr concentrations were determined by enzymatic colorimetry. Cats with <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> were diagnosed antemortem by radiographic imaging (n = 12) or by postmortem necropsy (n = 31). Retrospectively, serum SDMA was found to be increased above the upper reference limit in 39 of 43 cats with <b>kidney</b> <b>stones.</b> Serum Cr was increased above the upper reference limit in 18 of 43 cats; 6 of these 18 cats had terminal azotemia only. The mean time that serum SDMA was increased before serum Cr was increased was 26. 9 months (range 0 to 60 months). <b>Kidney</b> <b>stones</b> were composed of calcium oxalate in 30 of 34 cats. The lifespan for cats with <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> (mean, 12. 5 years; range, 6. 1 to 18. 1 years) was shorter (P < 0. 001) than for control cats (mean, 15. 2 years; range, 13. 0 to 17. 2 years), suggesting that non-obstructive <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> have an effect on mortality rate or rate of CKD progression. In conclusion, if SDMA concentrations are elevated in mid-to-older aged cats, further imaging studies are warranted to check for the presence of <b>kidney</b> <b>stones...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Kidney</b> <b>stones</b> are a common, painful {{disorder}} {{that can affect}} {{as many as one}} of 11 people in the United States (Goldfarb & Arowojolu, 2013). The gold standard for diagnosing <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> is currently computed tomography (CT). However, because CT scans emit radiation during the exam, they could be causing more harm than good. According to recent research, ultrasound may be used to diagnose <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> with close to similar accuracy and reliability. Ultrasounds are also safer and more cost effective for patients and the healthcare system. Purpose: The purpose of this project is to describe nurse practitioners (NPs) use of ultrasound to diagnose <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in the emergency department (ED). The information from this project was compared with the recent literature and used to develop an evidence-based practice recommendation for diagnosing suspected <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in the ED. Methods: A 15 -item survey was mailed to emergency department NPs across the United States. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative results. One open-ended question was also posed, and findings were grouped by commonalities of clinical experiences. Results: Analysis of survey responses indicates that all of the respondents use CT scan to diagnose <b>kidney</b> <b>stones.</b> However, the majority of the respondents also feel that ultrasound could be used in the ED to diagnose <b>kidney</b> <b>stones.</b> The results also demonstrate that even though there is no nationally or internationally accepted standardized guideline for diagnosing <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> in the ED, many EDs across the country are instituting their own protocols...|$|R

A sample of 1, 543 adult subjects, all Caucasians, was randomly selected from a population of over 25, 000 subjects followed by 22 general practitioners (GPs). Subjects were administered a questionnaire requesting the patient's age and sex, any history of <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> and/or colics and the prescription of kidney ultrasound (US) examination. GPs data-bases were also interrogated. Crude and adjusted prevalence proportions and ratios (PRs) with corresponding 95  % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Furthermore, the association between the practice pattern of each physician with respect to US prescription and the prevalence of <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> was investigated. The overall prevalence of <b>kidney</b> <b>stones</b> was 7. 5  % (95  % confidence interval 6. 2, 8. 9  %), increasing with age until 55 - 60  years and then decreasing.

25|$|Bone {{metabolism}} also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} {{in the direction of}} mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E
