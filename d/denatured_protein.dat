25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the <b>denatured</b> <b>protein.</b> 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E

40|$|Our {{focus is}} on an {{appropriate}} theoretical framework for describing highly <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> In high concentrations of denaturants, proteins behave like polymers in a good solvent and ensembles for <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> can be modeled by ignoring all interactions except excluded volume (EV) effects. To assay conformational preferences of highly <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins,</b> we quantify a variety of properties for EV-limit ensembles of 23 two-state proteins. We find that modeled <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> can be best described as follows. Average shapes are consistent with prolate ellipsoids. Ensembles are characterized by large correlated fluctuations. Sequence-specific conformational preferences are restricted to local length scales that span five to nine residues. Beyond local length scales, chain properties follow well-defined power laws that are expected for generic polymers in the EV limit. The average available volume is filled inefficiently, and cavities of all sizes are found within the interiors of <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> All properties characterized from simulated ensembles match predictions from rigorous field theories. We use our results to resolve between conflicting proposals for structure in ensembles for highly denatured states...|$|R
40|$|Local {{structures}} in <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> {{may be important}} in guiding a polypeptide chain during the folding and misfolding processes. Existence of local {{structures in}} chemically <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> is a highly controversial issue. NMR parameters [coupling constants 3 J(Hα,HN) and chemical shifts] of chemically <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> in general deviate little from their values in small peptides. These peptides were presumed to be completely unstructured; therefore, it was considered that chemically <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> are random coils. But recent experimental studies show that small peptides adopt relatively stable structures in aqueous solutions. Small deviations of the NMR parameters from their values in small peptides may thus actually indicate the existence of local structures in chemically <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> Using NMR data and theoretical predictions we show here that fluctuating β-strands exist in urea-denatured ubiquitin (8 M urea at pH 2). Residues in such β-strands populate more frequently {{the left side of}} the broad β region of φ–ψ space. Urea-denatured ubiquitin contains no detectable β-sheet secondary structures; nevertheless, the fluctuating β-strands in urea-denatured ubiquitin coincide to the β-strands in the native state. Formation of β-strands is in accord with the electrostatic screening model of unfolded proteins. The free energy of a residue in an unfolded protein is in this model determined by the local backbone electrostatics and its screening by backbone solvation. These energy terms introduce strong electrostatic coupling between neighboring residues, which causes cooperative formation of β-strands in <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> We propose that fluctuating β-strands in <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> may serve as initiation sites to form fibrils...|$|R

50|$|In pan frying, {{the water}} that exits the meat forms a barrier between the meat and the oil or {{the surface of the}} pan. This barrier is {{critical}} for the success of pan frying meat. When meat cooks, the proteins {{on the surface of the}} meat denature because of the heat. This means that many of the secondary bonds that give the proteins their shape are broken. The protein molecules want to reform those interactions to return to their most thermodynamically stable state. Two opportune locations for the surface proteins to bind are the oil and the surface of the pan. Meat sticking to the bottom of the pan is caused by the interactions between proteins on the surface of the meat binding with the molecules on the surface of the pan. The <b>denatured</b> <b>protein</b> can also bind with the oil in the pan. This is not desirable for many health and flavor reasons. Since the proteins, the oil molecules, and in some cases the surface of the pan, all have a significant polarity, the force of their interactions can be high.|$|E
50|$|A fully <b>denatured</b> <b>protein</b> lacks both {{tertiary}} {{and secondary}} structure, and exists as a so-called random coil. Under certain conditions some proteins can refold; however, in many cases, denaturation is irreversible. Cells sometimes protect their proteins against the denaturing influence of heat with enzymes known as heat shock proteins (a type of chaperone), which assist other proteins both in folding and in remaining folded. Some proteins never fold in cells at all except {{with the assistance}} of chaperones which either isolate individual proteins so that their folding is not interrupted by interactions with other proteins or help to unfold misfolded proteins, allowing them to refold into the correct native structure. This function is crucial to prevent the risk of precipitation into insoluble amorphous aggregates. The external factors involved in protein denaturation or disruption of the native state include temperature, external fields (electric, magnetic), molecular crowding, and even the limitation of space, which can have a big influence on the folding of proteins. High concentrations of solutes, extremes of pH, mechanical forces, and the presence of chemical denaturants can contribute to protein denaturation, as well. These individual factors are categorized together as stresses. Chaperones are shown to exist in increasing concentrations during times of cellular stress and help the proper folding of emerging proteins as well as denatured or misfolded ones.|$|E

We investigated changes in the positive-mode ESI charge state distribution produced by several chemical modifications of <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> Capping carboxylic acid groups with neutral functional groups yields little change in charge state distribution compared with unmodified proteins. The results indicate that carboxyl groups do not {{play a significant role}} in the positive charging of <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins</b> in ESI. The modification of proteins with additional basic sites or fixed positive charges generates substantially higher charge states, providing evidence that the number of ionizable sites, rather than molecular size and shape, determines ESI charging for <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> Fixed charge modification also significantly reduces the number of protons acquired by a protein, in that the charge state envelope is not increased by the full number of fixed charges appended. This result demonstrates that Coulombic repulsion between positive charges plays a significant role in determining charge state distribution by affecting the gas-phase basicity of ionizable sites. Addition of fixed-charge moieties to a protein is a useful approach for shifting protein charge state distributions to higher charge states, and with further work, it may help limit the distribution of protein ions to fewer charge states...|$|R

Heating cells followed by a fixed dose of diamide exposure resulted in HMA increases in a heat-dose dependent manner, demonstrating that the quantitation of HMA could ve as a measure of heat-denatured proteins. We compared thermotolerant and nontolerant cells and found decreased HMA in tolerant cells upon heat treatment. As an attempt to examine the kinetics of protein renaturation (or 'repair'), we measured the amounts of aggregates formed by the addition of diamide at various times after heat shock. Such experiments demonstrate an equally rapid disappearance of HMA in previously unheated and in thermotolerant cells. Levels of HMA in tolerant cells increased significantly after electroporation of HSP 70 specific mAbs, suggesting an involvement of HSP 70 in reducing HMA levels in thermotolerant cells upon heat exposure. Immunoprecipitation studies using anti-HSP 70 antibody indicated an association of HSP 70 with heat-denatured proteins. Our results suggest that heat induces protein denaturation, and that elevated level of HSP 70 present in thermotolerant cells protects them by reducing the level of protein denaturation rather than by facilitating the 'repair' (or degradation) process. ope...|$|R

Alpha A-crystallin also assists in refolding of <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here, we {{have investigated the}} effect of mild modification of αA-crystallin by MGO (with 20 - 500 µM) on the chaperone function {{and its ability to}} refold <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins.</b> Under the conditions used, mildly modified protein contained mostly hydroimidazolone modifications. The modified protein exhibited an increase in chaperone function against thermal aggregation of β- and γ-crystallins, citrate synthase (CS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and chemical aggregation of insulin. The ability of the protein to assist in refolding of chemically denatured β- and γ-crystallins, MDH and LDH, and to prevent thermal inactivation of CS were unchanged after mild modification by MGO. Prior binding of catalytically inactive, thermally denatured MDH or the hydrophobic probe, 2 -p-toluidonaphthalene- 6 -sulfonate (TNS) abolished the ability of αA-crystallin to assist in the refolding of denatured MDH. However, MGO-modification of chaperone-null TNS-bound αA-crystallin resulted in partial regain of the chaperone function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) hydroimidazolone modifications are sufficient to enhance the chaperone function of αA-crystallin but such modifications do not change its ability to assist in refolding of <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins,</b> 2) the sites on the αA-crystallin responsible for the chaperone function and refolding are the same in the native αA-crystallin and 3) additional hydrophobic sites exposed upon MGO modification, which are responsible for the enhanced chaperone function, do not enhance αA-crystallin's ability to refold <b>denatured</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

The contents of α-helices, β-strands, turns, poly-L-proline type II (PPII), and unordered structures were estimated for each denatured state of the three proteins using the SELCON 3 program with Protein Data Bank data and the VUVCD spectra of 31 reference proteins reported in our previous study. Based on these contents, the characteristics of the four types of denaturation were discussed for each protein. In all types of denaturation, a decrease in α-helices was accompanied by increases in β-strands, PPII, and unordered structures. About 20 % β-strands were present even in the proteins fully unfolded by GdnHCl in which β-sheets should be broken.
