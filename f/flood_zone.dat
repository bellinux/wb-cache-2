25|$|In {{anticipation}} of the flooding of the Tabqa Dam reservoir, an intensive, international program of archaeological rescue excavations {{was carried out in}} the threatened area between 1963 and 1974. As part of this program, excavations have been carried out at sites ranging in date from the Late Natufian to the Ottoman period. Excavated sites include Tell Abu Hureyra, Emar, Habuba Kabira, Mureybet, Tell es-Sweyhat, Tell Fray and Dibsi Faraj. At Qal'at Ja'bar, a castle on a hilltop that would be turned into an island by the flooding of Lake Assad, a protective glacis was built and two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were relocated to an area beyond the <b>flood</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{consequences}} of the inundation include loss of farmland, loss of spawning habitat as fishes can not swim upstream anymore. The Kachin Development Networking Group, a network of civil society groups and development organisations in Kachin State warn this {{will lead to a}} loss of income for fishermen. They report locals are also worried about the flooding of cultural sites in the <b>flood</b> <b>zone.</b> As with other large dam projects, the Myitsone Dam construction will alter the hydrological characteristics of the river, e.g. preventing sediment from enriching riverbanks downstream, where it usually enriches the riverside foodproducing plains. This can affect fertility as far downstream as the Irrawaddy Delta, the major rice-producing area of Myanmar.|$|E

25|$|Indianapolis {{continued}} to experience strong growth through the 1960s and 70s, but {{the population of}} Cottage Home and other inner-city neighborhoods was reduced by migration to the suburbs {{in the process of}} urban sprawl. As Cottage Home was within the <b>flood</b> <b>zone</b> of Pogue's Run, residents began to leave for other areas. In addition, I-70/I-65's construction required demolishing homes {{on the west side of}} the neighborhood, leaving it bordered with a high-traffic roadway. By the 1980s, more than 100 houses had been demolished in Cottage Home. A renewed interest in historic restoration and the establishment of the Cottage Home Neighborhood Association (CHNA) in 1984 reversed the demolition trend; the area has since lost only six homes to fire or demolition. CHNA led the effort for the unique neighborhood to be designated as a historic district, achieving addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, the State Register in 1995, and city designation in 2008. Today, while infill has been slow, the neighborhood continues as a vibrant and active community.|$|E
25|$|The {{inundation}} {{of large}} parts of the Euphrates valley, especially in Turkey and Syria, has led to the flooding of many archaeological sites and other places of cultural significance. Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered cultural heritage as possible, many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of Zeugma with its unique Roman mosaics by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press. The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by UNESCO to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the Natufian to the Abbasid period, and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the <b>flood</b> <b>zone.</b> Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include Mureybet, Emar and Abu Hureyra. A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed, which led, among others, to the flooding of the important Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Jerf el-Ahmar. An archaeological survey and rescue excavations were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq. Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake, resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research, but also providing opportunities for looting, which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq {{in the wake of the}} 2003 invasion.|$|E

500|$|Although the 1964 floods had {{initially}} generated support for New Melones, a spirited {{opposition to the}} dam arose from both the river recreation industry and environmentalists who saw the Stanislaus River canyon as having greater value than a reservoir.

The river flowed through the deepest limestone canyon in the US, with cliffs rising [...] above the water in places. Other natural features of the area included extensive limestone caves, and endemic species such as Banksula melones, the Melones cave harvestman. In addition, more than one hundred archaeological and historical sites, left over from Native American inhabitation and the Gold Rush period, were all situated in the reservoir <b>flood</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

500|$|President Dwight Eisenhower {{declared}} {{eight states}} as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. The Small Business Administration opened 18temporary {{offices in the}} eastern United States for people to take out disaster loan applications. In the months after the storm, both the United States {{federal government and the}} American Red Cross had difficulty raising enough funds for the storm victims; collectively, the Red Cross, the Small Business Administration, and Farmers Home Administration raised $37million, which was less than 8% of Diane's damage total. Throughout 1955, the Red Cross assisted about 10,000families in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states; some of the families received aid to move to a new house not in a <b>flood</b> <b>zone.</b> The Small Business Administration provided about 1,600loans, totaling $25million, for small businesses. Senator Herbert H. Lehman proposed a $12billion federal flood insurance program. In 1956, the United States Congress passed the Federal Flood Insurance Act, but the program was not enacted due to lack of funding. A nationwide flood program was not enacted until the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. After the floods from Diane, the American federal government provided funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to construct dams and reservoirs throughout New England to mitigate future flooding. In about 14years, the Corps built 29dams in Connecticut alone at the cost of $70million, including three along the Connecticut River. The federal government restored plans from the 1930s to build dams along the Delaware River, one of which along Tocks Island. A controversy arose there due to the [...] long reservoir the dam would have created, causing 600families to be displaced. The project was canceled in 1975, and the acquired lands became the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.|$|E
40|$|Flood hazard is {{currently}} being researched on continental and global scales, using models of increasing complexity. In this paper we investigate a different, simplified approach, which combines statistical and physical models in place of conventional rainfall-run-off models to carry out flood mapping for Europe. A Bayesian-network-based model built in a previous study is employed to generate return-period flow rates in European rivers with a catchment area larger than 100  km 2. The simulations are performed using a one-dimensional steady-state hydraulic model {{and the results are}} post-processed using Geographical Information System (GIS) software in order to derive <b>flood</b> <b>zones.</b> This approach is validated by comparison with Joint Research Centre's (JRC) pan-European map and five local flood studies from different countries. Overall, the two approaches show a similar performance in recreating <b>flood</b> <b>zones</b> of local maps. The simplified approach achieved a similar level of accuracy, while substantially reducing the computational time. The paper also presents the aggregated results on the flood hazard in Europe, including future projections.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the economic benefits}} of a levee constructed {{for the purposes of}} flood damage reduction in Mankato, Minnesota. The study also analyzes social benefits of the levee by assessing the demographic changes after the creation of the levee. Four analyses were developed to analyze the economic and social benefits of the levee. The first analysis was developed to evaluate property value. A second analysis was developed to evaluate tax revenue. A third analysis was developed to evaluate economic benefits of the levee. A fourth analysis was developed to assess population change after the creation of the levee. The calculation of property value focused on all land and buildings in <b>flood</b> <b>zones</b> while the calculation of tax revenue focused on buildings in the <b>flood</b> <b>zones</b> that were built after the levee project started.

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} the nesting by Crocodylus moreletii in Lago de Catemaco, Veracruz, southeastern, Mexico. During the nesting and hatching seasons, we searched for nests {{along the northern}} margins {{of the lake and}} small associated streams.

We not found differences to nest between inland or <b>flooded</b> <b>zones.</b> However, we found that egg size varied among nests. In nests built inland, predation was the major cause of egg mortality whereas flooding resulted in more deaths of eggs in the <b>flooding</b> <b>zone.</b> <b>Flooding</b> killed 25 % of eggs monitored in this study. We suggest that to increase nest success in the Morelet&# 8217;s crocodile it is necessary to promote conservation of nesting areas around the lake, recently occupied by urban or tourist developments...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the {{spatial distribution of}} the organic carbon found in alluvial soils affected by successive <b>floods.</b> In <b>flood</b> <b>zones,</b> very little is known of the processes associated {{with the development of}} soils subjected to frequent flooding, in particular with respect to the accumulation of litter and organic carbon concentrations. The aim {{of this study is to}} better understand the distribution of organic carbon based on various hydrological gradients associated with flood recurrence. A digital elevation model was developed from LIDAR data to assess the microtopography of the site, and further delineate floodplains and no-flood zones. Various soil properties were considered in addition to organic carbon, such as pH, soil bulk density, litter, drainage, and topographic levels (elevation). The results show that the soils in the frequent-flood zones (FFz, recurrence of 0 – 20 years) have significantly less total organic carbon than the soils in the no-flood zones (NFz) and the moderate <b>flood</b> <b>zones</b> (MFz, 20 – 100 years). Average values obtained for the surface horizons (0 – 20 cm) vary by 1. 74 % ± 0. 85 % (FFz), 3. 34 % ± 1. 09 % (MFz) and 3. 54 % ± 1. 77 % (NFz), respectively. The absence of ground litter in the frequent <b>flood</b> <b>zones</b> helps decrease the input of organic matter in the surface horizons and progressively results in soil depletion...|$|R
