The influence of the ortho substituents on the carbonyl carbon 13 C NMR chemical shift, δ CO, {{was found to be}} described by a linear multiple regression equation containing the inductive, resonance and steric substituent constants. For all the ortho -substituted esters containing substituents in acyl part as well as phenyl part the substituent–induced reverse inductive effect (ρ I ∠ 0), the normal resonance effect (ρ R ≥ 0), and the negative steric effect (δ ortho ∠ 0) with the E s B were observed. In the case of ortho substituents in phenyl part the resonance effect was negligible. Due to inductive effect the ortho electron-withdrawing substituents showed upfield shift or shielding of the carbonyl carbon, while the electron-donating substituents had an opposite effect. Because of the sterical consequences ortho substituents revealed deshielding effect on the 13 C NMR chemical shift of the carbonyl carbon. For all the meta - and para -substituted esters the reverse substituent-induced inductive and resonance effects (ρ I ∠ 0, ρ R ∠ 0) were found to be significant. In alkyl benzoates the alkyl substituents showed the reverse inductive and steric effects. The log k values for the alkaline hydrolysis in water, aqueous 0. 5 and 2. 25 M Bu 4 NBr and the IR frequencies, ν CO, for ortho -, meta - and para -substituted phenyl benzoates and alkyl benzoates were correlated nicely with the corresponding 13 C NMR substituent chemical shifts, Δ δ CO...|$|R

40|$|The {{velocity}} {{coefficient of}} a reaction in solution may be written k = PZe -E/RT, where E is {{the energy of}} activation, Z is the collision frequency as calculated for a gaseous system, and V is the proportion of energised collisions which actually leads {{to the formation of}} products. The thesis describes a kinetic studyof the alkaline hydrolysis of (a) a series of substituted benzoic esters and (b) a series of aliphatic esters; a similar study of the base-catalysed prototropy of a number of phenyl alkyl ketones had been carried out for purposes of comparison. The results are analysed in accordance with the above equation, and their significance is considered in its relationship to two problems, viz., that of the ortho effect and that of the influence of alkyl groups upon reactivity. Previous workers have shown that the introduction of substituents into the m~ or p-position in the aromatic nucleus influences reaction velocity almost' entirely by changing the energy of activation, the variations in the P factor being relatively unimportant. This was shown, for example, {{in the case of the}} alkaline hydrolysis of p-substituted <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoates</b> (Ingold and Nathan, J. C. S., 1936, 222). In the present work a similar constancy of P has been demonstrated for m-substituted benzoic esters. When the substituent is in the o-position, however, it reduces the reaction velocity by decreasing P. This is discussed in connection with other data relating to the ortho effect, and the conclusion is drawn that the changes In P are due to a "chelation" process. In the alkaline hydrolysis of normal aliphatic esters from ethyl acetate to ethyl octoate, the changes in velocity are due to variations in the energy of activation, which are in harmony with the known order of inductive effects of alkyl groups. Esters having a branched chain show, in addition, variations in the P factor, while this factor also changes, appreciably in passing from the prototropy of acetophenone to that of propiophenone. These changes in P are interpreted in the light of an interaction between B-hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen, already postulated by Evans (J. C. S., 1936, 785) in interpreting his results on the acid-catalysed prototropy of phenyl alkyl ketones. Peculiarities observed by other workers in the effects of alkyl groups upon reaction velocities are considered in the light of the new results. <p...|$|R

Additionally, several hundreds ppm of these compounds and ppb order of minor compounds were detected in the distilled K. marxianus fermented whey spirits (Dragone et al. 2009). So the level of isobutanol and isoamyl alcohol concentrations of W. pijperi fermented whey-g were low and the other minor aroma compounds were {{the same level as}} the Kluyveromyces spp. fermented whey.

Imanishi et al.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} photoinitiators and reducing agents on cure efficiency and color stability of resin-based composites using different LED wavelengths. Methods: Model resin-based composites were associated with diphenyl(2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO), phenylbis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (BAPO) or camphorquinone (CQ) associated with 2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA), <b>ethyl</b> 4 -(dimethyamino) <b>benzoate</b> (EDMAB) or 4 -(N,N-dimethylamino) phenethyl alcohol (DMPOH). A narrow (Smartlite, Dentisply) and a broad spectrum (Bluephase G 2, Ivoclar Vivadent) LEDs were used for photo-activation (20 J/cm(2)). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to {{evaluate the}} cure efficiency for each composite, and CIELab parameters to evaluated color stability (Delta E- 00) after aging. The UV-vis absorption spectrophotometric analysis of each photoinitiator and reducing agent was determined. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Higher cure efficiency was found for type-I photoinitiators photo-activated with a broad spectrum light, and for CQ-systems with a narrow band spectrum light, except when combined with an aliphatic amine (DMAEMA). Also, when combined with aromatic amines (EDMAB and DMPOH), similar cure efficiency with both wavelength LEDs was found. TPO had no cure efficiency when light-cured exclusively with a blue narrowband spectrum. CQ-systems presented higher color stability than type-I photoinitiators, especially when combined with DMPOH. Conclusions: After aging, CQ-based composites became more yellow and BAPO and TPO lighter and less yellow. However, CQ-systems presented higher color stability than type-I photoinitiators, as BAPO-and TPO-, despite their higher cure efficiency when photo-activated with corresponding wavelength range. Clinical Significance: Color matching is initially important, but color change over time {{will be one of the}} major reasons for replacing esthetic restorations; despite the less yellowing of these alternative photoinitiators, camphorquinone presented higher color stability.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} o-nitrobenzoate, p-aminobenzoate, benzocaine (ethyl aminobenzoate), <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoate,</b> methyl benzoate, salicylic acid (o-hydroxybenzoate), trans-cinnamic acid (beta-phenylacrylic acid), trans-cinnamaldehyde (3 -phenylpropenal), ferulic acid (p-hydroxy- 3 -methoxycinnamic acid), aspirin (o-acetoxy benzoic acid), and anthranilic acid (o-aminobenzoic acid) upon growth and aflatoxin release in Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3145 and A. parasiticus NRRL 3240. A chemically defined medium was supplemented with various concentrations of these compounds and inoculated with spores, and the developing cultures were incubated for 4, 6, and 8 days at 27 degree C in a mechanical shaker. At the beginning of day 8 of incubation, aflatoxins were extracted from cell-free filtrates, separated by thin-layer chromatography, and quantitated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The structure of these aromatic compounds appeared to be critically related to their effects on mycelial growth and aflatoxin release. At concentrations of 2. 5 and 5. 0 mg per 25 ml of medium, methyl benzoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> were the most effective in reducing both mycelial growth and aflatoxin release by A. flavus and A. parasiticus. Inhibition of mycelial growth and aflatoxin release by various concentrations of the above-named aromatic compounds may indicate the possibility of their use as fungicides...|$|E
40|$|Densities (ρ), viscosities (η), {{refractive}} indices (nD), {{and surface}} tensions (σ), for 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone + <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> mixtures, have been measured {{over the whole}} composition range at (283. 15, 293. 15, and 303. 15) K. The excess volumes (VE), the viscosity deviations (Δη), and the excess refraction (ΔR) were calculated and show negative values. The results were fitted to a Redlich−Kister type polynomial relation, and the corresponding parameters have been derived. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} molecular interactions...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in combating tuberculosis {{is caused by a}} poor penetration of drugs into the mycobacterial cells. A prodrug approach via activation inside mycobacterial cells is a possible strategy to overcome this hurdle and achieve efficient drug uptake. Esters are attractive candidates for such a strategy and we and others communicated previously the activity of esters of weak organic acids against mycobacteria. However very little is known about ester hydrolysis by mycobacteria and no biological model is available to study the activation of prodrugs by these microorganisms. To begin filling this gap, we have embarked in a project to develop an in vitro method to study prodrug activation by mycobacteria using Mycobacterium smegmatis homogenates. Model ester substrates were ethyl nicotinate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> whose hydrolysis was monitored and characterized kinetically. Our studies showed that in M. smegmatis most esterase activity is associated with the soluble fraction (cytosol) and is preserved by storage at 5 °C or at room temperature for one hour, or by storage at - 80 °C up to one year. In the range of homogenate concentrations studied (5 - 80 % in buffer), k(obs) varied linearly with homogenate concentration for both substrates. We also found that the homogenates showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics behavior with both prodrugs. Since <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> is a good substrate for the mycobacterial esterases, this compound can be used to standardize the esterasic activity of homogenates, allowing results of incubations of prodrugs with homogenates from different batches to be readily compared...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{ultrasonic}} velocities, densities and viscosities of ternary {{mixtures of}} N, N – dimethyl formamide and N, N – dimethyl acetamide with <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> in non – polar solvent benzene have been measured {{over the whole}} range of compositions at 303. 15 K and atmospheric pressure. The excess molar volumes (VE), excess intermolecular free length (LfE), excess internal pressure (π iE) excess free volume VfE) along with deviation in isentropic compressibility (∆βad) and deviation in viscosity(∆η) have been calculated for these mixtures. The variation of these excess parameters with composition reveals the non ideal behavior of these ternary systems. The sign and magnitude of these excess parameters identifies the existence of strong intermolecular interactions between the aliphatic and aromatic components in these mixtures. 1...|$|E
