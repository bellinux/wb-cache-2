25|$|Flight 426, {{bound for}} Wichita, Kansas, crashed near the <b>departure</b> <b>end</b> of runway shortly after takeoff. The {{aircraft}} encountered severe windshear {{at an altitude}} and airspeed which precluded recovery to level flight. The aircraft descended at a rate {{which could not be}} overcome even though the aircraft was flown at or near its maximum lift capability throughout the encounter. The windshear was generated by the outflow from a thunderstorm which was over the aircraft's departure path. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The aircraft was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|A Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16 was {{destroyed}} on 5 January 2014 after crash-landing at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport in Colorado during a positioning flight from Tucson, Arizona to Salt Lake City, Utah, where a bank which was repossessing the aircraft {{was to take}} formal custody. The aircraft attempted a tailwind landing in low-level windshear and gust conditions, then declared a missed approach and executed a go-around. Upon the second landing attempt, the aircraft touched down, bounced airborne again and slammed into the runway, coming to rest upside-down near the <b>departure</b> <b>end,</b> in flames and its right wing separated from the airframe. One crewmember was killed; another crewmember and a passenger sustained serious injuries.|$|E

500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board report {{stated that}} [...] "the {{airplane}} was seen lifting off the runway, and then nose down, impacting in a marsh {{on the south}} side of the <b>departure</b> <b>end</b> of runway 27 and then exploding in flames." [...] It indicated that the pilot was not approved to fly the plane. Morales falsely obtained his FAA license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown in order to get a job with his employer, Blackhawk International Airways. Additionally, toxicology tests performed on Morales revealed traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system.|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 1996, a Continental Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 {{operating}} as [...] from Ronald Reagan National Airport arriving in Houston, Texas landed with its landing gear in the stowed position on Runway 27.

There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. The aircraft was written off.|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses {{driving on}} the highway stated that they saw a bright glow emanating from the {{aircraft}} before it struck terrain just short of Gander Lake and crashed approximately [...] beyond the <b>departure</b> <b>end</b> of the runway. Flight 1285 broke up, struck an unoccupied building and exploded; this started a fire which increased in severity due to {{the large amount of}} fuel on board for the final leg of the flight. All 248 passengers and eight crew aboard the aircraft perished.|$|E

2500|$|The plane slid {{to a stop}} {{approximately}} [...] {{beyond the}} <b>departure</b> <b>end</b> of the runway. Of the 186 passengers and 14 crew on board, two passengers were burned to death during evacuation. Moreover, 28 passengers and three crew members were seriously injured during the evacuation, of whom two died about three months later of their injuries. Because of rule [...] at the time, stated only deaths within seven days of the accident should be listed in the official National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report, it did not include those later fatalities.|$|E
2500|$|The DC-8 {{began its}} {{take-off}} roll on runway 22 from {{the intersection of}} runway 13 at 10:15 UTC (06:45 NST). It rotated near taxiway A, 51 seconds after brake release, at an airspeed of about 167 KIAS. Witnesses reported the aircraft showed difficulty gaining altitude after rotation. Airborne, the airspeed reached 172 KIAS and began to decrease again, causing the DC-8 to descend. After crossing the Trans-Canada Highway, located about [...] from the <b>departure</b> <b>end</b> of runway 22, at a very low altitude, the aircraft's pitch increased and it continued to descend.|$|E
2500|$|August 16, 1987, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 {{operating}} as Northwest Airlines Flight 255, bound for Phoenix, Arizona, crashed on take-off from Metro's [...] Runway 3 Center (Now Runway 3L). All but one passenger on the aircraft were killed; the lone survivor {{was a young}} girl, Cecelia Cichan, who lost both of her parents and her brother. The NTSB determined that the accident resulted from flight crew's failure to deploy the aircraft's flaps prior to take-off, resulting in a lack of necessary lift. The aircraft slammed into an overpass bridge on I-94 just northeast of the <b>departure</b> <b>end</b> of the runway.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday, 2 July 2000 in Peyton, Colorado the {{prototype}} and sole example, registered N42915, crashed, killing the designer/builder of the aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board summarized the events: [...] "The pilot was performing a low fly-by over runway 33, {{and as the}} airplane reached the <b>departure</b> <b>end,</b> the engine lost power. Witnesses said that the pilot made a left turn back towards runway 15. Subsequently the airplane hit wires, impacted terrain, cart wheeled, came to rest against a transmission pole, and burned. Post accident examination of the engine revealed that the gear reduction assembly had failed. The pilot had designed and built the airplane in 1986." [...] The NTSB assigned cause factors: [...] "the pilot's inadequate decision to turn back (low altitude) towards the runway for a forced landing. A contributing factor was the total loss of engine power due to a reduction gear failure." ...|$|E
