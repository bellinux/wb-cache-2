5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the Democratic candidate {{by a margin of}} 532 votes.

5|$|Bristol City council {{consists}} of 70 councillors representing 35 wards, with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held {{in three years}} out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election. Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> grown strong {{in the city and}} (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the Senate, particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.|$|E
