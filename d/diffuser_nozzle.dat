40|$|The {{objective}} of this viewgraph presentation is to evaluate turbulence models for integrated aircraft components such as the forebody, wing, inlet, <b>diffuser,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and afterbody. The one-equation models have replaced the algebraic models as the baseline turbulence models. The Spalart-Allmaras one-equation model consistently performs better than the Baldwin-Barth model, particularly in the log-layer and free shear layers. Also, the Sparlart-Allmaras model is not grid dependent like the Baldwin-Barth model. No general turbulence model exists for all engineering applications. The Spalart-Allmaras one-equation model and the Chien k-epsilon models are the preferred turbulence models. Although the two-equation models often better predict the flow field, they may take from two to five times the CPU time. Future directions are in further benchmarking the Menter blended k-w/k-epsilon and algorithmic improvements to reduce CPU time of the two-equation model...|$|E

40|$|PZT-based valveless {{micropump}} is a microactuator {{that can}} be used for controlling and delivering tiny amounts of fluids, and diffuser/nozzle plays an important role when this type of micropump drives the fluid flowing along a specific direction. In this paper, a numerical model of micropump has been proposed, and the fluidic properties of diffuser/nozzle have been simulated with ANSYS. With the method of finite-element analysis, the increased pressure drop between inlet and outlet of diffuser/nozzle induces the increment of flow rate in both <b>diffuser</b> and <b>nozzle</b> simultaneously, but the increasing rate of diffuser is faster than that of nozzle. The L/R, ratio of L (length of cone pipe) and R (radius of minimal cross section of cone pipe) plays an important role in fluidic performance of <b>diffuser</b> and <b>nozzle</b> as well, and the mean flow rate will decrease with increment of L/R. The mean flow rate reaches its peak value when L/R with the value of 10 regardless the divergence angle of <b>diffuser</b> or <b>nozzle.</b> The simulation results indicate that the fluidic properties of diffuser/nozzle can be defined by its geometric structure, and accordingly determine the efficiency of micropump...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{energy in}} the urban {{environment}} faces complex and often unfavorable wind conditions. High turbulence, lower average wind velocities and rapid changes in the wind direction are common phenomena in the complex built environments. A possible way to improve the cost-efficiency of urban wind turbines is the application of flowenhancing structures {{on or near the}} turbines. For horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs), applying a diffuser has shown to have a beneficial impact on the power production, but it is still under development. For a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) it is expected that flow augmentation will also strongly increase the performance of the turbine, but very little research has been done in this field. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of a diffuser on the airflow through a VAWT. In order to investigate these effects, the turbine (with and without diffuser) is simulated using a 2 -D unsteady free-wake potential-flow panel model. The local flow field, local angles of attack, shed vorticity, the shape and strength of the wake, and the rotor torque are investigated for both the case with and without the diffuser. The diffuser used in this research consists of two mirrored airfoil cross-sections. The size of the duct-opening in which the turbine operates is varied. This work shows that unlike for a 1 -D actuator disc analysis, the area ratio B of the diffuser exit with respect to the <b>diffuser</b> <b>nozzle</b> area is not the only driving factor in the augmentation of the rotor torque of the VAWT. More important are the effect of the directional change of the rotor inflow and the faster downstream transport of the shed vorticity.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{computational model}} of a generic hypersonic vehicle was developed {{for the purpose of}} determining the vehicle's performance characteristics, which include the lift, drag, thrust, and moment acting on the vehicle at specified altitude, flight condition, and vehicular configuration. The lift, drag, thrust, and moment are developed for the body fixed coordinate system. These forces and moments arise from both aerodynamic and propulsive sources. SCRAMjet engine performance characteristics, such as fuel flow rate, can also be determined. The vehicle is assumed to be a lifting body with a single aerodynamic control surface. The body shape and control surface location are arbitrary and must be defined. The aerodynamics are calculated using either 2 -dimensional Newtonian or modified Newtonian theory and approximate high-Mach-number Prandtl-Meyer expansion theory. Skin-friction drag was also accounted for. The skin-friction drag coefficient {{is a function of the}} freestream Mach number. The data for the skin-friction drag coefficient values were taken from NASA Technical Memorandum 102610. The modeling of the vehicle's SCRAMjet engine is based on quasi 1 -dimensional gas dynamics for the engine <b>diffuser,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and the combustor with heat addition. The engine has three variable inputs for control: the engine inlet diffuser area ratio, the total temperature rise through the combustor due to combustion of the fuel, and the engine internal expansion nozzle area ratio. The pressure distribution over the vehicle's lower aft body surface, which acts as an external nozzle, is calculated using a combination of quasi 1 -dimensional gas dynamic theory and Newtonian or modified Newtonian theory. The exhaust plume shape is determined by matching the pressure inside the plume, calculated from the gas dynamic equations, with the freestream pressure, calculated from Newtonian or Modified Newtonian theory. In this manner, the pressure distribution along the vehicle after body expansion surface is then determined. The aerodynamic modeling, the engine modeling, and the exhaust plume analysis are described in more detail.

Several injection flow rates were tested using both an external air supply and recirculation from the diffuser exit. Compressor flow range did not improve at any injection flow rate that was tested. Compressor flow range did improve slightly at zero injection due to the flow resistance created by injector openings on the hub surface. Leading edge loading and semi-vaneless space diffusion showed trends similar to those reported earlier from shroud surface experiments that did improve compressor flow range. Opposite trends are seen for hub injection cases where compressor flow range decreased.

It provides a model to calculate the compensated flow force as well. This paper shows that the model applies to a different flow case due to incorrect assumptions made.

This equation states that, for subsonic flow, a converging duct (dA<0) increases the velocity of the flow and a diverging duct (dA>0) decreases velocity of the flow. For supersonic flow, the opposite occurs due to the change of sign of (1-M2). A converging duct (dA<0) now decreases the velocity of the flow and a diverging duct (dA>0) increases the velocity of the flow. At Mach = 1, a special case occurs in which the duct area must be either a maximum or minimum. For practical purposes, only a minimum area can accelerate flows to Mach 1 and beyond.

As a second approach six equally spaced diameters in a diffuser are determined by a genetic algorithm such that the entropy generation and thus the head loss is minimized.

40|$|The {{optimisation}} of submerged {{hollow fibre}} MBRs was achieved {{through a series}} of numerical simulations ranging from meso-scale simulations of the membrane module and filtration zone, to micro-scale simulations of the inhomogeneous distribution of filtration flux, and the effects of fibre displacement on surface shear and flux. A meso-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics model, coupled with sludge rheology models to account for the behaviour of mixed liquor and porous media models to represent the resistance of membranes to the fluid field, was developed and used to estimate shear stress in the filtration zone of a 1250 L pilot scale membrane bioreactor. These simulations indicated that the addition of iron salts altered the rheology of activated sludge and reduced the uneven distribution of shear stress, particularly in the lower zone of the membrane module. For the filtration zone design, the highest shear stress was predicted to occur for vertically oriented membranes aligned in parallel with air <b>diffuser</b> <b>nozzles</b> generating 10 mm diameter bubbles constrained to travel in the filtration zone by solid baffles encasing the membrane module. Micro-scale CFD modelling of flux as a function of fibre length, diameter, permeate collection modes (bottom-out, top-out and two-end out) was conducted on a single hollow fibre membrane. Results suggested that the local flux at the bottom was 43. 8 % lower than that at the top for a 2 m long hollow fibre operated in a top-out permeation mode, indicating an uneven flux distribution along fibre length. This can be improved by increasing fibre diameter or using two-side out permeation mode. Pressure profiles from meso-scale models of two-phase (liquid-air) flow were imported to the micro-scale models to account for the impact of aeration on flux. Under aerated conditions, a more even flux distribution was observed for the fibre with a bottom-out permeate collection mode than the one operated with a top-out permeate collection mode with the ratio of flux at the base to flux at the outlet of 12. 2 % compared to 23. 3 %. Fibre movement induced membrane surface shear was evaluated with microscale Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) modelling. Surface shear was found to be 130 % high for a moving fibre compared with a fixed fibre under the same aeration intensity. The average shear stress on a moving fibre could be increased by decreasing the Young’s modulus (more flexible fibre), increasing the fibre looseness and using fibre with larger diameter. In addition, the average shear around a bundle of 7 fibres with high packing density (666 m 2 /m 3) was found to be 3. 6 times greater than the bundle with lower packing density (172 m 2 /m 3) moved at identical amplitude and frequency...|$|R

A few examples of such flows are those associated with astrophysical phenomena and those found in combustion chambers, supersonic <b>diffusers</b> and <b>nozzles,</b> and over high-speed airfoils. For this project, we are primarily interested in compressibility effects near solid surfaces. Our main objective is an improved understanding of the fundamentals of compressible wall-bounded turbulence, which can in turn be used to cast light upon modeling concepts such as the Morkovin hypothesis and the Van Driest transformation. To this end, we have performed a direct numerical simulation (DNS) study of supersonic turbulent flow in a plane channel with constant-temperature walls. All of the relevant spatial and temporal scales are resolved so that no sub grid scale or turbulence model is necessary. The channel geometry was chosen so that finite Mach number effects can be isolated by comparing the present results to well established incompressible channel data. Here the fluid is assumed to be an ideal gas with constant specific heats, constant Prandtl number, and power-law temperature-dependent viscosity. Isothermal-wall boundary conditions are imposed so that a statistically stationary state may be obtained.

The boundary can be traveling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different velocities: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a <b>nozzle,</b> <b>diffusers</b> or wind tunnels channeling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless number.

40|$|A ten-foot-diameter {{water tunnel}} is {{discussed}} as to feasibility and design, and consideration is narrowed {{to the working}} section [...] <b>nozzle,</b> throat and <b>diffuser.</b> A non-cavitating <b>nozzle</b> shape is calculated by systematizing the method suggested by Hue-Shen Tsien. Structural design is approached {{on the basis of}} a six-hundred-foot static pressure head; and an additional half- full design loading is calculated as a Fourier expansion. The analysis of the structure is broken down into a number of elasticity problems. The cylindrical throat is analyzed by membrane theory for the high-head condition; and stresses at and in the supporting rings are thoroughly investigated. More involved methods considering transverse shear and bending are used to check the stability of the shell when only partially full. Membrane theory is applied to the conical diffuser and to the double-curved nozzle to determine the stress state in both under the high-head condition. Shell thicknesses and member sizes have been selected throughout from this analysis. ...|$|R
