While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car, causing Paul to swerve {{off the road and}} crash into a snowbank, while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> hitting the ground completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> Hughes took him down again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they stood up for a moment. At {{the beginning of the}} third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

25|$|In Greenland, {{seal hunting}} is {{conducted}} with rifles – the seals are {{shot in the}} head from a small open boat while they sit on an ice floe. The boat rushes up to the seal and hooks the carcass out of the water (where it falls within a <b>few</b> <b>seconds)</b> <b>before</b> it sinks. The economy of certain rural Greenlandic villages, such as Aappilattoq, are highly dependent upon such seal hunting.|$|E

25|$|Flight 185 {{remained}} {{level at}} FL350 until it started a rapid and nearly vertical dive around 16:12. While descending through , {{parts of the}} aircraft, including a great extent of the tail section, started to separate from the aircraft's fuselage due to high forces arising from the nearly supersonic dive. Seconds later, the aircraft impacted the Musi River, near Palembang, Sumatra, killing all 104 people on board. The time it took the aircraft to dive from cruise altitude to the river was less than one minute. The plane was travelling faster {{than the speed of}} sound for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> impact. Parts of the wreckage were embedded 15 feet into the riverbed.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> {{coming to}} its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end}} of the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E

25|$|In June 2015, CRS-7 {{launched}} a Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 to resupply the International Space Station. All telemetry readings were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight, when {{a loss of}} helium pressure was detected and a cloud of vapor appeared outside the second stage. A few seconds after this, the second stage exploded. The first stage continued to fly for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> disintegrating due to aerodynamic forces. The capsule was thrown off and survived the explosion, transmitting data until it was destroyed on impact. Later {{it was revealed that}} the capsule could have landed intact if it had software to deploy its parachutes in case of a launch mishap. The problem was discovered to be a failed 2-foot-long steel strut purchased from a supplier to hold a helium pressure vessel that broke free due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.The Dragon software issue was also fixed in addition to an analysis of the entire program in order to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for future rockets and their payload.|$|E

500|$|The Glaser {{device was}} a small glass {{cylinder}} (...) filled with ether.

The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5in, 2.5in, 4in, 10in, and 15in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed {{in time for the}} next beam cycle.|$|E
50|$|Despite being top-scorer in Iceland, it took quite a {{while for}} Pedersen to score his first league goal for Viking. His first goal however, was not only an {{important}} one, but also a beautiful goal. Opponent Odd was leading 2-1 with a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> left <b>before</b> full-time. Then Pedersen, which came in as a substitute, got the ball and shot it right into the top corner. The game was drawn 2-2, and each team got a point. This match was played on July 24, and ended Pedersen's many months of missing the target.|$|R

50|$|For {{extraordinary}} valor {{and achievement}} while piloting air mail plane No. NC 13735 {{on a flight}} from New Orleans to New York {{on the night of}} October 18, 1938. Soon after takeoff from the intermediate stop at Montgomery, Alabama, for flight to Atlanta, Georgia, extreme vibrations set up in the right engine and there was progressive failure of its component parts. Fire of intense heat from escaping gasoline and oil enveloped the engine and right wing and progressed toward the cabin. The engine burned from its fittings and dropped from the plane. The pilot, with great skill and courage, manipulated the controls to compensate for loss of engine and burning wing, kept the plane aloft until dwellings were cleared, and then landed in the darkness and without landing gear in such manner that, although the burning wing was sheared off by contact with a tree, there was no impact. The passengers were freed from the plane a <b>few</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> it was entirely consumed. Besides three members of the plane crew, there were eleven passengers who earnestly say that they are indebted for their lives to the courage of Pilot Hissong, who alone was injured by minor burns.|$|R
500|$|All {{darmstadtium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known darmstadtium isotope, 281Ds, is also the heaviest known darmstadtium isotope; it has a half-life of 11seconds. The isotope 279Ds has a half-life of 0.18seconds respectively. The remaining six isotopes and two metastable states have half-lives between 1microsecond and 70milliseconds.

500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] moves at a {{tempo of}} 123 {{beats per minute}} for 5:32, running {{slightly}} above the average song length of the album. It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". Just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't say a word, and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, in your closet, in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E
500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Pedro Romhanyi, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] as a single.

The video begins with {{a shot of the}} band in an all white room playing along to the track. A station identification logo for [...] "SFA television" [...] is seen in the top left and a green graphic appears, showing the volume level being turned up. The camera pans back to reveal a TV which switches channel from [...] "SFA" [...] to a station showing golf. The rest of the video continues this pattern, continually flicking between the band {{and a variety of other}} stations, which generally feature similar logos to real life channels but with slightly different names e.g. [...] "Cartoon Animals" [...] (Cartoon Network), [...] "CVQ" [...] (QVC), [...] "Animal Channel" [...] (Discovery Channel) Actors, news presenters, puppets, a golfer, an astronaut and weatherman sing along with the track as the television stops on the channel each appears on. At one point, the band are shown in silhouette in homage to the cover of Hot Rocks 1964-1971 by The Rolling Stones. As the video ends, the camera pans back to show a television in a room with a man having a telephone conversation. The camera continues to pan back showing this image on a television on a shelf in a small room. The camera pans back through three more televisions, each showing an image of the last shot, ending with a TV in a wallpapered room next to an electric fire. A <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> the video ends the screen turns to static. The Pedro Romhanyi video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] single.|$|E
