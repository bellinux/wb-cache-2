5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist {{who had been working}} to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E
5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and {{he was unable to}} view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E

25|$|During the Lord's Test against England, he bowled England wicket-keeper Chris Read for zero. Read was ducking to the ball, what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beamer from Chris Cairns {{but was a}} well-disguised slower ball.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Roy {{told the}} media that despite {{allowing}} five goals on 17 shots in the first, Tremblay kept him in net in order to humiliate him. In later interviews, Roy cited a general distaste with what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> loosening of standards with the team.|$|E
25|$|From January 2001 to June 2005, Ali {{worked in}} the computer-games {{industry}} as a designer for Full-Fat Gaming. However, after being disillusioned with using his creative skills for commercial benefit, he left the commercial games sector and began exploring with creating art with what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better purpose.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was hard}} to know his background. Some {{historian}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Chinese descendant and lived in Kumemura, but few Chinese used the family name [...] Some <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Ryukyuan, and [...] "Aranpō" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> corruption of Iraha (...)

25|$|Writing in UK monthly {{magazine}} Motor Cyclist Illustrated, racing journalist Ray Knight, who {{had achieved}} a lap speed of nearly 88mph on a Triumph Tiger 100 roadster-based racing motorcycle in the Manx Grand Prix, commented in early 1965 that the ACU had refused {{a request from}} manufacturers to run a production TT race, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> missed opportunity, particularly considering the dwindling support for the 500cc race.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{read the}} poems with, as he later recalled, a {{mounting}} sense of excitement. Ern Malley, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> poet {{in the same}} class as W. H. Auden or Dylan Thomas. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of Angry Penguins and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan, based on the poems, for the cover.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, American {{entomologist}} William Buren {{described what}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new species, naming it Solenopsis invicta. Buren collected a holotype worker from Cuiabá in Mato Grosso, Brazil, {{and provided the}} first official description of the ant in a journal article published by the Georgia Entomological Society. He accidentally misspelled invicta as invica above the description pages of the species, although {{it was clear that}} invicta was the intended spelling because of the constant use of the name in the article. The type material is currently housed in the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.|$|E

50|$|The Killer {{was hurt}} so he needed food, {{so he went}} to McDonald's and ate enough for six. Then he went to get the women that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> his from who <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> impostor. <b>He</b> went to the neighbour's house and got the daughters, but as he was leaving Marty came out and the girls escaped to him.

50|$|In {{his opening}} {{statement}} read out by Pistorius family lawyer Kenny Oldwage, Pistorius said he believed Steenkamp was in bed when he shot at what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> intruder behind the toilet door, {{and that he had}} spoken to her in bed shortly beforehand. He admitted to killing Steenkamp, but denied the charge of murder.|$|R
25|$|On November 26, 2010, the Square was {{the site}} of an {{attempted}} car bombing. Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-American student, was arrested after attempting to set off what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> car bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. It turned out the bomb was inert and was part of an FBI sting operation. He was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. In October 2014, Mohamud was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison along with credit for time served since his arrest, as well as lifetime supervision upon his scheduled release in 2037.|$|E
25|$|Allen Crum, a 40-year-old retired Air Force tail gunner, was {{a manager}} at the University Book Store Co-Op. Across the street he saw a 17-year-old {{newspaper}} boy being dragged and went to break up what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fight. Learning the boy had been shot, and hearing more shots, Crum rerouted street traffic out of harm's way. Unable {{to make his way}} back to the store safely, he then made his way to the tower, where he offered to help the police. Inside the tower, he accompanied Department of Public Safety Agent Dub Cowan and Austin Police Officer Jerry Day up the elevator; Cowan provided Crum with a rifle.|$|E
25|$|While {{serving his}} {{sentence}} {{he wrote his}} autobiography awaiting a new trial at which he would be charged with killing Giuliano. Some authorities were beginning to take his evidence more seriously, and perjury and other charges were made against police and Carabinieri. Pisciotta realised {{that he had been}} abandoned and was threatening to reveal much more than at the first trial, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano just before the attack. On February 9, 1954, he took a cup of coffee with what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tuberculosis medicine. Instead someone had replaced it with strychnine. Within an hour he was dead and his autobiography disappeared.|$|E

25|$|He toured Zimbabwe and South Africa {{with the}} A team the {{following}} winter, and in 1999 his maiden first-class century, a well-timed 160 against Warwickshire, brought him selection {{for the first}} Test against New Zealand at Edgbaston. Still not 21, Read made a good impression: although he failed with the bat, he claimed eight dismissals, six in the second innings alone. He was retained for Lord's, but suffered a very public embarrassment when he was bowled for zero, ducking what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beamer from Chris Cairns but {{was in fact a}} well-disguised slower ball. 37 in the second innings was followed by another duck at Old Trafford, and he was dropped, though he did play in the 1999/2000 One Day International series in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1972, Catholic {{civilian}} Jean Smith (or Smyth) was shot dead on the Glen Road. Jean was a 24-year-old mother of one. She was shot while sitting {{in the passenger seat}} of a car at the Glen Road bus terminus. As her male companion turned the car, he heard what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tyre bursting. When he got out to check, the car was hit by a burst of automatic gunfire. Smith {{was shot in the head}} and died shortly afterward. Her companion stopped a passing taxi and asked the driver to take her to hospital. However, the taxi was then stopped by police and diverted to Andersonstown RUC base, where they were held for several hours.|$|E
25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger looked through {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had found the right actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't remember exactly which was the one he liked. Eichinger looked through the tape and found what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E

25|$|The viewers' {{decision}} in this episode {{came as a}} complete surprise, as Urio, who was eliminated this time, ranked among this season's best and most favored contestants. Before the decision, jury member Dieter Bohlen ironically predicted Urio's elimination in what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> April fool hoax. Subsequently, he and his co-judges watched the decision with dismay and shock written all over their faces.|$|R
25|$|To {{save the}} British from what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{disastrous}} action {{and to stop}} the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson proposed {{the creation of the}} first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which mandated the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of sterling, which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops {{by the end of the}} year. Pearson was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance. A UN force (UNEF) was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when {{it occurred to him that}} something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from his}} {{business}} interests, Landale was appointed an unofficial {{member of the}} Executive Council, from 1946 to 1951, and the senior unofficial member of the Legislative Council, from 1946 to 1950, by the Hong Kong government, {{being one of the}} first unofficial members appointed when civilian government resumed after the war in May 1946. As an active critic of the government, he openly criticised the government in the Legislative Council meetings for a number of times, such as to blame the government for the perfunctory way it compiled the annual Budget and for its failure to maintain effective communication between Hong Kong and Whitehall in London, of which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> key factor to achieve good governance. In 1947, the government started to require an increase in the extent of developments on some of the Rural Buildings Lots in offering re-grants to landowners, as a measure to cope with the influx of refugees from mainland China and the housing shortage. The measure was complained by Landale as oppressive to the landowners due to the higher construction costs that they had to bear.|$|E
5000|$|Influenced by {{the works}} of Franz Anton Mesmer he {{hypothesised}} that the condition could be affected by environmental electromagnetism, but finally his investigations led him to propose a new imponderable force allied to magnetism, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> emanation from most substances, a kind of [...] "life principle" [...] which permeates and connects all living things. To this vitalist manifestation he gave the name Odic force.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s Warren {{was arrested}} at Baxter State Park for {{attempted}} to climb Mt. Katahdin, the terminus of the trail, while it was raining. Warren chose to spend a night in jail rather than pay a $20 fine to raise awareness for what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> unnecessary policy. Some time after the incident, the Baxter State Park authorities changed the policy and allowed climbing of Katahdin in the rain.|$|R
