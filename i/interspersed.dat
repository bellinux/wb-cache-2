40|$|A {{procedure}} {{known as}} mathematics <b>interspersing</b> {{provides students with}} additional opportunities (i. e., brief math problems) to complete math problems within an assignment by embedding brief additional problems among longer target problems. Previous research (e. g., Cates 2 ̆ 6 Dalenberg, 2005) found that the more problems completed on an assignment with <b>interspersing,</b> the higher the likelihood the student chooses that assignment relative to an assignment without <b>interspersing.</b> Some students, however, choose assignments without <b>interspersing.</b> The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to focus on students who do not choose assignments (i. e., non-choosers) with <b>interspersing</b> relative to assignments without <b>interspersing</b> and replicate and extend previous research (e. g., Cates 2 ̆ 6 Dalenberg, 2005) by manipulating relative problem completion rates at various fixed ratios (FR) (i. e., 0 : 1 [no <b>interspersing</b> relative to every longer problem], 1 : 3 [short problem following every three longer problems], and 2 : 1 [two short problems prior to every longer problem]). Further, students were given a choice between assignments with and without <b>interspersing</b> to determine choice consistency and whether a richer schedule of <b>interspersing</b> (i. e., 2 : 1) could influence students to choose assignment with <b>interspersing.</b> Participant information regarding reinforcement histories for completing mathematics assignments was also gathered. Results showed that participants, overall, chose and completed more problems on assignments with <b>interspersing</b> relative to those without <b>interspersing.</b> Choice remained consistent for choosers, but the richest <b>interspersing</b> ratio caused non-choosers to choose assignments with <b>interspersing.</b> Non-choosers completed more total problems on assignments with <b>interspersing</b> for both the 1 : 3 and 2 : 1 assignment pairs. Relative problem completion rates increased for choosers and non-choosers as <b>interspersing</b> ratios increased. Regarding past reinforcement history, participants reported receiving positive reinforcement most often after completing math assignments in the past. The discussion focuses on potential explanations and interpretations of results, and current limitations, future research endeavors, and applied functions of <b>interspersing</b> are also discussed...|$|R

As well as addressing interpersonal relationships (particularly in the Lynda-Spike story arc), the show tackled issues such as solvent abuse, child abuse and firearms control.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} the <b>intersperse</b> coloring problem, {{which is a}} generalized version of the hypergraph coloring problem. In the <b>intersperse</b> coloring problem, we seek a coloring that assigns at least l different colors to each hyperedge of the input hypergraph, where l is an input parameter of the problem. We show {{that the notion of}} <b>intersperse</b> coloring unifies several well-known coloring problems, in addition to the conventional graph and hypergraph coloring problems, such as the strong coloring of hypergraphs, the star coloring problem, the problem of proper coloring of graph powers, the acyclic coloring problem, and the frugal coloring problem. We also provide a number of upper and lower bounds on the <b>intersperse</b> coloring problem on hypergraphs in the general case. The nice thing about our general bounds is that they can be applied to all the coloring problems that are special cases of the <b>intersperse</b> coloring problem. In this thesis, we also propose a new model for graph and hypergraph property testing, called the symmetric model. The symmetric model is the first model {{that can be used for}} developing property testing algorithms for non-uniform hypergraphs. We also prove that there exist graph properties that have efficient property testers in the symmetric model but do not have any efficient property tester in previously-known property testing models...|$|R
