50|$|In {{two-stage}} process, {{reaction and}} oxidation {{are carried out}} separately in tubular reactors. Unlike one-stage process, air can be used instead of oxygen. Ethylene is passed through the reactor along with catalyst at 105-110 °C and 900-1000 kPa. Catalyst solution containing acetaldehyde is separated by flash distillation. The catalyst is oxidized in the oxidation reactor at 1000 kPa using air as oxidizing medium. Oxidized catalyst solution is separated and sent back to reactor. Oxygen from air is used up completely and the exhaust air is circulated as inert gas. Acetaldehyde - water vapor mixture is preconcentrated to 60-90% acetaldehyde by utilizing the heat of reaction and the discharged water is returned to the <b>flash</b> <b>tower</b> to maintain catalyst concentration. A two-stage distillation of the crude acetaldehyde follows. In the first stage, low-boiling substances, such as chloromethane, chloroethane and carbon dioxide, are separated. In the second stage, water and higher-boiling by-products, such as chlorinated acetaldehydes and acetic acid, are removed and acetaldehyde is obtained in pure form overhead.Due to corrosive nature of the catalyst, the equipments in contact with it are lined with titanium.|$|E

50|$|Between 2007 and 2008, {{the genre}} became a phenomenon, {{due in part}} to the {{popularity}} of the tower defense mode in real time strategy games, but mainly due to the rise of Adobe Flash independent developers as well as the emergence of major smartphone app stores from Apple and Google. The first stand-alone browser games emerged in 2007. Among them were the extremely popular titles <b>Flash</b> Element <b>Tower</b> Defense released in January and Desktop Tower Defense released in March. Desktop Tower Defense earned an Independent Games Festival award, and its success led to a version created for the mobile phone by a different developer.

5000|$|Many modern tower defense games {{evolved from}} {{real-time}} to turn based gameplay {{in which there}} is a cycle including distinct phases such as build, defend and repair.Many games, such as <b>Flash</b> Element <b>Tower</b> Defense feature enemies that run through a [...] "maze", which allows the player to strategically place towers for optimal effectiveness. [...] However, some versions of the genre force the user to create the maze out of their own towers, such as Desktop Tower Defense. Some versions are a hybrid of these two types, with preset paths that can be modified to some extent by tower placement, or towers that can be modified by path placement.Often an essential strategy is [...] "mazing", which is the tactic of creating a long, winding path of towers to lengthen the distance the enemies must traverse to get past the defense. Sometimes [...] "juggling" [...] is possible by alternating between barricading an exit on one side and then the other side to cause the enemies to path back and forth until they are defeated. Some games also allow players to modify the attack strategy used by towers to be able to defend for an even more reasonable price.|$|R

These dead hues were relieved only by one spot of gold--the spark of the candle alight in the window of the lonely tower, and burning on into the broadening daylight. As the group of detectives, followed by a cordon of policemen, spread out into a crescent to cut off all escape, the light in the <b>tower</b> <b>flashed</b> as if it were moved for a moment, and then went out.

40|$|Lightning is {{the primary}} cause of {{tripping}} for most overhead power transmission lines. Few methods have heen discovered to estimate the lightning performance of a transmission line. However these methods are not properly defined {{due to the nature of}} lightning which is difficult to analyze and model. Studies are continually being done to discover alternative methods that can be implemented to improve the lighting performance of transmission lines in addition to the standard methods such as adding Overhead Ground Wires (OHGW), reducing ground resistance, adding counterpoise and increasing insulation. In this project, a case study on lightning performance for an existing 275 kV overhead transmission line in TNB system which tripped on numerous occasion due to lightning will be simulated. The lightning performance will be simulated using TFLASH software and result will be analyzed. The influence of parameters such as tower footing resistance, ground <b>flash</b> density and <b>tower</b> lightning arrestor on lightning performance of a selected transmission line will be analyzed and appropriate corrective measures will be discussed as well...|$|R
40|$|Observations of upward {{lightning}} from tall objects {{have been}} reported since 1939. Interest in this subject has grown recently, some of {{it because of the}} rapid expansion of wind power generation. Also, with the increasing number of tall buildings and towers, there will be a corresponding {{increase in the number of}} upward lightning flashes from these structures. Reports from recent field observations are beginning to address the nature of upward lightning initiation, but much still needs to be learned. Examples are studies of upward lightning from towers in winter thunderstorms in Japan (Wang and Takagi, 2010; and Lu et al., 2009) and summer thunderstorms in Europe (Miki et al., 2005; Flache et al., 2008; and Diendorfer et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2011) and in North America (Mazur and Ruhnke, 2011; Hussein et al., 2011; Warner, 2011, and Warner et al., 2011).
