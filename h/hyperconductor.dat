40|$|We {{define a}} `hyperconductor' to be a {{material}} whose electrical and thermal DC conductivities are infinite at zero temperature and finite at any non-zero temperature. The low-temperature {{behavior of a}} <b>hyperconductor</b> is controlled by a quantum critical phase of interacting electrons that is stable to all potentially-gap-generating interactions and potentially-localizing disorder. In this paper, we compute the low-temperature DC and AC electrical and thermal conductivities in a one-dimensional <b>hyperconductor,</b> studied previously by the present authors, {{in the presence of}} both disorder and umklapp scattering. We identify the conditions under which the transport coefficients are finite, which allows us to exhibit examples of violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law. The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, which is characterized by the parameter Δ_X, is a power law, σ∝ 1 /T^ 1 - 2 (2 -Δ_X) when Δ_X ≥ 2, down to zero temperature when the Fermi surface is commensurate with the lattice. There is a surface in parameter space along which Δ_X = 2 and Δ_X ≈ 2 for small deviations from this surface. In the generic (incommensurate) case with weak disorder, such scaling is seen at high-temperatures, followed by an exponential increase of the conductivity σ∼ 1 /T at intermediate temperatures and, finally, σ∝ 1 /T^ 2 - 2 (2 -Δ_X) at the lowest temperatures. In both cases, the thermal conductivity diverges at low temperatures. Comment: v. 2 minor updates, 19 pages, 4 appendice...|$|E
