60|$|In {{course of}} time the {{inaccurate}} knowledge and vague hopes of the early navigators were exchanged for more definite ideas {{in regard to the}} American continent. The progress of discovery along the Pacific side of the continent and the occupation by the Spaniards of the coast of California led to a truer conception of the immense breadth of North America. Voyages across the Pacific to the Philippines revealed the great distance to be traversed in order to reach the Orient by the western route. At the same time the voyages of Captain Fox and his contemporary Captain James had proved Hudson Bay to be an <b>enclosed</b> <b>sea.</b> In consequence, for about a century no further attempt was made to find a North-West Passage.|$|E

5000|$|A {{mediterranean}} sea [...] is, in oceanography, a mostly <b>enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> that has limited exchange {{of water with}} outer oceans and with water circulation dominated by salinity and temperature differences rather than winds.

40|$|While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{satellite}} wave {{data are}} routinely applied over the oceans to extract spectral shapes, their application over <b>enclosed</b> <b>seas</b> {{is limited by}} their low resolution. No spectral information can presently be gathered about wavelengths of less than about 100 meters, thus limiting their usefulness to a restricted number of situations in <b>enclosed</b> or semi-enclosed <b>seas</b> where fetch lengths are necessarily limited. Yet another important SAR application, i. e. the study and the evaluation of bathymetry effects, can be particularly difficult in <b>enclosed</b> <b>seas</b> because of the sharp variations of the sea surface conditions due to winds and coastal topography {{that can be very}} hard to interpret. The paper presents some examples of SAR data which highlight the possibility of extracting useful information even in such difficult circumstances, as long as satellite images are integrated with other data and with numerical wave simulation. Two examples are given: the first provides wave field analysis during a heavy storm in the Tyrrhenian sea during which two ESA ERS satellite passes are available; the second example deals with a storm in the Persian Golf during which two passes at a day’s distance (ERS– 1 and ERS– 2) clearly show shallow bottom effects...|$|R

40|$|The European {{continent}} {{is confined}} by the North Atlantic Ocean, {{to the west}} and north-west, and by a score of marginal and <b>enclosed</b> <b>seas,</b> both to the north and to the south.

Among the major <b>enclosed</b> <b>seas,</b> the Mediterranean Sea behaves like a concentration basin, while the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea are essentially dilution basins. These seas exhibit a wide spectrum of environmental traits, ranging from sub-polar to sub-tropical climatic zones, from shallow continental shelves to deep abyssal plains, from pristine marine reserves to regions impacted by countless economic and recreational activities.

40|$|A {{technique}} for using satellite radar altimetry data {{to estimate the}} temporal variation of the water level in moderate to large lakes and <b>enclosed</b> <b>seas</b> is described. Great Lakes data from the first 2 years of the U. S. Navy's Geosat Exact Repeat Mission (November 1986 to November 1988), {{for which there is}} an improved orbit, are used to demonstrate the technique. The Geosat results are compared to the lake level data collected by the Great Lakes Section, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and are found to reproduce the temporal variations of the five major lakes with Root-Mean-Square error (RMS) ranging from 9. 4 to 13. 8 cm and a combined average of 11. 1 cm. Geosat data are also analyzed for Lake St. Clair, representing a moderate-sized lake, with a resulting rms of 17. 0 cm. During this study period, the water level in the Great Lakes varied in a typical annual cycle of about 0. 2 m (0. 5 in for Lake Ontario) superimposed on a general decline of approximately 0. 5 m. The altimeter data reproduced the general decline reasonably well for all the lakes, but the annual cycle was obscured in some lakes due to systematic errors in the altimeter data. Current and future altimetry missions will have markedly improved accuracy which will permit many moderate (25 km diameter) or larger lakes or <b>enclosed</b> <b>seas</b> to be routinely monitored...|$|R

40|$|Protease-producing {{bacteria}} are widespread in ocean sediments and play {{important roles in}} degrading sedimentary nitrogenous organic materials. However, {{the diversity of the}} bacteria and the proteases involved in such processes remain largely unknown especially for communities in <b>enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> bays. Here, we investigated the diversity of the extracellular protease-producing bacteria and their protease types in Laizhou Bay. A total of 121 bacterial isolates were obtained from sediment samples in 7 sites and their protease types were characterized. The abundance of cultivable protease producing bacteria was about 104 CFU g(- 1) of sediment. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences suggest that the isolates belonged to 17 genera from 4 phyla including Firmicutes, Actiriobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and mainly dominated by the genera Pseudoalteromonas(40. 5 %), Bacillus(36. 3 %), and Photobacterium(5. 8 %). The diversity and community structure varied among different sampling sites but no significant correlation was observed with soil sediment&# 39;s characteristics. Enzyme activity and inhibition tests further revealed that all isolates secreted proteases that were inhibited by serine and/or metalloprotease inhibitors, and a smaller proportion was inhibited by inhibitors of cysteine and/or aspartic proteases. Furthermore, all isolates effectively degraded casein and/or gelatin with only a few that could hydrolyze elastin, suggesting that the bacteria were producing different kinds of serine proteases or metalloproteases. This study provided novel insights on the community structure of cultivable protease-producing bacteria near the Yellow River estuary of an <b>enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> bay...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} temporal {{changes of}} water quality, a role of dinoflagellate cysts preserved in surface sediments was examined in Yokohama Port in Tokyo Bay, Japan. Two cores were collected, and sedimentation rates and ages of both were dated as approximately 1900 years or slightly older {{on the basis}} of 210 Pb and 137 Cs concentrations. The temporal change in dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in the two cores reflects eutrophication in Yokohama Port in the 1960 s. Abrupt increases in the cysts of Gyrodinium instriatum cysts strongly suggests that a red tide was caused by this species around 1985.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variation of water quality in Finnish lakes and coastal regions is high compared with typical conditions in open sea areas or in large lakes. Both the lake regions and the coastal archipelago consist of small basins or sub-basins isolated from each other by islands and peninsulas. Moreover, Finnish lakes {{as well as the}} Northern Baltic sea annually freezes which has a high influence on the seasonal behavior of water quality characteristics. Additionally, the Baltic Sea is a shallow <b>enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> with strong external nutrient loading sources which causes large regional impacts on water quality, e. g. in the Gulf of Finland [1]. In Finland, water quality is currently assessed mainly by in situ limnological observations at fixed sampling stations. Even though the amount of sampling stations is high, about 3000 stations on lakes and over 800 on coastal regions, the {{spatial and temporal}} coverage of water quality sampling is not high.

40|$|Abstract Where {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotic organisms survived {{during the}} Snowball Earth {{events of the}} Neoproterozoic remains unclear. Our previous research tested whether a narrow arm of the ocean, similar to the modern Red Sea, {{could have been a}} refugium for photosynthetic eukaryotes during the Snowball Earth. Using an analytical ice-flow model, we demonstrated that a limited range of climate conditions could restrict sea-glacier flow sufficiently to allow an arm of the sea to remain partially free from sea-glacier penetration, a necessary condition for it to act as a refugium. Here we expand on the previous study, using a numerical ice-flow model, with the ability to capture additional physics, to calculate sea-glacier penetration, and to explore the effect of a channel with a narrow entrance. The climatic conditions are made selfconsistent by linking sublimation rate to surface temperature. As expected, the narrow entrance allows parts of the nearly <b>enclosed</b> <b>sea</b> to remain safe from sea-glacier penetration for a wider range of climate conditions...|$|E
40|$|Sea-dyke is {{sometimes}} constructed, so {{one part of}} bay has been enclosed. This kind of situation is also observed at Isahaya of Nagasaki, {{that is a big}} project of construction of sea-dyke and reclamation. In order to make clean the enclosed water bodies, integrated management based on rivers and watershed should also be emphasized.

Following to the purpose described above, in this paper, runoff rate of nitrogen from the watershed has been estimated, using the two-dimensional model of pollutant runoff by DEM.

When the extended vegetation cover is justified by water protection targets, higher farmland diversity benefits can be gained by including meadow nectar plants in the founding grass seed mixture. The most favourable locations for joint water protection and farmland biodiversity conservation measures are identified at the catchment scale. vo...|$|R
