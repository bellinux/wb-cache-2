50|$|In {{structural}} engineering {{it is used}} to determine <b>failure</b> <b>load</b> as well as the angle of fracture of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials. Coulomb's friction hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material. Mohr's circle is used to determine which principal stresses that will produce this combination of shear and normal stress, and the angle of the plane in which this will occur. According to the principle of normality the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be shown}} that a {{material}} failing according to Coulomb's friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle {{to the line of}} fracture equal to the angle of friction. This makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the external mechanical work introduced by the displacement and the external load with the internal mechanical work introduced by the strain and stress at the line of failure. By conservation of energy the sum of these must be zero and this will make it possible to calculate the <b>failure</b> <b>load</b> of the construction.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{in vitro}} {{the influence of}} fiber reinforcement on the <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> of resin composite beams, simulating cantilevered two-unit resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, and compare the results with similarly obtained <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> of ZrO 2 and CoCr beams of a comparable design. Materials and Methods: Peel tests were performed using resin composite, fiber-reinforced resin composite, and zirconia beams, simulating two-unit cantilevered resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, luted with Panavia F 2. 0 onto flat-ground buccal surfaces of bovine mandibular incisors. The recorded <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> were {{compared with those of}} CoCr beams of a similar size and design from earlier research. Finite element analysis revealed the stress concentrations within the cement layers at failure. Results: The <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> (N) of the peel tests, depending on the beam type and including the type of failure, were statistically analyzed. The highest failure values were obtained with the fiber-reinforced resin composite beams, which were luted with the exposed fibers directly on the bovine enamel. Finite element analysis showed that peak stress locations depend on the beam type and facilitate the explanation of the different failure modes. Conclusion: Fiber-reinforcement of simulated two-unit cantilevered resin composite resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses does not necessarily lead to higher <b>failure</b> <b>loads.</b> This study identified significant differences in peel <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> between identical specimens, depending on whether or not the fiber reinforcement was exposed on the luting surface.

Under a {{damaging}} load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating propeller slips on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine's components. After such an event the rubber bushing may be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed <b>failure</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

The load {{is measured by}} a weighing system consisting {{of a number of}} levers with the final one carrying a jockey weight. The operator lets water into the hydraulic cylinder and as the pressure and hence load on the test piece increases the jockey weight is wound along to balance the hydraulic load. As it is wound it moves along a graduated scale and when the object under test fails the number on this scale is noted and multiplied by the weight to give the <b>failure</b> <b>load.</b> The weight can be varied in increments of 50 lb using slotted plates on a hanger. On the lower scale this reads up to 150 lb, and up to 1000 lb can be put onto the hanger. A separate jockey weight system above this one allowed the machine to measure loads of up to 1000000 lb.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} tortoise's diet consists {{mainly of}} the leaves, geophytes, flowers, and shoots {{of a wide}} range of indigenous fynbos and renosterveld plant and grass species. Some of its more common food plants include Crassula ciliata, Oxalis species, local geophyte species, such as Cyanella hyacinthoides, Babiana angustifolia and Lachenalia contaminata; as well as a variety of grass species such as Themeda triandra, Briza maxima, Cynodon dactylon, Ehrharta calycina, Pentaschistis curvifolia and Eragrostis curvula. A failure to have the full range of these, and other specific local plant species, means that the Geometric tortoise soon dies when taken out of its natural habitat or kept in captivity. The specific diet, together with climate, humidity and soil differences, are the principal reasons why the species does not survive for long outside of its habitat. It also means that the Geometric tortoise is restricted to south-western Cape Alluvial Fynbos and Shale Renosterveld vegetation types. The geometric tortoise consumes at least 14 plant species as food, which includes 64% of Aspalathus species, 60% of Oxalis species and 66% of Berkheya species occur in West Coast renosterveld. Since the distribution range of geometric tortoise lies within a winter rainfall area, the annual grasses, geophytes and other herbaceous taxa are important food items during winter. During the summer, the annual green component is reduced and therefore the perennial grass, shrub and succulent components would serve geometric tortoise as the major food resource. Food sources tend to have a higher concentration of iron and had lower <b>failure</b> <b>load</b> and tensile strength than non-food plants. When eating the tortoise uses a grab and pull method that tends to be used more in larger herbivores. They take small bites that increase surface area to be exposed to enzymes making digestion easier.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{deals with}} the {{mathematical}} study of <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> of glass epoxy composite plates with two serial holes subjected to traction force by two serial rigid pins. To evaluate the effect of joint geometry on the <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> the geometrical parameters such as the edge distance of first hole-to-hole diameter (E/D), {{the width of the}} specimen-to-hole diameter (W/D), and the distance between center of two holes-to-hole diameter (K/D) were varied from 1 - 4, 2 - 4, and 3 - 4 respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was searched using MEDLINE from 1984 to 2003 for dental articles in English. Keywords used were (post or core or buildup or dowel) and (teeth or tooth). Additional inclusion/exclusion steps were conducted, each step by two independent readers: (1) Abstracts describing post-and-core techniques to reconstruct endodontically treated teeth and their mechanical and physical characteristics were included (descriptive studies or reviews were excluded); (2) articles that included FRC post systems were selected; (3) in vitro studies, single-rooted human teeth, prefabricated FRC posts, and composite as the core material were the selection criteria; and (4) <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> and modes were extracted from the selected papers, and failure modes were dichotomized (distinction was made between "favorable failures," defined as reparable failures, and "unfavorable failures,"defined as irreparable [root] fractures). RESULTS: The literature search revealed 1, 984 abstracts. Included were 244, 42, and 12 articles in the first, second, and third selection steps, respectively. Custom-cast post systems showed higher <b>failure</b> <b>loads</b> than prefabricated FRC post systems, whereas ceramic showed lower <b>failure</b> <b>loads.</b> Significantly more favorable failures occurred with prefabricated FRC post systems than with prefabricated and custom-cast metal post systems.

The crack growth criterion was a critical crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) at a specified distance from the crack tip, or equivalently, a critical crack-tip-opening angle (CTOA). Whenever the CTOD (or CTOA) equaled or exceeded a critical value, the crack was assumed to grow. Single values of critical CTOD {{were used in the}} analysis to model crack initiation, stable crack growth, and instability for 7075 -T 651 and 2024 -T 351 aluminum alloy compact specimens.
