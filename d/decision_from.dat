5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's <b>decision.</b> <b>From</b> then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—When {{people have}} access to {{information}} sources such as newspaper weather forecasts, drug-package inserts, and mutual-fund brochures, all of which provide convenient descriptions of risky prospects, they can make <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description. When people must decide whether to back up their computer’s hard drive, cross a busy street, or {{go out on a}} date, however, they typically do not have any summary description of the possible outcomes or their likelihoods. For such decisions, people can call only on their own encounters with such pros-pects, making <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience. <b>Decisions</b> <b>from</b> expe-rience and <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description can lead to dramatically different choice behavior.

Fourteen teams responded to the challenge: The last seven authors of this paper are members of the winning teams.

It reaffirmed the reserved right of American Indian tribes in the State of Washington to act alongside the state as co-managers of salmon and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they had always done, including fishing at their traditional locations that were off the designated reservations.|$|E

40|$|The descriptiontextendashexperience gap {{refers to}} the robust finding that {{learning}} about uncertain options via description or experience results in systematically different choices. This gap has previously been studied primarily with monetary gambles. Here, we examine search and choice processes in <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience involving medical outcomes (side effects of medication). We compare these processes both to <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience involving monetary gambles and to <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description involving the same medical outcomes. As in the monetary domain, we found a descriptiontextendashexperience gap in medical choices. Yet we also found four striking differences between medical and monetary choices. First, medical choices were significantly less consistent with the maximization of expected value than were monetary choices from description or experience. Second, medical choices gave rise to more strongly inverse S-shaped probability weighting functions in <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description and experience, suggesting considerably lower probability sensitivity in the medical than the monetary domain. Third, participants gathered considerably less information in medical than in monetary <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience.

40|$|Time {{pressure}} {{is a common}} constraint on many real-world decisions, such as those made by traders placing orders in the stock market, bidders in an auction, or gamblers at a casino. Many of these situations also involve elements of risk or uncertainty. Previous research has mostly found that time pressure leads to more risky choices. These previous studies, however, have examined <b>decisions</b> made <b>from</b> probabilities that were explicitly described, rather than learned through experienced outcomes. Here we tested how time pressure influences <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience, while manipulating outcome value. Participants under greater time pressure chose risky options more often, independent of outcome value. Our results suggest that, as with <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description, time pressure moderately increases risk seeking in <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience...|$|R
40|$|Most {{investigations}} into how people make risky choices have employed a simple drosophila: monetary gambles involving stated outcomes and probabilities. People {{are asked to}} make <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description. When people decide whether to back up their computer hard drive, cross a busy street, or {{go out on a}} date, however, they do not enjoy the convenience of stated outcomes and probabilities. People make such decisions either in the void of ignorance or in the twilight of their own often limited experience of such real-world options. In the latter case, they make <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience. Recent research has consistently documented that <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> description and <b>decisions</b> <b>from</b> experience can lead to substantially different choices. Key in this description–experience gap is people’s treatment of rare events.
