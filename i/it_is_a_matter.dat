5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to secede from that territory. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of debate to what extent this move was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way {{is not a}} matter of imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly reminded us that we must cultivate our garden. We all know about large prize-winning marrows, but are not succulent baby courgettes more perfect? Small is beautiful too...|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E

2500|$|... it read Pickering to {{hold that}} the context of <b>a</b> {{statement}} should <b>be</b> considered not only in assessing whether it impaired a public employee's work function but also whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of public interest; ...|$|R
50|$|April 30, 2009 The Czech {{police chief}} stated his firm {{belief that the}} {{perpetrators}} would <b>be</b> identified within <b>a</b> month. He also announced that for the police <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of honour to find the perpetrators.|$|R
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The battalions {{were then}} {{allocated}} {{positions on the}} eastern side of the perimeter, but by now they were battalions in name only. 156 Para had just 53 men under Major Geoffrey Powell, while 10 Para were only slightly better off with 60 men although all its battalion officers were missing. As a result, Captain Peter Barron of the brigade's anti-tank battery was given command of 10 Para. One of the official war photographers inside the perimeter wrote:"This is the fourth day of fighting and camera work is almost out of the question. All day we have been under shell, mortar and machine gun fire. We are completely surrounded and our perimeter is becoming smaller every hour, now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of fighting for our lives. If our land forces don't make contact with us soon then we've had it".|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
2500|$|White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for the Education Department. According to Associated Press the Department of Education {{stated that}} the deal <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "permissible use of {{taxpayer}} funds under legal government contracting procedures." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> {{has since}} <b>been</b> {{revealed}} by Doom that the lobotomy only temporarily removed Emma's powers and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> {{of time before}} Emma recovered her telepathy once again. When her powers returned, she joined Weapon Omega's reign, and has since been named Queen of Latveria.|$|R
50|$|Business {{opportunities}} {{were very}} rare, unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of <b>a</b> widow taking over her late husband's small business. However the rapid {{acceptance of the}} sewing machine made housewives more productive and opened up new careers for women running their own small millinery and dressmaking shops.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of rabbinic dispute whether birkat hamazon must be {{said after}} eating certain other bread-like foods such as pizza.|$|E
25|$|Material {{cannot be}} {{excluded}} simply because the prosecution claims <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of internal security, or confidentiality of the information.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> {{of debate}} whether {{transhumanism}} is {{a branch of}} posthumanism and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism. The latter {{is often referred to}} as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative, Christian and progressive critics.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist <b>was</b> <b>a</b> key {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of attacking <b>a</b> doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of defending <b>a</b> doctrine that embodied that gift. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was {{before he became a}} reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|R
500|$|Jackson {{was well}} known for having large bags under his eyes, which he had surgically removed shortly after his retirement. He stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of [...] "vision, not vanity", as the bags had been {{impairing}} his sight. Jackson lists his interests as music, reading, travel, skiing, and tennis.|$|R
50|$|However Fahri didn’t want Aisha to {{have more}} than a formal {{relationship}} before being married. He really believed that. So, for him <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of religious fact and faith, not only matter of love.The best part of this film is the protagonist, the little twist and turn at the bottle.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> {{of public}} record that Apple Inc. {{is the single}} largest {{taxpayer}} to the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple Fiscal Year 2016.|$|E
25|$|Before Kim Jong-un {{had been}} {{confirmed}} as Kim Jong-il's successor and Kim Jong-chul was groomed as the country's next leader, a limited set of Kim Jong-chul badges were reportedly made {{and given to}} cabinet, party, and army officials. There are no Kim Jong-un badges, but experts think that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before there will be.|$|E
25|$|The {{friendliness}} {{was carried}} on long after Defoe’s visit. Miss Parkin still retains a lively {{memory of the}} kindliness of William, 12th Baron, and has a photograph, taken by him in the Rectory garden, of Rector Parkin and his family. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for regret that of late years the great landowner {{has been so much}} less in touch with the parish.|$|E
2500|$|At Pontmain, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of <b>a</b> {{message of}} prayer, very simple in the {{dramatic}} circumstances {{of war and}} invasion. [...] At Pontmain, Mary <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sign of hope {{in the midst of}} war. A place of pilgrimage, it attracts annually around 200,000 drawn from among the people of the region, with some international pilgrimages, especially from Germany.|$|R
500|$|As 1967 began, many American pacifists and {{radicals}} did {{not look}} favorably on emigration to Canada {{as a means of}} resisting the Vietnam War. [...] For some this reflected a core conviction that effective war resistance requires self-sacrifice. [...] For others <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of strategy– emigration was said to be less useful than going to jail ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there were}} big ideological issues behind the {{annexation}} issues, {{such as the}} anti-annexationists' claim that the metropolis went against the American ideal of republican liberties, the argument always eventually boiled down to specific local concerns. As with most political questions, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of private gain {{for many of the}} political figures that led either side.|$|R
25|$|This period {{marks the}} first known spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of Aśoka, emissaries were sent to various {{countries}} west of India to spread Buddhism (Dharma), particularly in eastern provinces of the neighbouring Seleucid Empire, and even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of disagreement among scholars {{whether or not these}} emissaries were accompanied by Buddhist missionaries.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{investigations}} on residual neural plasticity {{in adulthood}} now also include {{studies on the}} recovery of stereopsis. Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially {{if the person is}} not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} decade, and in {{particular}} the last 6 years, the residents have shifted to alternative financial resources with a better interest profit. Most of them have extensively dealt with buildings' construction and specifically with the erection of numerous residential places and new neighbourhoods. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before the village becomes literally autonomous in terms of services and facilities found locally. Pissouri seems to evolve rapidly, following the trends of the globalisation and global investments'.|$|E
50|$|Arden had a {{great love}} of Africa and campaigned tirelessly {{for the rights of}} {{indigenous}} African people. Within the Church he made widespread provision for the education of indigenous black African priests, and campaigned for the appointment of indigenous bishops. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of pride to him that he was the last white Archbishop of Central Africa.|$|R
25|$|After Norfolk, Wilson then {{proceeded}} westward to Kansas, Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington; he favored voting reforms which empowered the populace, {{such as the}} initiative, the referendum and the recall (excepting judges). In California Wilson was asked about his views on women's suffrage and though he was firmly opposed, he evasively said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for the states to decide.|$|R
50|$|In 1849, {{she married}} William Leslie Cazneau. They {{moved to the}} Dominican Republic in 1855. Despite her earlier sympathies for {{southern}} expansionism she disapproved of secession, and was hired by William H. Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, to write denunciations of the Confederacy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of simple principle for her: the war <b>was</b> <b>a</b> serious interruption to further prospects of American expansion in the Caribbean.|$|R
25|$|This long {{tradition}} {{has resulted in}} a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary worship music (often directed to God) and gospel music (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.|$|E
25|$|An {{established}} {{convention in}} the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention—just as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of convention in mathematical diagram to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of some dispute {{how much}} credit Dirichlet deserves {{for the modern}} {{definition}} of a function, {{in part because he}} restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function {{to make it clear that}} no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. But I also doubt there is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.|$|E
2500|$|Dany Cotton said Grenfell {{was unique}} {{in terms of}} volume and {{behaviour}} of fire. She said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for the inquiry, but defended the general [...] "stay put" [...] policy for most buildings by reasoning that if residents all evacuate at once, they could block firefighters from entering. Furthermore, smoke and fire could <b>be</b> spread within <b>a</b> building by residents opening doors.|$|R
40|$|In October 2002, {{the newly}} elected Punjabi {{assembly}} <b>was</b> convened for <b>a</b> swearing-in ceremony. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of routine and all went as planned till Fazal Hussain, a legislator-elect, {{said that he would}} take his oath in Punjabi, his mother tongue.

500|$|The archaic {{concept of}} conatus is today being {{reconciled}} with modern biology by scientists such as Antonio Damasio. The conatus of today, however, is {{explained in terms}} of chemistry and neurology where, before, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of metaphysics and theurgy. This concept may be [...] "constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living organism's structures and functions against numerous life-threatening odds".|$|R
