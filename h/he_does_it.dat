500|$|Christopher Heyerdahl plays two characters: Bigfoot, an {{abnormal}} {{who works in}} the Sanctuary, and John Druitt, Magnus' former fiancé and father to Ashley. As Bigfoot, Heyerdahl had to wear prosthetics. Tapping believed that Heyerdahl [...] "has this incredible gift wearing prosthetics and acting through them and creating real humanity, and <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> with Bigfoot." [...] Ullerup also felt nervous, yet excited playing every scene with Heyerdahl when he plays Druitt.|$|E

That night, Greene assigns [...] Sneperger to set the bomb under Frato’s car and presses the detonator as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> An enraged Frato later shoots at Greene in a park. Greene returns fire, kills Frato, and is arrested for murder, but released after Frato's driver tells Manditski that Greene acted in self-defense. Having had enough, Greene's long suffering wife leaves him and takes the children.|$|E
500|$|Late in July, he {{attached}} {{himself to}} [...] "the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles 'Buck' Lanham, as it drove toward Paris", and Hemingway became de facto leader {{to a small}} band of village militia in Rambouillet outside of Paris. Of Hemingway's exploits, World WarII historian Paul Fussell remarks: [...] "Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> well". This was in fact in contravention of the Geneva Convention, [...] and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said that he [...] "beat the rap" [...] by claiming that he only offered advice.|$|E

500|$|The title character, {{played by}} Rowan Atkinson, is a childish buffoon who brings various unusual schemes and contrivances to {{everyday}} tasks. He lives {{alone at the}} address of Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, Highbury, and is almost always seen in his trademark tweed jacket and a skinny red tie. He also usually wears a digital calculator watch. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically low-pitched voice. His first name (he names himself [...] "Bean" [...] to others) and profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the first film adaptation, [...] "Mr." [...] appears on his passport in the [...] "first name" [...] field, and he is shown employed as a guard at London's National Gallery.|$|E
500|$|Manson has {{referred}} to Born Villain as the band's [...] "grandest concept record". He has said its title {{was inspired by the}} controversy which surrounded the band after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, when elements of the mainstream media falsely accused the band of influencing its perpetrators. The title also references the nature versus nurture argument, with Manson elaborating to CNN: [...] "In any story, the villain is the catalyst. The hero's not a person who will bend the rules or show the cracks in his armor. He's one-dimensional intentionally, but the villain is the person who owns up to what he is and stands by it. He'll do things that are sometimes morally questionable, but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> because it's his nature to do it, and it never fluctuates." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{classical}} scholar Harry Thurston Peck, Demosthenes [...] "affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially {{in the fact that}} his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit." [...] In this judgement, Peck agrees with Jaeger, who said that the imminent political decision imbued Demosthenes's speech with a fascinating artistic power. From his part, George A. Kennedy believes that his political speeches in the ecclesia were to become [...] "the artistic exposition of reasoned views".|$|E

500|$|Mikel {{believed}} his sending off was [...] "harsh" [...] {{and placed the}} blame on the Arsenal players, who he felt overreacted. Lampard described his teammate Drogba as “…special, he's {{the best in the}} world at the moment. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> week in, week out and on the big occasions." [...] He argued the brawl near the end of the match highlighted how much the players from both sides wanted to win. Defender Ashley Cole, who left Arsenal in acrimonious terms to join Chelsea felt his decision to move was vindicated: [...] "I'm enjoying life, the manager's good and after six or seven months here I've already won a medal. That's why I came here." [...] Journalist Ian McGarry reported that Abramovich chose not to join the Chelsea players in congratulating them on their cup win, noting the fractured relationship between him and Mourinho.|$|E
500|$|Variety {{declared}} that the film [...] "Shows the young star [...] as a better than fair actor". The New York Times also gave a favorable review: [...] "Mr. Curtiz and his players have got it snugly draped around Mr. Presley's shoulders. And there it stays, until a limp melodramatic home stretch, even with eight or so of those twitching, gyrating musical interludes. ... These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere. Matching, or balancing, the tunes are at least seven characterizations that supply the real backbone and {{tell the story of}} the picture. ... for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it's a pleasure to find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin' and wigglin'. Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it,</b> so help us over a picket fence." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sibling Rivalry" [...] was {{watched by}} 7.95 million viewers, {{making it the}} 77th most-watched program of the week. In {{a review of the}} episode, Bob Sassone of TV Squad noted [...] "If there's one reason I'm glad I watched tonight's episode it's because I learned exactly how a vasectomy is done," [...] adding that [...] "Peter {{is going to have a}} vasectomy, so he decides to freeze his sperm before <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> This leads to a hysterical, yet truly gross, scene where Peter knocks over an entire shelf of sperm samples, and has to refill them, um, himself." [...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews {{reviewed}} the episode negatively, writing [...] "many viewers will probably be disappointed with an episode about sibling rivalry between Stewie and newfound half-brother Bertram. Both share the same goal– to rule the Universe. With Bertram nothing more than a whinier version of his half-brother, it turns out one Stewie Griffin is more than enough." ...|$|E

500|$|He led the NHL {{in assists}} three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and {{finished}} in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{recorded}} at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 7, 2001. War at the Warfield was Slayer's second DVD.

However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, you got your kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear the place up. And then you get the one kid that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, then they go to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E
500|$|Many Victorian critics {{appreciated}} {{the emotion of}} the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] and focused on [...] "Strange fits". John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as [...] "powerfully pathetic". In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym [...] "Parson Frank", remarked that [...] "Strange fits" [...] contained [...] "true pathos. We are moved to our soul's centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and obtrusive, and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> in words as few as may be: how intense their beauty!" [...] A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that [...] "Strange fits" [...] had a [...] "deep but subdued and 'silent fervour'". Other reviewers emphasised the importance of [...] "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", including Scottish writer William Angus Knight (1836–1916), when he described the poem as an [...] "incomparable twelve lines".|$|E

Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand. [...] At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing [...] "American Pie" [...] and dancing in the same cemetery at night, presumably having never left.|$|E
500|$|The Cat and the Canary {{debuted in}} New York City's Colony Theatre on September 9, 1927, {{and was a}} [...] "box office success". Variety opined, [...] "What distinguishes Universal's film version of the ... play is Paul Leni's {{intelligent}} handling of a weird theme, introducing some of his novel settings and ideas with which he became identified .... The film runs a bit overlong .... Otherwise it's a more than average satisfying feature ...." [...] A New York Times review expounded, [...] "This is a film which ought to be exhibited before many other directors to show them how a story should be told, for in all that he does Mr. Leni {{does not seem to}} strain at a point. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> as naturally as a man twisting the ends of his mustache in thought." [...] Nonetheless, as film historian Bernard F. Dick points out, [...] "xponents of Caligarisme, expressionism in the extreme ... naturally thought Leni had vulgarized the conventions [...] ". [...] Dick, however, notes that Leni had only [...] "lighten [...] so they could enter American cinema without the baggage of a movement that had spiraled out of control." ...|$|E
500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E

500|$|Having {{spent almost}} two years working on the novel, Cleave decided upon using the dual narrative, as: [...] "This {{is a story of}} two worlds: the {{developed}} and the developing, and of the mutual incomprehension that sometimes dooms them to antagonism." [...] He found it technically challenging to write from a female perspective, but felt that it prevented him from unwittingly using his own voice to animate the characters, explaining: [...] "It forces me to listen, to think, and to write more precisely." [...] Kaminski accused Cleave of cultural appropriation, asking rhetorically: [...] "When a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl, is it an act of empathy, or identity theft?" [...] Cleave has responded by stating that he sympathises with those who feel he has no right to write {{from the perspective of a}} Nigerian girl, but feels that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> well. He believes that the best mechanism for telling a story about crossing borderlines is to depict both sides. He conducted interviews with actual asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, a psychiatrist specialising in the trauma of child refugees, and members of London's Nigerian community, researching speech patterns to shape the [...] "quirks and cadences" [...] of Little Bee's narrative voice.|$|E
500|$|Ben's unclear motives {{have led}} to {{speculation}} about his possible status as a villain. Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he really have been the good guy all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and doing whatever is necessary to protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. He always has a plan and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator complemented the video {{by saying that}} the [...] "standout track from Doo-Wops & Hooligans, and it’s given an extra sheen thanks to a quirky, unconventional video that doesn’t shy away from the dark tone of the song’s lyrics". Brian Zacher from AXS.com said that the video shares the [...] "greatness" [...] with the previous one, [...] "Just the Way You Are". James Montgomery of MTV News gave a mixed review on the video, in which he said [...] "after all, it would’ve been easy — and expected — to make something slick, sexy and/or saccharine, a glossy thing where he croons from a rooftop somewhere, removes his shirt, and somehow ends up with the girl. None of that happens here. Rather, we see Mars struggling and sweating, being taunted and tempted, falling and rising again... He ends up alone, unloved. He probably gets flattened by a train". On another review by Montgomery, the singer redemption is refereed because Mars [...] "distances himself from his smoove-crooning contemporaries, and <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> simply by being real. Really dramatic, really emotional, really clever. This one’s a winner, even if, at the end of it, Mars has lost everything." ...|$|E
