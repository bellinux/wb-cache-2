25|$|It <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the {{beginning}} of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, {{more than thirty years}} later, to realize that it was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk, the anticipation of dinner and a book...What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other. p98, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition.|$|E
25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season could be out of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. It <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and not so great if they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 October, Kossuth {{landed at}} Southampton and spent {{three weeks in}} England, where he was {{generally}} feted. After his arrival, the press characterized {{the atmosphere of the}} streets of London as this: [...] "It <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a coronation day of Kings". Contemporary reports noticed: [...] "Trafalgar Square was [...] "black with people" [...] and Nelson's Monument peopled [...] "up to the fluted shaft." ...|$|E

2500|$|Faked (or wrongly presumed) death, disgrace, banishment, {{and changed}} {{identity}} {{are of course}} major ingredients in Shakespeare's plays, and Stephen Greenblatt puts it fairly clearly: [...] "Again and again in his plays, an unforeseen catastrophe...suddenly turns what <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> happy progress, prosperity, smooth sailing into disaster, terror, and loss. The loss is obviously and immediately material, but it is also, and more crushingly, a loss of identity. To wind up on an unknown shore, without one’s friends, habitual associates, familiar network—this catastrophe is often epitomized by the deliberate alteration or disappearance of the name and, with it, the alteration or disappearance of social status." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Clarissa {{prepares for}} the party she thinks of the famous actor Sally is lunching with, a B-movie action star who {{recently}} came out as gay. This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is [...] "only a wife" [...] (p94). Clarissa tries {{to be grateful for}} the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95). She thinks of kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes that maybe there is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. [...] "It <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." ...|$|E
60|$|Swiftly {{the doomed}} plane swept {{down out of}} sight. Gone! At that instant {{something}} which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a bird must have become a broken mass. The other planes drifted eastward.|$|E
60|$|The {{face was}} hidden {{and the body}} was quite still. It would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> that of the dead but for that long sigh, which, {{intangible}} though it was, had broken {{the silence of the}} night.|$|R

50|$|Unprogrammed {{meetings}} {{may have}} a time {{after the end of}} the meeting for worship (called the rise of meeting) for Friends and attenders to speak about something that occurred to them during meeting, but may not <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> something to share during the meeting.|$|R
60|$|The {{carpenter}} had brooded and brooded {{over his}} sorrow till now his daughter's name roused him to fury. He had even asserted a little authority over his wife, and she dared not mention her daughter before him. Daisy's marriage <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the consummation of her shame; it was vice riding triumphant in a golden chariot....|$|E
60|$|Very far off was her old experience--Skrebensky, her parting with him--very far off. Some {{things were}} real; those first glamorous weeks. Before, these <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> hallucination. Now they seemed like common reality. The rest was unreal. She knew that Skrebensky had never become finally real. In the weeks of passionate ecstasy {{he had been}} with her in her desire, she had created him for the time being. But {{in the end he}} had failed and broken down.|$|E
60|$|And {{from the}} {{thoughts}} of the beautiful girl his mind flew back as if instinctively to that strange phase of his life--those unforgettable days in Judæa which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> unto the turning point of his whole existence. He recalled every moment of that memorable day when he had stood among a multitude on the barren wastes of Galilee and, wrapped in a dark cloak, had listened in solitary silence to words and teachings such as he had never dreamed of before.|$|E

50|$|Following the 1987 general {{election}} Haughey was back as Taoiseach and O'Kennedy {{returned to the}} cabinet as Minister for Agriculture and Food. For someone {{with the experience of}} O'Kennedy this may <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a demotion, however, his near five-year tenure received praise from farming circles.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic review {{awarded the}} album 4½ stars, stating: [...] "The cool tenor of Stan Getz and the extroverted vibraphonist Lionel Hampton might <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an {{unlikely}} matchup {{but once again}} producer Norman Granz showed his talents at combining complementary talents... Classic music from two of the best".|$|R
60|$|There in {{this high}} chamber, in the {{presence}} of the living and the dead, while the last act of the great tragedy unrolled itself before me, looking on Ayesha that forgotten scene sprang into my mind. For on her face just such a change had come. Hitherto, with all her loveliness, the heart of Ayesha <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> that winter mountain wrapped in its unapproachable snow and before her pure brow and icy self-command, aspirations sank abashed and desires died.|$|E
60|$|This, then, was {{the great}} canyon, which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a hunter's fable rather than truth. Slone's sight dimmed, {{blurring}} the spectacle, and he found that his eyes had filled with tears. He wiped them away and looked again and again, until he was confounded by the vastness and the grandeur and the vague sadness of the scene. Nothing he had ever looked at had affected him like this canyon, although the Stewarts had tried to prepare him for it.|$|E
6000|$|At {{half past}} nine {{he found himself}} with three hours of good work behind him. It <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> two. He had not worked like this for many weeks. [...] "This is very cheering," [...] he said. [...] "And unexpected. Can old Moon-face have hypnotized me? Anyhow--... Perhaps I've only {{imagined}} I was ill.... Dinner?" [...] He {{looked at his watch}} and was amazed at the time. [...] "Good Lord! I've been at it three hours. What can have happened? Funny I didn't hear the gong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If any one {{had told}} us when Abel Hunt was {{following}} so close at our heels, {{that we might have}} worked this trick, it would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a fairy tale, and yet we have come through thus far in safety, with every chance of gaining old Mary's cabin unmolested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{shattered}} {{one theory}} at least," [...] {{was his only}} comment, and then {{he returned to his}} self-assumed occupation of fluently cursing the steering wheel. I once heard a pirate swear, but his best efforts would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> those of a tyro alongside of Perry's masterful and scientific imprecations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, impatiently, as David wheeled {{around but}} still kept silence, [...] "What have {{you to say}} to me? Don't keep me in {{suspense}} any longer, David. I have endured all I can. To-day <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a thousand years. Have you discovered what is the matter with Kilmeny?" ...|$|R
60|$|Buster Bear hadn't enjoyed {{himself so}} much {{since he came}} to the Green Forest to live. His fun began when he {{surprised}} Little Joe Otter on the bank of a little pool in the Laughing Brook and Little Joe was so frightened that he dropped a fat trout he had just caught. It <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a great joke to Buster Bear, and he had chuckled over it all the time he was eating the fat trout. When he had finished it, he started on to do some fishing himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "What was that?" [...] I almost {{heard the}} words of my own thought as I {{sat up in bed}} wide awake. To memory rather than present hearing the {{disturbing}} sound <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the faint tapping at the window. For some seconds I listened, mechanically but intently, with bated breath and that quick beating of the heart which in a timorous person speaks for fear, and for expectation in another. In the stillness the sound came again--this time a very, very faint but unmistakable tapping at the glass door.|$|E
60|$|The man {{alongside}} of Larry {{emitted a}} menacing growl {{and started to}} spring belligerently to his feet. But he never reached his feet. Mr. Pike, {{with the back of}} same right hand, open, smote the man {{on the side of the}} face. The loud smack of the impact was startling. The mate's strength was amazing. The blow looked so easy, so effortless; it <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the lazy stroke of a good-natured bear, but in it was such a weight of bone and muscle that the man went down sidewise and rolled off the hatch on to the deck.|$|E
6000|$|It was in Will's {{nature that}} the first spark it threw out was a direct answer of the {{question}} and a challenge of the consequences. To have said, [...] "What is that to you?" [...] in the first instance, would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> shuffling--as if he minded who knew anything about his origin! ...|$|R
25|$|Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} visit Finland on 4 June 1942, ostensibly to congratulate Mannerheim on his 75th birthday. But Mannerheim {{did not want}} to meet him in his {{headquarters}} in Mikkeli or in Helsinki, as it would <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an official state visit. The meeting took place near Imatra, in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.|$|R
50|$|On Sunday, 9 October 1994 at 9 am CDT, STS-68 MCC Status Report # 16 reports: It <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> deja vu {{on board}} Endeavour as the crew {{spent much of}} the last 24 hours {{precisely}} repeating many Space Radar Laboratory observations to provide scientists with duplicate images for highly accurate three-dimensional maps of volcanoes, glaciers and other phenomena.|$|R
6000|$|Poor boys! Their mothers, in the revulsion {{from all}} that <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a system of bondage, had held lightly by their faith, and in the cares and {{troubles}} of their life had heeded little of their children's devotions, so that the practical heathenism of their home at Boola Boola had been unrelieved save by Eustace the elder, when his piety was reckoned {{as part of his}} weak, gentlemanly refinement. The dull hopeless wretchedness was no longer in Harold's face, but there was a wistful, gentle weariness, and yet rest in it, which was very touching, as he came to me with his strange sad question, [...] "How does one pray?" ...|$|E
60|$|After three days' search, {{they found}} the hut. The Prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maiden's company that the time <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a single hour. Before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his father's court, where he would make her his bride. When he had gone, she sat down to her wheel {{to make up for}} lost time, but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness. Her heart beat fast and she wept bitterly, for she remembered the old woman's warning and knew not what misfortune might now befall her.|$|E
60|$|Then my {{elder brother}} returned, {{an event of}} the {{greatest}} importance in my life; and as {{he had not been}} expected so soon, I was for a minute in doubt that this strange visitor could be my brother, so greatly had he altered in appearance in those five long years of absence, which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an age to me. He had left us as a smooth-faced youth, with skin tanned to such a deep colour that with his dark piercing eyes and long black hair he had looked to me more like an Indian than a white man. Now his skin was white, and he had grown a brown beard and moustache. In disposition, too, he had grown more genial and tolerant, but I soon discovered that in character he had not changed.|$|E
50|$|Staying within Tenochtitlan as a {{defensive}} tactic may <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a reliable strategy at the time. This would allow them the largest possible army that would be close to its supplies, while affording them the mobility provided by the surrounding lake. Any Spanish assault {{would have to come}} through the causeways, where the Aztecs could easily attack them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891, {{the team}} split its time between Washington Park and a newer {{facility}} called Eastern Park in Brownsville, moving there full-time in 1892. That might <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{a good idea}} at the time, but the park {{was a little too}} [...] "eastern" [...] for the fans' convenience, and was abandoned after six poorly attended seasons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not likely. He is shy and uncertain, very hearty and {{friendly}} {{when you do}} meet him, but reluctant to go into society, and often taking no notice one day, when he <b>has</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> one's best friend the day before. They say he has never got {{over the loss of}} his wife; but I don't like such manners.' ...|$|R
