5000|$|The sine {{quadrant}} (Arabic: Rubul Mujayyab) - {{also known}} as the [...] "Sinecal Quadrant" [...] - was used for solving trigonometric problems and taking astronomical observations. It was developed by al-Khwarizmi in 9th century Baghdad and prevalent until the nineteenth century. Its defining feature is a <b>graph-paper</b> like grid on one side that is divided into sixty equal intervals on each axis and is also bounded by a 90 degree graduated arc. A cord was attached to the apex of the quadrant with a bead, for calculation, and a plumb bob. They were also sometimes drawn on the back of astrolabes.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} using first-principles calculations {{the atomic}} {{structure of the}} orthorhombic phase of Ta$_ 2 $O$_ 5 $. Although this structure has been studied for decades, the correct structural model is controversial owing to the complication of structural disorder. We identify a new low-energy high-symmetry structural model where all Ta and O atoms have correct formal oxidation states of + 5 and - 2, respectively, and the experimentally reported triangular lattice symmetry of the Ta sublattice appears dynamically at finite temperatures. To understand the complex atomic structure of the Ta$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $ plane, a triangular <b>graph-paper</b> representation is devised and used alongside oxidation state analysis to reveal infinite variations of the low-energy structural model. The structural disorder of Ta$_ 2 $O$_ 5 $ observed in experiments is attributed to the intrinsic structural variations, and oxygen vacancies that drive collective relaxation of the O sublattice.
