500|$|Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. Initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiancée. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want" [...] {{since most of the}} series pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he does not like to read, Nolasco was amazed that the script was a [...] "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role.|$|E
500|$|Players at both clubs {{received}} {{the news with}} apprehension. As Ley put it, [...] "When you merge two clubs into one, you cannot have a squad of 45." [...] The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith {{in the dressing room}} at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April. Mark Jones, one of the Oxford midfielders, recalled that the room [...] "went totally quiet", and that his <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it might be hard to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading's players also on the books. According to Jones, Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players' fears by telling them that [...] "we're only doing it so we can buy Kerry Dixon. All your places are safe". Alan Judge, the Reading goalkeeper, reported his team reacting in a similar way—indeed, he described the Reading players as even more worried as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season. Ley, who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game, recalled that the players were almost silent, their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by [...] "a feeling of incredulity, confusion, worry and fear".|$|E
2500|$|Mother Candace Chacona {{said she}} was [...] "flabbergasted" [...] by the allegations: [...] "My <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my {{daughter}} has her computer open almost around the clock in her bedroom. Has she been spied on?" [...] Chuck Barsh, an insurance broker whose son is in high school, called the district's actions a [...] "gross invasion" [...] of student privacy, and supported the lawsuit, saying: [...] "These people were {{able to look at}} our kids in our house". [...] Mike Salmonson, father of an elementary school student, said the matter was [...] "part of … institutional arrogance—a lack of full disclosure and honesty" [...] on the part of district administrators.|$|E
50|$|Taub {{is shown}} {{having dinner with}} his wife, Rachel. He {{mentions}} that his current patient is having an open marriage, and she immediately picks up on <b>that.</b> Her <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> cheating on her (again), {{partly due to the}} recent night that he spent away from home (doing the diagnostic test). Taub is completely honest, mentioning Maya, who people say is attracted to him, but saying <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> not having, and will not have an affair with her. He shortly thereafter leaves after he is called on his pager, with Rachel disapproving.|$|R

5000|$|Ashby {{graduated}} {{out of the}} Oxford United youth team, {{signing a}} three-year professional contract in February 2014. Manager Michael Appleton said <b>that</b> [...] "I’ve <b>been</b> really impressed with the kid since I walked through the door. From day one my <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> ‘who <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Tell me about him’". He made his debut for the club on 24 January 2015, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2-2 draw with Exeter City at the Kassam Stadium.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear that}} the boy lives," [...] the armourer said; [...] "for indeed when I saw you alone my <b>first</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> he had fought his last battle. We have terrible news from the South. The Normans are plundering and slaying from Beachy Head well-nigh to Dover, and the people are flying before them in crowds. However, matters will be changed as soon as the king returns to town. London will send her militia in full strength, and we hear that the thanes of the West are hurrying hither. 'Tis a pity indeed <b>that</b> Harold <b>was</b> drawn off north, for had he been here the Normans would have had to fight their best before they {{established}} themselves on our shores." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{knowledge}} of danger had sobered Sam, and he understood he {{must make a}} desperate fight or be arrested, for, quite naturally, the <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the officers of the law were on his track.|$|E
60|$|When {{the fight}} began Teddy's <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{it had been}} {{prearranged}} by some one who wanted to do him an injury without taking the chances of being arrested {{on a charge of}} malicious mischief.|$|E
60|$|My <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the rioters had flung {{some heavy}} piece of camp {{equipage}} {{into the bushes}} at random, and then the blood grew cold in my veins as I felt two hands clutching at my throat.|$|E
60|$|Neale {{dropped to}} his knees and parted the tufts of sage. Lower down the crack opened up. On the ground, just inside that crack he saw the gleam of a mass of {{chestnut}} hair.

6000|$|... "Sacrilege?" [...] I echoed, entirely bewildered--for my <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> had <b>been</b> <b>that</b> here might <b>be</b> {{something}} {{concerning the}} death of Fifanti, and that the dread tribunal of the Inquisition dealing with the matter secretly, {{there would be no}} disclosures to be feared by those who had evoked its power.|$|R

60|$|As may be imagined, Jim {{felt very}} wide awake when he {{staggered}} to his feet, after being thrown so violently against Walter that both {{rolled to the}} floor, and his <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all the trouble had originated in the engine-room.|$|E
60|$|George's <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his friends, the moonlighters, {{had taken}} the horses away, {{as a favor to}} him, and this belief was {{strengthened}} when, on questioning the woman closely, he learned that she did not know either Jim or Dick even by sight.|$|E

40|$|From what I have heard, and {{recently}} read, I gather <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> {{a movement to}} bring together the law {{of war and the}} law of human rights. This article will be directed toward the possible integration of these two, once allegedly different, dimensions of inherited experience. I propose to try to put the problems of humanitarian law into a larger context which includes other urgent, contemporary problems. My <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> a mistake to separate humanitarian law {{from other parts of the}} law of war and from international law and even law, more generally. There was a very famous professor of constitutional law at Harvard, Thomas Reed Powell, who used to say: 2 ̆ 2 If you think you can think about something to which something is attached without thinking about the thing to which it is attached, then you have a good legal mind. 2 ̆ 2 It is this high skill <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in some measure being applied to the new humanitarian law...|$|R

60|$|His <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Skip's {{friends had}} come {{together}} {{for the purpose of}} taking revenge upon the boy who had chastised the bully, and he remained motionless an instant, wondering whether it would not be the better part of valour to seek safety in flight.|$|E
60|$|My <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the fellow}} was some Ghazi or Afghan fanatic who had stolen {{in with the}} {{intention}} of stabbing me, and with this idea in my mind I had all the will to spring from my couch and defend myself, but the power was unaccountably lacking.|$|E
40|$|The noble crayfish, Astacus astacus, {{is highly}} valued from a {{recreational}} and economical point of view. In most noble crayfish areas, there are long traditions of crayfish catching. The noble crayfish is {{also included in}} national and international Red Lists as a vulnerable or threatened species. Intuitively, the <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such a species should be protected from exploitation. However, {{in many cases the}} possibility for exploitation and local economic benefits may be important for the conservation of the species. For the noble crayfish this is especially true. The greatest threat against noble crayfish is the man-facilitated spread of plague-carrying alien crayfish species. If local people are allowed and encouraged to catch and make a benefit from noble crayfish, this is also the best protection against illegal stocking of alien crayfish. The possibility to exploit the crayfish is of major importance for the will to protect. Examples from Norway showing different ways of getting an economical and recreational outcome from the noble crayfish are presented. Key-words: Astacus astacus, noble crayfish, exploitation, conservation, red-listed species, socioeconomics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{benefits}} that a student, who is enrolled in a business administration curriculum, might receive if that same person {{had the opportunity to}} enroll in a beginning acting course. The author is an Associate professor of Business Administration who spent two semesters enrolled in two sequential, principles of acting classes at Troy State University. The findings suggest <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> real benefits and a number of similarities between the topics <b>that</b> <b>are</b> taught in both curriculums. The important finding of this study appears to reside in the “hands on ” and interactive teaching methods <b>that</b> <b>are</b> essential to the acting courses but are generally not appropriate in the business classes. PROLOGUE In March of 2001 I was a relatively contented professor in the college of business at Troy State University. However, the following month I received an invitation to judge a “forensics tournament. ” My <b>first</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> I would <b>be</b> judging a group of students engaged in the dissection of some unfortunate cadaver but such was not the case.
