In 1956, the Albany County Board of Supervisors asked the state of New York to develop a highway that would {{reduce the amount of}} traffic on NY43 (now NY443) <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem.</b> The original plans released by the state in 1959 called for a four-lane divided highway between NY85 in New Scotland and US9W <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem.</b> The new road, known as the Delmar Bypass, would run south of the hamlets of Slingerlands, Delmar, and Elsmere, and loosely parallel Feura Bush Road to the north between Elm Avenue and US9W.|$|E

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem,</b> seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> near Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the <b>Bethlehem</b> referred to <b>in</b> this passage is the <b>Bethlehem</b> <b>in</b> {{the territory of the}} Tribe of Zebulun, in Galilee, rather than the more famous <b>Bethlehem</b> <b>in</b> the Tribe of Judah. However the Talmud (Bava Batra 91a) asserts that Ibzan is to be identified with Boaz from the Book of Ruth, who lived <b>in</b> the <b>Bethlehem</b> <b>in</b> Judah, and that he consummated his marriage with Ruth on the last night of his life.|$|R
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem,</b> and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E

5|$|The current {{alignment}} of PA378 was first constructed from West Broad Street <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> {{to the current}} interchange with the Lehigh Valley Thruway.

Upon completion of the freeway in 1968, the new highway was designated I-378, a spur off of I-78.

5|$|The {{existence}} of early traditions of Jesus' birth <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> is attested by the Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge {{in a cave}} outside of the town. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave {{in the town of}} Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz.|$|E

5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem,</b> {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem.</b> Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{became part}} of Jund Filastin {{following}} the Muslim conquest in 637. Muslim rule continued <b>in</b> <b>Bethlehem</b> until its conquest in 1099 by a crusading army, who replaced the town's Greek Orthodox clergy with a Latin one. In the mid-13th century, the Mamluks demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt under the Ottomans in the early 16th century. Control of Bethlehem passed from the Ottomans to the British {{at the end of}} World War I. Bethlehem came under Jordanian rule during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Bethlehem has been administered by the Palestinian Authority.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life.
