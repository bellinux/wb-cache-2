The Committee watched with alarm as the Ukrainian People's Republic made overtures to incorporate Bessarabia into her borders. The Ukrainian Rada received a letter of protest written for the Bessarabian soldiers' organization by Buzdugan. It argued that, [...] "on the basis of historical, ethnographic rights, of her distinct customs and of her economic situation", Bessarabia had [...] "an <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>right</b> to complete autonomy." [...] Buzdugan was also one of the founders of the PNM-and-Committee tribune, Soldatul Moldovan, and returned to his career in the Bessarabian press.|$|E
40|$|Resume: This thesis {{deals with}} the general {{personality}} right of individuals and its civil law protection, proceedings in the first instance. Universal personal law as the law related to any natural person, {{is one of the}} fundamental human rights. As such, the <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>right,</b> not subject to the statute of limitations, irrevocable and inalienable. Protection of personal rights of individuals is therefore included nor in the Civil Code, as a basic private personal protection legislation, either in the constitutional order of the Czech Republic, especially in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, just as at regional and international protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms. Civil Code, calculated individual rights (permissions), resulting from the protection of individual personality, only indicative, so that into the right to protection of personal rights of individuals includes the right to life and health, the right to civic honor and human dignity, right to privacy, the right to name and the rights to the statements of a personal nature. The protection of personality is largely shaping with the decision-making practice of courts and other personality rights arise from their conclusions. The range of civil remedies is quite broad. In my work I focuse on the protection of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|There {{is perhaps}} no text with a broader {{impact on our}} lives than the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). It is strange, therefore, that historians have paid so little {{attention}} to the UDHR. I argue that its potential impact on the study of history is profound. After asking whether the UDHR contains a general view of history, I address the consequences of the UDHR for the rights and duties of historians, and explain how it deals with their subjects of study. I demonstrate that the UDHR is a direct source of five important rights for historians: the rights to free expression and information, to meet and found associations, to intellectual property, to academic freedom, and to silence. It is also an indirect source of three duties for historians: the duties to produce expert knowledge about the past, to disseminate it, and to teach about it. I discuss the limits to, and conflicts among, these rights and duties. The UDHR also has an impact on historians' subjects of study: I argue that the UDHR applies to the living but not to the dead, and that, consequently, it is a compass for studying recent rather than remote historical injustice. Nevertheless, and although it is itself silent about historians' core duties to find and tell the truth, the UDHR firmly supports an emerging <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>right</b> to the truth, which in crucial respects is nothing less than a right to history. If the UDHR is a "Magna Carta of all men everywhere," it surely is one for all historians...|$|E

5000|$|Early August 1789 the National Constituent Assembly {{abolished}} {{the privileges of}} the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights.Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms [...] "the natural and <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>rights</b> of man" [...] to [...] "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression".

50|$|Thus, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen) can be {{encapsulated}} so: (1) Men are born, {{and always}} continue, free and equal {{in respect of}} their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility; (2) The end of all political associations is {{the preservation of the}} natural and <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>rights</b> of man; and these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression; and (3) The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; neither can any individual, nor any body of men, be entitled to any authority, which is not expressly derived from it.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{developing}} mechanisms to protect human rights emerged with the Declaration of the Rights of Man {{and of the}} Citizen of French National Assembly, on August 26, 1789, which states that “the purpose of all political association is {{the preservation of the}} natural and <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>rights</b> of man”. State Concerns for the international protection of human rights have increased but from {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, after the establishment of the United Nations Organization, who proposed that one of the aims to be achievement of international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for fundamental rights and freedoms of man, thus spurring the creation of protective mechanisms at global and regional levels, able to control the actual translation of regulations enshrining rights.

40|$|Officially, huge {{importance}} {{was attached}} to the family in twentieth century Ireland, the most obvious manifestation of this is in the Constitution of 1937 where it is afforded the status of a moral institution with inalienable and <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>rights.</b> In practice however, there was a huge gulf between the ideals and the reality. In this marvellous book, Finola Kennedy has shown that ultimately, the ideal constitutional notion of the family, particularly {{towards the end of the}} century, could not remain above and beyond economic realities. This book is one of the most significant to have been published on modern Irish history because despite its place at the centre of Irish life and official rhetoric, there has been little sustained examination of the family as an institution. This is all the more surprising, given the author?s contention that change in the various dimensions of Irish family life amounted to a social revolution within an economic revolution, as Ireland, for so long the exception to normal European demographic trends, began to mirror the trends of its European neighbours...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} teacher’s {{educational}} activity {{depends on the}} presence of his or her particular readiness to accept and solve educational problems and to update their knowledge and skills required for their solving in the system of social and educational work. The main forms of methodical work include lectures, reports, information, statements, practical classes, disputes, business simulations and role plays, discussions, public educational events, defense of modern lesson model, etc. It should be emphasized that moral-value actions of the younger generation are fully implemented in extra-curricular activities since the formation of their social experience is based on their own desires, personal ambitions, natural inclinations and abilities. In order to improve the methodical work of teaching employees of educational institutions, the principles and functions of methodical work should be studied, parameters of its basic forms should be determined, main criteria of methodical work and the requirements for its organization should be formulated. The main objectives of such mass forms of methodical work as pedagogical readings, scientific conferences, seminars, schools of advanced educational experience and others should be determined. The basic requirements for the organization of teaching staff’s work on the only research and methodology subject should be studied. Basic aspects of advanced educational experience should be determined. Attention must be drawn to teaching experience modeling and transforming it into educational work practice. During the educational work particular attention should be paid to the fact that every person has inalienable and <b>imprescriptible</b> <b>rights</b> simply because he or she is human. Primarily, these are moral rights originating from human nature of each person, developing and maintaining self-respect of every person...|$|R
40|$|This research, {{extensively}} {{based on}} unpublished manuscript sources, {{deals with the}} topic of the origins of the clash between the political power and the judiciary within a perspective of institutional history. In eighteenth-century France, from the death of Louis XIV to the Revolution, the traditional combat between the crown and the judiciary was revived after the long break the reign of the sun king. The battle marked the whole life of the state and its major institutions, accelerating the cultural and political debate, and involving broad sections of civil society and religious and ecclesiastical world. All major issues, both theoretical and practical, of the ancien régime emerge from the analysis of this conflict: from the actual working of the absolutist apparatus to the concept of "constitution", not at all incompatible with the system of absolute monarchy legitimized by divine right. To {{the vast majority of the}} protagonists of the political and institutional life, who had a legal training, the "constitutional" doctrine was conceived and developed within the absolute state; it was not alternative to it. The absolutist system was more than necessary for the patriarchal mediation of the judiciary. The "fundamental laws of the kingdom" and all other "ordinary" laws enclosed a set of principles aimed at ensuring rights of the subjects that were unalterable, inalienable and <b>imprescriptible.</b> Such <b>rights</b> - the lawyers argued - could be defended only through legal institutions. Hence the priority value assigned to the judiciary, primarily to the “Parlements”, considered "sovereign courts," and their officials. Among them, those invested with the judicial functions were called “robins” for the symbolic value assumed by the robe, worn and shown off as a symbol of their status. The study of the "ideology" of the “robins”, i. e. the fundamental matrix of their thinking, their culture, their doctrines, allows us to examine the most significant phenomena of that important period in the history of the state and helps to explain the deep meaning of the political action led by the most important socioinstitutional "body" then existing. The robins were the chief protagonists of a dialectic that was not only - as has been argued - the symptom of a particular moment of crisis in the system, but the diarchic essential condition of the absolute state that emerges from the metaphor of the “king's two bodies”. It thus casts light on the origin of a fundamental problem that returns endemically also in contemporary society and states...|$|R
