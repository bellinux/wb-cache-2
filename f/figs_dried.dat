40|$|Ochratoxin A is a {{mycotoxin}} {{present in}} food commodities as cereals, wine, coffee, <b>figs,</b> <b>dried</b> vine fruits or beer and in feeds for animals. The enhancement of its conversion into ochratoxin a {{is considered to}} be a way to reduce its presence in the body and, therefore, its toxicity. In this paper we report the ability of several commercial proteases to hydrolyze ochratoxin A into ochratoxin a in different amounts. After an incubation period of 25 h., a significant hydrolytic activity at pH 7. 5 for Protease A (87. 3 %), and for Pancreatin (43. 4 %) was detected. At pH 3. 0, a weak hydrolytic activity was detected for Prolyve PAC (3 %). None of the other commercial enzymes tested were able to hydrolyze ochratoxin A in the tested conditions. Also, the isolation of an enzyme extract from an Aspergillus niger strain with very strong ochratoxin A hydrolytic activity at pH 7. 5 (99. 8 %) is reported. This activity is similar to the activity detected in Protease A. Data about the inhibition effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride on the involved hydrolytic enzymes showed that enzymes involved in ochratoxin A hydrolysis are metalloproteins.

Insulin (0 - 4 u. /ml) replaced the growth-stimulatory properties of protamine-zinc-insulin, whilst protamine sulphate (5 /tg/ml) was found to be toxic to the cells. The addition of insulin to cultures depleted of insulin increased both cell growth rates and maximum cell populations. In the denned medium, HeLa cells could only utilize glutamate when a small amount of glutamine was included. Glucose, at a level of 2 mg/ml, was shown to limit maximum cell populations.

40|$|Summary. Figs are an {{economically}} important crop {{in the mediterranean}} area. Fungal infection can be observed on figs on the tree, after shriveling, after falling to the ground, and during the drying process. Fungal growth and subsequent mycotoxin production are influenced {{by a variety of}} complex interactions between instrinsic and ex-trinsic factors as well as stress factors and physical damage. The dominant fungal flora in <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> consisted of Aspergillus section Nigri, Fusarium spp., Aspergillus section Flavi and Penicillium spp. Fungal infection can result in mycotoxin contamination including aflatoxins, citrinin, cyclopiazonic acid, fumonisins, patulin and ochratoxin A.

Total fumonisins (FB 1, FB 2, FB 3) in <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> were determined using ELISA, whereas only fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) {{was determined by}} HPLC. In the period 2003 - 2004, {{one hundred and fifty}} five <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> samples were taken during their drying in 7 different districts in the Aegean Region. Among a total of 115 samples, the incidence of total fumonisin in the <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> was 82 % within the range of 0. 16 - 108. 34 mg/g when determined by ELISA. In comparison, FB 1 was detected in 86 samples (74. 8 %) within the range between 0. 046 and 3. 649 mg/g by HPLC. Correlation between ELISA and HPLC methods was observed for all samples. However, no correlation between methods was recorded for the samples with less than 1 mg/g Fumonisin B 1 level (obtained by HPLC). Although there was a correlation between methods for all the samples, fumonisin levels obtained by ELISA were much higher than those obtained by HPLC.

This study aims to prove the hypothesis that export orientation is a major motivating force for the adoption of food safety systems in the Turkish <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms. Data were obtained from 91 <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms located in Aydin, Turkey. Interviews were carried out with firms’ managers/owners using a face-to-face questionnaire designed from May to August of 2010. While 36. 3 percent of the interviewed firms had adopted one or more systems, the rest had no certification. A binomial logistic econometric model was employed. The parameters that influenced this decision included contractual agreements with other firms, implementation of good practices by the <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> farmers, export orientation and cost-benefit ratio. Interestingly, {{the rest of the}} indicators employed had no statistically significant effect on adoption behaviour. This paper focusses on the export orientation parameter directly in order to test the validity of the main research hypothesis. The estimated marginal effect suggests that when <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms are export-oriented, the probability that these firms will adopt food safety systems goes up by 39. 5 percent. This rate was the first range observed among all the marginal probability values obtained and thus verified the hypothesis that export orientation is a major motivator for the adoption of food safety systems in the Turkish <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> firms...|$|R

This paper reports {{for the first time}} the volatile composition of this typical Italian fig, in comparison to Turkish <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> of the cultivar Smirne, and Greek <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> of the cultivars Evia and Kalamata. 73 volatile compounds were identified and semi-quantified by SPME-GC/MS. The most represented chemical classes were alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes and furans. Ethanol, isopentyl alcohol, isopentyl alcohol acetate, ethyl acetate, 3 -mehtylbutanal, hexanal and benzaldehyde were the most abundant compounds. A clear distinction was obtained by applying PCA on volatile dataset among figs from different origins and some marked differences were found in the distribution of volatile compounds by chemical classes. The thermal treatment applied to sun-dried Cilento figs caused significant changes in figs aroma profile. Fig pollination could be a significant factor in determining the aroma composition of fruits. PDO Cilento figs resulted clearly distinguishable from other <b>dried</b> <b>figs.</b> Their aromatic pattern seems to be strongly influenced by the thermal treatment during production. Dried Turkish and Greek figs cultivar Kalamata showed similar volatile profile. Fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> are important components of the Mediterranean diet. In this paper we report the characterization of the phenolic compounds in 19 fig samples: 9 fresh figs belonging to the cultivar “Dottato” from Cilento (Italy), 10 <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> samples from Cilento (2), Turkey (6), and Greece (2). The following phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by HPLC/UV-DAD: chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, luteolin- 3, 7 -di-O-glucoside, luteolin 7 -glucoside, apigenin- 7 - 0 -rutinoside, rutin, quercetin- 3 -glucoside and cyaniding- 3 - 0 -rutinoside. To our knowledge protocatechuic acid and vanillic acid are for the first time reported for figs. A discriminative analysis between the peel and pulp of the samples was carried out. The first crop (“breba”) and the second one (full crop) from Cilento figs were considered, as well as the effect of fig pollination. The majority of the phenolic compounds were predominant in the fig peel. Significant quantitative differences were found among fresh figs, whereas some qualitative differences were obtained between fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> from the same origin in cultivar Dottato, and among <b>dried</b> <b>figs</b> from different origins.

In the meantime, the potential of different culture media for isolation of fungal species from figs was also investigated. The mycobiota of 389 samples of <b>dried</b> <b>fig</b> were studied. Total fungal counts ranged from < 2 to 6. 74 log 10 CFU g- 1. In general, the predominant species were Aspergillus niger aggregate, Aspergillus flavus, Acremonium spp. and Mucor spp. in percentages of 90. 9 %, 63. 7 %, 54. 6 % and 36. 4 % infection, respectively. Other Aspergillus spp. and Mucor spp. Corresponded to 36. 7 % and 28. 3 % infection, respectively.
