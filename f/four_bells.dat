5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> and a clock. The north aisle was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel of the Resurrection. At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
5|$|Crawley's oldest {{church is}} St John the Baptist's, between the High Street and the Broadway. It {{is said to}} have 13th-century origins, but there has been much {{rebuilding}} (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part remaining is the south wall of the nave, which is believed to be 14thcentury. The church has a 15th-century tower (rebuilt in 1804) which originally contained <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> cast in 1724. Two were replaced by Thomas Lester of London in 1742; but in 1880 a new set of eight bells were cast and installed by the Croydon-based firm Gillett, Bland & Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor is}} of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and {{tabernacle}} {{are made of}} Lahn marble. The wall behind the altar held a neo-gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974. It {{was placed on the}} right side in the opening for the chapel, visible to the congregation. The free-standing bell tower, housing <b>four</b> <b>bells,</b> is 42m high.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{there was}} a ring of <b>four</b> <b>bells.</b> These were recast into five bells in 1721 by Abraham Rudhall, who added a sixth bell at the same time. These were all {{replaced}} in the 20thcentury by a ring of eight bells, all cast by John Taylor, {{two of them in}} 1910 and the rest in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Bradford Reed {{invented the}} pencilina, a {{custom-made}} string instrument in the 1980s. It is a double-neck 3rd bridge guitar {{that is similar}} in construction to two long, thin zithers connected by a stand. Wedged over and under the strings in each neck is an adjustable rod, a wooden drum stick for the guitar strings and a metal rod for the bass strings. In addition, there are <b>four</b> <b>bells.</b> The pencilina is played by striking its strings and bells with sticks. The strings may also be plucked or bowed.|$|E

25|$|The east-facing {{cross-arm}} of {{the church}} contains the altar, and also contains a half-round apse that is recognisable from outside. The apse contains a mullion which, like the two smaller windows next to the apse, is filled with colourful glass bricks. The red, green, yellow and blue glass bricks provide the only exterior light into the chancel, that is otherwise only lit through the opened doors of the iconostasis, or through it from the inner part {{of the church}}. North of the chancel, at the Northeast side of the building, is a narrow bell-gable with <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> that can be rung from outside using bell ropes.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up {{her eyes on the}} palm of her hand. The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E
500|$|The {{church has}} a plain, simple Decorated-style exterior, {{apart from the}} tower which is Early English style. The nave and chancel are in a single chamber, {{separated}} by a narrow step instead of a chancel arch. [...] The tower stands at {{the western end of}} the church, and contains a ring of <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> hung for change ringing. The tenor (largest) bell dates from 1908, the others from 1913; all were cast by John Taylor & Co. The church is built of rubble with ashlar dressings. The roof of the main body is tiled; during the 14thcentury it had a thatched roof, but this was replaced in about 1400. [...] The tower roof is a shingled octagonal cap.|$|E

40|$|Quantum spin chains {{may be used}} to {{transfer}} quantum states between elements of a quantum information processing device. A scheme discovered recently BFR+ 12 was shown to have favorable transfer properties for ingle-qubit states even in the presence of built-in static disorder caused by manufacturing errors. We extend that scheme in a way suggested already in BFR+ 12 and study the transfer of the <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states which form a maximally entangled basis in the two-qubit Hilbert space. We show that perfect transfer of all <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states separately and of arbitrary linear combinations may be achieved for chains with hundreds of spins. For simplicity we restrict ourselves to systems without disorder. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

500|$|The {{entrance}} {{is at the}} top of a wide flight of steps leading up from Hope Street. [...] Above the {{entrance is}} a large wedge-shaped structure. [...] This acts as a bell tower, the <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> being mounted in rectangular orifices towards the top of the tower. [...] Below these is a geometric relief sculpture, designed by William Mitchell, which includes three crosses. [...] To the sides of the entrance doors are more reliefs in fibreglass by Mitchell, which represent the symbols of the Evangelists. The steps which lead up to the cathedral were only completed in 2003, when a building which obstructed the stairway path was acquired and demolished by developers.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "{{carillon}}" [...] is {{from the}} French quadrillon, meaning <b>four</b> <b>bells.</b> In German, a carillon is also called a Glockenspiel; while the percussion instrument called a [...] "glockenspiel" [...] by English speakers is often called a carillon in French.|$|E
2500|$|The tower {{houses a}} ring of 5 bells (tenor [...] in A). [...] The {{earliest}} mention of the bells was in 1521 when Roger Hawkyns left 2/- in his will to repair them.

40|$|It is {{impossible}} to unambiguously distinguish the <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states in polarization, resorting to linear optical elements only. Recently, the hyperentangled Bell state, the simultaneous entanglement {{in more than one}} degree of freedom, has been used to assist in the complete Bell-state analysis of the <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states. However, if the additional degree of freedom is qubitlike, one can only distinguish 7 from the group of 16 states. Here we present a way to distinguish the hyperentangled Bell states completely with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Also, we discuss its application in the quantum teleportation of a particle in an unknown state in two different degrees of freedom and in the entanglement swapping of hyperentangled states. These applications will increase the channel capacity of long-distance quantum communication. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
2500|$|In the four-in-hand technique, the ringer hold {{two bells}} {{in one hand}} with the clappers {{at right angles to}} each other. This allows the ringer to either move the hand {{normally}} ("ring" [...] – primary bell) or ring knuckles-first ("knock" [...] – secondary bell) to ring two bells independently with the same hand (for a total of <b>four</b> <b>bells</b> when ringing with both hands). The two bells can also be played simultaneously by holding the wrist at a 45° angle. In large ensembles, four-in-hand is typically used to ring multiple positions or pick up accidentals.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Blomfield's {{church of}} 1881 {{was built in}} his {{preferred}} Early English Gothic Revival style, mostly in red brick with some Bath Stone dressings. [...] The arcade-flanked nave had {{five and a half}} bays—an arrangement also seen at Blomfield's St John the Evangelist's Church in Preston Village, Brighton—a clerestory and a queen post ceiling. [...] The aisles on the north and south sides had brick arches and Bath Stone pillars. [...] The chancel had an organ chamber. [...] The octagonal tower at the southwest corner (a local landmark) rose in four stages, the topmost of which had <b>four</b> <b>bells.</b> [...] The church also had a baptistery.|$|E
2500|$|A Saxon chapel was {{originally}} on the site. It was {{not mentioned in}} the Domesday Book but fragments of architecture still present in the 19thcentury showed that a new church must have been built soon after the Norman conquest. [...] Ormerod quotes sources from the 14thcentury which stated that at that time the church was [...] "a sumptuous fabric of stone and wood, of great size, with <b>four</b> <b>bells,</b> but was then becoming ruinous". The present church dates from its rebuilding in 1827, undertaken by George Edgecombe (or Edgecumbe), and very little of the original work remains. [...] A further restoration was carried out in 1911–12.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{impossible}} to unambiguously distinguish the <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states encoded in pairs of photon polarizations using only linear optics. However, hyperentanglement, the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree of freedom, has been shown to assist the complete Bell analysis of the <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states (given a fixed state of the other degrees of freedom). Yet introducing other degrees of freedom also enlarges the total number of Bell-like states. We investigate the limits for unambiguously distinguishing these Bell-like states. In particular, when the additional degree of freedom is qubit-like, we find that the optimal one-shot discrimination schemes are to group the 16 states into 7 distinguishable classes, and that an unambiguous discrimination is possible with two identical copies.

50|$|For {{entanglement}} in {{a single}} qubit variable, only three distinct classes out of <b>four</b> <b>Bell</b> states are distinguishable using such linear optical techniques. This means two Bell states cannot be distinguished from each other, limiting the efficiency of quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. If a Bell state is measured from this ambiguous class, the teleportation event fails.|$|R
