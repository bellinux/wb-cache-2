5|$|Doom leverages his {{experience}} into {{a deal with}} the American military, which forces the Fantastic Four to work with Doom. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a tachyon pulse generator that will separate the Surfer from it, while Doom devises a machine whose function he keeps secret. In the Black Forest, the Surfer confronts Sue and reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the Fantastic Four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia, where they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where he informs her that his master, known by the people of his world as Galactus, is a massive cloud-like cosmic entity that feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus, who will otherwise destroy the Surfer's planet.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E

25|$|For {{some months}} the new {{regiment}} shuttled its HQ between Falmouth and Truro. In the new year, 509 Bty formed a Training Troop, which continued training the recruits {{under the supervision}} of the experienced 482 Bty. At this time the S/Ls were deployed in clusters following a 'master light' (ideally equipped with S/L Control (SLC or 'Elsie') radar), while single lights were provided for <b>homing</b> <b>beacons</b> at airfields or for anti-minelaying duties at harbours such as Falmouth, Penryn and St Mawes.

25|$|A {{hyperbola}} is {{the basis}} for solving multilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a LORAN or GPS transmitters. Conversely, a <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2a from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2a whose foci are the two given points.|$|E
500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an ocean weather vessel was to take surface and upper air weather measurements, and report them via radio at the {{synoptic}} hours of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Weather ships also reported observations from merchant vessels, which were reported by radio back to {{their country of origin}} using a code based on the [...] square in the ocean within which the ship was located. The vessels were involved in search and rescue operations involving aircraft and other ships. The vessels themselves had search radar and could activate a <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> to guide lost aircraft towards the ships' known locations. Each ship's <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> used a distinctly different frequency. [...] In addition, the ships provided a platform where scientific and oceanographic research could be conducted. The role of aircraft support gradually changed after 1975, as jet aircraft began using polar routes. [...] By 1982, the ocean weather vessel role had changed too, and the ships were used to support short range weather forecasting, in numerical weather prediction computer programs which forecast weather conditions several days ahead, for climatological studies, marine forecasting, and oceanography, as well as monitoring pollution out at sea. At the same time, the transmission of the weather data using Morse code was replaced by a system using telex-over-radio.|$|E

This hit destroyed two Swordfish being prepared for flight and {{the hole in the}} flight deck prevented any other aircraft from taking off. Splinters penetrated a boiler casing and caused a temporary drop in steam pressure. At 16:58 a second shell hit the <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> above the bridge and killed or wounded the captain and most of the personnel stationed there. Ardent's smokescreen became effective enough to impair the visibility of the Germans from about 16:58 to 17:20 so they ceased fire on Glorious.|$|E
500|$|The brigade's pathfinders landed {{accurately}} {{and set up}} their <b>homing</b> <b>beacons,</b> but {{the main body of}} the brigade landed over a large area, some [...] away. The following glider force also had problems; weather conditions forced the brigade's anti-tank unit to turn back for Italy and [...] return with the second wave later that day. Eventually the brigade captured their primary objectives, but the lack of manpower meant that their secondary objective of Le Muy was given to the American airborne forces. The seaborne and airborne landings linked up within two days, and the brigade became the reserve formation for the operation.|$|R

[...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up.

500|$|After Shōkaku and Zuikaku had {{recovered}} the aircraft that had sunk Neosho and Sims, Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara, {{commander of the}} 5th Carrier Division, ordered that a further air strike be readied as the American carriers were {{believed to have been}} located. The two carriers launched a total of 12 Aichi D3A [...] "Val" [...] dive bombers and 15 Nakajima B5N [...] "Kate" [...] torpedo bombers late that afternoon. The Japanese had mistaken Task Force 44 for Lexington and Yorktown, which were much closer than anticipated, although they were along the same bearing. Lexingtons radar spotted one group of nine B5Ns at 17:47 and half the CAP was directed to intercept them while additional Wildcats were launched to reinforce the CAP. The intercepting fighters surprised the Japanese bombers and shot down five while losing one of their own. One section of the newly launched fighters spotted the remaining group of six B5Ns, shooting down two and badly damaging another bomber, although one Wildcat was lost to unknown causes. Another section spotted and shot down a single D3A. The surviving Japanese leaders cancelled the attack after such heavy losses and all aircraft jettisoned their bombs and torpedoes. They had still not spotted the American carriers and turned for their own ships, using radio direction finders to track the carrier's <b>homing</b> <b>beacon.</b> The beacon broadcast on a frequency very close to that of the American ships and many of the Japanese aircraft confused the ships in the darkness. A number of them flew right beside the American ships, flashing signal lights in an effort to confirm their identity, but they were not initially recognized as Japanese because the remaining Wildcats were attempting to land aboard the carriers. Finally they were recognized and fired upon, by both the Wildcats and the anti-aircraft guns of the task force, but they sustained no losses in the confused action. One Wildcat lost radio contact and could not find either of the American carriers; the pilot was never found. Only 18 Japanese aircraft successfully returned to their carriers, beginning at 20:00.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, RAF Fighter Command {{planned to}} use the {{airfield}} for an experimental unit, and after requisitioning land from several adjacent farms, contracted George Wimpey and Company to begin work on 11 June 1941. However, its intended use soon changed into being a satellite airfield for the fighter squadrons based at RAF Colerne. Originally, the new airfield's name was to be RAF Broadfield Down. The runways used the standard triangular pattern. The main, east-west runway was [...] long, with a designated alignment of 28/10, {{and the others were}} [...] aligned 21/03 and [...] aligned 34/16. The first aircraft to land was a Luftwaffe Ju 88 at 06.20 on 24 July 1941.

5000|$|Wraith civilization {{centers around}} massive hive ships, {{of which there}} are over sixty in the Pegasus galaxy. Most hive ships are ruled by Queens, {{although}} Todd mentions in [...] that after years of conflict many hives are now without Queens and cannot replenish their numbers. The Wraith perform mass human cullings once every few centuries; {{the rest of the time}} they hibernate within their hive ships on the surface of planets, guarded by a small force of soldiers and the Keeper (of those who sleep). This hibernation allows the human population of Pegasus to replenish its numbers. During cullings, Wraith hive ships unleash hundreds of darts to scour the surface of the target planet, and dial the planet's Stargate to prevent escape. If given the opportunity, individual Wraith will self-destruct rather than be captured, using a powerful explosive device built into their armor. Wraith warriors are also equipped with <b>homing</b> <b>beacons</b> to signal for reinforcements if required.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 April 1942, Avenger started {{flight deck}} landing {{training}} with four Fairey Swordfish aircraft of 816 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm. The exercise {{had to be}} curtailed when her engines broke down. Repaired by 30 April 1942, she joined the escort for convoy AT 17 to cross the Atlantic to Britain. During the crossing the Swordfish of 816 Squadron provided anti-submarine patrols. On 4 May, two aircraft lost the convoy in heavy weather and requested a <b>homing</b> <b>beacon</b> from Avenger. She was unable to help, not having the correct equipment, and both aircraft and crews were reported missing. When Avenger arrived in Britain the Fleet Air Arm had a shortage of Martlet fighter aircraft, [...] so {{a small number of}} Royal Air Force Hawker Hurricanes were converted into Sea Hurricanes.

Just before they closed on the convoy a Swordfish attacked a surfaced U-boat. The two bombs caused no damage to the submarine which returned fire, damaging the plane and wounding the air observer. Their relief shadowed the submarine until it dived when it carried out another unsuccessful attack. At 13:45, Biter closed with the convoy and commenced anti-submarine patrols. The convoy reached Britain on 16 May without any loss, and Biter was ordered to the Clyde. As a result of Biter′s experiences on these early convoys, the complement of aircraft carried was increased to 15 bombers and six fighters, with a 50% increase in air crews. <b>Homing</b> <b>beacons</b> were to be fitted to all carriers together with a Type 237 blind approach beam system for use in poor visibility.|$|R
500|$|A bite from a {{radioactive}} spider triggers {{mutations in}} Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers. In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man {{has the ability}} to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility. [...] The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters. This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to swing from, a net to snare or bind enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider wing. Other equipment include a light beacon that can either be used as a flashlight or project a [...] "Spider-Signal" [...] design, a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically, and spider-tracers, which are spider-shaped adhesive <b>homing</b> <b>beacons</b> keyed to his own spider-sense.|$|R
