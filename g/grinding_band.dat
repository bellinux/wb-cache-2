5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early <b>grind</b> <b>bands,</b> powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|R

5000|$|Abaddon Incarnate {{was formed}} in Dublin in 1994, playing fast death metal with grindcore elements. Under the name Bereaved the band {{released}} two demo cassette tapes, Signs of Death in 1992 and Tortured Souls in 1994.

5000|$|Disembowelment, often styled as diSEMBOWELMENT, was an Australian death/doom {{band that}} formed in Melbourne in November 1989 {{out of the}} ashes of a two-piece <b>grind</b> <b>band</b> Bacteria, {{featuring}} Renato Gallina on guitar and vocals, and Paul Mazziotta on drums. With the help of Dean Ruprich from Melbourne death/grind band Necrotomy providing session bass guitar, the band released its first demo, [...] "Mourning September" [...] in September 1990. Disembowelment played a very slow form of doom - with occasional bursts of great speed - that relied equally on the atmospheric effects of droning guitars and constant riffing. The band was known for its atmospheric chanting, slow riffs and spiritual dark elements present in their symphonic, heavily distorted style. They are often credited with spawning the funeral doom movement that developed years later.|$|R
5000|$|... "Discordance Axis was a three piece <b>grind</b> core <b>band</b> {{that started}} in NJ around 1992.

50|$|Gallina and Skarajew {{continued}} {{working together}} in the ethno ambient act, Trial of the Bow, which Skarajew had initiated during his time in Disembowelment. The group released an EP, Ornamentation and an album, Rite of Passage to critical approval, notably Rolling Stone and Wired Magazine. Trial of the Bow was licensed to Rykodisc soon after. From 2004 Skarajew and Mazziotta formed a <b>grind</b> <b>band,</b> Pulgar. In October 2005 Disembowelment's catalogue was re-released as a double and limited edition triple CD, Disembowelment by Relapse Records. Two different Limited Edition Vinyl Box sets were later released. A related band, d.USK, formed in 2010 with original Disembowelment members Skarajew and Mazziotta and played some their former group's material as a live band.

The band's debut album, One Man's Trash (Is Another Man's Treasure), met with some local success and was positively reviewed by Michael Stipe of R.E.M. on his blog. Shortly after the 1992 release of their second album, Lefty's Deceiver, Hayes and new drummer Rob Clayton, along with Atlanta performance artist and poet Deacon Lunchbox, {{were killed in}} a car accident.

2500|$|Sydney label [...] was {{established}} in the early 2000s (decade) by the vocalist of grindcore band Ebolie to release not only his own albums but those from other groups, mostly other Sydney grind and brutal death metal acts. [...] The label has since released a wider range of extreme styles including doom and sludge bands as well as a few international releases and has been running two all day festivals: Slaughterfest, which showcases a mixed line up of Death, Grindcore and Doom bands and East West Death Grind Fest which focuses mainly on Brutal Death Metal and Grindcore bands. Another label specialising in grind is Melbourne's , set up by two members of Fuck... I'm Dead and releasing both local and international <b>grind</b> and death <b>bands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in early 2006 by Sanders and singer Jamie Ludbrook with the {{original}} intention of reforming Damaged, a <b>grind</b> and death <b>band</b> that {{had been one of}} the most popular acts on the domestic music scene during the 1990s, releasing three albums and enduring various periods of well-documented instability and turmoil. Recruiting guitarist Dan [...] "Fanza" [...] O'Grady and contrabassist Dav Byrne, Sanders and Ludbrook opted for the name Terrorust instead and began work on a CD almost immediately. Apparently insisting on complete independence, the band recorded, produced, and pressed the album itself. Post Mortal Archives was released in mid-2006 in a limited pressing of 1000 hand-numbered copies. The album featured guest contributions from members of Blood Duster, Fuck... I'm Dead and Bestial Warlust.|$|R
50|$|Joel Grind founded Toxic Holocaust in 1999. He {{originally}} {{wrote and}} recorded {{all of the}} band's music himself, and {{after a couple of}} demo releases (Radiation Sickness, 1999; Critical Mass, 2002), he made his official full-length album debut as Toxic Holocaust with Evil Never Dies (2003). Two years later, after some touring with a hired backing <b>band,</b> <b>Grind</b> released the second Toxic Holocaust album, Hell on Earth (2005), which once again he wrote and recorded by himself. The album notably features cover art by Ed Repka, known for having created iconic covers for albums by Megadeth, Death and others. Extensive touring followed, along with a recording contract with Relapse Records. In addition to releasing the third Toxic Holocaust album, An Overdose of Death... (2008), Relapse reissued Evil Never Dies and Hell on Earth. Toxic Holocaust also recorded and released a number of other recordings: Gravelord (2009, EP), Conjure and Command (2011), and Chemistry of Consciousness (2013).|$|R
50|$|Skid Row wrote most of Slave to the Grind in a New Jersey {{studio and}} demoed the tracks with Michael Wagener, who {{produced}} its previous album. Recording {{took place at}} two studios: New River in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Scream in Studio City, California. Slave to the <b>Grind</b> marked the <b>band's</b> move toward a heavier sound, with the title track verging on speed metal. The lyrics were more complex, criticizing modern ways of life, authority, politics, drugs, and organized religion, among other topics. Wagener said the demoing and pre-production went well, and the title track was recorded and mixed in an hour, and {{was placed on the}} album without being remixed. Sebastian Bach's father, David Bierk, painted the cover art, which is actually a long mural, continued inside the album's booklet. Although it is set in the medieval era, it depicts people using modern technological gadgets. The cover was inspired by Caravaggio's Burial of St. Lucy from 1608 and shows John F. Kennedy in the crowd.|$|R
5000|$|Superheist {{were formed}} in Frankston, Victoria in 1993. The {{original}} line-up was Rod “Berger” McLeod on vocals, DW Norton on guitar, Sean “Seanheist” Pentecost on drums, Fetah Sabawi on keyboards and samples, and Adrian Sudborough on bass. The band was originally {{to be named}} Orgheist, which {{was inspired by the}} European <b>grind</b> core <b>bands</b> that they were influenced by at the time. The name was soon altered to Superheist, Berger supplied the [...] "Super" [...] while DW provided the [...] "Heist". McLeod and Norton met at Overport primary school in Frankston Victoria in 1980 and later attended Frankston High School together: Sean Pentecost was a mutual friend who worked at the local music store, Frankston Guitar Village, and had previously played with Norton, Mcleod and Sudborough in the alt rock band Big Pop Monsters. Superheist's first live performance was at the 21st Century Dance Club, Frankston supporting the Cosmic Psychos. In 1994 they issued a five-track extended play cassette, Apocalypse, which was recorded at Backbeach Studios in Rye, Victoria and later distributed by Warhead records, The band’s style at this early stage was grindcore, in the Napalm Death mould and incorporated synth tones, samples and clean vocals mixed amongst the brutal blast beats and death growls. The band’s focus was to push the boundaries of extreme metal whilst introducing pop and nu-wave inspired melodies and hook lines. The demo was met with rave reviews across the country and as the band began touring nationally they quickly gained a loyal and fanatic following. Later that year bassist Sudborough was replaced with Adam [...] "Donut" [...] Donath and the next year was spent touring the country with bands such as In:Extremis, Damaged and Beanflipper. Superheist were now a regular feature of the Melbourne grind scene and played at such venues as The GB and The Hell Club, the band were learning their craft and honing what would eventually become the foundation for a world class live show. In early December 1995 they appeared at the annual Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra, which raised funds for the National Brain Injury Foundation. This pivotal performance helped the band set themselves up {{for the next few years}} to come. They returned for the 1996 festival but by that time Seanheist had left the group due to his waining interest in playing extreme metal. Aaren “Suds” Suttil (1974-2006) of Dreadnaught replaced him on drums.|$|R
