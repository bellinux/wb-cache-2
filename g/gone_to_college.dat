5|$|You Me at Six {{formed in}} Weybridge, Surrey in 2004. The band's line-up {{consisted}} of vocalist Josh Franceschi, guitarists Max Helyer and Chris Miller, bassist Matt Barnes, and drummer Joe Phillips. The group released an EP, We Know What It Means to Be Alone in 2006, after which, Phillips left the band. Dan Flint, a friend the band had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> with, was initially asked {{to fill in}} on drums for a tour. He ended up becoming Phillips' permanent replacement following the band's appearance at Slam Dunk Festival 2007. The band then released another EP later in 2007.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{referring}} {{to the level of}} education, college is the term more used to be synonymous to tertiary or higher education.

500|$|Extraordinary {{events had}} {{recently}} transpired in England, with King Charles I executed, {{power in the}} hands of a commoner, and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans. The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright, the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, with whom Wheelwright had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> Henry Vane, who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy, had also reached high positions in government. These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty, but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s. Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England. Wheelwright was well received by Cromwell, who once described his classmate this way: [...] "I remember the time when I was more afraid of meeting Wheelwright at football than I have been since of meeting an army in the field, for I was infallibly sure of being tripped up by him". Wheelwright wrote a letter to his church in Hampton, dated 20 April 1658, in which he described his meeting with Cromwell, writing, [...] "I had discourse in private about the space of an hour. All his speeches seemed to me very orthodox and gracious".|$|E

If I hadn't <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> and had signed right out of high school, I might have had one bad year and quit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1906 and 1908, a {{movement}} developed to eliminate football from university sports programs {{on grounds that}} it was too brutal and was attracting professionalism to the college campuses. However, Murphy remained a strong supporter of college football. In 1908, he told The Washington Post:"Fellows, show me a man that has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> for four years and played on either his varsity or scrub football team and I'll show you a man that'll make good on any job he tackles when he gets out into the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brennan (who was now {{a senior}} at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was {{supportive}} of Jobs {{when he told her}} he planned to drop out of Reed because {{he did not want to}} spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college).</b> He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again. In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: [...] "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts." ...|$|E

His face was featureless, save for gaping orifices and for the lidless eyes that burned under hairless brows.|$|E

"But before I {{enter on}} that question, {{let me just}} touch a point on which your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very evening on which I once before {{fulfilled}} a mission from Fred, just after he had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> Mr. Garth told me {{what happened on the}} night of Featherstone's death--how you refused to burn the will; and he said that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had been the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand pounds.

In a couple of months every one accepted the order of things; and life at Normanstand went on much as it had done before Harold had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> There was a man in the house now instead of a boy: that was all. Stephen too was beginning to be a young woman, but the relative positions were the same as they had been. Her growth did not seem to make an ostensible difference to any one. The one who might have noticed it most, Mrs. Jarrold, had died during the last year of Harold's life at college.|$|E

Airey Force, as everybody knows, is a waterfall near to the shores of the lake, and is the great lion of the Lake scenery {{on that side of the}} mountains. The waterfall was full fifteen miles from Humblethwaite, but the distance had been done before, and could be done again. Emily, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and two other young ladies were to go. Mr. Fitzpatrick would sit on the box. There was a youth there also who had left school and not yet <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> He was to be allowed to drive a dog-cart.
