5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
25|$|Penniless, Aspasia, {{with her}} daughter, chose {{to follow her}} in-laws to the exile in early 1924. They found refuge with Queen Sophia, {{who moved to the}} Villa Bobolina in Fiesole near Florence shortly after the death of her husband in December 1923. The now Dowager Queen, who adored Alexandra, was delighted, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> {{financial}} situation was also precarious.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired studio audience, combined {{with two of the}} panellists, disagreed with the decision, feeling that Claire should have been fired for her complete lack of respect, although Simon himself said that he deserved to be fired.

25|$|The old Tsarist Copyright law of 1911 was not {{immediately}} invalidated after the October Revolution. The old law, with its copyright term of 50 years after the author's death and its possibility of transferring copyrights in their entirety from an author to a publisher, continued to be valid initially. But the nationalizations {{in all areas of}} the economy soon considerably restricted the avenues through which an author could publish her or his work, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> or his copyright remained initially untouched. All publishing activities were placed {{under the supervision of the}} State Publishing house by a decree of May 21, 1919. On July 29, 1919, the government declared a state monopoly on unpublished works of deceased authors; and on April 20, 1920, all books (including those in private possession) were nationalized, except those in public libraries. Theatres and film studios as well as the photographic industry were nationalized in August 1919. Private publishing houses were eventually liquidated as well. The right to translate foreign publications into Russian was also monopolized by the government.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly writer Michael Slezak {{described}} Carey's boots as [...] "hot", and considered the cinematography of the music video [...] "gorgeous". He also complimented several aspects of the video, saying, [...] "Mariah’s bod looks totally smokin’, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> entire wardrobe should be donated to a charity benefiting teenage strumpets and/or truck-stop hookers.

500|$|The woman's film Laaga Chunari Mein Daag from {{director}} Pradeep Sarkar was Mukerji's second {{release that}} year. She described {{the film as}} a [...] "journey of a girl into womanhood and her sacrifices for her family". Her portrayal earned her a seventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare, she {{played the role of}} Vibhavari Sahay, a young girl of limited means who is forced to moonlight as a prostitute to fend for her family. Jaya Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor co-starred in the film which released to poor box office returns and little praise from the critics. The Indian Express noted that Mukerji was responsible for [...] "hold the film together, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> part, both as the ingénue and the hooker, doesn't have freshness".|$|E
500|$|... "Circus" [...] was {{performed}} on December 2, 2008 at American morning talk show Good Morning America, along with [...] "Womanizer". She wore a midriff-baring shirt, leather pants, a ringmaster jacket and a top hat. [...] "Circus" [...] was a major part on The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), as the opening number of the show. The costumes of the performance were selected to show a metamorphosis. The show began with a video introduction featuring Perez Hilton as Queen Elizabeth I, welcoming the audience to the circus. In {{the middle of the}} video, the cylinder screen surrounding the stage started to rise, while Spears appeared on the video and shot Hilton with a crossbow, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. As the video ended, Spears started to descend from the ceiling on a suspended platform, wearing a cheetah headdress, a ringmaster jacket, black shorts, high-heeled boots and carrying a whip. The headdress represented an animal. When she reached the stage, she took it off to represent both a ringmaster and a lion tamer and [...] "Circus" [...] started. It featured acrobats taking the stage and spinning on giant rings in the air. The performance ended with Spears taking off her ringleader jacket to reveal a Swarovski-crystal corset, representing a slave. She then ran {{into the center of the}} main stage, surrounded by jets of smoke, to enter a golden cage and perform [...] "Piece of Me". People writer Chuck Arnold wrote that Spears, [...] "descending from above in a red ringmaster-meets-dominatrix outfit" [...] to sing the song, [...] "showed that her body was tight, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> dancing always wasn't." [...] James Montgomery of MTV considered both [...] "Circus" [...] and [...] "Radar" [...] performances [...] "great". Spears included the song on her current residency show in Las Vegas, [...] For the performance, Spears appears from the back of the stage, in the center of a fiery ring, resembling a circus showgirl.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} tour was acclaimed by critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert {{four out of five}} stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a [...] "confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking—adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the [...] "real rendition" [...] of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance." [...] "Better late than never", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that [...] "At first blush, it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers—dubbed Haus of Gaga—who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing." [...] Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said [...] "While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade." [...] Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying [...] " [...] only has two albums under her belt but who cares? Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [...] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that [...] "Throughout the evening, Gaga [...] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Lester of The Guardian {{declared}} Mitchell to be New Band of the Day as [...] "there's more to [...] than {{an ability}} to hold a note, although she does that very well indeed, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> voice is perhaps too idiosyncratic {{for one of those}} reality programmes, a little too quavery, kooky and girly". After working in London for six months, Mitchell returned to Australia. During October and November she undertook a national tour starting in Canberra and finishing in Perth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case went}} to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her {{original}} legal team, and it was dismissed via summary judgment. The judge ruled that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, [...] "... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal {{to submit to the}} governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment." [...] The ruling was appealed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim {{from many}} music critics. Nick Levine from BBC Music wrote a positive review, commenting: [...] "She's {{a natural and}} charismatic vocal presence, {{so much so that}} Want U Back even creates a recurring hook from – how to put this? – the sound of her ‘frustrated grunts’." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic wrote that the song is [...] "an infectious example of cutesy pure pop that recall Britney before she lost her innocence." [...] Alex Denney from NME considered it [...] "a sassy bit of bubble-drunk pop from Britney songwriter Max Martin." [...] Danner had previously written in another NME review that the song is [...] "a peachy-keen pop number that goes pining after an ex, Cher drawing comfort from the fact that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> beloved is going out with someone else now, at least they’re only getting sloppy seconds." [...] Joe Rivers from No Ripcord wrote that [...] "It's packed with hooks and has Cher’s personality stamped all over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, the monokini {{influenced}} {{the sexual revolution}} by emphasizing a woman's personal freedom of dress, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> attire was provocative and exposed more skin than had been the norm during the more conservative 1950s. Quickly renamed a [...] "topless swimsuit", the design was never successful in the United States, although the issue of allowing both genders equal exposure above the waist has been raised as a feminist issue from time to time. In Saint Tropez, Tahiti beach, which had been popularised in the film And God Created Woman featuring Brigitte Bardot, emerged as a clothing-optional destination. The [...] "clothing fights" [...] between the gendarmerie and nudists become the main topic of a famous French comedy film series Le gendarme de Saint-Tropez (The Troops of St. Tropez) featuring Louis de Funès, {{but in the end}} the nudist side prevailed. Topless sunbathing is now the norm {{for both men and women}} from Pampelonne beaches to yachts in the centre of Saint-Tropez port. The Tahiti beach is now clothing optional, but nudists often head to private nudist beaches, like that in Cap d'Agde.|$|E
2500|$|A {{characteristic}} of Neocolonialism is that Colonial powers continue {{to exploit the}} resources of their colonized counterpart for economic or political interests. [...] "Wild Seed" [...] exhibits neocolonialism {{in the relationship between}} Doro and Anyanwu and the relationship between Doro and his descendants. Doro uses Anyanwu's children in order to continue his exploitation of her supernatural abilities. He notes that [...] "Her children would hold her <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> husband did not." [...] Anyanwu does not want to endanger her children by attempting to escape or kill Doro. Even after she tries {{to start a new life}} on a plantation, he breeds with her to pass on her supernatural abilities to his children. He has a vested interest in her powers, and he refuses to let her go. Anyanwu's children face the same struggle when attempting to escape Doro. Doro threatens them with death in order to keep them under his control. He purposely creates villages for his people so that if they decide to leave they will be left with nothing. They rely on Doro for kinship and protection. In return, Doro uses them for his own gains.|$|E
