5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised {{during the dry}} season, which <b>halts</b> work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that <b>halts</b> the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby <b>halts</b> the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway <b>halts</b> on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E
5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated level {{crossing}} and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor <b>halts,</b> which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.|$|E

5|$|The album has a melodic form, and employs pentatonic {{scales for}} melodic development, a {{practice}} common in African and African-American folk music. Goin' Home is mostly tempoless, {{as most of}} the pieces are performed in a rubato-like free rhythm. Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and <b>halts,</b> particularly at the end of bars, phrases, and sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty-two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.|$|E
5|$|The draught section {{drivability}} test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, {{consists of}} four parts, and 0–5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for {{each part of the}} test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, <b>halts,</b> turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it <b>halts</b> and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
2500|$|The uncomputability of S(n) {{can also}} be {{established}} by reference to the blank tape <b>halting</b> problem. The blank tape <b>halting</b> problem {{is the problem of}} deciding for any Turing machine whether or not it will <b>halt</b> when started on an empty tape. [...] The blank tape <b>halting</b> problem is equivalent to the standard <b>halting</b> problem and so it is also uncomputable. [...] If S(n) was computable, then we could solve the blank tape <b>halting</b> problem simply by running any given Turing machine with n states for S(n) steps; [...] if it has still not <b>halted,</b> it never will. [...] So, since the blank tape <b>halting</b> problem is not computable, it follows that S(n) must likewise be uncomputable.|$|R

5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or <b>halts</b> the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements from Romani, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Yorke, attacked the Ottoman {{force to the}} north of Katia, but were driven off. These five troops and a machine gun section of Gloucestershire Hussars moved out from Romani at 10:15 to intercept a column of 500 Ottoman soldiers retiring south-east from Dueidar. Shortly after leaving Romani, firing was heard from Katia, and from some high ground they could see the Ottoman artillery north of Er Rabah shelling the camp. When the Gloucestershire Hussars advanced towards the Ottoman artillery, it ceased fire, and fifteen minutes later was seen to withdraw some distance. The Gloucestershire Hussars pushed some Ottoman soldiers back to the high ground south of the Hod um Ugba, where Ottoman reinforcements stopped their advance. The strength of the Ottoman attacks made a gradual withdrawal necessary, but long <b>halts</b> were made to enable the wounded at Romani to retire also.|$|E
5|$|The Governor's Daughter is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story details a convict who is being sent to prison when the train is wrecked and the sheriff escorting him is killed. The convict frees himself, but <b>halts</b> his escape {{to save the life}} of a little girl. As he returns the girl to her nurse, a policeman identifies and recaptures him. Later the little girl accompanies her father, the governor, on a tour of the prison and the father pardons the hero-convict. The film included scenes of a real train wreck and the scenario was written around the filming of the disaster. The film received praise for the before and after scenes which were described as shocking to The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer. The film was released on June 24, 1910, and was shown as far away as Australia. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

50|$|A {{machine with}} an oracle for the <b>halting</b> problem can {{determine}} whether particular Turing machines will <b>halt</b> on particular inputs, but they cannot determine, in general, whether machines equivalent to themselves will <b>halt.</b> This creates {{a hierarchy of}} machines, each with a more powerful <b>halting</b> oracle and an even harder <b>halting</b> problem.This hierarchy of machines {{can be used to}} define the arithmetical hierarchy (Börger 1989).|$|R
5|$|The loss {{of teeth}} with age in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, Limusaurus {{is one of the}} only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during ontogeny (the others are the red mullet and striped red mullet, several armored catfish, and the platypus). Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled chameleon. Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development <b>halts.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually <b>halts</b> when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it <b>halts</b> after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E
