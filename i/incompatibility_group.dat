50|$|Mating between isogamous fungi may consist only of a {{transfer}} of nuclei from one cell to another. Vegetative incompatibility within species often prevent a fungal isolate from mating with another isolate. Isolates of the same <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group</b> do not mate or mating {{does not lead to}} successful offspring. High variation has been reported including same chemotype mating, sporophyte to gametophyte mating and biparental transfer of mitochondria.|$|E
50|$|Plasmids {{can also}} be {{classified}} into incompatibility groups. A microbe can harbour different types of plasmids, however, different plasmids can only exist in a single bacterial cell if they are compatible. If two plasmids are not compatible, {{one or the other}} will be rapidly lost from the cell. Different plasmids may therefore be assigned to different incompatibility groups depending on whether they can coexist together. Incompatible plasmids (belonging to the same <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group)</b> normally share the same replication or partition mechanisms and can thus not be kept together in a single cell.|$|E

50|$|Triparental mating {{is a form}} of Bacterial {{conjugation}} where a conjugative plasmid {{present in}} one bacterial strain assists the transfer of a mobilizable plasmid present in a second bacterial strain into a third bacterial strain. Plasmids are introduced into bacteria for such purposes as transformation, cloning, or transposon mutagenesis. Triparental matings can help overcome some of the barriers to efficient plasmid mobilization. For instance, if the conjugative plasmid and the mobilizable plasmid are members of the same <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group</b> they do not need to stably coexist in the second bacterial strain for the mobilizable plasmid to be transferred.|$|E

50|$|When an F+ cell conjugates/mates with an F− cell, {{the result}} is two F+ cells, both capable of {{transmitting}} the plasmid to other F− cells by conjugation. The F-plasmid belongs to a class of conjugative plasmids that control sexual functions of bacteria with a fertility inhibition (Fin) system. In this system, a trans-acting factor, FinO, and antisense RNAs, FinP, combine to repress {{the expression of the}} activator gene TraJ. TraJ is a transcription factor that upregulates the tra operon. The tra operon includes genes required for conjugation and plasmid transfer. This means that an F+ bacteria can always act as a donor cell. The finO gene of the original F plasmid (in E. coli K12) is interrupted by an IS3 insertion, resulting in constitutive tra operon expression. F+ cells also have the surface exclusion proteins TraS and TraT on the bacterial surface. These proteins prevent secondary mating events involving plasmids belonging to the same incompatibility (Inc) group. Thus, each F+ bacterium can host only a single plasmid type of any given <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

The examination of couples or twins, blood groups showed that the blood <b>group</b> <b>incompatibility</b> can affect adversely the outcome of pregnancy. Couples with blood <b>group</b> <b>incompatibility</b> are more involved in spontaneous miscarriage. Antigenes in two different blood groups could disorganize implantation. Aborted embryos with normal karyotype showed more frequently blood <b>group</b> <b>incompatibility</b> with their mother. Abnormal newborn and stillbirth were observed more frequent in couples with incompatible blood groups than without. MethodsThis study investigates relationship between blood <b>groups</b> <b>incompatibility</b> and recurrent miscarriage in couples who were referred to genetic counseling clinic of Yazd Research & Clinical Center for Infertility. The blood group of 100 couples with recurrent miscarriage was evaluated using slide test method. Their abortions were unknown after possible evaluation.

40|$|<b>Incompatibility</b> <b>group</b> P {{plasmids}} demonstrate strong entry exclusion properties. Stringent incompatibility is {{also observed}} {{in the absence of}} entry exclusion. These observations have been facilitated by the study of a nontransmissible plasmid, RP 1 -S 2, derived from RP 1 by transductional shortening. RP 1 -S 2 retains carbenicillin and tetracycline resistances as well as loci that cause either the loss of P plasmids (incp) or a locus specifying susceptibility to curing (sinp) {{in the presence of a}} P plasmid. RP 1 -S 2 can be mobilized by an <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group</b> W plasmid, R 388, and also freely forms recombinants with R 388. P, N, and W <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group</b> plasmids all encode information for the receptor of the cell wall-adsorbing phage PRD 1. Based on the premise that the location of this receptor is analogous to entry exclusion factors for F-like plasmids and hence a regulated transfer region determinant, we tested fertility inhibition relationships among these plasmid groups. We detected both reciprocal and nonreciprocal fertility inhibition relationships for bacteria containing various combinations of W, N, and P group plasmids. The nonreciprocal nature of some combinations, we believe, reflects the identity of the point mutation reading to derepression of the plasmid in question. Reciprocal fertility inhibition, on the other hand, may reflect the reconstruction of a fertility inhibition system through complementation. An X <b>incompatibility</b> <b>group</b> plasmid, known to affect the fertility of an N group plasmid, was also shown to inhibit P plasmid fertility. These observations may indicate a possible evolutionary relationship(s) of plasmids unrelated by the criteria of incompatibility, pilus phage specificity, or plasmid host range...|$|E

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the {{molecular}} characterization of 22 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli isolates collected in a German university hospital, {{during a period of}} nine months in 2006. Relationship analysis of clinical isolates was done via pulsed-field gel-electrophoresis, mulit-locus sequence typing, plasmid profiling and additionally PCR for blaESBL detection and phylogroups. After conjugal transfer plasmid isolation and subsequent PCR for blaESBL detection and <b>incompatibility</b> <b>groups</b> were performed. Using one-primer-walking, up to 3600 bp upstream and downstream of different blaCTX-M genes could be sequenced. Beta-Lactamases found were TEM- 1 (n= 14), SHV- 5 (n= 1) and a wide variety of CTX-M types (n= 21) as CTX-M- 15 (n= 12), CTX-M- 1 (n= 4), CTX-M- 14 (n= 2), CTX-M- 9 (n= 1), CTX-M- 3 (n= 1) as well as one new type CTX-M- 65 (n= 1). In 18 isolates blaESBL genes were located on conjugative plasmids in sizes between 40 and 180 kbp belonging to <b>incompatibility</b> <b>groups</b> FII (n= 9), N (n= 5) andI 1 (n= 4).

These insertion sequences connected to blaCTX-M as well as other genes were located between two IS 26 elements in a composition that have not been described yet. The results reveal the emergence of blaESBL, preferentially blaCTX-M, located on different plasmids harboured by genotypic different E. coli strains. The identical gene arrangement in blaCTX-M neighbourhood in plasmids of different <b>incompatibility</b> <b>groups</b> indicates a main role of IS 26 in distribution of mobile resistance elements between different plasmids...|$|R
