5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|The laconic Act is {{the legal}} basis for the {{existence}} of modern Lithuania, both during the interwar period and since 1990. The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all Constitutions of Lithuania. The Act itself was a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the foundation of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence in 1990. Lithuania, breaking away from the Soviet Union, stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the Settlement {{movement}} was founded, with settlements such as Toynbee Hall and Oxford House, to encourage university students {{to live and}} work in the slums, experience the conditions and try to alleviate some of the poverty and misery in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the Workers Educational Association (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and Child Poverty Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{negotiations}} {{constituted a}} <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> Elizabeth's foreign policy. She turned down Philip's own hand early in 1559 but {{for several years}} entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden. For several years she also seriously negotiated to marry Philip's cousin Archduke Charles of Austria. By 1569, relations with the Habsburgs had deteriorated, and Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first Henry, Duke of Anjou, and later, from 1572 to 1581, his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alençon. This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the Southern Netherlands. Elizabeth {{seems to have taken}} the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frog-shaped earring that Anjou had sent her.|$|E
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E

5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, {{a system}} {{governing}} {{the strengths and}} weaknesses certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|The Rhondda {{also has}} a strong history of {{communist}} sympathy, with the Rhondda Socialist Society being a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the coalition that founded the Communist Party of Great Britain. By 1936 there were seven Communists on the Rhondda Urban District Council and was publishing its own Communist newspaper The Vanguard. In the 1930s Maerdy became such a hotspot of Communist support it was known as Little Moscow producing left wing activists such as Merthyr born Arthur Horner and Marxist writer Lewis Jones. The Rhondda miners were also active in socialist activities outside the valleys. In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support {{of some of the}} largest hunger marches, while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the International Brigades than the total number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Wagga Wagga's Central business district was already well {{established by the}} late 1800s and remains focused around the commercial and recreational grid bounded by Best and Tarcutta Streets and the Murrumbidgee River and the Sturt Highway. The main shopping street of Wagga Wagga is Baylis Street which becomes Fitzmaurice Street at the northern end. The Wollundry Lagoon is the water focus of the city centre {{and has been a}} <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the development and separation of the north (older) and south (newer) parts of the city centre. Most residential growth in Wagga Wagga has been on the higher ground to the south of the city centre, with the only residential areas north of the Murrumbidgee being the flood prone suburb of North Wagga Wagga and the university suburb of Estella. Major industrial areas of Wagga Wagga include the northern suburb of Bomen and the eastern suburb of East Wagga Wagga.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{factorization}} of Euclidean domains {{is useful}} in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. Unique factorization was also a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> an attempted proof of Fermat's Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel Lamé, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid's algorithm, based on a suggestion of Joseph Liouville. + Bn + Cn = 0 | journal = J. Math. Pures Appl. | volume = 12 | pages = 172–184}} Lamé's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form x + ωy, where x and y are integers, and ω = e2iπ/n is an nth root of 1, that is, ωn = 1. Although this approach succeeds for some values of n (such as n=3, the Eisenstein integers), in general such numbers do not factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer {{to the concept of}} ideal numbers and, later, Richard Dedekind to ideals.|$|E
5|$|These fashions {{permeated}} noble households, where resident musicians were employed, including viol and lute players. As {{elsewhere in}} Europe, musical ability {{became one of}} the major achievements expected of a nobleman or woman. Musicians were clearly employed as teachers for the children of the household, both male and female. There is evidence for the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of lessons being given in a variety of instruments and singing, and of the purchase of sheet music and instruments (including the virginals and harpsichords). In the Highlands clan chiefs continued to employ harpists, and increasingly, pipers as fili and bards, whose prowess and ability to glorify their ancestors was a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> underlying a clan's status and heritage into the seventeenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music in Scotland was by publisher John Forbes in Aberdeen in 1662. Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols, known as Forbes' Cantus, was printed three times in the next twenty years. It contained 77 songs, of which 25 were of Scottish origin.|$|E
5|$|Except for his juvenilia, {{little of}} which has survived, Mahler {{composed}} only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler's music can be considered. The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song-cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of cross-fertilisation is important, it is during Mahler's extended Wunderhorn phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das himmlische Leben ("The Heavenly Life"), composed in 1892, became a <b>key</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody {{is central to the}} whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song, Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ("The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes"), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony's third movement. Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892, Urlicht ("Primal Light"), is used as the Second Symphony's fourth (penultimate) movement.|$|E
