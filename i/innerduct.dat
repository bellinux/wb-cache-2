50|$|Innerducts are {{primarily}} installed in underground conduit systems that provide connecting paths between manhole locations. In addition to placement in conduit, <b>innerduct</b> {{can be directly}} buried, or aerially installed by lashing the <b>innerduct</b> to a steel suspension strand.|$|E

50|$|<b>Innerducts</b> are {{installed}} in existing underground conduit systems to provide clean, continuous, low-friction paths for placing optical cables that have relatively low pulling tension limits. They {{provide a means}} for subdividing conventional conduit that was originally designed for single, large-diameter metallic conductor cables into multiple channels for smaller optical cables.|$|R

50|$|Innerducts are {{typically}} small-diameter, semi-flexible subducts. According to Telcordia GR-356, {{there are three}} basic types of innerduct: smoothwall, corrugated, and ribbed. These various designs {{are based on the}} profile of the inside and outside diameters of the <b>innerduct.</b> The need for a specific characteristic or combination of characteristics, such as pulling strength, flexibility, or the lowest coefficient of friction, dictates the type of <b>innerduct</b> required.|$|E

50|$|Beyond {{the basic}} {{profiles}} or contours (smoothwall, corrugated, or ribbed), <b>innerduct</b> {{is also available}} in an increasing variety of multiduct designs. Multiduct may be either a composite unit consisting of up to four or six individual innerducts that are held together by some mechanical means, or a single extruded product having multiple channels through which to pull several cables. In either case, the multiduct is coilable, and can be pulled into existing conduit {{in a manner similar}} to that of conventional <b>innerduct.</b>|$|E
5000|$|TVC (MaxCell, NCTC, White Sands Engineering, Satellite Engineering Group). Founded by George Gardner in 1952, in Lewistown, Pennsylvania. TVC is {{the oldest}} {{distributor}} of construction materials and supplies for the cable television, telecommunication and data communication industries. The company expanded in the ensuing decades and by 2010 had three divisions: White Sands Engineering, MaxCell, and Marathon. White Sands Engineering, based in Phoenix, Arizona, is the leading manufacturer of custom-made cable harness in the U.S. for the cable television, telephone, satellite, broadcast, data delivery and computer industries. MaxCell produces textile <b>innerduct.</b> Marathon provides products for communications networks. Wesco purchased TVC Communications and its divisions for a purchase price of $246.5 million, in December 2010.|$|E
