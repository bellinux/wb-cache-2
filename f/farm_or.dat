After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

Richard Bland Lee did not build the main house until 1794. Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838, Sully was used as a home, a working <b>farm,</b> <b>or</b> both by a series of private owners. Then in 1958, Sully was acquired by the federal government {{as a part of the}} area to be used for the construction of Dulles Airport. Today the Fairfax County Park Authority operates the site with a specific focus on the Lee family.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set naming system {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. First comes the prefix, the <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> breeding establishment of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the given name for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy, but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with identification numbers, but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E
5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E

5|$|The {{main source}} of income {{recorded}} on the Pipe rolls was the county <b>farm,</b> <b>or</b> income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.|$|E
5|$|Hilary {{held the}} office of Sheriff of Sussex in 1155, and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was {{a measure of the}} trust that King Henry II had in Hilary. Hilary was the only bishop to hold {{the office of}} sheriff during Henry's reign, with the {{possible}} exception of Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln. An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non-clergy. As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county <b>farm,</b> <b>or</b> income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the Exchequer, clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council. Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, and then sent back to the country of origin for trial. He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec. Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156, and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157. Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric. He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.|$|E

40|$|This study tested whether {{contract}} <b>farming</b> <b>or</b> farmers professional cooperatives (FPCs) {{improved the}} social benefit of pork production and income of breeding farmers in China. The main concern {{of this study}} is whether institutional arrangement like contract <b>farming</b> <b>or</b> FPCs actually improved the welfare of farmers as expected. To answer this question accurately, we estimated the differentiated market demand of pork products in order to quantify the benefit by transaction types. Our study finds that contract <b>farming</b> <b>or</b> FPCs improved the benefits of pork products, but farmer's income remained lower than that of traditional transaction types. This finding is new in terms of quantifying distribution of the economic values among sales outlets, agro-firms and farmers. It is more reliable because it explicitly captures impacts from both demand side and supply side by structural estimation. In practice, we need to keep it mind the bargaining power of small farmers will not improve instantly even when the contract <b>farming</b> <b>or</b> FPCs are introduced...|$|R
25|$|Dairy {{farming is}} {{a class of}} {{agriculture}} for long-term production of milk, which is processed (either on the <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> at a dairy plant, either {{of which may be}} called a dairy) for eventual sale of a dairy product.|$|E
25|$|In {{rural areas}} {{it is common}} that farmers are known by the {{traditional}} name of their Hof (<b>farm</b> <b>or</b> estate).

25|$|After the {{admission}} of Missouri as a slave state, the owning and sale of slaves continued in St. Louis, although as the town grew, {{the percentage of the}} population held as slaves declined. The treatment of slaves in St. Louis as compared with other areas is unclear; some evidence suggests mild to harsh treatment, and it is clear that many slaves attempted to escape. Slave sales occurred usually through advertising in newspapers, with transactions conducted in hotels or private homes. Slaves often were held in the St. Louis jail prior to their movement to a particular <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> to a dealer. Many slaves worked on steamboats as crew or as laborers on the riverfront, and some escaped across the river to the free state of Illinois, continuing via the Underground Railroad to Canada. Some slaves also were hired out by their owners for <b>farm</b> <b>or</b> commercial work for periods of up to a year.|$|E

25|$|As swine {{influenza}} is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required.
