5|$|<b>Krypton</b> is {{characterized}} by several sharp emission lines (spectral signatures) the strongest being green and yellow. <b>Krypton</b> {{is one of the}} products of uranium fission. Solid <b>krypton</b> is white and has a face-centered cubic crystal structure, which is a common property of all noble gases (except helium, which has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure).|$|E
5|$|<b>Krypton</b> {{is mixed}} with argon in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. <b>Krypton</b> costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. <b>Krypton</b> (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|Krypton's {{multiple}} emission lines make ionized <b>krypton</b> gas discharges appear whitish, {{which in}} turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source. <b>Krypton</b> is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography. <b>Krypton</b> gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Compounds with <b>krypton</b> {{bonded to}} atoms other than {{fluorine}} {{have also been}} discovered. There are also unverified reports of a barium salt of a <b>krypton</b> oxoacid. ArKr+ and KrH+ polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for KrXe or KrXe+.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{retained}} {{all of the}} noble gases that were present at its formation except helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of <b>krypton</b> in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of <b>krypton</b> in space.|$|E
5|$|In {{experimental}} particle physics, liquid <b>krypton</b> is used {{to construct}} quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters. A notable example is the calorimeter of the NA48 experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid <b>krypton.</b> This usage is rare, since liquid argon is less expensive. The advantage of <b>krypton</b> is a smaller Molière radius of 4.7cm, which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping. The other parameters relevant for calorimetry are: radiation length of X0=4.7cm, and density of 2.4 g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster is a Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster at the Six Flags Fiesta Texas {{amusement}} park in San Antonio, Texas, USA. Opened in 2000, Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster {{was one of}} the first floorless roller coasters in the world. The well-received ride held the title for the world's tallest vertical loop (145 feet) from its opening until 2013. It is also known as for being the world's tallest and fastest floorless coaster at 168ft (51 m) high and a top speed of 70mph (110km/h). Six Flags describes the coaster Thrill Level at MAXIMUM. Six Flags has announced plans to add Virtual Reality to Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster to enhance the experience.|$|E

5|$|In Action Comics #14 (January 2013), {{which was}} {{published}} 7 November 2012, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, <b>Krypton,</b> orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus, 27.1 light-years from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star {{that would be an}} appropriate parent star to <b>Krypton,</b> and picked the star in Corvus, and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows.|$|E
5|$|<b>Krypton</b> was {{discovered}} in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. Neon {{was discovered}} by a similar procedure by the same workers {{just a few weeks}} later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including <b>krypton.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} noble gases, <b>krypton</b> is highly {{chemically}} unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of <b>krypton</b> in its only known nonzero oxidation state of +2 parallels {{that of the}} neighboring element bromine in the +1 oxidation state; due to the scandide contraction {{it is difficult to}} oxidize the 4p elements to their group oxidation states. Before the 1960s, no noble gas compounds had been synthesized.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>krypton</b> in Earth's {{atmosphere is}} composed of five stable isotopes, plus one isotope (78Kr) with such a long half-life (9.2×1021years) {{that it can be}} considered stable. (This isotope has the second-longest known half-life among all isotopes for which decay has been observed; it undergoes double electron capture to 78Se).Kr |journal=Phys. Rev. C |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=035501 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.87.035501|bibcode=2013PhRvC..87c5501G }} In addition, about thirty unstable isotopes and isomers are known. 81Kr, the product of atmospheric reactions, is produced with the other naturally occurring isotopes of <b>krypton.</b> Being radioactive, it has a half-life of 230,000 years. <b>Krypton</b> is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near-surface water, but 81Kr has been used for dating old (50,000–800,000 years) groundwater.|$|E

5|$|The planet <b>Krypton,</b> {{unstable}} {{from years}} of industrial mining, faces impending destruction. Jor-El, chief advisor to Krypton's supreme council, recommends the council give him control of the genetics codex. Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by General Zod, {{an old friend of}} Jor-El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realizing that <b>Krypton</b> is doomed, Jor-El steals genetic codes sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, Jor-El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. Zod orders the rocket's destruction, only to learn that forces loyal to the council have suppressed the rebellion. In a brief trial, Zod and several of the surviving rebels are convicted of treason and sentenced to the Phantom Zone moments before <b>Krypton</b> explodes.|$|E
5|$|Turning in his script in July 2002, J. J. Abrams' Superman: Flyby was an origin {{story that}} {{included}} <b>Krypton</b> besieged by {{a civil war}} between Jor-El and his corrupt brother Kata-Zor. Before Kata-Zor sentences Jor-El to prison, Kal-El is launched to Earth to fulfill a prophecy. Adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, he forms a romance with Lois Lane in the Daily Planet. However, Lois {{is more concerned with}} exposing Lex Luthor, written as a government agent obsessed with UFO phenomena. Clark reveals himself to the world as Superman, bringing Kata-Zor's son, Ty-Zor, and three other Kryptonians to Earth. Superman is defeated and killed, and visits Jor-El (who committed suicide on <b>Krypton</b> while in prison) in Kryptonian heaven. Resurrected, he returns to Earth and defeats the four Kryptonians. The script ends with Superman flying off to <b>Krypton</b> in a spaceship.|$|E
5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of <b>krypton</b> and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into <b>krypton</b> and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for <b>krypton,</b> and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Six Flags Great Adventure spent $42 {{million on}} new attractions {{including}} a prototype Floorless Coaster by Bolliger & Mabillard, Medusa (later Bizarro). The immediate {{popularity of the}} ride, led to Six Flags Fiesta Texas and three other amusement parks to announce plans to install Floorless Coasters in 2000; aside from the announcement of Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster on November 1, 1999, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom announced Medusa, Geauga Lake announced , and SeaWorld Orlando announced Kraken. The $20 million Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster was announced {{as part of a}} wider multimillion-dollar expansion of Six Flags Fiesta Texas.|$|E
5|$|In Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards, Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster {{was ranked}} in the top 50 steel roller {{coasters}} numerous times since its opening. It peaked at position 24 in 2002, before it dropped to 50 in 2008 and rose again to 38 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster entered {{at position}} 20 in 2001 and peaked at 17 in 2004. The ride's ranking in subsequent polls {{is shown in}} the table below.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, <b>krypton,</b> and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, <b>krypton,</b> and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium. His calculations suggested {{that it might be}} possible to make these two elements by fusing lead with <b>krypton</b> under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the planet}} <b>Krypton,</b> using {{evidence}} {{provided to the}} Council by scientist Jor-El, the attempted insurrectionists General Zod, Ursa, and Non are sentenced to the Phantom Zone. For this, Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family. Jor-El, despite his eminence, is unable to convince the Council that <b>Krypton</b> will soon be destroyed when its red supergiant sun goes supernova. To save his infant son, Kal-El, Jor-El launches him in a spaceship to Earth, a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton's sun explodes, destroying the planet.|$|E
5|$|Six {{nonmetals}} occur naturally as monatomic noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), <b>krypton</b> (Kr), xenon (Xe), and {{the radioactive}} radon (Rn). They comprise {{a group of}} chemical elements with very similar properties. In their standard states they are all colorless, odourless, nonflammable gases with characteristically very low chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistries}} of {{the heavier}} noble gases, <b>krypton</b> and xenon, are well established. The chemistry of the lighter ones, argon and helium, {{is still at}} an early stage, while a neon compound {{is yet to be}} identified.|$|E
5|$|The <b>krypton</b> {{fluoride}} laser {{is important}} in nuclear fusion energy research in confinement experiments. The laser has high beam uniformity, short wavelength, and the spot size can be varied to track an imploding pellet.|$|E
5|$|To {{enable the}} {{construction}} of the park's 2013 roller coaster, Full Throttle, Superman: Escape from <b>Krypton</b> was temporarily closed from December 2012. It reopened in mid-January with Six Flags Magic Mountain stating the ride may have intermittent closures as {{the construction of}} Full Throttle continues.|$|E
5|$|Although xenon has {{potential}} {{for use in}} computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% xenon and 30% <b>krypton</b> is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as {{the definition of the}} fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the atomic spectrum of <b>krypton,</b> but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{has written}} {{supporting}} novels {{in the past}} in established franchises, such as Star Wars and Dune. He had previously written about Superman in the 2007 novel The Last Days of <b>Krypton.</b> Enemies & Allies was published in May 2009 and met with mixed reviews which noted flat characterization but that it may be entertaining for comic book fans.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, <b>krypton</b> and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2010, Six Flags Magic Mountain officially {{announced}} the refurbishment and re-theming of Superman: The Escape, {{in addition to}} the construction of two new roller coasters. As part of the refurbishment, the ride was renamed to Superman: Escape from <b>Krypton</b> and featured new backward launching cars and a new color scheme. The upgraded ride reopened to the public on March 19, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Superman: <b>Krypton</b> Coaster {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. This gives the ride a theoretical hourly capacity of 1600 riders per hour. The open-air trains feature seats which leave riders' legs dangling above the track. Riders are restrainted with over-the-shoulder restraints (OTSRs). As the trains are floorless, the station has a retractable floor for safe boarding.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} show {{extremely}} low chemical reactivity; consequently, {{only a few}} hundred noble gas compounds have been formed. Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, <b>krypton,</b> and argon have shown only minor reactivity. The reactivity follows the order Ne < He < Ar < Kr < Xe < Rn.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by <b>krypton,</b> and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same {{be done with the}} kilogram.|$|E
