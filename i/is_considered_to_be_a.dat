5|$|A feature-length {{historical}} film Caligula {{was completed}} in 1979, in which Malcolm McDowell played the lead role. The film alienated audiences with explicit sex and violence.

5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they had evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E

Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume {{roughly the size of}} the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E

Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
