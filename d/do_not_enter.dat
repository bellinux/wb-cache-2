5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E
5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E

25|$|While {{the evening}} bat is {{considered}} endangered {{in the state}} of Indiana, it has a cosmopolitan distribution throughout the southeast and midwest. Because evening bats <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> or hibernate in caves, the species is not at-risk from white-nose syndrome, which has killed over six million bats in the United States since 2006. The evening bat's avoidance of this disease, along with die-offs of many other species, is possibly responsible for the evening bat recently expanding its range into Wisconsin in 2015 and Minnesota in 2016.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} quotas was largely {{reported}} to have resulted {{in an increase in}} the percentage of Bumiputra entering public universities.

It is also alleged that during the marking of examination scripts in the Government exams, that Malay/Bumiputra students are given additional points even before the students sit for the exams. As a result, despite the removal of the Quota system, this alleged unfair advantage gives more places to undeserving students of Malay origin.|$|E

25|$|Goatfishes are {{a family}} Mullidae of about 55 species of perciform fishes, {{associated}} worldwide with tropical reefs. They are typically about 20cm long, though the dash-and-dot goatfish, grows to 55cm. Goatfish are tireless benthic feeders, possess {{a pair of}} long chemosensory barbels ("whiskers") protruding from their chins resembling a goat’s beard. They use these to rifle through the sediments {{in search of a}} meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible; worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. Many species of goatfish are conspicuously coloured and have the ability to change their colouration depending on their current activity. By day, many form large inactive (non-feeding) schools: these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin goatfish school with blue-striped snappers. When they do that, the yellowfins changes its colouration to match that of the snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. The diurnal goldsaddle goatfish changes from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream when feeding. Other nocturnal feeders will shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for overlooked morsels. Goatfish stay within the shallows, going no deeper than about 110 metres. Most species do not tolerate brackish water, so they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> estuaries or the mouths of rivers.|$|E
