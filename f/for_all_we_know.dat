Henry, Professor of Classics at Iowa State University, maintains that [...] "biographical anecdotes that arose in antiquity about Aspasia are wildly colorful, almost completely unverifiable, and {{still alive and}} well in the twentieth century". She finally concludes that [...] "it is possible to map only the barest possibilities for [...] life". According to Charles W. Fornara and Loren J. Samons II, Professors of Classics and history, [...] "it may well be, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> that the real Aspasia was more than a match for her fictional counterpart".|$|E

2500|$|Writers do not all {{follow the}} same terminology. The phrase [...] "statistical interpretation", {{referring}} to the [...] "ensemble interpretation", often indicates {{an interpretation of the}} Born rule somewhat different from the Copenhagen interpretation. For the Copenhagen interpretation, it is axiomatic that the wave function exhausts all that can ever be known in advance about a particular occurrence of the system. The [...] "statistical" [...] or [...] "ensemble" [...] interpretation, on the other hand, is explicitly agnostic about whether the information in the wave function is exhaustive of what might be known in advance. It sees itself as more 'minimal' than the Copenhagen interpretation in its claims. It only goes as far as saying that on every occasion of observation, some actual value of some property is found, and that such values are found probabilistically, as detected by many occasions of observation of the same system. The many occurrences of the system are said to constitute an 'ensemble', and they jointly reveal the probability through these occasions of observation. Though they all have the same wave function, the elements of the ensemble might not be identical to one another in all respects, according to the 'agnostic' interpretations. They may, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> beyond current knowledge and beyond the wave function, have individual distinguishing properties. For present-day science, the experimental significance of these various forms of Born's rule is the same, since they make the same predictions about the probability distribution of outcomes of observations, and the unobserved or unactualized potential properties are not accessible to experiment.|$|E

60|$|There was no trust, no {{confidence}} anywhere. The man who plotted beside us, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew,</b> {{might be an}} agent of the Iron Heel. We mined the organization of the Iron Heel with our secret agents, and the Iron Heel countermined with its secret agents inside its own organization. And it was the same with our organization. And despite the absence of confidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on confidence and trust. Often were we betrayed. Men were weak. The Iron Heel could offer money, leisure, the joys and pleasures that waited in the repose of the wonder cities. We could offer nothing but the satisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal. As for the rest, the wages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril, torture, and death.|$|R
60|$|The fact is, that, {{in regard}} to the {{distance}} of the fixed stars—of any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it belongs—astronomical science, until very lately, could speak only with a negative certainty. Assuming the brightest as the nearest, we could say, even of them, only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the hither side of which they cannot be:—how far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain. We perceived, for example, that Alpha Lyræ cannot be nearer to us than 19 trillions, 200 billions of miles; but, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew,</b> and indeed <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> now <b>know,</b> it may be distant from us the square, or the cube, or any other power of the number mentioned. By dint, however, of wonderfully minute and cautious observations, continued, with novel instruments, for many laborious years, Bessel, not long ago deceased, has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars; among others, that of the star numbered 61 in the constellation of the Swan. The distance in this latter instance ascertained, is 670,000 times that of the Sun; which last it will be remembered, is 95 millions of miles. The star 61 Cygni, then, is nearly 64 trillions of miles from us—or {{more than three times the}} distance assigned, as the least possible, for Alpha Lyræ.|$|R
