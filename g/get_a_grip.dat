5|$|Aerosmith is an American Grammy Award-winning {{hard rock}} band formed in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts. They have {{released}} 15 studio albums: Aerosmith (1973), Get Your Wings (1974), Toys in the Attic (1975), Rocks (1976), Draw the Line (1977), Night in the Ruts (1979), Rock in a Hard Place (1982), Done with Mirrors (1985), Permanent Vacation (1987), Pump (1989), <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> (1993), Nine Lives (1997), Just Push Play (2001), Honkin' on Bobo (2004), and Music from Another Dimension!

5|$|Perry and Whitford {{returned}} to Aerosmith in 1984 {{and the band}} signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It {{was not until the}} band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described {{as one of the most}} remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year, except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour that will likely last several years.|$|E

25|$|Just {{three days}} after the final Norwich date of the tour, Ant was back onstage again with two members of his live band on 19 December at a charity event at Ronnie Scott's. The first record release of Ant's 2010s {{comeback}} also occurred at this point, with the release of the Sex Drugs and HIV compilation album featuring Ant's version of <b>Get</b> <b>A</b> <b>Grip</b> which had been recorded a year earlier while the World Tour of London was in progress.|$|E
500|$|During {{the making}} of <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip,</b> the {{management}} and record company brought {{in a variety of}} professional songwriting collaborators to help give nearly all the songs on the album more commercial appeal, a trend which would continue until the early 2000s. However, this led to accusations of selling out that would continue throughout the 1990s. In addition to Aerosmith's grueling 18-month world tour in support of <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip,</b> the band also did a number of things to help promote themselves and their album and appeal to youth culture, including the appearance of the band in the movie Wayne's World 2 where they performed two songs, the appearance of the band and their music in the video games Revolution X and Quest for Fame, performing at Woodstock '94, using their song [...] "Deuces Are Wild" [...] in The Beavis and Butt-head Experience, and opening their own club, The Mama Kin Music Hall, in Boston, MA in 1994. That same year saw the release of the band's compilation for Geffen Records, entitled Big Ones featuring their biggest hits from Permanent Vacation, Pump, and <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip,</b> [...] "Deuces Are Wild" [...] from the Beavis and Butt-head Experience, as well as two new songs, [...] "Blind Man" [...] and [...] "Walk on Water", both of which experienced great success on the rock charts.|$|E
500|$|The band took a brief break before {{recording}} their {{follow-up to}} Pump in 1992. Despite significant shifts in mainstream {{music at the}} beginning of the 1990s, 1993's <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> was just as successful commercially, becoming their first album to debut at number 1 and racking up sales of 7 million copies in a two-and-a-half-year timespan. The first singles were the hard rocking [...] "Livin' on the Edge" [...] and [...] "Eat the Rich". Though many critics were unimpressed by the focus on the subsequent interchangeable power-ballads in promoting the album, all three ("Cryin'", [...] "Crazy" [...] and [...] "Amazing") proved to be huge successes on radio and MTV. The music videos featured then up-and-coming actress Alicia Silverstone; her provocative performances earned her the title of [...] "the Aerosmith chick" [...] for the first half of the decade. Steven Tyler's daughter Liv Tyler was also featured in the [...] "Crazy" [...] video. <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> would go on to sell more than 7 million copies in the U.S. alone, and over 20million copies worldwide. The band won two Grammy Awards for songs from this album in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal: for [...] "Livin' on the Edge" [...] in 1994 and [...] "Crazy" [...] in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Album opener [...] "Bullshittin'" [...] was {{produced}} by Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J, and features a murky bassline with a calming vibe. The track is inspired {{by the sound of}} southern hip hop. [...] "Cookie Coma" [...] {{was produced}} by The Alchemist, and contains a jazzy beat, with lush horns and upright bass. The style of production is inspired by boom bap production, with prominent sounding drums.

500|$|In {{naming the}} character, {{executive}} producer and head writer Russell T Davies {{drew inspiration from}} the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand.

Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived {{with the intention of}} forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, [...] "Is he a force for good or ill?" ...|$|E
500|$|Nansen {{wanted the}} ship in one year; {{he was eager to}} get away before anyone else could adopt his ideas and {{forestall}} him. [...] The ship's most significant external feature was the roundness of the hull, designed so that there was nothing upon which the ice could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip.</b> Bow, stern and keel were rounded off, and the sides smoothed so that, in Nansen's words, the vessel would [...] "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice". [...] To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28inches (60–70cm), increasing to around 48inches (1.25metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by crossbeams and braces throughout the length of the hull.|$|E

500|$|During mid-1993, Megadeth {{performed}} {{at a number}} of shows with Metallica in Europe. The first was at Milton Keynes Bowl in England, and included Diamond Head. In July, Megadeth was added as the opening act for Aerosmith's <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> Tour, but was removed from the bill after three shows. Aerosmith said that Megadeth was [...] "dumped" [...] because of Mustaine's erratic behavior, while Capitol Records said it was due to [...] "artistic restrictions". After the canceled US tour, Megadeth returned to the studio to record [...] "99 Ways to Die", which appeared on The Beavis and Butt-head Experience, a compilation album released in November featuring songs interspersed with commentary by the main characters of the animated series Beavis and Butt-head. The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1995 Grammy Awards. During these sessions, Megadeth recorded a cover version of Black Sabbath's [...] "Paranoid", which appeared on the Black Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black; it was nominated for a Grammy the following year.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, in {{the midst}} of {{setbacks}} during the Nine Lives Tour, the band released the single [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", the love theme, written by Diane Warren for the 1998 film Armageddon, starring Steven Tyler's daughter Liv. The song became Aerosmith's first and only number 1 single when it debuted at the top position on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on top of the charts for four weeks. The song was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999. The song helped open Aerosmith up to a new generation and remains a slow-dance staple. 1998 also saw the release of the double-live album, A Little South of Sanity, which was assembled from performances on the <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> and Nine Lives tours. The album went platinum shortly after its release. The band continued with their seemingly neverending world tours promoting Nine Lives and the [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] single well into 1999.|$|E
500|$|When Gareth David-Lloyd {{was cast}} in the role, the {{character}} was renamed Ianto Jones. This {{was inspired by the}} character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname [...] "Jones" [...] with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones ("Random Shoes"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of the character on the blank page. In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: [...] "Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also got him into a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.|$|E

500|$|Aerosmith {{had signed}} a $30million {{contract}} for four records with Columbia Records/Sony Music in 1991, but had only recorded three of their six contractual albums with Geffen Records at that point (Done with Mirrors, Permanent Vacation, and Pump). Between 1991 and 1996, they released two more albums with Geffen (<b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> and Big Ones), which meant they now had five albums with Geffen under their belt (along with a planned live compilation), which meant they could now begin recording for their new contract with Columbia. The band took time off with their families before working on their next album, Nine Lives, which was plagued with personnel problems, including the firing of manager Tim Collins, who, according to band members, had nearly caused the band to break up. The album's producer was also changed from Glen Ballard to Kevin Shirley. Nine Lives was released in March 1997. Reviews were mixed, and Nine Lives initially fell down the charts, although it had a long chart life and sold double platinum in the United States alone, fueled by its singles, [...] "Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)", the ballad [...] "Hole in My Soul", and the crossover-pop smash [...] "Pink" [...] (which won the band their fourth Grammy Award in 1999 in the Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category). It {{was followed by the}} over two-year-long Nine Lives Tour, which was plagued by problems including lead singer Steven Tyler injuring his leg at a concert, and Joey Kramer suffering second degree burns when his car caught fire at a gas station.|$|E
500|$|Some {{established}} acts {{continued to}} enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grip</b> (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles {{and became the}} band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as [...] "Keep the Faith" [...] (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads [...] "Bed of Roses" [...] (1993) and [...] "Always" [...] (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe {{than it was in}} the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or [...] "pop-metal" [...] sound.|$|E
