5|$|Allotted to No.45 Squadron RFC flying Sopwith Camels, Brownell {{moved to}} France for {{operational}} service over the Western Front during September 1917. On 10 September, he {{took part in}} his first patrol, during which he shot down a two-seater German aircraft. In his time <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western Front, Brownell accumulated {{a total of five}} victories and achieved 'ace' status before his squadron was transferred to Italy in December. Later that month, Brownell and his observer, Lieutenant Henry Moody, shot down German ace Alwin Thurm over Asolo.|$|E
5|$|BLM {{counts the}} herd {{visually}} about {{every four years}} by <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> range, reporting on each animal found, and using statistical methods to correct for historic undercounting and other problems. In 1984, BLM set the maximum carrying capacity of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range at 121 adult animals, and revised this to 95 adult animals in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Breton {{folklore}} {{holds that}} storm petrels are {{the spirits of}} sea-captains who mistreated their crew, doomed to spend eternity <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sea, and they are also held to be the souls of drowned sailors. A sailing superstition holds that {{the appearance of a}} storm petrel foretells bad weather. Sinister names from Britain and France include waterwitch, satanite, satanique and oiseau du diable.|$|E

5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> heads of her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
5|$|Grissom's crew {{received}} {{approval in}} June 1966 {{to design a}} mission patch with the name Apollo 1. The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The Moon {{is seen in the}} distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American Aviation employee Allen Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. <b>Flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E

5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{aircraft}} <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan {{as far as}} Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn on {{the morning}} of 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, blocking the road, causing many horses to bolt over a precipice {{on one side of the}} road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E

5|$|Bran and Meera Reed {{are fleeing}} the wights, who {{continue}} to follow them from the cave. Bran, still in his visions, witnesses several events: Jaime Lannister killing King Aerys Targaryen, a dragon <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Red Keep, his fall from Winterfell which left him paralyzed, the Night King transforming Craster's last son into a White Walker, the Massacre at Hardhome, Ned Stark's beheading, {{the murder of his}} mother Catelyn and brother Robb in the Red Wedding, and wildfire exploding beneath King's Landing. As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and destroys some of the wights while pulling Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.|$|E
5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the area}} to the east of the Jordan River garrisoned by the Ottoman Fourth Army, two Bristol Fighters {{reporting}} early in the day all Ottoman camps {{in the area}}, were quiet. After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Wadi Fara road. Here they dropped their remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the lorries blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mourning}} doves migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves {{have been}} seen <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained {{by the presence of}} bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|The American {{airborne}} landings {{began with}} the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15. Navigation was difficult because of a bank of thick cloud, and as a result only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and Aldis lamps. Paratroopers of the US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command. To avoid <b>flying</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> invasion fleet, the planes arrived from the west over the Cotentin Peninsula and exited over Utah Beach.|$|E
