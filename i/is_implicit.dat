50|$|The {{secret of}} Hegel may be {{indicated}} at shortest thus: As Aristotle—with considerable assistance from Plato—made explicit the abstract Universal that <b>was</b> <b>implicit</b> in Socrates, so Hegel— with less considerable assistance from Fichte and Schelling—made explicit the concrete Universal that <b>was</b> <b>implicit</b> in Kant.|$|R

25|$|The Singapore Constitution thus vests legislative, {{executive}} and judicial {{power in the}} legislature, {{executive and}} judiciary respectively. This is {{a defining feature of}} Westminster-style constitutions, of which Singapore's constitution is one.

25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> (undefined). If it <b>is</b> <b>implicit,</b> the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E
25|$|The 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: “Without Contraries is no progression” - {{and this}} idea <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> {{in many of}} the poems. The last part of the book, Spirit Songs, draws freely on British traditions like the Queen of the May at Beltane. By contrast, the final poem Queen of the Moon ('Queen of the vision {{revealed}} in the vine / And the leaves of the Shining Tree...') evokes the Brazilian Santo Daime tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{left side}} of Fig.1 shows a region of the prefrontal cortex {{receiving}} multiple inputs from other regions, as cortico-cortical activity. The input from B is the strongest of these. The right side of Fig. 1 shows the input signals also being fed to the basal ganglia circuitry. The output from here, {{back to the same}} region, is shown to modify the strength of the input from B, by adding strength to the input from C thereby modifying the strongest signal from B to C. (Thalamic involvement <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> but not shown).|$|E

25|$|The One {{acts as the}} {{determining}} factor on the Indefinite Dyad, which is called 'the Great and the Small,' and eliminates its indeterminacy, which encompasses every possible relation between largeness and smallness or between excess and deficiency. Thus the One produces determinate relations between magnitudes by making the indeterminacy of the Indefinite Dyad determinate, and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of determinate Twoness, which can from various perspectives {{be seen as the}} Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{historic}} Sunni scholars who permitted the Mawlid include the Shafi'i scholar Al-Suyuti (d 911 A.H.) who stated that:My {{answer is that}} the legal status of the observance of the Mawlid – as long as it just consists of a meeting together by the people, a recitation of apposite parts of the Qur'an, the recounting of transmitted accounts of the beginning of (the biography of) the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and the wonders that took place during his birth, all of which is then followed by a banquet that is served to them and from which they eat-is a good innovation (bid'a hasana), for which one is rewarded because of the esteem shown for the position of the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – that <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> in it, and because of the expression of joy and happiness on his – may God bless him and grant him peace – noble birth.|$|E

50|$|Perceptual {{learning}} {{is often said}} to <b>be</b> <b>implicit,</b> such that learning occurs without awareness.

500|$|The {{relationship}} {{has also been}} criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life. Others have said that some viewers refused to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the [...] "kiss" [...] is obscured by Victor's arm, it <b>is</b> <b>implicit.</b> Cecilia D'Anastasio of Kotaku wondered why the [...] "kiss" [...] was blocked when other anime, such as Shin Sekai Yori, had depicted gay kisses.|$|E
500|$|User {{control over}} Windows Updates was removed (except in {{enterprise}} versions). In earlier versions users could opt for updates {{to be installed}} automatically, or to be notified so they could update as and when they wished, {{or not to be}} notified; and they could choose which updates to install, using information about the updates. Windows10 Pro and Enterprise users may be configured by an administrator to defer updates, but only for a limited time. Under the Windows end-user license agreement, users consent to the automatic installation of all updates, features and drivers provided by the service, and to the automatic removal or changes to features being modified is not required; it <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> [...] "without any additional notice".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} people are drawn to professions that fit their name was {{suggested}} by psychologist Carl Jung, citing as an example Sigmund Freud who studied pleasure and whose surname means [...] "joy". A few recent empirical {{studies have indicated that}} certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> egotism, which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is genetic: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{allegations}} made in the Pendle witch trials resulted {{from members of the}} Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> in much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, {{it may have been a}} trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about [...] away, near the village of Fence.|$|E
