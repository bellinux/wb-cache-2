The model is used to evaluate three control algorithms using thermal and electrical storage in terms of final energy, solar fraction, self-consumption and seasonal performance factor. The algorithms are tested and compared with respect to energetic improvement for 1) use of the heat pump plus storage tank for domestic hot water and space heating, 2) use of the electrical storage in batteries and 3) use of both electrical and thermal storage. Results show the highest increase of self-consumption to 50. 5 %, solar fraction to 40. 6 % and final energy decrease to 6923 kWh by implementing the third algorithm in a system with 9. 36 kW PV capacity and battery storage of 10. 8 kWh. The use of electrical energy storage has higher positive impact compared to the thermal storage with the settings and component sizes used. The combined use of thermal storage and batteries leads to <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> that are nearly {{the same as the}} combined savings of thermal storage and batteries separately, showing that they are mostly independent of one another for the settings of this study...|$|E
40|$|Improved energy {{efficiency}} {{is among the}} key measures for CO 2 emission abatement in the industry. Energy benchmark curves provide data measured at individual plants and they offer a basis to estimate the sectoral {{energy efficiency}} improvement potentials (IP) compared to a best practice technology (BPT) currently in operation worldwide. In this paper, we estimate the BPT energy use of 17 industry sectors based on such curves or energy indicators prepared at country-level. We compare BPT data with current energy use to estimate the IP. According to our analysis, BPT offers improvement potentials of 27 ± 8 % worldwide. This is equivalent to 32. 5 ± 9. 6 EJ (exajoules) of <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> worldwide, of which three-quarters can be achieved in developing countries. Due to lack of benchmark curves and limited data availability for developing countries, our results include uncertainties. We used literature data at country-level and international energy statistics to fill data gaps and to develop energy indicators. Quality of these data should be improved and benchmark data needs to be collected for more sectors. By doing so, energy benchmarking could become a key tool to estimate energy saving potentials and energy indicators could serve as strong supplementary methodology...|$|E
40|$|The cement {{industry}} {{is among the}} top three industrial energy consumers in Switzerland with a share of 9 % of the total final energy demand by Swiss industry in 2014. It is also {{a major contributor to}} the Swiss greenhouse gas emissions, releasing approximately 2. 7 Mt of CO 2 in 2014 (including both fossil and mineral CO 2). This study investigates the energy efficiency improvement and CO 2 abatement potential in the Swiss {{cement industry}} by means of energy efficiency cost curves. The energy savings potential for this sector is estimated based on the data collected from literature and via interviews with the experts. The current economic potential for <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and CO 2 abatement is estimated at 14 % and 13 % of the sector's final energy use and CO 2 emissions in 2014 respectively and the total investment costs are approximately CHF ∼ 120 million (approx. USD 115 million). This study also highlights techno-economic barriers that are limiting implementation of the best practices in Swiss cement plants. Due to the relatively low current final energy and CO 2 prices, the cost savings of the cost-effective measures are found to be low to very low. While the sensitivity to higher fuel prices (+ 50 %) is limited, a CO 2 tax of 84 CHF/t CO 2 (approx. 80 USD/t CO 2) would make carbon capture and storage economically viable and allow to drastically reduce CO 2 emissions. The results of this study offer {{a better understanding of the}} energy efficiency gap in the sector and can serve as basis for formulating more effective policies...|$|E

40|$|Energy Saving Predictions in the Residential Building Sector - An Assessment {{based on}} Stochastic Modeling <b>Energy</b> <b>savings</b> in the {{residential}} building sector are typically predicted by means of simplified, normative calculation tools, relying on standardized user behaviour. In reality however, actual <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> prove to be only 20 to 60 % of those predicted, seriously questioning {{the use of these}} tools in reliable cost efficiency analyses and robust policy making. Additionally, the tools are mostly conceived deterministically, giving no insight in the uncertainties inherent to predicting <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> The main aim of this work is to provide a more reliable <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> prediction method, embedded in a probabilistic framework. To do so, an evidence-based probabilistic behavioural model is developed, reflecting the large variety in dwelling use. Key aspects of the final behavioural model are (i) the use of time-dependent occupancy profiles and (ii) the implementation of space-dependent heating patterns. As the simple thermal building models of the normative tools are no longer suitable to implement this behavioural model, a transient zonal building model is set up as well. By using the well-known Monte-Carlo technique, <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> predictions can be generated in terms of probability distributions. When applied on an existing case study district, the results show the above methodology is able to predict energy use estimates that are very comparable to measured data (both in average values and statistical spread), confirming its overall reliability. In addition, and in contrast to the simplified calculation tools, the methodology is capable of capturing typical retrofitting effects like the temperature takeback. Finally, the probabilistic setup proves to be worthwhile in assessing <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> at a large-scale building stock level (district, city, region, [...] .) : as the building parameters can be conceived probabilistic as well, it allows for an incorporation of the global uncertainty of statistical building stock data within the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> estimates. nrpages: 204 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{trends in}} GHG emissions {{over the last}} 40 years due to the economic growth are aggravating the effects of Climate Change. A way to stabilise and reverse these effects is through the decarbonisation of energy systems and {{the transition to a}} low carbon economy; however, this requires time and involves costly investments. The gradual transition to a low carbon economy demands {{the development and implementation of}} new technologies as well as policies that will exploit the potential of the technology mix in the least cost for society. Cost effectiveness has been used as an indicator for giving such insights to decision and policy makers. In planning such futures, models are being widely used providing input to assess the developments need to be undertaken taking into account policy and technology interactions. In this study we used OPERA optimisation model in order to study the Dutch energy system regarding the cost effectiveness of technologies under different policy pathways for 2030. Four scenarios were studied representing possible pathways with regard to the climate and energy targets. In particular renewable energy, primary energy savings and <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> targets were investigated along with the non-ETS emission reduction targets. Aim of the research was to provide a method to examine how the interactions among the scenario objectives and the assessed technologies affect the ranking of the latter using as indicator their cost effectiveness. The shadow prices of the assessed targets were used as a proxy to estimate the cost effectiveness of technologies as well as the interactions among the objectives of each scenario. The analysis suggests that the scoring of each technology is highly dependent on its influence on the scenario objectives. Providing such ranking can be proved really useful for policy makers because the alignment or misalignment of technologies with the policy objectives can be predicted. Hence, technological lock-ins can be avoided and more efficient and effective policies to be planned in the longer term time horizon...|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{examines the}} relationship between energy demand and residential building attributes, demographic characteristics, and behavioral variables using the U. S. Department of Energy’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey 2005 microdata. This study investigates {{the applicability of the}} smooth backfitting estimator to statistical analysis of residential energy consumption via nonparametric regression. The methodology utilized in the study extends nonparametric additive regression via local linear smooth backfitting to categorical variables. The conventional methods used for analyzing residential energy consumption are econometric modeling and engineering simulations. This study suggests an econometric approach that can be utilized in combination with simulation results. A common weakness of previously used econometric models is a very high likelihood that any suggested parametric relationships will be misspecified. Nonparametric modeling does not have this drawback. Its flexibility allows for uncovering more complex relationships between energy use and the explanatory variables than can possibly be achieved by parametric models. Traditionally, building simulation models overestimated the effects of energy efficiency measures when compared to actual "as-built" observed savings. While focusing on technical efficiency, they do not account for behavioral or market effects. The magnitude of behavioral or market effects may have a substantial influence on the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> resulting from implementation of various energy conservation measures and programs. Moreover, variability in behavioral aspects and user characteristics appears to {{have a significant impact on}} total energy consumption. Inaccurate estimates of energy consumption and potential savings also impact investment decisions. The existing modeling literature, whether it relies on parametric specifications or engineering simulation, does not accommodate inclusion of a behavioral component. This study attempts to bridge that gap by analyzing behavioral data and investigate the applicability of additive nonparametric regression to this task. This study evaluates the impact of 31 regressors on residential natural gas usage. The regressors include weather, economic variables, demographic and behavioral characteristics, and building attributes related to energy use. In general, most of the regression results were in line with previous engineering and economic studies in this area. There were, however, some counterintuitive results, particularly with regard to thermostat controls and behaviors. There are a number of possible reasons for these counterintuitive results including the inability to control for regional climate variability due to the data sanitization (to prevent identification of respondents), inaccurate data caused by to self-reporting, and the fact that not all relevant behavioral variables were included in the data set, so we were not able to control for them in the study. The results of this analysis could be used as an in-sample prediction for approximating energy demand of a residential building whose characteristics are described by the regressors in this analysis, but a certain combination of their particular values does not exist in the real world. In addition, this study has potential applications for benefit-cost analysis of residential upgrades and retrofits under a fixed budget, because the results of this study contain information on how natural gas consumption might change once a particular characteristic or attribute is altered. Finally, the results of this study can help establish a relationship between natural gas consumption and changes in behavior of occupants...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Energy saving {{has been}} a stated policy {{objective}} of the EU since the 1970 s. Presently, the 2020 target is a 20 % reduction of EU energy consumption in comparison with current projections for 2020. This {{is one of the}} headline targets of the European Energy Strategy 2020 but efforts to achieve it remain slow and insufficient. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand why this is happening. Firstly, this paper examines the reasons why public measures promoting energy efficiency are needed and what form these measures should optimally take (§ 1). Fortunately, over the last 20 years, much research has been done into the famous ‘energy efficiency gap’ (or ‘the energy efficiency paradox’), even if more remains to be done. Multiple explanations have been given: market failures, modelling flaws and behavioural obstacles. Each encompasses many complex aspects. Several types of instruments can be adopted to encourage energy efficiency: measures guaranteeing the correct pricing of energy are preferred, followed by taxes or tradable white certificates which in turn are preferred to standards or subsidies. Information programmes are also necessary. Secondly, the paper analyzes the evolution of the different programmes from 2000 onwards (§ 2). This reveals the extreme complexity of the subject. It deals with quite diverse topics: buildings, appliances, public sector, industry and transport. The market for energy efficiency is as diffuse as energy consumption patterns themselves. It is composed of many market actors who demand more efficient provision of energy services, and that suppliers of the necessary goods and know-how deliver this greater efficiency. Consumers in this market include individuals, businesses and governments, and market activities cover all energy-consuming sectors of the economy. Additionally, energy efficiency is the perfect example of a shared competence between the EU and the Member States. Lastly, the legal framework has steadily increased in complexity, and despite the successive energy efficiency programmes used to build this framework, it has become clear that the gap between the target and the results remains. The paper then examines whether the 2012 / 27 /EU Directive adopted to improve the situation could bring better results. It briefly describes the content of this framework Directive, which accompanies and implements the latest energy efficiency programme (§ 3). Although the Directive is technically complex and maintains nonbinding energy efficiency targets, it certainly represents an improvement in several aspects. However, it is also saddled with a multiplicity of exemption clauses and interpretative documents (with no binding value) which weaken its provisions. Furthermore, alone, it will allow the achievement of only about 17. 7 % of <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> by 2020. The implementation process, which is essential, also remains fairly weak. The paper also gives a glimpse of the various EU instruments for financing energy efficiency projects (§ 4). Though useful, they do not indicate a strong priority. Fourthly, the paper tries to analyze the EU’s limited progress so far and gather a few suggestions for improvement. One thing seems to remain useful: targets which can be defined in various ways (§ 5). Basically, all this indicates that the EU energy efficiency strategy has so far failed to reach its targets, lacks coherence and remains ambiguous. In the new Commission’s proposals of 22 January 2014 – intended to define a new climate/energy package in the period from 2020 to 2030 – the approach to energy efficiency remains unclear. This is regrettable. Energy efficiency is the only instrument which allows the EU to reach simultaneously its three targets: sustainability, competitiveness and security. The final conclusion appears thus paradoxical. On the one hand, all existing studies indicate that the decarbonization of the EU economy will be absolutely impossible without some very serious improvements in energy efficiency. On the other hand, in reality energy efficiency has always been treated as a second zone priority. It is imperative to eliminate this contradiction...|$|E

The performances of several constructions of Trombe walls are studied. The annualized life cycle energy use by houses with Trombe walls may be lower when the core material has lower density and lower embodied energy.

40|$|The 2015 climate {{summit in}} Paris {{has shown the}} {{dedication}} of countries {{all over the world}} to prevent “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”, [13]. The decision has been made, that exceeding the limit of a 2 degree Celsius increase in average world temperature compared to 1990 levels has to be avoided. Germany has been on the front of reducing its carbon footprint with its ’Energiewende’. The reduction of the energy consumption in the residential building sector plays a vital role in the country’s policies, as the residential building accounts for 26 % of the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> consumption [42]. The goal of the TABULA project is to categorise the residential building stock, [47]. This research uses the TABULA project to determine the potential <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and corresponding CO 2 emission reductions as a result of retrofit application of building automation systems in single family houses (SFH). Building automation systems (BAS), and in particular automatic regulating heating systems in residential homes could play a role. In this research a Modelica [60] based residential building model (RBM) has been developed to simulate the automatic regulation of a central heating system in SFHs. Two BAS scenarios are considered and applied to three Stand Alone Houses (SAHs). The imple- mentation of a time schedule thermostat that automatically reduces the set temperature when the residents are not occupying the building, and a self regulating thermostat valve that reduces the heat transmission in the room during manual ventilation over the windows. Implementing scenario 1 BAS for the SAHs would lead to an annual <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> reduction of 10 % for SAH 1, 11 % for SAH 2 and 14 % for SAH 3. The corresponding annual primary energy reduction on the German building stock level results to 58 PJ. This would lead to a reduction of the CO 2 emissions by 3. 1 Mt CO 2 on yearly basis. The RBM has a dual functionality of assessing both the indoor climate conditions over the course of a year as well as the annual <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> consumption for space heating. Regulating the indoor set temperature requires a relatively high load during reheating periods compared to constant operation. The research shows the importance of a sufficient nominal load of the heating system to ensure the thermal comfort of the residents in winter. The annual <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> potential for scenario 2 BAS (self regulation thermostat valves) in SAH 3 is 4 %, under minimal ventilation conditions. However, the results of the RBM have shown that different ventilation rates could influence this result significantly.

40|$|SUMMARY The world steel {{industry}} {{plays a major}} role in energy use and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions now and in the future. Implementing energy efficiency measures is among one of the most cost-effective investments that the industry could make in improving efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. The goal of this thesis was to analyse the potential of energy efficiency measures in the world {{steel industry}}. Through characterizing energy-efficiency technology costs and improvement potentials, energy savings and carbon mitigation have been developed and presented for energy efficiency measures for the world steel industry in 2006. In order to properly analyse the total world steel industry, specific regions have been identified; the United States (US), Western Europe (WEU), Former Sovjet Union (FSU), India (IND), China (CHI), Japan (JAP) and Central- and South America (CSA). These regions together are responsible for over 80 % of the world steel production. First, an in depth study of 72 identified energy efficiency measures in the US steel industry in 2006 was conducted. Data for energy efficiency measure was collected from case studies, scientific reports, energy audits, etc. Measures were evaluated on cost-effectiveness by calculating Cost of Conserved Energy (CCE) and total energy savings. Once each measure was characterized individually, its applicability to the US iron and steel industry as a whole was assessed. The total of energy savings calculated for each measure represents the total potential for the US. Next, the potential of only cost-effective measures was calculated by adding only the energy savings potential of measures which were identified as cost-effective by CCE calculation. From the energy savings, the carbon mitigation was calculated. In summary, implementing all energy efficiency measures in the US steel industry showed major reduction potentials for both the energy use (385 PJ) and carbon emissions (7. 2 MtC). Even if only cost-effective measures are taken into account, the energy and carbon reductions add up to 300 PJ and 6. 2 MtC, respectively (equals 26 % and 22 % of total US steel industry energy use and carbon emissions). The assessment of energy efficiency measures in the US lead to a number of assumptions on key factors influencing the energy efficiency measures for the steel industry in different world regions. From the assessment in the US, it was clear that the energy use, production, industry structure and average weighted energy price were the most important factors influencing the potential of (cost-effective) energy efficiency measures. With these key factors, the analysis was expanded to the other identified world regions. For these world regions estimations were made of the effects of energy efficiency measures in in their steel industry, using the identified key factors and an adaptation of costs data by the PPP-index. The results of these estimations are provided in Table 1. The results of the in depth analysis of the US, the estimations for the selected world regions and an assumption for the remaining other world regions, provided an estimation of the potential for the world steel industry. Apparently, the application of energy efficiency measures all over the world resulted in a total potential energy savings of about 5. 7 EJ in 2006 (5. 3 - 6. 0 EJ when uncertainties are included). The cost-effective energy savings for the world steel industry are about 4. 1 EJ in 2006 (3. 5 - 5. 4 EJ, uncertainties included). The total potential for energy efficiency measures is about 23 % of the world steel final energy consumption. The cost-effective energy savings add up to about 16 % of the final energy consumption. For carbon mitigation the application of energy efficiency measures all over the world resulted in a total potential carbon reduction of about 107 MtC in 2006 (101 - 113 MtC, uncertainties included). The cost-effective carbon reductions for the world steel industry are about 82 MtC in 2006 (76 - 101 MtC, uncertainties included). The total potential for energy efficiency measures is about 20 % of the world steel carbon emission mitigation. The cost-effective carbon reductions add up to about 15 % of the total carbon emissions. In short, the application of energy efficiency measures in the world steel industry offers a major potential for <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and carbon emission reductions. ...|$|E

Chips are treated with a dilute solution of oxalic acid (OA) for only 10 minute at 130 °C, in a typical example. The properties of the pulp produced by this OA process are quite different from those obtained via conventional chemical pretreatments, providing a much more valuable pulp, and at higher yields. Refining results obtained at the Andritz Pilot Plant in Springfield, Ohio show an outstanding combination of strength improvements, <b>energy</b> <b>savings,</b> and shive and triglycerides reduction, with only a modest loss in brightness. Under suitable conditions the light scattering coefficient of the oxalic-treated treated chips was fully recovered without losing the above benefits.

First a short description is given of the 'Protocol Monitoring Energy savings', a common methodology and database to calculate the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>savings,</b> that {{has been set up}} earlier by four Dutch institutes CPB, ECN, Novem and RIVM. Results are presented for <b>savings</b> on <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> use, for conversion in end-use sectors (co-generation) and for conversion in the <b>energy</b> sector. National <b>savings</b> of 1, 0 % per year are found, with a decreasing tendency in recent years. Much attention is given to the uncertainty margins that result from the uncertainty in the input data and the 'quality' of the variable that is used to calculated the reference <b>energy</b> use (without <b>savings).</b> It proves not possible to supply a reliable <b>saving</b> figure for <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> use in the services sector. On the other hand the savings from better conversion can be calculated quite well. Overall a margin of +/- 0, 3 % is found for the national yearly saving figure. Next to savings an analysis has also been made of volume- and structural effects with respect to energy consumption, energy-intensity developments and other relevant factors in different sectors. Finally savings have been put in perspective: savings in comparison with that of the EU-countries, the contribution of savings to the reduction of the CO 2 -emissions and a comparison with other evaluation studies...|$|R

Studies show that it dominates the energy consumption of households in the European Union (EU) with 67 % of the total energy use (Lapillonne et al. 2015). The residential sector overall accounts for 25 % of the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> consumption, comparable to the EU’s entire industry sector (Eurostat 2018). Other countries report similarly significant numbers (International Energy Agency 2015).

40|$|Promoting {{technological}} development to improve energy efficiency {{has been the}} primary method of energy conservation in China. However, the existence of energy rebound effect will impose negative effects on the <b>final</b> result of <b>energy</b> <b>saving.</b> In this article, we adopt the Malmquist index approach to estimate the contribution of technological progress to economic growth. We also employ Logarithmic mean weight Divisia index (LMDI) to measure the impact of technological improvement on the energy intensity. Based on the above, {{we set up a}} model to estimate the technology-based energy rebound effect in China. The results show that, over 1981 - 2009, energy rebound effect amounts averagely to 53. 2 %, implying that China cannot simply rely on technical means to reduce energy consumption and emission. Economic instruments should also be applied as supplements to ensure results of energy conservation and emission reduction. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The EU Directive 2006 / 32 /EC {{on energy}} end-use {{efficiency}} and energy services (ESD) became effective on 17 May 2006. Now the Member States {{have to develop}} strategies and policies for the national implementation of the Directive, which sets a national indicative <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> target of 9 % for the ninth year of the Directive's application. This target is to be met using measures to improve energy efficiency. The Member States have to present their first energy efficiency action plan (EEAP) under the ESD by 30 June 2007, which must contain the national overall target for <b>energy</b> <b>saving.</b> According to the first provisional calculations of the national <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> target under the ESD, the <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> which have to be achieved in Germany in the ninth year of the Directive (2016) amount to 758 PJ of <b>final</b> <b>energy.</b> The target cannot only be achieved by new measures applied in the active period of the Directive (2008 - 2016), but measures taken since 1995 which still have an effect in 2016 ("early actions") may also be considered. According to a first rough estimate, early action can contribute substantially to achieving the ESD target value for Germany. Taking into account recent energy efficiency programmes of the Federal government, {{the main focus of}} new measures under the ESD will probably be on the building sector (existing and new buildings) and on electrical appliances. The transport sector could become a second area for energy efficiency measures under the ESD. For measuring the <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> realised under the ESD in Germany, a national model has been developed which includes both bottom-up and top-down monitoring elements. Other important implementation aspects are also discussed such as the statistical data demands resulting from the ESD, the special requirements for the public sector, institutional embedding and cost aspects of transposing the ESD in Germany...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{concentrate}} on the reporting and verification of energy and emissions reductions rather than absolute levels. Absolute emissions levels are collected by the US Department of Energy`s (US DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA) and other agencies, using reporting and verification procedures that are straightforward and build upon previous data collection activities. In contrast, <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> or reductions cannot be measured directly; instead they must be estimated by subtracting the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> use from initial energy use. In the meantime, conditions may change, such as economic activity or weather, so that a simple subtraction may yield misleading results. Therefore, estimation, verification, and reporting of <b>energy</b> and emissions <b>savings</b> require considerably more information {{to ensure that the}} reductions are due to efficiency improvements rather changes in other conditions.
