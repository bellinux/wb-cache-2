25|$|Two Spanish friars, Brothers Gabriel de Fontaned and Guillermo de Rigosa {{traveled}} to Rome {{to meet the}} Pope for the approval of their order (The Order of Minims for the Service of the Sick or The Order of Saint Francis of Paola). As they were passing through the town of Traigueras (under the jurisdiction of Tortosa in the Principate of Catalonia), a furious storm descended upon them. The brothers prayed for God's guidance and help. Immediately they saw a mysterious light coming from a cave in a cliff. Climbing up, they entered and found a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Jesus in her arms. They reported being surrounded by shimmering lights and fragrant scents. As no one claimed the statue, the two carried it with them, hoping that the Blessed Mother would help in getting approval for their order.|$|E
25|$|Having {{borrowed}} the large architectural {{setting in the}} Temple of the Presentation, later scenes may show the high priest alone <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> as he or a mohel performs the operation, as in the St Wolfgang altarpiece by Michael Pacher (1481), or Dürer's painting (right) and his influential woodcut from his series on the Life of the Virgin. This reflected what had by then become, and remains, standard Jewish practice, where the ceremony is performed in the synagogue and the baby is held by the seated rabbi as the mohel performs the operation. Such an arrangement is seen in a miniature from a German Pentateuch in Hebrew from about 1300, showing the Circumcision of Isaac. Other depictions show the baby held by Mary or Joseph, or both. Many show another baby in the background, presumably the next in the queue.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{episode was}} shot in Cardiff, in November 2004. The weather changed {{frequently}} during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold. The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were {{in the community of}} Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tyler's flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the '80s; for example, peach dresses and [...] "big hair" [...] were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too [...] "bouncy". Piper was scared of <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but they were limited to how many hours they could work with the infant, an [...] "artificial baby" [...] was used as a placeholder in some scenes.|$|E

"Moreh Derekh", the Rabbi's {{manual of}} the Conservative Judaism movement's Rabbinical Assembly, {{presents}} a ceremony based on traditional Jewish forms, {{with a number}} of options that parents may choose to perform: [...] (A) Lighting seven candles (symbolizing the seven days of creation) and <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> towards them, (B) [...] Wrapping the baby in the four corners of a tallit (Jewish prayer shawl), or (C) Lifting the baby and touching her hands to a Torah scroll.|$|E

[...] The other two kings stand, their crowns on their heads and hold vases {{containing}} their gifts. One's costume is completed by a small cross and type of coif whilst the other has a cord around his shoulders from which a cross is suspended. The cow and the ass are at Joseph's side.|$|E

2500|$|This is one view, however {{scholars}} have also {{written about the}} Cult of the Virgin Mary and its prominence {{in the creation of}} the church we see today. [...] Before the Christian church was built, the church used to be dedicated to a fertility goddess, and women would come to the well at this location in order to pray for their children. [...] When the Catholic church took over the pagan site, they made a nod to the cult by depicting the life of Mary on the door jambs, beginning with the infertility of her parents Joachim and Anne. Mary also occupies a less marginal position in the far right tympanum, <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> Christ on her lap.|$|E

Apparently Mrs Smith had gone shopping and M.J.K. was left <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Despite an Oxford education his accent was utterly classless and between questions to which he appeared to be paying no attention whatever, he applied himself to solving the crossword in the latest Times to arrive from Britain. [...] "Good heavens", growled one of Australia's senior cricket correspondents, [...] "what have we here?" [...] What we all had on that tour was the affable companionship {{of one of the most}} popular England captains ever to tour anywhere. It never occurred to him to leave the baby, let alone his wife, at home while he led the fight for the Ashes.|$|E
2500|$|The Quilinen Calvary {{was erected}} in 1547. On {{the shaft of}} the central cross are two small ledges on which there are statues {{depicting}} John the Evangelist and two female saints and {{at the base of}} the cross is a pietà or [...] "Notre-Dame de Pitié" [...] depicting the Virgin Mary with her dead son across her lap and accompanied by one of the female saints and John the Evangelist. At the back of the cross is a depiction of the Virgin Mary <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> Jesus in her arms and a little higher up the shaft is a depiction of Mary Magdalene with her pot of ointment. At the summit of the cross on the reverse side of the depiction of the crucifixion there is a depiction of the resurrected Christ. The two smaller crosses bear the contorted bodies of the two robbers executed alongside Jesus.|$|E

2500|$|The tight {{bundling}} {{is enough}} to stimulate the baby: vestibular stimulation from the parent's breathing and chest movement, auditory stimulation from the parent's voice and natural sounds of breathing and the heartbeat, touch by {{the skin of the}} parent, the wrap, and the natural tendency to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> [...] All this stimulation is important for <b>the</b> <b>baby’s</b> development.|$|R
2500|$|On the calvary {{platform}} {{are three}} crosses. We see Jesus {{on the central}} cross with four angels collecting his blood and on the reverse an [...] "Ecce Homo". Jesus has a horsed cavalier {{on either side of}} him and on the lower crosspiece there is a depiction of the Virgin Mary <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> Jesus, with St Peter on one side and John the Evangelist on the other, whilst on the reverse of these three figures there is a pietà in the centre with the Virgin Mary on one side and St Yves on the other. There are two smaller crosses, one on each side of the crucifixion cross, from which the two robbers hang. The good robber turns to Jesus whilst the bad robber turns away from him. At the foot of the main cross there is a statue of Mary Magdalene looking up towards Jesus and on the pedestal platform a [...] "mise au tombeau" [...] and a depiction of Jesus' resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} depictions to survive is a miniature in an important Byzantine illuminated manuscript of 979–984, the Menologion of Basil II in the Vatican Library. This has a scene which shows Mary and Joseph <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> Jesus outside a building, probably the Temple of Jerusalem, as a priest comes towards them with a small knife. This {{is typical of the}} early depictions, which avoid showing the operation itself. At the period of Jesus's birth, the actual Jewish practice was for the operation to be performed at home, usually by the father, and Joseph is shown using the knife in an enamelled plaque from the Klosterneuburg Altar (1181) by Nicolas of Verdun, where it is next to plaques showing the very rare scenes (in Christian art) of the circumcisions of Isaac and Samson. [...] Like most later depictions these are shown taking place in a large building, probably representing the Temple, though in fact the ceremony was never performed there. Medieval pilgrims to the Holy Land were told Jesus had been circumcised in the church at Bethlehem.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes called [...] "tube", [...] "pocket" [...] or [...] "ringless" [...] slings, {{these are}} {{generally}} formed {{by a wide}} piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, snaps, buckles, clips, rings, drawstrings, velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent's body and <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> more securely than a simple straight tube. The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in. Many pediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> chin is collapsed against his or her chest, constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent's view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should {{be sure to keep}} <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> face elevated and clearly visible.|$|R
25|$|Kangaroo care {{seeks to}} provide {{restored}} {{closeness of the}} newborn with family members by placing the infant in direct skin-to-skin contact with one of them.

50|$|There are two {{roles in}} the Jewish {{circumcision}} ceremony that are sometimes translated as godparent. <b>The</b> sandek <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> boy while he is circumcised.

Kvater is etymologically derived from the archaic German Gevatter ("godfather").|$|R
