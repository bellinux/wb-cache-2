5|$|Power: A New Social Analysis by Bertrand Russell (1st imp. London 1938, Allen & Unwin, 328 pp.) {{is a work}} {{in social}} {{philosophy}} written by Bertrand Russell. Power, for Russell, is one's ability to achieve goals. In particular, Russell <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> social power, that is, power over people.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|Subramaniam {{is a rich}} {{businessman}} managing his own construction company. He {{lives with}} his wife Shanthi and sons Sanjay and Santosh. Subramaniam cares for his family a lot and excessively dotes upon his children. Santosh, the younger son, does not like this as he wants to be independent and free from his father’s guidance and control. But Santosh acts normally to avoid hurting his father. Santosh <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that both his career and wife should be of his choice only and not of his father. Subramaniam wants Santosh to assist him in managing the company but Santosh dreams of starting a new company on his own and does not prefer to work in his father’s company. Meanwhile, Subramaniam arranges Santosh’s wedding with Rajeshwari, daughter of his friend Ramamoorthy. Santosh is shocked as he has no other option rather than agreeing for this wedding.|$|E

25|$|The non-logical symbols {{represent}} predicates (relations), {{functions and}} constants on {{the domain of}} discourse. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes. A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a signature.|$|E
25|$|Howard (1919) {{ended his}} review by stating, {{that the issue}} is {{probably}} beclouded by reason of the different points of view involved. The cost accountant wishes, among other things, to furnish the selling department adequate data upon which to base a price policy. The general accountant <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the preparation of correct, unpadded statements of condition and of operation. For the purposes of the one certain information is needed, which by the other should be discarded. Reconciliation of the opposing ideas ought to be possible, perhaps along the lines suggested by Messrs. Nicholson and Rohrbach.|$|E

25|$|Although {{thorough}} {{training and}} practice {{are required to}} use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the input method. This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method. The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows. On Mac OS X, handwriting recognition input method is bundled with the OS.|$|E
25|$|In Jelling, Thorfinn meets some of Thorkell’s men. After being {{pressured}} by the men, Thorfinn {{has no choice}} but to accompany them to meet Thorkell, the Earl of Jelling whose land was received by King Canute. Thorfinn also meets Floki who, unbeknownst to Thorfinn, was the one who ordered Askeladd to kill his father Thors. During their meeting, Thorfinn learns that a group of Jomsvikings led by Vagn is pirating the Baltic Sea to gain fame and name himself as the new chieftain of the Jomsvikings, as the previous chieftain died before he could name a successor. Floki came to Jelling to seek aid from Thorkell in the conflict. Floki cannot become the new chieftain as their order’s code dictates that any warriors 50 years and over must retire, and the candidate Floki <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> is too young for the order to admit. The candidate is Baldr, Floki’s grandson, as well the son of the former chieftain and grandchild of Sigvaldi, the second Jomsviking chieftain. In case a successor was not named, it’s only appropriate that the next chieftain is based on the prestige of his bloodline. To Floki’s dismay, Thorkell wants Thorfinn to become the next chieftain, as he is also the grandson of Sigvaldi and the son of Thors, the “Troll of Jom”, and currently the strongest and most valid candidate as the next Jomsviking chieftain. Thorfinn refuses the offer and returns to his companions. Thorfinn, knowing the dangers of staying in Jelling, hurries his crew to set sail immediately. All the while, Floki has plans to killing Thorsfinn while away from Thorkell’s lands.|$|E
500|$|By [...] "traditional power", Russell <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> {{the ways}} in which people will appeal to the force of habit to justify a {{political}} regime. It is in this sense that traditional power is psychological and not historical; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed, but rather, on mere habit. Moreover, traditional power need not be based on actual history, but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history. Thus he writes that [...] "Both religious and secular innovators – at any rate those who have had most lasting success – have appealed, as far as they could, to tradition, and have done whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system."

500|$|According to numismatic {{historian}} Roger Burdette, [...] "Chapman's letter {{caused some}} consternation at the White House". [...] The President prepared a reply {{in which he}} expressed himself strongly to Chapman, but Bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over Bigelow's signature, defending the new coins. [...] Bigelow's letter replied to Chapman's complaint about the Indian, [...] "The answer to {{this is that the}} head was taken from a recent photograph of an Indian whose health was excellent. [...] Perhaps Mr. Chapman <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations." [...] Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but no one at the lame duck Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, [...] "the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed". [...] Leach wrote to Bigelow on January 2, 1909, [...] "I was somewhat amused by their savage attack, and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism. [...] However, I am pleased to say that adverse criticism of the coins is an exception. [...] I feel very well pleased with the result." ...|$|E

[...] The extroverted, Americanized woman {{is not what}} Wang <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for his elder son, and Wang and Ta argue. [...] Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates Linda's scheme: Linda, frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy, is determined to marry someone, and if Sammy won't step forward, she will settle for Ta. [...] Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs, Mei Li and her father to watch the show at his [...] "Celestial Bar" [...] ("Fan Tan Fannie"). [...] Linda does her striptease, realizing too late who is sitting at the best table. [...] Sammy's special guests storm out, except for Ta, who is so humiliated {{that he does not}} know what to do. [...] He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao, a seamstress who fits Linda's costumes for her, and whose love for Ta is unrequited. [...] Linda, goaded beyond endurance when Sammy raises his glass to her, dumps a champagne bucket over his head.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{had voted}} {{the day before}} in favor of {{approval}} for the Clinton administration's action, saying [...] "Atrocities are the signature of the Serbian Army. They've been carrying out atrocities since 1992. We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for Kosovo to continue. We are at a critical hour." [...] He was critical of past inaction by the Clinton administration in the matter, and within days was urging {{that the use of}} ground troops not be ruled out. [...] McCain became a very frequent guest on television talk shows discussing the conflict, and his [...] "We are in it, now we must win it" [...] stance drew much attention. [...] On March 31, three American soldiers were captured by Yugoslavia; the next day, McCain canceled his planned roadshow, stating [...] "this is not an appropriate time to launch a political campaign." [...] He received media praise for his action and continued to be a highly visible spokesman for strong action regarding Kosovo; CNN pundit Mark Shields said that, [...] "In thirty-five years in Washington, I have never seen a debate dominated by an individual in the minority party as I've seen this one dominated by John McCain." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E

2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. If I were in his place I should do all that he has done and I should do all that I know he <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to do'.|$|E
