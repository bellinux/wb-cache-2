5|$|The African species Roridomyces mauritianus <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> {{appearance}} to R.austrororidus, {{but can be}} distinguished by the brownish cap, and microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 7–8 by 3.5–4.0μm), and its shorter (25–40μm), club-shaped basidia.|$|E

5|$|Antrodia serialiformis <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but {{the latter has}} larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The two can be distinguished in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on coniferous wood, A.serialiformis grows strictly on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola: Commonly {{known as}} white {{mountain}} banksia, {{it is the}} only subspecies with a montane distribution; it occurs in the Blue Mountains of northern New South Wales.

5|$|Boletus pisciodorus <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> form to Tylopilus tabacinus.

Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion {{does not appear to have}} significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E

Hydnellum spongiosipes is readily confused with H.ferrugineum, and several authors have historically considered {{the two species}} to be the same; molecular studies, however, indicate that the two fungi are closely related, but distinct. In contrast with H.ferrugineum, H.spongiosipes has a darker cap when young, darker flesh, and occurs in deciduous woods. Old fruit bodies of H.ferrugineum can be confused with those of Hydnellum concrescens.|$|E
