In these 3 experiments we always compared the masking effects of speech backgrounds (i. e., 4 -talker babble) that were produced in the same language as the target language (i. e., French) or in unknown foreign languages (i. e., Irish and Italian) to the masking effects of corresponding non-speech backgrounds (i. e., speech-derived <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise).</b> The <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> contained similar spectro-temporal information as babble but lacked linguistic information. At - 5 dB SNR, both tasks revealed significantly divergent results between the unknown languages (i. e., Irish and Italian) with Italian and French hindering French target word identification to a similar extent, whereas Irish led to significantly better performances on these tasks. By comparing the performances obtained with speech and <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> backgrounds, {{we were able to}} evaluate the effect of each language. The intelligibility task showed a significant difference between babble and <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> for French, Irish and Italian, suggesting acoustic and linguistic effects for each language. However, the lexical decision task, which reduces the effect of post-lexical interference, appeared to be more accurate, as it only revealed a linguistic effect for French. Thus, although French and Italian had equivalent masking effects on French word identification, the nature of their interference was different. This finding suggests that the differences observed between the masking effects of Italian and Irish can be explained at an acoustic level but not at a linguistic level...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that pupil dilation, a measure of mental effort (cognitive processing load), is sensitive to differences in speech intelligibility. The present study extends this outcome by examining the effects of masker type and age on the speech reception threshold (SRT) and mental effort. Design: In young and middle-aged adults, pupil dilation was measured while they performed an SRT task, in which spoken sentences were presented in stationary noise, <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise,</b> or together with a singletalker masker. The masker levels were adjusted to achieve 50 % or 84 % sentence intelligibility. Results: The results show better SRTs for <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> and a single-talker masker compared with stationary noise, which replicates results of previous studies. The peak pupil dilation, reflecting mental effort, was larger in the single-interfering speaker condition compared with the other masker conditions. Remarkably, in contrast to the thresholds, no differences in peak dilation were observed between <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> and stationary noise. This effect was independent of the intelligibility level and age. Conclusions: To maintain similar intelligibility levels, participants needed more mental effort for speech perception {{in the presence of a}} single-talker masker and then with the two other types of maskers. This suggests an additive interfering effect of speech information from the single-talker masker. The dissociation between these performance and mental effort measures underlines the importance of including measurements of pupil dilation as an independent index of mental effort during speech processing in different types of noisy environments and at different intelligibility levels.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several compression parameters on speech intelligibility in stationary and fluctuating speech-shaped noise was systematically investigated. The experiment {{was designed to}} investigate possible interaction effects between compression parameters on the speech reception threshold (SRT) in noise. Experimental conditions included all combinations of compression ratio (CR= 1 / 2, 2 / 2, 2 / 3, 3 / 3 for low/high frequencies), attack and release times (Ta/Tr= 4 / 4, 4 / 40, 40 / 40, 4 / 400, and 40 / 400 ms), and number of channels (NC= 1, 2, and 6). Twenty subjects with moderate sensorineural hearing loss {{took part in the}} extensive experiment. For stationary noise the results indicate that most compression settings yielded lower scores than those obtained with linear amplification. Single-channel compression resulted in the worst speech intelligibility whereas the results for two-channel and six-channel compression were roughly equal to each other. A compression ratio of 3 / 3 (CRlow/CRhigh) gave worse speech intelligibility than lower compression ratios. The combination of largest time constants (Ta/Tr = 40 / 400 ms) gave best results. For stationary noise two significant interaction effects were found: NC* T and NC*CR* T. Overall, the best result was obtained for two-channel compression CP(2, 2 / 3, 40 / 40) (_SRT =- 0. 7 dB). For six-channel compression the best speech intelligibility was achieved with CP(6, 2 / 2 + 2 / 3, 40 / 400) (_SRT =- 0. 4 dB) and the best result with single-channel compression was equal to that with linear amplification. For <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise,</b> the results showed that compression had only a small influence on speech intelligibility. Although multi-channel compression is known to reduce spectral and temporal contrasts, its effect on speech intelligibility in <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> was limited. For <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise,</b> only one significant result was obtained: overall, six-channel compression led to significantly worse speech intelligibility than compression with NC= 1 or 2. No significant interaction effects were found. For <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise,</b> the detrimental effects of compression were smaller than for stationary noise and the variance in the SRT results was larger. This suggests that stationary noise is more suited than <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noise</b> for measuring the effect of compression on speech intelligibility. Analyses for the data of individual subjects showed that for our subjects the effect of compression was rather small with respect to the within subject variability. Additionally the measurement error was larger for subjects with worse speech intelligibility in noise. The effect of compression was not significantly related to standard audiometric characteristics such as hearing threshold or dynamic range. However, for stationary noise, a significant correlation was found between the effect of compression and the SRT for linear amplification for the lowest two compression ratios (CR= 1 / 2 and CR= 2 / 2) only. Moreover, for this noise type, the best results obtained with compression improved significantly for subjects with a worse SRT. These correlations tentatively suggest that speech in stationary noise might be more useful for determining a possible benefit of compression than pure-tone audiometric threshold or dynamic range. In contrast, most current fitting rationales are threshold based...|$|E

Results indicated that the speech maskers were more interfering than the noise maskers in both target languages. The larger need for phonetic and semantic cues in a nonnative language makes a stationary masker relatively more challenging than a fluctuating-noise masker.

This method first calculates the brightness offset and the fluctuation level of each pixel by acquiring the dark image of the camera and then calculates the gain per pixel by illuminating the camera with different intensities. Then, these three parameters are used to calibrate the actual fluorescence image. This method is a good way to distinguish the source of readout noise and to calibrate and eliminate the single-pixel-dependent systematic readout {{noise of the}} camera. However, Huang et al. assumed Gaussian noise model of readout noise for all pixels on the sensor, which is based on the data obtained when the camera is dark, may not reflect the underlying fluctuation pattern for each pixel on the camera at different time points during the actual sampling, because during the actual sampling the fluctuation level of each pixel at a certain time point varies greatly. In SMLM experiments, these <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noises</b> can easily be treated as signals by single-molecule detection algorithms, resulting in artifacts in the reconstruction results.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Children with {{dyslexia}} {{have been}} suggested to experience deficits in both categorical perception (CP) and speech identification in noise (SIN) perception. However, results regarding both abilities are inconsistent, {{and the relationship between}} them is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between CP and the psychometric function of SIN perception. Method: Sixteen children with dyslexia, 16 chronological-age controls, and 16 reading-level controls were evaluated in CP of a voicing continuum and in consonant identification in both stationary and <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noises.</b> Results: There was a small but significant impairment in speech identification performance of children with dyslexia in stationary noise compared with chronological age– matched controls (but not reading level–matched controls). However, their performance increased in a fluctuating background, hence suggesting normal masking and unmasking effects and preserved sensory processing of speech information. Regarding CP, location of the phoneme boundary differed in the children with dyslexia compared with both control groups. However, scrutinizing individual profiles failed to reveal consistently poor performance in SIN and CP tasks. In addition, there was no significant correlation between CP, SIN perception, and reading scores in the group with dyslexia. Conclusions: The relationship between the SIN deficit and CP, and how they potentially affect reading in children with dyslexia, remains unclear. However, these results are inconsistent with the notion that children with dyslexia suffer from a low-level temporal processing deficit and rather suggest a role of nonsensory (e. g. attentional) factors in their speech perception difficulties.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to compare disturbance of reading by noises from various sources. Fourteen real noises were selected in one experiment, which were two isolated bursts of sound energy, two quasi-steady impulsive <b>noises,</b> three <b>fluctuating</b> <b>noises,</b> three intermittent noises, two noises from mixed noise sources, one steady noise and the other noise. These noises except for the mixed noises are typical ones classified in ISO 2204 according to level fluctuation. In another experiment, fourteen simulated pink noises were used and their sound levels fluctuated {{in the same way}} as those of real noises. Leq of these noises were equal to about 70 dB(A) and their duration were six minutes. It was found that high disturbance was caused by <b>noises</b> which greatly <b>fluctuated,</b> that is, more contained high sound level even in equal Leq. These noises are an aircraft noise, a complex noise which contained aircraft noise and their simulated pink noises. There was high correlation between disturbance and percentile levels like L 1, or L 5 of experimental noises both in real noise and particularly in pink noise. These support the dB(A) peak concept proposed by Rylander et al. It is therefore suggested that unified noise index should contain this finding. In addition, a tentative noise index which could evaluate noises from various sourced was shown. The concept of Flindell's pressure Leq was extended and applied to this index. Using this index, it is possible that findings of other researches are reasonably accounted for...|$|R
