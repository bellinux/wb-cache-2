5|$|Although corals <b>first</b> <b>appeared</b> in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are {{extremely}} rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. Paleozoic corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles <b>first</b> <b>appeared</b> before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole <b>first</b> <b>appeared</b> before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} {{are held}} to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene.

5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine Bette, and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many {{of the characters in}} the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel <b>first</b> <b>appeared</b> in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine Bette enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who <b>first</b> <b>appeared</b> as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between that story and La Cousine Bette, he became the Count of Forzheim; {{in a letter to the}} Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine Bette allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|E
