5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Booth co-authored Cricket and Christianity with Paul White {{and wrote}} Hockey Fundamentals and Booth to Bat. In 1998 he wrote Sport and sportsmanship: a Christian {{perspective}} towards 2000 for the Australian Christian Forum on Education. He {{believed that the}} foundations of sport were courtesy and fairness, and he condemned the prevalence of verbal jousting in the modern game. During his career, Booth often spoke at religious functions <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> Christian cricketers. He appeared with the English Test opener Reverend David Sheppard at Sydney Town Hall and preached with Conrad Hunte in the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{frequently}} occurs <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, {{a combination}} of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal}} to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|NVC has {{reportedly}} been {{an element of}} a bundle of interventions that produced dramatic changes in forensic psychiatric nursing settings in which {{a high level of}} violence is the norm. NVC was adopted, <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> interventions, in an effort to reduce violence. The interventions were said to reduce key violence indicators by 90 percent over a three-year period in a medium security unit, and by around 50 percent in a single year in a maximum security unit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{results from}} the design and evaluation of one-handed squeezing of a mobile phone: the application of force by each individual digit, and combinations of digits, of one hand {{as a means of}} interacting with a mobile device. As part of the evaluation we also consider how to alter the size of the interaction space to best suit the number of digits being used. By identifying which digits can accurately apply force both individually and <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>others,</b> we can then design one-handed, multi-channel input for mobile interaction. The results suggest that not all digits are equally accurate, and that some are more accurate when used <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>others.</b> Further, increasing the size of the underlying interaction space to suit the number of digits used improves user performance...|$|R

5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused no {{structural damage}} while tropical, although it generated rip currents <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> storms that killed one person off the New Jersey coast. Nate dropped light rainfall and produced gusty winds {{on the island}} of Bermuda. The remnants of hurricanes Nate and Maria contributed to heavy rainfall in parts of Scotland and later Western Norway, triggering a mudslide that killed one person. Canadian Navy ships en route to the US Gulf Coast, carrying relief supplies to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were delayed while trying to avoid Nate and Hurricane Ophelia.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} {{mechanisms}} can act in isolation or <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>others.</b> Assuming each effect is independent, the observed line profile is a convolution {{of the line}} profiles of each mechanism.

5|$|The type {{remains of}} Hypacrosaurus remains were {{collected}} in 1910 by Barnum Brown for the American Museum of Natural History. The remains, a partial postcranial skeleton consisting of several vertebrae and a partial pelvis (AMNH 5204), came from along the Red Deer River near Tolman Ferry, Alberta, Canada, from rocks {{of what is now}} known as the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (early Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous). Brown described these remains, <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> postcranial bones, in 1913 as a new genus that he considered to be like Saurolophus. No skull was known at this time, but two skulls were soon discovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Twelve binary halides, {{compounds}} {{with the}} formula VXn (n=2..5), are known. VI4, VCl5, VBr5, and VI5 {{do not exist}} or are extremely unstable. <b>In</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> reagents, VCl4 {{is used as a}} catalyst for polymerization of dienes. Like all binary halides, those of vanadium are Lewis acidic, especially those of V(IV) and V(V). Many of the halides form octahedral complexes with the formula VXnL6−n (X = halide; L = other ligand).|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. <b>In</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
