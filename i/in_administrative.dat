5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time. In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> tasks.

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. <b>In</b> <b>administrative</b> law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> law.|$|E

He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.|$|E

5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v.

The master huntsman, or the veneur, held a central position in greater noble households. Likewise, the master falconer was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself. There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a chapel was a natural part of every large household. These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics.

5|$|In the {{following}} year he became Home Secretary in India {{in the administration of}} Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, and in 1909 was temporarily a member of the governing council. His experience of administrative matters, including with regard to policing, proved to be useful to Curzon during the government's 1905 partition of Bengal along communal lines. So useful was his knowledge and ability that his term in India was extended for two years beyond the usual retirement age. This was to enable him to provide the summarisation, negotiation and drafting skills necessary to ensure success <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> reform of the Provincial Councils by Curzon's successor as Viceroy, Lord Minto.|$|E

5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would be {{in line with the}} green-light approach that the courts adopt <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> law. Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E

His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced.|$|E
5|$|Until 2007, Skagen was a {{municipality}} in its {{own right}} with a substantial local administration. With the reforms of 2007, it became part of Frederikshavn Municipality with a resulting loss <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> jobs. The Bank of Skagen was established in 1862, and in 1865 a telegraph station was established in the town. The pharmacy opened in 1904, a hospital in 1916, and telephone services were automated in 1956. Ankermedet School was established in 1955. Recently, Skagen has seen developments in the offshore sector with an initiative to assist the Norwegian market through the establishment of Skagen Offshorepark in 2012. On the shipbuilding front, Karstensens Skibsværft continues to prosper with orders for trawlers from Norway.|$|E
5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion <b>in</b> <b>administrative</b> law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E
