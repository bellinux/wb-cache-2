40|$|International audienceMost {{conservation}} efforts are channeled toward highly endangered species. However, snake populationsdecline rapidly worldwide, and many {{species that are}} currently classified as not threatened (e. g. LC - least concern, IUCNRed List) may well rapidly fall into the threatened categories. Yet, common species attract little attention. The principle,that it is more efficient to prevent disasters than to cure effects, is not taken into account. <b>Dice</b> <b>Snakes</b> (Natrix tessellata) offer a typical example of this situation.

40|$|International audienceSecondarily marine {{tetrapods}} {{have evolved}} adaptations {{to maintain their}} osmotic balance in a hyperosmoticenvironment. During {{the transition to a}} marine habitat, the evolution of a euryhaline physiology likely encompassedsuccessive changes in behavior and physiology that released organisms from regular access to freshwater. Deciphering these key steps is a complicated task. In this study, we investigated a species of freshwaternatricine snake in which some populations are known to use marine environments. We experimentally subjected 30 adult <b>Dice</b> <b>snakes</b> (Natrix tessellata) from a population inhabiting the Black Sea coast to three salinitiescorresponding to freshwater (~ 0. 1 ‰), brackish water (~ 15. 0 ‰), and full-strength seawater (~ 34. 0 ‰) inorder to investigate their physiological (variation of body mass, osmolality) and behavioral (activity, drinkingbehavior) responses to salinity. Our results show that coastal <b>Dice</b> <b>snakes</b> from the study population are relativelytolerant to salinity close to that recorded in the Black Sea, but that prolonged exposure to full-strengthseawater increases osmolality, stimulates thirst, decreases the activity of snakes and may ultimately jeopardizesurvival. Collectively with previously published data, our results strongly suggest specific physiological adaptationsto withstand hyperosmolality rather than to reduce intake of salt, in coastal populations or species ofsemi-aquatic snakes. Future comparative investigations of <b>Dice</b> <b>snakes</b> from populations restricted to freshwaterenvironment might reveal the functional traits and the behavioral and physiological responses of coastal N. tessellata to life in water with elevated salinity...|$|R

The activities of CAT, GSH-Px, GR and AChE, and the concentration of TBARS were significantly decreased, while GST activity and GSH concentration were significantly increased in snakes from the contaminated area compared to specimens from the control area. Significantly increased concentrations of Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mn, Na, Ni and Zn in the water at the contaminated area as compared to control area were detected. The metals Ag, Bi, Cd, Co, Hg, In and Tl were not observed in any of the localities. Cr, Mo and Pb were not detected at the control area but were observed at the contaminated area. The concentrations of Sr were similar at both sites. The concentration of Mg was 2 -fold higher at the control site than at the contaminated area.

40|$|International audienceA {{population}} of <b>dice</b> <b>snakes</b> (Natrix tessellata) monitored since 2008 {{in a small}} island (18 ha, 850 m a. s. l., FYR of Macedonia) revealed unforeseen patterns for snakes living in temperate climates. More than 5000 individuals have been marked and the density {{is one of the}} highest ever recorded (> 500 resident snakes per hectare). Reproductive and mortality rates are elevated, suggesting a high population turnover. These traits evoke a tropical rather than a temperate-climate ophidian demographic system. The population is highly polymorphic, three colour morphs (dotted, grey, and black) are observed in both sexes and each morph is represented by large numbers of individuals. This polymorphism pattern was not previously documented in snakes. Data obtained for other life history traits (e. g. body size, size at maturity, clutch size, diet, predation) markedly diverged in comparison to available information. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that the strong inter-population variability (often mediated by phenotypic plasticity) of snakes should be taken into account over large geographic scales; otherwise attempts to derive general patterns may well be strongly biased...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{relationship between}} salt excreting structures (e. g., salt glands) and marine life {{strongly suggests that}} the ability to regulate salt balance has been crucial during the transition to marine life in tetrapods. Elevated natremia (plasma sodium) recorded in several marine snakes species suggests that the development of a tolerance toward hypernatremia, in addition to salt gland development, has been a critical feature in the evolution of marine snakes. However, data from intermediate stage (species lacking salt glands but occasionally using salty environments) are lacking to draw a comprehensive picture of the evolution of an euryhaline physiology in these organisms. In this study, we assessed natremia of free-ranging <b>Dice</b> <b>snakes</b> (Natrix tessellata, a predominantly fresh water natricine lacking salt glands) from a coastal population in Bulgaria. Our results show that coastal N. tessellata can display hypernatremia (up to 195. 5 mmol x l(- 1)) without any apparent effect on several physiological and behavioural traits (e. g., hematocrit, body condition, foraging). More generally, a review of natremia in species situated along a continuum of habitat use between fresh- and seawater shows that snake species display a concomitant tolerance toward hypernatremia, even in species lacking salt glands. Collectively, these data suggest that a physiological tolerance toward hypernatremia has been critical during the evolution of an euryhaline physiology, and may well have preceded the evolution of salt glands...|$|R

50|$|In the Nahe valley a {{huge number}} of {{thermophile}} species appear which usually can only be found in the mediterranean region or Eurasian steppe habitats. Characteristical species of plants are e. g.

These plants immigrated in a postglacial warm period to Europe but became extinct in most regions when the climate changed again to significantly cooler and more humid conditions. They only survived in small but still warm and dry places due to special geographic situations. In the Nahe valley and its tributaries these are mostly rocky precipices towards South or South-East, furthermore sunny slopes with shrubs, bushes and dry broad-leaved forests.

40|$|Snakes are {{the second}} most specios group of living reptiles. Colubroidea, with more than 2500 species, {{is one of the}} most {{conspicuous}} radiations of terrestrial vertebrates. Recent studies show that globally 12 % of the snake species are estimated to be threatened with extinction. This estimation increases when including the cryptic species (discrete species that are difficult, or sometimes impossible, to distinguish morphologically and thus have been incorrectly classified as a single taxon) too. It is possible that some of the snakes biodiversity may get extinct even before a proper identification. In the developing countries like Iran this situation is even more serious. The country of Iran has the greatest faunal and floral diversity of the southern and arid parts of the Palaearctic realm, including a considerable diversity in the snakes. But there is insufficient data on the biodiversity of snakes in Iran and limited data about cryptic species of snakes in the country. In this PhD study, I have aimed to investigate the taxonomy of selected species of Iranian snakes, inhabiting the northern and western mountains of Iran. Relevant taxa were detected based on a review performed on the available taxonomic data on snakes of Iran. Snake taxa with a wide distribution range that reflect complexity of adaptations to different ecosystems or have great matter of taxonomic confusion, including the Eirenis medus species complex, the Eirenis persicus species complex, the Eirenis punctatolineatus, the Montivipera raddei species complex, and Natrix tessellata, have been selected for this study. Samplings were done in the northern and western mountains of Iran between 2008 and 2011. Patterns of morphological variation and its relevance for taxonomical interpretations of the Montivipera raddei species complex, as well as the taxonomy of Natrix tessellata, Eirenis punctatolineatus and Eirenis medus species complex, were investigated using a principal component analysis (PCA) and a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on metric and meristic data of the specimens. Taxonomy of the Eirenis persicus species complex was studied using both traditional biometry and geometric morphometry on landmark data of the dorsal head scales. Two mitochondrial genes, 16 S rRNA and cytochrome b, and one nuclear gene, c-mos, were sequenced and then a concatenated data set of these was analyzed to generate a Bayesian inference of phylogeny. The morphological analysis on the Montivipera raddei species complex revealed that a couple of specimens of the genus Montivipera, originating from the central Zagros mountain range, 216 is representing an unknown species. This species, named Montivipera kuhrangica Rajabizadeh, Nilson and Kami, 2011, has a higher count of head scales than other closely related species, including higher a number of intercanthal, supralabial scales and scales between the last supralabials. The field data indicate that in the Montivipera raddei species complex, there is a correlation between the dorsal color pattern variation and the environmental factors of the habitat, including vegetation and substrate color. In order to study geographic variation of Natrix tessellata in Iran, a total of 66 specimens, including 39 males and 27 females, were examined. The analysis on both sexes separately revealed that the males from the Fars province (southern Zagros) are significantly different from all other <b>dice</b> <b>snakes</b> in Iran, in the tail length, head length, head width and number of ventral scales. Further studies are needed to resolve the taxonomic problem of the southern Zagros populations of Natrix tessellata. The analysis on 23 males and 21 females of Eirenis punctatolineatus indicates that the southern Zagros populations differ significantly from the rest of the populations in tail length and number of subcaudal scales, number of preventral scales, number of scales bordering parietals and shape of the dorsal color pattern in both sexes. A subspecific subdivision is suggested for the northern and southern populations. As a new combination, Eirenis punctatolineatus condone (Boulenger, 1920), is proposed for the southern populations. Analysis on the three populations of Eirenis medus species complex from Turkmenistan and northern and western mountains of Iran, revealed a couple of specimens from Kerman province in southern Zagros that differs from known populations of Eirenis medus in their morphometric and meristic characters. Compared with Eirenis medus, this new species, named Eirenis kermanensis Rajabizadeh, Schmidtler, Orlov and Soleimani, 2012, has a higher number of subcaudals and a higher ratio of tail length over total length. Also in Eirenis kermanensis, the loreal scale is deeper than long, while in Eirenis medus the loreal is longer than deep. In studying the taxonomy of the Eirenis persicus species complex, the biometric data from 23 males and 17 females revealed that the populations of Eirenis persicus in the western mountains of Iran and Turkey are significantly different from the populations in eastern Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan. This significant divergence was confirmed by geometric morphometric and molecular analyses too. Both molecular and morphological analyses showed that specimens of the Eirenis persicus species complex that belong to the nigrofasciatus morph, are closely related to the eastern populations of the Eirenis persicus species complex. Within-group PCA revealed that Eirenis persicus populations of Iran and Turkey are morphologically different from each other at a subspecific level. This result was confirmed by molecular data as well. Studies on the genus Eirenis revealed the occurrence of cryptic biodiversity in these snakes. During the warming periods of the Pleistocene climatic oscillations, the suitable habitat of mountain dwelling snakes shifted to higher altitudes in the mountain. Subsequently, climatic cooling shifted the range of these habitats back to lower altitudes. These altitude shift of the habitat during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations induced the isolation and speciation in the examined snake species throughout the northern and western mountains of Iran. The present study on the selected species of the genera Eirenis, Natrix and Montivipera confirmed that the current knowledge on Iranian snake taxonomy is limited, and undescribed species remain to be discovered. This limited knowledge is to be understood due to the substantial snake biodiversity in Iran (related to its diversity of ecosystems) and lack of in-depth taxonomic studies on snake biodiversity. As such, although most of the results from this study are new related to our understanding of snake biodiversity in Iran, they still cover only a few species of this Iranian diversity, of which a lot remains to be properly assessed...|$|R

30|$|Countries with Mediterranean climate (Croatia, Italy, Turkey) {{form the}} final group with {{freshwater}} tolerating marine fish species and cosmopolitan fish {{species in the}} diet of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake.</b> This area is characterised with the most diverse feeding spectrum including snails, insects, reptiles and mammals (Additional file 1, Figure  3) related to the drying out of many water bodies during summer. During extremely hot summers, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> was also observed to hunt at night, also far away from surface waters, which furthers the potential feeding spectrum of this snake (see e.g. Moller [1990], who observed {{over a period of}} several weeks a large <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> which ‘unusually’ hunted geckos at night).|$|E
30|$|Abiotic {{environmental}} {{parameters are}} known to have an important, but limited power in determining reptile distributions on a larger scale; other factors such as resources are also important (Guisan and Hofer [2003]). As far as feeding spectra are concerned, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> was considered to be in an intermediate position among the three Natrix species inhabiting the Palearctic. In a comparative study with the closely related grass snake (Natrix natrix), Luiselli and Rugiero ([1991]) found the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> to have a narrower feeding spectrum than the grass snake, which also has a broader distribution (Gasc et al. [1997]). The latter species more plastically changing its diet and populations near to each other within relatively short distances may specialise on different food (Luiselli et al. [2005]). What is more, the presence of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> did not have any apparent effect on the food types eaten by grass snakes because grass snakes consumed fish when sympatric with N. tessellata (Luiselli et al. [2005]). The diet of the third species, the viperine snake, Natrix maura, shows a considerable overlap with that of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> but with some exceptions (see e.g. the observations of Scali, [2011]), and due to other factors as fertility and size, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> is able to outcompete the viperine snake (Metzger et al. [2011]).|$|E
30|$|The feeding {{spectrum}} of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> differs among different regions, {{the analysis of the}} results revealed four main groups (Figure  4). The group separated most from other branches includes Asian countries with <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> populations in highly arid regions (Iran, Syria, Jordan). The list of prey species in these countries is short, with snakes predominantly feeding on fish and amphibians from permanent rivers and alien fish species kept in fish farms (Amr and Disi [2011]; Amr et al. [2011]; Shehab et al. [2011]). Fish ponds also function as refugia over the driest periods {{but at the same time}} the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> is under great predation pressure there due to the large number of aquatic birds present (Amr and Disi [2011]; Bakaloudis et al. [1998]; Shehab et al. [2011]).|$|E
40|$|Six novel {{polymorphic}} microsatellite loci {{are presented}} for the grass snake (Natrix natrix), a species with declining populations in many regions.

At two loci, the expected heterozygosity differed significantly from observed heterozygosity. Cross-amplification of the grass snake markers in the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> showed two polymorphic microsatellites with two and four alleles...|$|E
30|$|Due to its {{excellent}} {{swimming and}} diving abilities and fidelity to freshwater habitats, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> {{is generally considered}} to be a piscivorous fish species (Gasc et al. [1997], Kreiner [2007]). However, the global feeding spectrum of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> is surprisingly wide; it also includes a reasonable number of marine and terrestrial species (Figure  1), both fast- and slow-moving animals. For example, reptiles, especially lizards, have been found in the diet of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> for more than 60  years (Göçmen et al. [2011]), and slow aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, snails and insects were also repeatedly reported (Additional file 1) (Bakiev et al. [2011]; Göçmen et al. [2011]; Wang et al. [1987], [2005]). A key factor determining the actual species composition is that according to current understanding of the species' habitat requirements over much of its range, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> remains in the immediate vicinity of surface waters at a distance of less than 20 metres to the water edge during the active season (Conelli et al. [2011]; Neumann and Mebert [2011]; Velenský et al. [2011]). As a result, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> nearly exclusively feeds on aquatic and/or water-bound animals. The most important prey organisms are fish, especially in the European part of its distribution area, where over 75 species were recorded in the diet and 85 % to 100 % of food items belonged to this group. There is a clear relationship between fish species preyed upon and the size of water bodies. In seas, the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> may cover long distances up to several kilometres to hunt on benthic (Neogobius sp., Parablennius sp., Ponticola sp.) or open water marine (Clupeonella sp., Symphodus sp.,) fish species as it has been observed in the Caspian Sea (Tuniyev et al. [2011]). In large lakes such as Lake Baćina (Hutinec and Mebert [2011]), Lake Balaton (own unpublished data), Lake Prespa (Sterijovski et al. [2011]), Lake Sinoe (Sloboda et al. [2010]) and Lake Geneva (Metzger et al. [2011]), the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> mostly eats benthic fish (Neogobius sp., Cottus gobio) and/or fish species hidden in aquatic vegetation stands (Cyprinidae sp., and e.g. Blennius fluviatilis, Lepomis gibbosus, Perca fluviatilis). In large rivers, densely vegetated water courses and lakes, they hunt fish (mainly Cyprinidae sp.), amphibian larvae and adults (mainly Pelophylax and Rana sp.) near the bank (Acipinar et al. [2006]; Filippi et al. [1996]; Gaebele et al. [2013]; Luiselli et al. [2007]; Vlček et al. [2010]; Weiperth et al. [2014]; Zimmerman and Fachbach [1996]). In fishponds, the main prey species of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> were juvenile fish from aquaculture and allochthonous fish species (Acipinar et al. [2006]) with occasional predation on amphibians (tadpoles and froglets) such as in Jordanian fish ponds (Amr and Disi [1998]) (Additional file 1). With decreasing waterbody size, the feeding spectrum of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> considerably changes to include terrestrial species besides fish and amphibians common in the given area (Amr and Disi [1998], [2011]; Bakiev et al. [2011]; Göçmen et al. [2011]; Luiselli et al. [2007]; Žagar et al. [2011]) (Additional file 1). Populations in high mountains (over 1, 000  m a.s.l.) may specialise on eating larval and adult amphibians (Cafuta and Krofel 2007; Frotzler et al. [2011]; Tuniyev et al. [2011]; Žagar et al. [2011]) as predominant food. It can also be considerable in arid regions, where the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> often lives along temporary water bodies or fish ponds, where {{only a limited number of}} fish species are present (Amr and Disi [2011]; Amr et al. [2011]; Göçmen et al. [2011]; Laňka [1978]; Gruschwitz et al. [1999]; Shehab et al. [2011]). As young fish produced in fish farms can become an important element in the diet of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> besides natural conditions, human activity may also influence the spread and survival of this snake (Acipinar et al. [2006]; Göçmen et al. [2011]).|$|E
30|$|The <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> {{has a large}} {{distribution}} and it occurs in different habitats, which would imply the species can adapt well to local conditions presumably by adopting a wide feeding spectrum. However, it is {{generally considered to be}} a diurnal piscivorous snake (Gasc et al. [1997]) despite information that shows the species also eats non-fish prey items such as amphibians and reptiles (see e.g. Beshkov and Dushkov [1981]). A number of publications contain information on the food of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake,</b> with several focusing on local areas (e.g. Luiselli et al. [2007] on Central Italy), but no global overview of the species' dietary preferences has been published.|$|E
30|$|The <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> (Natrix tessellata Laurenti, 1768) is a Eurasian snake species {{ranging from}} Germany and Switzerland to China, Pakistan and Egypt (Gasc et al. [1997]; Ibrahim [2012]; Mebert et al. [2013]) and is well {{adapted to the}} aquatic {{environment}} (Lahav and Dmi'el [1996]; Nekrasova et al. [2013]). It occurs in aquatic or marshy habitats, including brackish water (Gruschwitz et al. [1999]; Khonjakina [1969]; Tuniyev et al. [2011]) occasionally even inhabiting cities such as Rome and Prague (Velenský et al. [2011]; Vignoli et al. [2009]). The distribution area of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> is partly overlapped with two other aquatic Natrix species. The grass snake (Natrix natrix) lives in Eurasian habitats, often inhabiting similar areas with the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> (Gasc et al. [1997]) while the viperine snake (Natrix maura) has sympatric populations in Switzerland and Italy with the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> (Metzger et al. [2011]; Scali [2011]). It is listed in Annex II of the Bern Convention ([1999]) and it also appears in Annex IV of the Habitat Directive of the European Union ([1992]) but due to its wide distribution and presumably large population size, it is categorised as least concern by IUCN ([2012]). However, it {{is considered to be}} threatened in a number of western and central European states, with low genetic variation in some populations (Gautschi et al. [2002]; Guicking et al. [2004]) and its world population was also assessed as declining (IUCN [2012]). As such, conservation measures should still be undertaken for this species as habitat destruction, pollution, road traffic, collection and persecution are listed as possible threats.|$|E
40|$|The <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> Natrix tessellata (Laurenti, 1768) {{is one of}} {{the common}} snake species in the Southern Palaearctic and North Africa. In the Central and Southern Dnieper River basin the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> {{is one of the}} most {{numerous}} and characteristic species. Relative isolation and the varying influence of environmental factors are known to be a motive force behind epigenetic divergence between populations. In populations of N. tessellata this divergence can be manifest in the form of morphometric and phenetic peculiarities. Research into these parameters of  <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> populations in terms of anthropogenic influence on habitats along a latitude gradient is essential. In the Central and Southern parts of the Dnieper River basin such studies are of great importance for the monitoring of populations and for further indicative purposes. The aim of our study is to characterize the morphometric features of N. tessellata in this area and to determine the variability of these parameters in the snake populations under varying intensities of anthropogenic influence. The snakes were collected in 2013 – 2016 from the territory adjacent to the Prydniprovska Thermal Power Plant, from the Maiorova gully (Maiorka village, Dnipropetrovsk region) and the National Nature Park “Velykyi Lug” (Zaporizhia region). The following morphometric parameters were recorded: snout-vent length (SVL), tail length (TL), the number of ventral scales (V), and the number of subcaudal scales (SBC), the number of scale rows at mid-body (MBS), the number of supralabial scales (SLS), the number of temporal scales (TS), and the number of postocular scales (POS). All the tested parameters generally correspond to the limits known for this species from the literature. Nevertheless, some geographic peculiarities in variability of the tail length and number of subcaudal scales were identified. According to data from the literature, the southern populations of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> are distinguished by an increase in the number of subcaudal scales. The studied <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> populations were characterized by some sexual dimorphism in the snout-vent length, tail length and the number of subcaudal scales. A higher percentage of bilateral asymmetry in snakes from the population close to the Prydniprovska TPP was found. Such changes are usually considered to be an indicator of a certain destabilization of the embryogenesis...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the feeding {{spectrum}} of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> over its global distribution by comparing the species' prey items in different countries and offer reasons for potential differences in prey item preference based on geography and habitat conditions.|$|E
30|$|Information was {{gathered}} from literature sources and personal {{observations on the}} diet of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> from its whole range, i.e. from Switzerland {{in the west to}} Pakistan and China in the east, and from Germany in the north to Iran in the south. Information from papers only mentioning large, collective groups such as ‘insects’, ‘fish’ or ‘frogs’ as food items without giving species (or genus) level information is discussed in the article (e.g. Brecko et al. [2011]) but {{was not included in the}} database, even if their addition would have added new items to the list such as mice (Wang et al. [1987]) or shrews (Radovanović [1951]). No time limit was applied; reports available from the first half of the twentieth century were also used. Besides published records and our observations, citizen science data were also collected by approaching internet databases for photographic evidence of <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> predation on a given taxa (e.g. [URL] [URL] The distribution of different prey classes among different habitats was calculated and information on their frequency in the diet of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> was also summarised. Species with no indication of frequency in the diet were listed under ‘no quantitative data’, whereas the following frequencies were listed when quantitative data was available: under 5 %[*]=[*]rare; 5 % to 20 %[*]=[*]frequent; and > 20 %[*]=[*]common. Studies including quantitative data were also used for comparison after the relative abundance of prey taxa were calculated. Association analysis with the presence-absence data of the prey taxa of the <b>dice</b> <b>snake</b> were used in non-metric cluster analysis (Goodall [1953]; Podani [1997], [2001]; Williams and Lambert [1960]) to elucidate geographical differences among 18 countries, where appropriate information could be collected. Statistical analysis was made using SYN-TAX 2000 (Podani [2001]). Results were plotted by MS Office 2010 and SYN-TAX 2000 (Podani [2001]).|$|E
