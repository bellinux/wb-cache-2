5000|$|The {{screenplay}} for the 1972 version of The Getaway {{was written by}} Walter Hill. In 1990, Hill's wife, Hildy Gottlieb, had left her job as an agent to head up Alec Baldwin's production company, Meadowbrook Productions. (She later produced his film Heaven's Prisoners.) Hill and Baldwin were friendly - at one stage {{they were going to}} make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, [...] "they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to <b>go</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Encouraged by the {{publication}} of experimental series such as Camelot 3000 and the Epic Comics lineup, in 1983 DeMatteis again pursued publication for Moonshadow. While talking with his friend Karen Berger, he mentioned his idea for the series, and an enthusiastic Berger offered to have DC Comics publish it. Having already been considering going over to DC, DeMatteis was initially inclined to accept. However, when he discussed the upcoming expiration of his contract with Marvel with Shooter, Shooter offered to publish both Moonshadow and the Greenberg the Vampire graphic novel, another DeMatteis pet project that he had previously rejected. DeMatties recalled, [...] Jim said, [...] "Okay. You've been here long enough. You've paid your dues. You deserve {{to get a chance}} to do some things that you want to do." [...] And I respect him for letting me do it. I wasn't one of Marvel's top-selling writers. Jim could easily have said: [...] "Fine. <b>Go</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for DC." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Clarke {{published}} his novel 2010: Odyssey Two in 1982, he telephoned Stanley Kubrick, and jokingly said, [...] "Your {{job is to}} stop anybody from making it a movie so I won't be bothered." [...] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer subsequently worked out a contract {{to make a film}} adaptation, but Kubrick had no interest in directing it. However, Peter Hyams was interested and contacted both Clarke and Kubrick for their blessings: I had a long conversation with Stanley and told him what was going on. If it met with his approval, I would do the film; and if it didn't, I wouldn't. I certainly would not have thought of doing the film if I had not gotten the blessing of Kubrick.

5000|$|Gordon-Levitt, who had {{no formal}} high-wire experience, trained {{directly}} with Petit. By {{the end of the}} eighth day, he was able to walk on the wire by himself, and continued to practice while shooting. Along with a stunt double, the actor shot the climactic wire-walking scenes on a soundstage; it had reconstructions of the top two stories of the tower and a wire approximately twelve feet off the ground, which was connected out across a green abyss and was anchored on a pole. To learn more about what it was like, Gordon-Levitt also walked the distance between the World Trade Center memorial's two pools, which are located where the Twin Towers stood before the September 11 attacks. He visited the original observatory once before, in 2001, during his first summer in New York City. [...] "It was touristy but I wanted to <b>go</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I remember it distinctly. It felt more like being in the sky than being on a tall building." [...] Aside from wire-walking, Gordon-Levitt also learned to speak French fluently, perfecting a Parisian accent aided by Le Bon and other French actors on set.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2013 interview, on the Murder Master Music Show, Heller {{said that}} Eazy-E had planned on killing Suge Knight, but Heller {{was able to}} talk Eazy out of it. Heller {{said he was in}} his office when Eazy-E told him, “You know this guy Suge Knight? Well, I’m gonna kill him… This guy’s gonna be a problem, and I’m gonna kill him.” Heller said that he told Eazy it didn't make sense to kill Knight and it wouldn't be worth the risk, citing that Ruthless Records was the most {{successful}} startup record company ever, making $10 million a month with only 6 employees and, as Heller put it, [...] "not even having a typewriter in their office." [...] Heller said that, given everything that had transpired afterward, he regrets talking Eazy out of it. [...] "You know something? I should have let him kill him. I would have done the world a favor. He would have done it for sure by himself. He always rolled by himself and he was fearless. I think {{that he was going to}} <b>go</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I took him seriously. He was right and I was wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{originated}} from Joshua Cain, {{who brought the}} song to the band late in the recording process, but struggled to expand the idea into what he wanted. The song came together gradually, much like the recording process for Go. The band's bass guitarist, Matthew Taylor, regarding the recording process, says that [...] "there's always a certain point for me, and I think Josh too, during recording, we start to sift through every idea we have." [...] Taylor sent Cain a mock keyboard part he had written for [...] "True Romance", and both decided {{at the last minute}} that the track should be recorded and considered for the album. However, drums for the entire album had already been recorded and the group's drummer, Tony Thaxton, was to be leaving town on a plane the very next day. That next morning, two hours before Thaxton's flight, he came into the studio and tracked drums for [...] "True Romance". Jesse Johnson, the group's keyboard player, acknowledges the absurdity of the task they were putting before Thaxton by saying, [...] "You gotta go play another song, that you haven't really heard, and don't know how it goes, and haven't written a part, but <b>go</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> And you have an hour".|$|E
5000|$|The title-track is an uptempo {{country rock}} song mainly driven by {{electric}} guitar and fiddle. In it, Paisley asks his lover {{to join him}} for a high-speed ride through the country in his '69 Camaro. The song [...] "Shattered Glass" [...] {{has been called a}} feminist ode to female empowerment. When asked about the song, Paisley said [...] "there’s two people I really wrote that for. One of them is my wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley, ... and the other one is our daughter who does not exist...what song would I write for my daughter? It would be this exact song". He added that [...] "the song {{is supposed to be a}} pep talk to wife and any woman who has dreams she wants to achieve, and thinks to herself [...] "this might not be something a woman like me can do." [...] Not true. <b>Go</b> <b>do</b> <b>it!</b> It’s meant to be a total vote of confidence and love song in that sense. It’s basically 'I believe in you!'". The song was highly praised by critics. [...] "Limes" [...] is an upbeat song about taking what life gives you and making the best of it. [...] "You Shouldn't Have To" [...] is introduced by a bluesy electric guitar solo and in the song, the narrator describes some things a girl could do alone, but she [...] "shouldn't have to." ...|$|E
