40|$|Graduation date: 1967 A {{report in}} the {{literature}} suggesting {{that the use of}} cottage cheese dressing cultured with S. diacetilactis would afford enhanced flavor and shelf life in the finished product prompted this study to examine reasons for its effectiveness. The method used involved addition of a culture of S. diacetilactis 18 - 16 to 12 percent cream at the rate of one percent with incubation at 21 ° C. for six hours; this dressing was then used to cream <b>dry</b> <b>Cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> curd. It was found that the dressing was effective in suppressing the growth of organisms in the Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Alcaligenes, Aerobacter, and Staphylococcus genera when the dressing was used on Cottage cheese curd that had been heavily contaminated with these organisms. The disc assay method was used to determine what effect various culture fractions would have against the growth of these spoilage organisms. The culture fractions tested were: cell suspension of S. diacetilactis (2 x 10 ¹⁰ cells/ml.); sonicated cell suspension (2 x 10 ⁸ viable cells/ml.); broth supernatant of 24 hour culture; broth supernatant of 24 hour culture concentrated ten times by lyophilization; this same concentrate, dialyzed to remove salts and sugars; uninoculated broth, single strength, concentrated, and concentrated-dialyzed; 24 hour milk culture; 24 hour broth culture. Buffered lactic acid at pH 4. 5, 5. 0, 5. 5 or 7. 0 was also tested. In all cases, there was no inhibition from these culture fractions except where there were viable cells of the lactic organisms present. Cross streaking with S. diacetilactis 18 - 16 against the various spoilage organisms also showed inhibition of the bacteria at the point of intersection; not all organisms were inhibited to the same degree. Competitive growth studies were also conducted between S. diacetilactis and S. aureus and between S. diacetilactis and P. fragi in milk and broth. Growth repression of P. fragi ranged from one to ten percent of the control growth in the presence of viable cells of S. diacetilactis; there was no inhibition in the presence of heat-killed cells. Similar results were found with S. aureus grown in the presence of S. diacetilactis. Maintenance of the pH at 7. 0 did not alter the inhibitory effect, suggesting that the lowered pH caused by acid produced by the lactic organisms was not a contributing factor. The minimum growth temperature of S. diacetilactis 18 - 16 was found to be approximately 7. 5 ° C.; the cells were still metabolicly active at this temperature. Inhibition of P. fragi did occur when grown with S. diacetilactis at 7. 5 ° C., suggesting that active metabolism and not cell growth per se was responsible for the inhibitory effect. Experiments were conducted with Cottage cheese curd that had been heavily contaminated with spoilage organisms and creamed with cultured S. diacetilactis dressing or plain cream. Results showed that the cultured dressing was effective in retarding loss of aroma and slimy curd defect when the cheese was held at 7. 5 ° C. for 30 days, or for two weeks at 10 ° C. and even when held at 21 ° C. for as long as six days...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} methods of acidifying skim milk(milk starter, whey base starter and direct acid set) for making <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> were evaluated for {{their effect on}} yield, quality and acidification cost. Cultured <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> was produced with milk starter and pH controlled whey-base starter by the short set method. Five percent milk starter and 2. 4 % whey base starter were approximately equivalent in activity and gave average setting times of 234 to 255 minutes. Direct acid set <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> {{was made by the}} Vitex/American method. The setting time required for direct acid set <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> was 158 minutes. Yields of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> made by direct acid set were significantly higher than with the two cultured methods. Mean yield for direct acid set was 16. 1 %, the milk starter yield was 14. 5 % and the whey base method gave a yield of 14. 8 %. Protein in the milk starter was less efficiently recovered in the <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> curd than the protein in pasteurized milk. The direct acid set method produced <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> curd that was more mealy than the curd produced by cultured methods, but was still equal in over-all quality to curd made by milk starter methods. The <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> produced by the different acidification methods were judged superior to commercially made direct acid and commercial cultured <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> by an panel of trained judges. <b>Cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> made by whey base starter was preferred over all of the other <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese.</b> Acidification costs per kilogram of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> curd were $ 0. 54 for milk starter, $ 0. 019 for whey base starter and $ 0. 114 for direct acid set curd. Overall ingredient cost per 1, 000 Kg of skim milk set were $ 160. 04, $ 154, 43 and $ 170. 17 respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the physicochemical and sensory properties of functional low-fat cheesecake prepared by using full, low and fat-free <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> as a healthier alternative of cream cheese as a control which traditionally used in cheesecake making. The results revealed that moisture content of different prepared <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> samples varied from 78. 38 % to 81. 22 % and fat content from 0. 41 % to 5. 30 %. The protein content in <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> samples ranged from 12. 15 % to 14. 85 % which was, on average, greater than its content in cream cheese. Also, the ash content of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheeses</b> was higher than that of cream cheese. A reduction in fat content was occurred in cheesecakes prepared with full, low and fat free <b>cottage</b> <b>cheeses</b> compared to cream cheesecake; it was approximately 50 %, 71 % and 88 %, respectively. The carbohydrates were also gradually and significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased by substitution with the above respective <b>cottage</b> <b>cheeses,</b> comparing to cream cheesecake. Cheesecakes prepared with free fat and reduced fat <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> had significantly (P< 0. 05) higher protein content (20. 49 % and 17. 0 %, resp.) as well as ash content (8. 94 % and 8. 54 % resp.) than the control cheesecake made from cream cheese, thus promoting the nutritive value. Measurements of tenderness using (penetrometer) indicated that the substitution with full fat <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> (4 % milk fat) was more significantly (P< 0. 05) tender than the other cheesecake samples. Both cheesecakes substituted with free fat and full fat-cottage cheeses were more significantly (P< 0. 05) lighter than the other samples, meanwhile, the color values of yellowness of these two kinds of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> were less significantly (P< 0. 05) lesser. The functional low-fat cheesecakes prepared from <b>cottage</b> <b>cheeses</b> showed good organoleptic properties which accepted by panelists. Since, the manufacture of cheesecakes with the use of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> from milk contained 4 %, 2 % and 0. 1 % milk fat reduced the total calories of the final product by 30, 41. 77 and 48. 57, respectively and also caused a reduction in total cost of the cheesecakes by 40 %. So, it is easy to say that, <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> with 4 % or 2 % milk fat is a healthy and functional choice in manufacture of low-fat cheesecake...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{structural and}} strategic factors affecting price determination in the branded <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> industry. Special {{emphasis is placed}} on the presence and conduct of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> brands marketed by dairy cooperatives. The data examined in this study cover <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> sales in 47 markets for the fourth quarter of 1988. We find evidence supporting the premise that market power is being exercise in the <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> market. One of the strongest influences of the price of <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese</b> is the extent of market penetration of the brand. Brands' prices rise with an increase in the price of private label <b>cottage</b> <b>cheese.</b> We also find strong evidence that cooperatives are not exercising market power. Cooperatives charge a lower price than their IOF competition under the same conditions and, unlike their IOF competition, co-ops do not capitalize on higher share to raise price. Moreover, the presence of cooperatives in a market brings the price of competing brands down. Cooperatives do not differ greatly from IOFs in the use of merchandising tools, using them as much or slightly more in most cases. Agribusiness, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
