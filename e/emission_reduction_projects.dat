50|$|Through the CDM, {{countries}} can meet their domestic emission reduction targets by buying greenhouse gas reduction units from (projects in) non Annex I countries to the Kyoto protocol (mostly developing countries). Non-Annex I countries have no GHG emission restrictions, but have {{financial incentives to}} develop GHG <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> to receive Certified Emission Reductions that can then be sold to Annex I countries, encouraging sustainable development.|$|E

50|$|The Gold Standard is a {{standard}} for creating high-quality <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>projects</b> in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Joint Implementation (JI) and Voluntary Carbon Market. It was designed to ensure that carbon credits are not only real and verifiable but that they make measurable contributions to sustainable development worldwide. Its objective is to add branding, a label to existing and new Carbon Credits generated by projects which can then be bought and traded by countries that have a binding legal commitment according to the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
50|$|The Gold Standard {{is open to}} any non-government, {{community-based}} organization {{especially those}} {{with an interest in}} the promotion of sustainable development or a focus on climate and energy issues. As of March 2009, 60 environmental and development non-profit organizations internationally officially endorse The Gold Standard. These organizations support The Gold Standard as an effective tool for creating high-quality <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> that promote sustainable development and benefit local communities.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011 ESCO and Portland {{neighborhood}} representatives {{signed a}} Good Neighbor Agreement, which includes an implementation schedule for 17 <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> over five years. As of April 2014, 12 of 16 projects are completed, and one ongoing project with no completion date. Several {{of the projects}} are related to improving or adding control devices to capture particulate matter and metal emissions. It also includes projects related to chemical substitution to reduce organic compound emissions, and projects requiring additional or modified procedures or operations to improve emission capture.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the concept}} of ‘joint implementation’ of {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> (also called [...] "carbon offset projects") was launched at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, “the Earth Summit”), the early carbon offset projects of the 1990s suffered {{from a lack of}} specialised services to support them. One service of particular importance is that of independent verification of carbon offsets, as offsets are dependent on proving a shift of behaviour in relation to a baseline (this shift is referred as [...] "additionality", in the sector).|$|E
50|$|With the inking of the Paris Agreement at the COP21 climate conference, South Pole Group has {{announced}} its determination to turn climate change into an enormous opportunity for companies and organisations alike. In addition to <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>project</b> development, wholesale, and retail, the company's {{areas of expertise}} covers the key areas carbon credit solutions, renewable energy, sustainability advisory, and green finance. South Pole Group is at present {{one of the major}} global advisors for climate-related policies, sustainable supply chains, climate smart cities, and climate impact assessment for investments.|$|R
5000|$|Joint {{implementation}} (JI) is one {{of three}} flexibility mechanisms set out in the Kyoto Protocol to help countries with binding greenhouse gas emissions targets (the Annex I countries) meet their obligations. JI is described in Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol. Under Article 6, any Annex I country can invest in an <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>project</b> (referred to as a [...] "Joint Implementation Project") in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically. In this way countries can lower the costs of complying with their Kyoto targets by investing in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an Annex I country where reducing emissions may be cheaper, and then using the resulting <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> Units (ERUs) towards their commitment goal.|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} the first {{commitment}} period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) show that developed countries fulfilled their commitments through varied strategies. However, the Kyoto protocol did not manage to stabilize global GHG concentrations; furthermore its direct impact on domestic <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> is unclear. Nevertheless, the KP has likely {{paved the way for}} a low-carbon transition by establishing international standards on emissions monitoring and on <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>projects.</b> Yet, domestic policies – especially the EU ETS – are the main driver of <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> and the principal catalyzers of private finance flows. A new, more effective, agreement would therefore need to expand its coverage, and take down the specter of “internationally binding” <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> commitments in order to focus on MRV requirements. Similar to Kyoto, a Paris outcome could {{take the form of a}} framework agreement setting up requirements and mechanisms with subsequent implementing agreements expected by 2020...|$|R
5000|$|The CDM {{addresses}} the second objective {{by allowing the}} Annex I countries to meet part of their emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by buying Certified Emission Reduction units from CDM <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> in developing countries (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 14). Both the projects {{and the issue of}} CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these emission reductions are real and [...] "additional." [...] The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).|$|E
5000|$|EcoSecurities {{was founded}} in January 1997 by Moura Costa and {{environmental}} economist Marc Stuart to provide [...] "environmental finance solutions". Twelve months later, in December 1997 the Kyoto Protocol was signed creating binding commitments for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions among industrialised countries. It also created the Flexibility Mechanisms, Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), that enabled the creation and use of carbon credits from greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects.</b> Carbon trading gradually evolved from being a niche environmental activity to becoming a global market that in 2010 mobilised over €120 billion, including trades under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and the UN flexibility mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{receiving}} credit for JI projects is somewhat complex. <b>Emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> are awarded credits called Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), which represents an emission reduction equivalent to one tonne of CO2 equivalent. The ERUs {{come from the}} host country's pool of assigned emissions credits, known as Assigned Amount Units, or AAUs. Each Annex I party has a predetermined amount of AAUs, calculated {{on the basis of}} its 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels. By requiring JI credits to come from a host country's pool of AAUs, the Kyoto Protocol ensures that the total amount of emissions credits among Annex I parties does not change for the duration of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period.|$|E
5000|$|... Projects {{which are}} {{compliant}} {{with the requirements}} of the CDM mechanism generate Certified <b>Emissions</b> <b>Reductions</b> (CERs). - <b>Projects</b> which are compliant {{with the requirements of}} the JI mechanism generate <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> Units (ERUs).|$|R
40|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, {{industrial}} countries accept caps on their emissions of greenhouse gases. They {{are permitted to}} acquire offsetting <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> from developing countries - which do not have emissions limitations - to assist in complying with these caps. Because these <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> are defined against a hypothetical baseline, practical issues arise in ensuring that the reductions are genuine. Forestry-related <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects</b> are often thought to present greater difficulties in measurement and implementation, than energy-related <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>projects.</b> The author discusses how project characteristics affect the process for determining compliance {{with each of the}} criteria for qualifying. Those criteria are: 1) Additionality. Would these <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> not have taken place without the project? 2) Baseline and systems boundaries (leakage). What would business-as-usual emissions have been without the project? And in this comparison, how broad should spatial, and temporal system boundaries be? 3) Measurement (or sequestration). How accurately can we measure actual with-project emissions levels? 4) Duration or permanence. Will the project have an enduring mitigating effect? 5) Local impact. Will the project benefit its neighbors? For all the criteria except permanence, it is difficult to find generic distinctions between land use change and forestry and energy projects, since both categories comprise diverse project types. The important distinctions among projects have to do with such things as: a) The level and distribution of the project's direct financial benefits. b) How much the project is integrated with the larger system. c) The project components'internal homogeneity and geographic dispersion. d) The local replicability of project technologies. Permanence is an issue specific to land use and forestry projects. The author describes various approaches to ensure permanence, or adjust credits for duration: the ton-year approach (focusing on the benefits from deferring climatic damage, and rewarding longer deferral); the combination approach (bundling current land use change and forestry <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> with future reductions in the buyer's allowed amount); a technology-acceleration approach; and an insurance approach.
