40|$|This paper extends {{recent work}} on {{interruption}} insurance for electric power by introducing onsite backup generation capacity as a supplementary form <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>insurance.</b> The basic model <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>insurance</b> {{as a mechanism}} for differential pricing is reviewed, the incentive for providing onsite backup generation capacity is demonstrated and the interaction between onsite backup generation and interruption insurance is analyzed. Two types of onsite backup, customer and utility owned, are discussed. It is shown that individuals' economic incentives to install onsite backup generation dominate the utility's incentive. Hence customer owned onsite backup decisions will pre-empt the utility's plan to mitigate compensation payments by providing onsite backup generation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} short- and long-term effects <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the enterohepatic circulation (EHC) on hepatic cholesterol metabolism and biliary secretion in rats. For this purpose, we employed {{a technique that}} allows reversible <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, during normal feeding conditions, and excludes effects of anaesthesia and surgical trauma. [3 H]Cholesteryl oleate-labelled human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was injected intravenously in rats with (1) chronically (8 days) interrupted EHC, (2) interrupted EHC {{at the time of}} LDL injection and (3) intact EHC. During the first 3 h after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, bile flow decreased to 50 % and biliary bile acid, phospholipid and cholesterol secretion to 5 %, 11 % and 19 % of their initial values respectively. After 8 days of bile diversion, biliary cholesterol output and bile flow were at that same level, but bile acid output was increased 2 - 3 -fold and phospholipid output was about 2 times lower. The total amount of cholesterol in the liver decreased after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, which was mainly due to a decrease in the amount of cholesteryl ester. Plasma disappearance of LDL was not affected by <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC. Biliary secretion of LDL-derived radioactivity occurred 2 - 4 times faster in chronically interrupted rats as compared with the excretion immediately after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC. Radioactivity was mainly in the form of bile acids under both conditions. This study demonstrates the very rapid changes that occur in cholesterol metabolism and biliary lipid composition after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC. These changes {{must be taken into account}} in studies concerning hepatic metabolism of lipoprotein cholesterol and subsequent secretion into bile...|$|R

30|$|Titration of {{continuous}} IV infusion of hypnotics {{is by far}} the most common method used to prevent oversedation in French ICUs. This is in accordance with the 2007 French Consensus conference guidelines, which included a frame for hypnotics and morphinics use based on continuous titration, whereas the use <b>of</b> daily <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> continuous IV infusions of hypnotics was not addressed [4]. Inversely, a recent survey showed that 80 % of U.S. hospitals use daily <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> sedatives in mechanically ventilated patients [14]. Although both continuous titration [2, 11, 12] and daily <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> sedatives [15] have shown a significant beneficial effect on mechanical ventilation duration, they have not been formally compared. However, a recent randomized trial in North America showed that combining daily <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> sedatives and continuous titration did not improve outcomes compared to continuous titration alone but was associated with increased nurse workload [16].|$|R
