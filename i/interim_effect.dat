40|$|This keynote {{presents}} {{a view of}} the current position of textile design {{from the perspective of the}} Textiles Environment Design (TED) research group, now part of the University's Textiles Futures Research Centre. Today’s textile design graduates are entering a professional landscape largely unchanged in structure since the middle of last century. The familiar systems for design creation, presentation and production have continued, although transformed by new technologies at almost every stage. However, in recent years, there has been a huge growth in awareness of the environmental, economic and social implications of production. What, how, where and why things are made is gradually becoming central in the minds of designers, manufacturers and citizens. Practical action that will bring about systemic change or in the <b>interim,</b> <b>effect</b> even ‘marginal gains’, is urgently needed. Therefore designers must devise prototypes, which not only continue to solve problems but confront the issues surrounding the lifecycle of products, new ecological thinking and developments in consumption. Over a period of fifteen years, researchers, practitioners and teachers at Chelsea have collaborated with the aim of developing sustainable textiles. Strategies for identifying innovative ways of designing more sustainable products enable designers to take on a dynamic role, which includes facilitation, activism and social engagement. THE TEN strategies are being used as a kind of infrastructure for us to reflect on the evolution of our research, on its potential impact in industry and on the education of designers. The dominance of consumerism and industrial profit must be challenged by innovation to overcome the ever-increasing ecological imperatives...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} and document the use and efficacy of intensive non-avoidance group treatment for Bulgarian adults who stutter (AWS), to specify that changes are adopted in different speech situations (in the stabilization phase), and to demonstrate that changes are maintained after intensive therapy. METHODS: Participants were AWS (n= 15, 12 males) with an average age of 25. 2 years) Bulgarian native-speakers. Twelve participants were University students and three were clients with tertiary education in different areas. All participants were enrolled in First (overall effect) and Second (<b>interim</b> <b>effect)</b> Stages of Intensive Non-Avoidance Treatment for Stuttering. Van Riper's stuttering modification therapy approach was employed; the latter considers a non-avoidance treatment for stuttering. The treatment was conducted in participants' native Bulgarian language. RESULTS: AWS, as a group (n= 15), significantly decreased the number of stuttered utterances after intensive treatment; findings were consistent for participants with moderate as well as severe stuttering. Likewise, there was a significant decrease in duration (in seconds) of disfluencies after treatment; findings were consistent for participants with moderate as well as severe stuttering. Eighty percent of AWS used cancellation immediately and six months after treatment, 65 % mastered preparatory sets immediately and six months after treatment, 35 % exhibited pull-outs immediately after treatment and 55 %, six months post-treatment. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings were taken to suggest that intensive non-avoidance treatment for stuttering can be successfully employed with Bulgarian adults who stutter. Special focus was on the positive fluency changes that occurred during the course of therapy regarding the duration of disfluencies in seconds, and index of disfluencies...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{association}} {{studies have}} become {{the most widely used}} gene mapping tool for the identification of disease susceptibility loci of complex common traits or diseases. In order to obtain sufficient power at a certain significance level (type I error risk), these analyses require a complete pre-specification {{of the total number of}} individuals to be sampled and genotyped. However, in most of these studies little information about the genetic effect size is available beforehand and thus it is difficult to calculate a reasonable sample size. By addressing these problems, this thesis aims at introducing, extending, and evaluating statistical methodology on design adaptations for genetic association studies. In particular, it is shown how a confirmatory candidate gene association study can be planned and analyzed given the mentioned uncertainties. For this purpose, an adaptive group sequential procedure is developed. If no rejection of the null hypothesis is possible at the interim analysis, the design of the subsequent study part can be modified depending on interim data. As an example, sample size reassessment may be done using <b>interim</b> <b>effect</b> size estimates developed by the author of this thesis, as well. Finally, a new flexible two-stage design for genomewide association studies is presented. While providing strong control of the genomewide, family-wise type I error rate, the new design might also be more cost-efficient due to greater flexibility in comparison to all previously suggested designs. Examples of which are the possibility to base marker selection upon biological criteria instead of statistical criteria or the option to modify the sample size at any time during the course of the project. Both the candidate and the genomewide association designs are evaluated using simulated and real data sets. Finally, prospects and limits of design adaptation methods and estimators of genetic effects in genetic association studies of complex traits are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} {{decentralized}} farm biogas plants has increased significantly in the EU. This development leads not only to an increasing amount of biogas produced, but also to a higher amount of digestate obtained. One of the most attractive options to manage the digestate is to apply it as biofertiliser to the soil, because this gives the opportunity of recovering the nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, and of attenuating the loss of organic matter suffered by soils under agricultural exploitation. Studies have claimed that digestates can present a residual biodegradability, and contain complex organic elements, salts or pathogenic bacteria that can damage terrestrial organisms. However few ecotoxicological studies have been performed to evaluate the ecological impact of digestate application on soil. In this study, the use of digestate as biofertiliser in agriculture was assessed by a battery of ecotoxicological tests considering the potential pollutants present in the digestate as a whole by using the "matrix-based" approach (also known as "whole effluent toxicity" for eluates or wastewater effluents). The direct and indirect tests included plant bioassays with Lepidium sativum, earthworm bioassays with Eisenia fetida, aquatic organisms (Artemia sp. and Daphnia magna) and luminescent bacteria bioassays (Vibrio fischeri). Direct tests occurred {{to be more sensitive}} than indirect tests. The earthworm bioassays did not show serious negative effects for concentrations up to 15 % (dry weight/dry weight percent, w/w dm) and the plant bioassays showed no negative effect, but rather a positive one for concentrations lower than 20 % (w/w dm), which encourages the use of digestate as a biofertiliser in agriculture provided that proper concentrations are used. The indirect tests, on the eluate, with the using aquatic organisms and luminescent bacteria showed an LC 50 value of 13. 61 % volume/volume percent, v/v) for D. magna and no toxicity for Artemia sp. and V. fischeri. The ecotoxicological parameters obtained from the experimental activity have been analyzed so that they could serve in both ecological risk assessment (ERA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the risks and impacts of using digestate as a biofertiliser in agriculture. An <b>interim</b> <b>effect</b> factor of 1. 17 E- 3 m(3) /kg-in-soil is advocated and can be used in life cycle impact assessment modelling of terrestrial ecotoxicity. A predicted non effect concentration for soil organisms was defined at 341 mg-digestate/kg-soil and can be used for the dose-response assessment step in ERA. Although these values are recommended for use in ERA and LCA applications, it should be stressed that they underlie important uncertainties, which should be reduced by increasing the number of toxicological tests, in particular of chronic studies conducted at different trophic levels...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} advance {{our understanding of}} the roles that institutions play in economic development. How do institutions evolve? What mechanisms are responsible for their persistence? What effects do they have on economic development? I address these questions using historical and contemporary data from Eastern Europe and Russia. This area is relatively understudied by development economists. It also has a very interesting history. For one thing, for several centuries it was divided between different empires. For another, it experienced wars and socialism in the 20 th century. I use some of these exogenous shocks as quasi-natural social experiments to study the institutional transformations and its effects on economic development both in the short and long run. This first chapter explores whether economic, social, and political institutions vary in their resistance to policies designed to remove them. The empirical context for the analysis is Romania from 1690 to the 2000 s. Romania represents an excellent laboratory for studying the persistence of different types of historical institutional legacies. In the 18 th and 19 th centuries, Romania was split between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires, where political and economic institutions differed. The Habsburgs imposed less extractive institutions relative to the Ottomans: stronger rule of law, a more stable and predictable state, a more developed civil society, and less corruption. In the 20 th century, the Romanian Communist regime tried deliberately to homogenize the country along all relevant dimensions. It was only partially successful. Using a regression discontinuity design, I document the persistence of economic outcomes, social capital, and political attitudes. First, I document remarkable convergence in urbanization, education, unemployment, and income between the two former empires. Second, regarding social capital, no significant differences in organizational membership, trust in bureaucracy, and corruption persist today. Finally, even though the Communists tried to change all political attitudes, significant discontinuities exist in current voting behavior at the former Habsburg-Ottoman border. Using data from the parliamentary elections of 1996 - 2008, I find that former Habsburg rule decreases by around 6 percentage points the vote share of the major post-Communist left party and increases by around 2 and 5 percentage points the vote shares of the main anti-Communist and liberal parties, respectively. The second chapter investigates the effects of Stalin’s mass deportations on distrust in central authority. Four deported ethnic groups were not rehabilitated after Stalin’s death; they remained in permanent exile until the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This allows one to distinguish between the effects of the groups that returned to their homelands and those of the groups that were not allowed to return. Using regional data from the 1991 referendum {{on the future of the}} Soviet Union, I find that deportations have a negative <b>interim</b> <b>effect</b> on trust in central authority in both the regions of destination and those of origin. The effect is stronger for ethnic groups that remained in permanent exile in the destination regions. Using data from the Life in Transition Survey, the chapter also documents a long-term effect of deportations in the destination regions. The third chapter studies the short-term effect of Russian colonization of Central Asia on economic development. I use data on the regions of origin of Russian settlers and push factors to construct an instrument for Russian migration to Central Asia. This instrument allows me to interpret the outcomes causally. The main finding is that the massive influx of Russians into the region during the 1897 - 1926 period had a significant positive effect on indigenous literacy. The effect is stronger for men and in rural areas. Evidently, interactions between natives and Russians through the paid labor market was an important mechanism of human capital transmission in the context of colonization. The findings of these chapters provide additional evidence that history and institutions do matter for economic development. Moreover, the dissertation also illuminates the relative persistence of institutions. In particular, political and social capital legacies of institutions might outlast economic legacies. I find that most economic differences between the former empires in Romania have disappeared. By the same token, there are significant discontinuities in political outcomes. People in former Habsburg Romania provide greater support for liberalization, privatization, and market economy, whereas voters in Ottoman Romania vote more for redistribution and government control over the economy. In the former Soviet Union, Stalin’s deportations during World War II have a long-term negative effect on social capital. Today’s residents of the destination regions of deportations show significantly lower levels of trust in central authority. This is despite the fact that the Communist regime tried to eliminate any source of opposition and used propaganda to homogenize people’s political and social attitudes towards the authorities. In Central Asia, the influx of Russian settlers had a positive short-term effect on human capital of indigenous population by the 1920 s, which also might have persisted over time. From a development perspective, these findings stress the importance of institutions for future paths of development. Even if past institutional differences are not apparent for a certain period of time, as was the case with the former Communist countries, they can polarize society later on, hampering economic development in the long run. Different institutions in the past, which do not exist anymore, can thus contribute to current political instability and animosity. Dissertatio...|$|E

Short-term 4, 500 μg/m 3 2, 500 ppbv Long-term 450 μg/m 3 250 ppbv Background In 1993, the short-term ESL for nitrous oxide was set at 900 μg/m 3 (500 ppbv), and the long-term ESL was set at 90 μg/m 3 (50 ppbv). As was typical for that time, the short- and long-term ESLs were calculated as 1 percent and 0. 1 percent, respectively, of an appropriate occupational exposure limit. The basis for this ESL was the ACGIH TLV-TWA 1 of 50 ppm. Supporting this TLV was a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in a male human exposure study (Venables et al. 1983). In this study, 50 ppm was identified as an unbounded NOAEL for decrements in neurobehavioral performance on four psychomotor tests.

30|$|The methods {{differed}} on {{the probability}} of early stopping under the alternative hypothesis with method 2 having the lowest probability. This is because this approach includes data from all subjects that have been randomized {{by the time of}} the interim analysis in the denominator of the estimation of the event proportion even though a subgroup of these patients would not have had any assessment of the outcome since they would not have reached their first time point for outcome assessment. The consequence is the dilution of the <b>interim</b> treatment <b>effect</b> leading to lower interim power. Method 3 also uses all available data from randomized subjects at the time of the interim analysis. However, it employs a conditional probability approach which differentiates between those subjects who have not yet had an assessment visit (i.e. censored) and who are at risk at each assessment visit, thus yielding a greater probability of early stopping. Similarly, since method 1 uses only a subset of randomized subjects at the time of the interim analysis, the estimated <b>interim</b> treatment <b>effect</b> is less diluted and, therefore, has greater probability for early stopping than method 2. Conversely, since it uses a smaller number of subjects compared with method 3, the probability for early stopping is slightly lower than method 3 in trials where the standard group event proportion is 0.5, because the variability is greater for proportions closer to 0.5. Furthermore, we observed that the probabilities for early stopping are greater using the O’Brien-Fleming boundary compared with the Haybittle-Peto boundary since it is less conservative.|$|R

Method: Eighty-seven clinically stable participants with schizophrenia {{were randomly assigned to}} either targeted auditory training (AT, N= 46) or a computer games control condition (CG, N= 41). Participants were assessed on neurocognition, symptoms and functional outcome at baseline and after 50 hours of intervention delivered over 10 weeks. Serum BDNF was assessed at baseline, at 2 weeks, and at 10 weeks. Results: After the intervention, AT participants showed significant gains in global cognition, speed of processing, verbal learning, and verbal memory, relative to CG participants, with no changes in symptoms or functioning. At baseline, schizophrenia participants had significantly lower-than-normal serum BDNF. AT participants showed a significant increase in serum BDNF compared to CG participants, and “normalized” levels by post training. Conclusions: Participants with chronic schizophrenia made significant cognitive gains after 50 hours of intensive computerized training delivered as a stand-alone treatment, but no improvement in symptoms or functioning. Serum BDNF levels were significantly increased, and may serve as a peripheral biomarker for the effects of training.

Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanism so as the postulate the best rehabilitation for this population. Reduced subacromial space (extrinsic factor) and vascularity increase (intrinsic factor) were the common proposed factors for the cause of pain in SAPS. This project consisted of 5 inter-related studies. The first study (Chapter 2) aimed at assessing the association between subacromial space and intensity of pain, Study 2 (Chapter 3) was to detect presence and intensity of vascularity in supraspinatus tendon; and to evaluate relationships between tendon vascularity and resting subacromial space in overhead athletes with SAPS. In Studies 3 to 5, the effects of conventional exercise, Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy and Bodyblade® training on pain reduction and functional improvement (using Disability Arm Shoulder Hand (DASH) Questionnaire) were compared. The inter-relationship among changes on pain intensity, subacromial space and tendon vascularity were then assessed at post-(Chapter 4), 3 -month post-(Chapter 5) and 1 year post-intervention (Chapter 6). Study 1 confirmed the relationship between subacromial space and provoked pain in overhead athletes with SAPS. Greater intensity of provoked pain was associated with reduced subacromial space in male but widened subacromial space in female. In study 2, majority (> 80 %) of the overhead athletes with SAPS had mild to severe pathological changes in the supraspinatus tendon. More than 80 % of the tendinopathic tendon had vascularization. Hypervascularity was associated with reduced subacromial space in male athletes. Findings from Studies 1 and 2 highlighted pain, subacromial space and vascularity in tendon were highly interrelated. Findings from Study 3 indicated that immediately after 8 -weeks of conventional exercise or Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy, the intensity of pain was reduced by a clinically significant level in the conventional exercise and Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy groups, but not Bodyblade{ 170 } group, and yet the improvement in the DASH scores exceeded minimal clinically detectable difference in conventional exercise and Bodyblade{ 170 } groups but not Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy group. Spearman correlation tests indicated that in male athletes receiving either conventional exercise or Bodyblade® training, percentage increase in subacromial space was correlated with percentage reduction in vascular index (rho=- 0. 63; p= 0. 037). The finding suggested that conventional exercise showed satisfactory clinical improvement in both pain and functional level. Exercise-induced modulation of extrinsic (widening of subacromial space) and intrinsic (decrease in vascularity) factors of SAPS are related. Study 4 evaluated the <b>interim</b> <b>effects</b> of the interventions found in Study 3. The decrease in DASH score was significantly higher in the conventional exercise group (52. 4 ± 28. 4 %) when compared with Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (36. 6 ± 34. 4 %; p= 0. 013) and Bodyblade® groups (23. 8 ± 46. 8 %; p= 0. 037). Number of participants being successfully treated was significantly higher in the conventional exercise group (70 %) when compared with Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (20 %; p= 0. 012). In the male participants, the percentage of reduction in pain was related to the percentage increase in subacromial space in the exercise group (conventional exercise and Bodyblade®) (rho= 0. 74; p= 0. 006) but to the percentage decrease in vascularity index in the Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy group (rho=- 1. 00; p= 0. 000). The findings suggested exercise and Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy modulate pain by different mechanism, and combined therapy may further benefit the athletes. The result of Study 5 showed the conventional exercise group had significantly greater reduction in DASH score (63. 7 ± 26. 1 %) when compared with Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (37. 5 ± 43. 7 %; p= 0. 019) and Bodyblade® training group (35. 2 ± 45. 9 %; p= 0. 048). The study also showed highest successful rate in the conventional exercise group (60 %) when compared with the extracorporeal shockwave therapy (33. 3 %) and Bodyblade® training (38. 5 %) group, despite the differences being statistically insignificant. Being male and in the conventional exercise group, the percentage improvement in DASH was correlated with Body Mass Index (rho=- 0. 94; p= 0. 005) and pre-intervention vascularity (rho= 0. 94; p= 0. 005). No subjects with moderate to severe supraspinatus tendon could be successfully treated with conventional intervention. These information help us to better screen overhead athletes with SAPS at the start of the conservative intervention. Department of Rehabilitation SciencesPh.

40|$|We {{investigate}} variability {{and trends}} of the Southern Hemisphere quasi-stationary planetary waves over 1979 – 2013 using the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) <b>Interim</b> reanalyses. The <b>effects</b> of tropical and extra-tropical forcing factors on the phase and amplitude of the planetary waves are identified. The amplitudes of wave numbers 1 – 3 exhibit an annual cycle {{with a minimum}} in summer and maximum over the extended austral winter period. The phase of wave number 1 has a semi-annual cycle, moving east in austral spring/autumn and west in summer/winter {{as a result of}} differences in the phase of the semi-annual oscillation across the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The phase of wave number 3 has an annual cycle, being more eastward (westward) in summer (winter). Year-to-year variability of the amplitude of wave number 1 is found to be strongly associated with the Amundsen Sea Low, which in turn is known to be strongly influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with the consequence that the amplitude of wave number 1 is larger during the El Niño phase of the cycle. Regarding trends for the year as a whole, the amplitude of wave number 1 has decreased since 1979 (p < 0. 1), while the amplitudes of wave numbers 2 and 3 have increased. These changes are consistent with the warming trends in sea surface temperatures across much of the tropical oceans. However, the factors associated with longer-term trends are less clear than for year-to-year variability...|$|R
40|$|A {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} comparing an experimental new treatment {{to a standard}} therapy for a life-threatening medical condition should be stopped early on ethical grounds, in either of the following scenarios: (1) it has become overwhelmingly clear that the new treatment {{is better than the}} standard; (2) it has become overwhelmingly clear that the trial is not going to show that the new treatment is any better than the standard. The trial is continued in the third scenario: (3) there is a reasonable chance that the new treatment will finally turn out to be better than the standard, but we aren't sure yet. However, the (blinded) data monitoring committee in the "PROPATRIA" trial of an experimental probiotica treatment for patients with acute pancreatitis allowed the trial to continue at the half way <b>interim</b> analysis, in <b>effect</b> because there was still a good chance of proving that the probiotica treatment was very harmful to their patients. The committee did not know whether treatment A was the probiotica treatment or the placebo. In itself this should not have caused a problem, since it could easily have determined the appropriate decision under both scenarios. Were the decisions in the two scenarios different, then the data would have to be de-blinded, {{in order to determine the}} appropriate decision. The committee mis-read the output of SPSS, which reports the smaller of two one-sided p-values, without informing the user what it is doing. It seems that about 5 lives were sacrificed to the chance of getting a significant result that the probiotica treatment was bad for the patients in the trial...|$|R
40|$|To resolve {{conflicts}} {{the alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) has derived several procedures. In {{last few decades}} the ADR process becomes more important that it becomes more prevalent in international and domestic commercial contracts. The basic {{reason for this is}} the high cost of litigation, thus the parties are considering alternative methods to resolve disputes with the process which is cheaper and quicker. By using ADR the working relationship between parties will not lead to a break down. Therefore this report is based on a detailed examination of arbitration in International Commercial scenario. The report is given to define the effectiveness of the International Commercial Arbitration, the international system covering states and corporate with advantages and disadvantages of the international arbitration. The commentary also discusses the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) alternative dispute resolution rules and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) rules. Furthermore, “ADR techniques fall into two discrete types. Those which seek to persuade the parties to settle and those that provide a decision. Where a decision is given then that decision may be binding on the parties, it may have an <b>interim</b> binding <b>effect</b> or may simply be a recommendation that the parties can accept or ignore”. 1 Arbitration is one of the techniques of ADR and it is very important in the international commercial sector. However to define arbitration there is no universal definition of arbitration. In different legal rules arbitration has been used differently. It has been defined in different ways by the different commentators but there are core principles that can be found in all definition. The arbitration is a private system of adjudication. The arbitration method has been used differently in different countries. Though there are distinctions between domestic and international arbitration but there are also similarities found in this method. We could find factors which could affect the international arbitration but not the domestic arbitration. The laws are likely to be different in international and domestic law e. g. international arbitration relies upon conventions for the enforcement of arbitral award. Moreover the similarities are that the parties to a dispute have option to go for mediation before choosing arbitration. Basically the arbitration agreement provides authority to the arbitral tribunal to hear and determine the dispute. It is choice of the parties to choose between the arbitration and mediation. The selection regarding arbitral tribunal could be found in arbitration agreement. The main purpose of arbitral process is to resolve disputes or differences between parties before the relationship gets end up. It is a judicial process but not as a mirror judicial proceedings by which the procedure is {{to meet the demands of}} the case. Thereafter the arbitral tribunal makes or delivers an award to settle dispute between the parties and the award is final and binding as to the matter which it decides. 2 The international institutions are very important regarding the proceedings of the arbitration and the treaties or conventions plays role for the enforcement and recognition of the arbitral award. to discuss the structure of the international commercial arbitration could lead to understand the effectiveness of the informal system as well as the critical view is a key factor to define whether the future of the system is secure and does it provide sufficient security to the parties around the world...|$|R
