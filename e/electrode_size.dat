40|$|Electrode {{design is}} {{investigated}} for electrical capacitance tomography on a 1 mm-thick 3 D planar domain. Arrays of square electrodes {{are located on}} both sides of the domain, which is filled with dielectric material. Anomalies of interest are voids in the material with low dielectric constant. Simulated tomography is conducted with various electrode patterns over a range of <b>electrode</b> <b>sizes</b> in order to compare performance. The high-aspect-ratio domain requires a large finite element mesh for simulating electric fields and for defining spatial sensitivity responses of electrode pairs. Compared to the canonical 2 D pipe cross-section problem, this high-aspect-ratio system requires solving the reconstruction problem on a much larger mesh and is more severely underdetermined. An efficient methodology for characterizing the sensitivity responses of various electrode pairs is developed. An image reconstruction algorithm creates binary images by sequentially composing a list of occupied cells, conditioned with a cell-to-cell energy formulation. A parametric study of four candidate electrode patterns is conducted using <b>electrode</b> <b>sizes</b> between 0. 8 mm and 1. 6 mm, in which each potential design is used to perform tomographic reconstruction of 100 images. A new image-error metric is proposed, which is used to evaluate each electrode design.

50|$|There {{have been}} two {{different}} types of stimulators: electrotactile or vibrotactile. Electrotactile stimulators use direct electrical stimulation of the nerve ending in the skin to initiate the action potentials; the sensation triggered, burn, itch, pain, pressure etc. depends on the stimulating voltage. Vibrotactile stimulators use pressure and the properties of the mechanoreceptors of the skin to initiate action potentials. There are advantages and disadvantages for both these stimulation systems. With the electrotactile stimulating systems a lot of factors affect the sensation triggered: stimulating voltage, current, waveform, <b>electrode</b> <b>size,</b> material, contact force, skin location, thickness and hydration. Electrotactile stimulation may involve the direct stimulation of the nerves (percutaneous), or through the skin (transcutaneous). Percutaneous application causes additional distress to the patient, and is a major disadvantage of this approach. Furthermore, stimulation of the skin without insertion leads to the need for high voltage stimulation because of the high impedance of the dry skin, unless the tongue is used as a receptor, which requires only about 3% as much voltage. This latter technique is undergoing clinical trials for various applications, and been approved for assistance to the blind in the UK. Alternatively, the roof of the mouth has been proposed as another area where low currents can be felt.|$|E

For a high frequency AlN ultrasonic transducer, its properties are related with its top <b>electrode</b> <b>size,</b> electrical impedance matching and layers of the piezoelectric plate. However, until now, no research has been published to analyze their influence on the performance of AlN ultrasonic transducers, especially in the frequency range above 200 MHz.
