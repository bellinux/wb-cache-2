At the classroom level, the Item Analysis Report, the Writing Criteria Report and (for numeracy in particular) the Assessment Area Report provide powerful diagnostic information {{which can be used}} to complement school assessment and to inform the planning of teaching and learning programs. Reports are usually delivered in September. [...] Each student tested receives a student report. Schools receive detailed results as to how each student answered individual questions, but {{do not have access to}} what the questions were. The tests provide an indication, not a <b>fine</b> <b>grading,</b> of a student's performance. Parents are only given general feedback as to which percentile band their children are in for each type of test. ACARA does not provide the magnitude of the measurement error or the imprecision of the tests.|$|E
5000|$|The {{face ring}} k&Delta; is a multigraded algebra over k all of whose {{components}} {{with respect to}} the <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> have dimension at most 1. Consequently, its homology can be studied by combinatorial and geometric methods. An abstract simplicial complex &Delta; is called Cohen-Macaulay over k if its face ring is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. [...] In his 1974 thesis, Gerald Reisner gave a complete characterization of such complexes. This was soon followed up by more precise homological results about face rings due to Melvin Hochster. Then Richard Stanley found a way to prove the Upper Bound Conjecture for simplicial spheres, which was open at the time, using the face ring construction and Reisner's criterion of Cohen-Macaulayness. Stanley's idea of translating difficult conjectures in algebraic combinatorics into statements from commutative algebra and proving them by means of homological techniques was the origin of the rapidly developing field of combinatorial commutative algebra.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ideas of}} early writers like Arthur de Gobineau made the more {{politically}} minded archaeologists {{of the day}} consider Europeans as the original (superior) race. Hence, the African and Asian races had to come from somewhere. The skull from Chancelade showing traits {{similar to that of}} Eskimos was suggested as an ancestor for the [...] "yellow" [...] race, while the much older Grimaldi finds satisfied the need for an ancestor for the [...] "black" [...] race. In the post-Victorian science, and particularly after World War II such <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> of human races fell out of favour, and the interpretation of Chancalade man as an ancestor of Asian people have been seen as imaginations resulting from the theories of de Gobineau, to prove the superiority and anteriority of the white race. Harvard evolutionary geneticist Richard Lewontin stated that [...] "no justification can be offered for continuing the biological concept of race. (...) Genetic data shows that no matter how racial groups are defined, two people from the same racial group are about as different from each other as two people from any two different racial groups. That's the Lewontin's Fallacy.|$|E

50|$|Fully {{automatic}} systems {{allow the}} ability of the machine's implements to be controlled by the GPS guidance system. This is typically used in the <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> applications where precise levels of material need to be moved on a predetermined design or grade. The advantages to this system is due to the accuracy that can be achieved with GPS and RTK, but requires an onsite base station. These systems can use either one or two GPS receivers and are mounted on the machine's blade. The more advanced systems use two receivers since it allows the machine to be controlled in a three-dimensional design. Fully automatic systems require the GPS guidance system to be integrated in the machine's implement controls. Some manufacturers sell the machine with these controls already integrated into the machine as an option. Aftermarket kits are available that can retrofit your existing machine to fully automatic control, but requires the GPS system to interface with the machine's implement controls. This is typically done one of two ways. If the machine's implements are controlled using electric over hydraulic (EH), the GPS system can input lever commands in parallel with the machine's implement lever. The output from the GPS system is interpreted by the machine's electronic control module as a lever command given by the operator and moves the implements accordingly. The second method for integrating GPS in the machine's implement controls is by adding a second pilot hydraulic valve in parallel with the machine's pilot hydraulic valve. This second valve is controlled by the GPS system and moves the implement valve according to the system design and blade location. Types of machines that use fully automatic GPS systems include TTT and MG.|$|E

Based on {{the classification of}} maximal diagonalizable subgroups of PGL(n, C) by Havlicek, Patera and Pelantova, we prove that any finite maximal diagonalizable subgroup K of PGL(n, C) is a symplectic abelian group and its Weyl group, which describes the symmetry of the <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> induced {{by the action of}} K, is just the isometry group of the symplectic abelian group K.

40|$|Study of the normalizer of the MAD-group {{corresponding}} to a finegrading {{offers the most}} important tool for describing symmetries in the system of non-linear equations connected with contraction of a Lie algebra. One <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> that is always present in any Lie algebra sl(n,C) is the Pauli grading. The MAD-group {{corresponding to}} it is generated by generalized Pauli matrices. For such MAD-group, we already know its normalizer; its quotient group is isomorphic to the Lie group Sl(2,Z_n) × vZ_ 2. In this paper, we deal with a more complicated situation, namely that the <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> of sl(p^ 2, C) is given by a tensor product of the Pauli matrices of the same order p, p being a prime. We describe the normalizer of the corresponding MAD-group and we show that its quotient group is isomorphic to Sp(4,Z_p) ×Z_ 2...|$|E

40|$|Background: Trachoma is {{the leading}} {{infectious}} cause of blindness due to conjunctival infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The presence of active trachoma and evidence of infection are poorly correlated and a strong immunologicallymediated inflammatory response means that clinical signs last much longer than infection. This population-based study in five Aboriginal communities endemic for trachoma in northern Australia compared a <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> of clinical trachoma with diagnostic positivity and organism load. Methods: A consensus <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> of trachoma, based on clinical assessment and photograding, was compared to PCR, a lipopolysacharide (LPS) -based point-of-care (POC) and a 16 S RNA-based nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Organism load was measured in PCR positive samples. Results: A total of 1282 residents, or 85. 2 % of the study population, was examined. Taking the findings of both eyes, the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1 – 9 years was 25. 1 % (96 / 383) of whom 13 (13. 7 %) were PCR positive on the left eye. When clinical data were limited to the left eye as this was tested for PCR, the prevalence of TF decreased to 21. 4 % (82 / 383). The 301 TF negative children, 13 (4. 3 %) were PCR positive. The <b>fine</b> <b>grading</b> of active trachoma strongly correlated with organism load and disease severity (rs = 0. 498, P = 0. 0004). Overall, 53 % of clinical activity (TF 1 or TF 2) and 59 % of PCR positivity was found in those with disease scores less than the WHO simplified grade of TF...|$|E

Detailed studies of the pathogenesis, distribution and natural history of trachoma should use finer grading schemes for the more precise identification of clinical status. In low prevalence areas, the LPS-based POC test lacks the sensitivity to detect active ocular infection and nucleic acid amplification tests such as PCR or the 16 S-RNA based NAAT performed better. Trachoma in the Aboriginal communities requires specific control measures...|$|E
