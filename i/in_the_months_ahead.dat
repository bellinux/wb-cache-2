40|$|To craft a post- 2012 {{climate change}} agreement, four key {{sticking}} points {{will need to}} be addressed <b>in</b> advance of <b>the</b> COP 15. First, a number of hurdles must be overcome to put in place global abatement targets for the near- and mid-term—and critically, to establish what countries are willing to do individually to achieve these goals. Next, a more comprehensive carbon market is needed to deliver cost-effective emissions reductions on a global scale and to engage developing nations (which are set to account for the majority of future emissions) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Third, shifting away from high- to low-carbon technologies will require that clean technologies become costcompetitive, brought to sustainable scale, and effectively deployed.
