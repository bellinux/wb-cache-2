Under the influence of an alternating electric field, an induced electrical dipole moment can be formed due to the polarization of the electrical double layer.

These impedance parameters are in relation to particle characteristics, for example, the particle size. The research about particle size effect on electrical impedance spectra {{was carried out in}} a four-electrode system and the result indicated that impedance parameters shows a capability for characterizing the particle size. This paper reports the experimental results from electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements on silica suspensions in a two-electrode system with carbon probe.
