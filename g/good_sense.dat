50|$|Humidity sensors {{have also}} been {{prepared}} using polyaniline nanofibers. These sensors were prepared through electrospinning of a N,N-dimethylformamide solution of polyaniline nanofibers, poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). These sensors were shown to have high sensitivity, with resistance changes of three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the sensors showed <b>good</b> <b>sensing</b> linearity, fast response, small hysterics, and good repeatability.|$|R
30|$|However, {{there are}} some {{problems}} about the conventional structure: (1) the sample size of the quiet periods {{may not be enough}} to get <b>good</b> <b>sensing</b> performance; (2) all CR communications have to be postponed during channel sensing; (3) the placement of the quiet periods causes an additional burden of synchronization. To address these problems, novel spectrum sensing scheduling schemes have been proposed.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of}} the lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with a <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of position who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring lakes, rivers, {{and oceans}} is {{critical}} to improv-ing our understanding of complex large-scale ecosystems. In this work, we develop and analyze three path planning al-gorithms for underwater robots to optimize sensing in con-junction with networks of underwater sensors. The algo-rithms require different levels {{of knowledge about the}} en-vironment: global, local, and decentralized control of the robot by the sensor network. We find our global Voronoi approach produces paths that are typically best for sensing, but are longer, which can be problematic if the robot has limited endurance. The local algorithm, inspired by Tangent Bug, produces paths that are usually shorter while still hav-ing <b>good</b> <b>sensing.</b> The decentralized controller also has <b>good</b> <b>sensing</b> and short paths and has the advantage that it can also adapt the depths of the underwater sensors to jointly optimize the sensor network and robot sensing and the robot path length. The drawback is the somewhat higher com-munication and processing requirements. For each of these algorithms we perform a detailed analysis and comparison in simulation. We identify limitations of each and provide framework for future improvements. 1...|$|R

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|The face appears wide due to ruffs of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils.

The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) pressure sensor partly shielded {{with a metal}} tube.

Due to its <b>good</b> <b>sensing</b> linearity, this sensor can be applied in the measurement of hydraulic pressure and vibration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
