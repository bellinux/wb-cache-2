5|$|Ball {{then took}} leave in England. His feats in France had {{received}} considerable publicity. He {{was the first}} British ace to become a household name, and found that <b>his</b> <b>celebrity</b> was such {{that he could not}} walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements {{had a profound impact on}} budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|During his NBA career, Bradley {{used his}} fame {{on the court}} to explore social as well as {{political}} issues, meeting with journalists, government officials, academics, businesspeople, and social activists. He also worked as an assistant to the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C., and as a teacher in the street academies of Harlem. In 1976, he also became an author by publishing Life on the Run. Using a 20-day stretch of time during one season as the main focus of the book, he chronicled his experiences in the NBA and the people he met along the way. He noted in the book that he had initially signed only a four-year contract, and that he was uncomfortable using <b>his</b> <b>celebrity</b> status to earn extra money endorsing products as other players did.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, he {{appeared}} frequently on Phil Donahue's talk show. <b>His</b> <b>celebrity</b> crush, Alyssa Milano of the then-popular TV show Who's the Boss?, met Ryan and gave him a friendship bracelet and a kiss. Elton John loaned Jeanne White $16,500 to put toward a down payment on the Cicero home, and rather than accept repayment, placed the repaid money into a college fund for Ryan's sister. In high school, White drove a red 1988 Ford Mustang GT, a gift from Michael Jackson. Despite the fame and donations, Ryan White stated that he disliked the public spotlight, loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his mother or his upbringing for his illness, and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1939, Ruth {{spoke on}} Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium {{as members of}} the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into {{premature}} retirement by ALS disease, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, {{he was one of the}} first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that <b>his</b> <b>celebrity</b> and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.|$|E
5|$|During the war years, {{restrictions}} on {{style and the}} demand that composers write in a 'socialist realist' style were slackened, and Prokofiev was generally able to compose in his own way. The Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 80, The Year 1941, Op. 90, and the Ballade for the Boy Who Remained Unknown, Op. 93 all came from this period. In 1943 Prokofiev joined Eisenstein in Alma-Ata, the largest city in Kazakhstan, to compose more film music (Ivan the Terrible), and the ballet Cinderella (Op. 87), {{one of his most}} melodious and celebrated compositions. Early that year he also played excerpts from War and Peace to members of the Bolshoi Theatre collective, but the Soviet government had opinions about the opera that resulted in many revisions. In 1944, Prokofiev composed his Fifth Symphony (Op. 100) at a composer's colony outside Moscow. He conducted its first performance on 13 January 1945, just a fortnight after the triumphant premieres on 30 December 1944 of his Eighth Piano Sonata and, on the same day, the first part of Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible. With the premiere of his Fifth Symphony, which was programmed alongside Peter and the Wolf and the Classical Symphony (conducted by Nikolai Anosov), Prokofiev appeared to reach the peak of <b>his</b> <b>celebrity</b> as a leading composer of the Soviet Union. Shortly afterward, he suffered a concussion after a fall due to chronic high blood pressure. He never fully recovered from the injury, and he was forced on medical advice to restrict his composing activity.|$|E
