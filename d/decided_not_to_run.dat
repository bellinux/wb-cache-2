5|$|Although St. Gatien {{was entered}} in the Cambridgeshire Handicap at the next Newmarket meeting, {{he would have been}} {{required}} to carry 139 pounds, and his connections <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> instead targeting the ten furlong Free Handicap at the same meeting on October 22. He started odds-on favourite and successfully conceded three pounds to Duke of Richmond, winning comfortably by three quarters of a length. On his final start of the year he won at Newmarket for the third time when taking the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E
50|$|Otis joined U.S. Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett's {{staff in}} 2001, and {{he served as}} {{his chief of staff}} {{beginning}} in 2003. Bartlett considered not running for reelection in 2012, and Otis resigned from Bartlett's staff in December 2011 in order to explore running to replace Bartlett if Bartlett were <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for reelection. Otis ended up <b>deciding</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the office.|$|R

In 1987 Raymond Figueroa, with Washington's backing, {{defeated}} Berrios's candidate for alderman, Miguel Santiago, which helped close the Council Wars. A year later Figueroa defeated Berrios for committeeman. In 1991, Figueroa <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election as alderman, {{and left the}} committeeman's job the following year. Berrios regained the committeeman's post, a role he has held ever since.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand had {{numerous}} potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic primary election. Some were obvious {{at the time}} of her appointment. Most notably, Long Island Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy was unhappy with Gillibrand's stance on gun control, but McCarthy ultimately <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> Harold Ford, Jr., a former Congressman from Tennessee, considered a run but ultimately decided against it in March 2009. Congressman Steve Israel was also a potential contender but was talked out of it by President Obama.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for {{re-election}} in 1883. He was losing too much support due to his ties with the Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} mayor of Moose Jaw in the Saskatchewan {{municipal}} elections, 2009, and retired in 2012, <b>deciding</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for another term.|$|R

5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, and he <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{for reelection}} in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, {{and in that}} year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total}} of 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in what is now called the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to the New State House the following year.|$|E
5|$|In March 2003, Huntsman {{resigned}} {{his post}} in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election {{in order to become}} the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Bush administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{stood to}} benefit from the Republican electorate's {{tendency}} to nominate candidates who had previously run for president, and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen. The early stages of the race found him as the apparent front-runner in a weak field, especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization. Perhaps his greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts health care reform law that he had shepherded five years earlier. As many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> (including Mike Pence, John Thune, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Daniels), Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney.|$|E
50|$|Reason: Farnsworth withdrew, {{conceding that}} he could not beat Horgan who had amassed the support of over half the NDP's 34 member caucus. He had not officially {{registered}} his candidacy prior <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R

50|$|After {{two more}} terms in 1878 and 1879 {{in the state}} house, Turner {{was elected to the}} 47th United States Congress as a Democratic Representative. He was re-elected to Congress for seven {{additional}} terms until <b>deciding</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in 1896.|$|R
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997 {{legislative}} elections the FN polled its best-ever {{result with}} 15.3% support in metropolitan France, confirming its {{position as the}} third most important political force in France. It also showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{to focus on the}} 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly (Toulon), thanks to a good communication director, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential now {{than it had been in}} 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, in an unusual display of dissent, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such compromise. In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Rove {{encouraged}} George W. Bush {{to run for}} Texas governor, {{brought in}} experts to tutor him on policy, and introduced him to local reporters.

50|$|Before {{mustering}} {{out of the}} Army on January 1, 1866, Cox {{was elected}} governor of Ohio in October 1865. He served from 1866 to 1868, but his moderate views on African-American suffrage and his earlier endorsement of President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policy caused him <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for reelection.
