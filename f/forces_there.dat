The detonation killed 13 men and wounded 23; the ship had to be beached at Malo-les-Bains lest she sink, and was written off.|$|E
5|$|His reign was {{inextricably}} {{connected to}} the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman domination. Although there exist no historical sources which prove that he took {{active role in the}} defence of the country, in Bulgarian folklore Ivan Shishman is portrayed as a legendary and heroic ruler who desperately fought against the overwhelming Ottoman <b>forces.</b> <b>There</b> are numerous sites, geographical features and fortresses named after him throughout Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class were}} the only battleships with the speed {{required}} for post-war operations based around fast aircraft carrier task <b>forces.</b> <b>There</b> {{were a number of}} proposals in the early Cold War to convert the class to take into account changes in technology and doctrine. These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability and—in the case of Illinois and Kentucky—a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn. Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open {{a path for}} the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the rest}} of Army Group North. The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn, and concentrated their <b>forces</b> <b>there</b> in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Morotai began at 6:30 {{on the morning}} of 15 September. Allied {{warships}} conducted a two-hour-long bombardment of the landing area to suppress any Japanese <b>forces</b> <b>there.</b> This bombardment set several native villages on fire, but caused few Japanese casualties as they did not have many troops in the area.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin, {{armed with}} heavy {{anti-aircraft}} batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during {{air strikes against}} Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese <b>forces</b> <b>there</b> and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3–22 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, {{in the hope that}} major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy could be drawn into battle.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the regular}} Nigerian Police <b>Force,</b> <b>there</b> are high amounts of {{corruption}} and violations that include extortion and embezzlement.

5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was {{in command of the}} militia <b>forces</b> <b>there.</b> Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E
5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, {{but refused to}} take any further action as the Union <b>forces</b> <b>there</b> were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous supply line. Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner {{was the author of}} the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|After losing {{half its}} strength, No. 38 Squadron {{remained}} at Changi and conducted supply and aeromedical evacuation flights throughout Malaya {{to support the}} British-led <b>forces</b> <b>there.</b> The squadron's aircraft were also occasionally used to mark targets ahead of bombing raids and to drop propaganda leaflets. From April to July 1951, No. 38 Squadron and an attached flight from No. 41 Squadron RNZAF was stationed at RAF Kuala Lumpur, and was the main unit tasked with dropping supplies to Commonwealth forces in the field. The squadron made another deployment to Kuala Lumpur between November 1951 and February 1952. In February 1952, No. 38 Squadron successfully parachuted 54 personnel from the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment into a remote area near the Malaya-Thailand border.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{formerly}} enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, {{such as the}} brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634–679) and Yeon Namsan (639–701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla began fighting the Tang <b>forces</b> <b>there.</b> At {{the same time the}} Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670. By 676, the Tang army was driven out of Korea by Unified Silla. Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed <b>forces.</b> <b>There</b> is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{of the two}} armies {{initially}} collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his <b>forces</b> <b>there,</b> his objective {{being to}} engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating {{through the streets of}} the town to the hills just to the south.|$|E

5|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{chose to}} attack Riga, the Grand Duchy's {{foremost}} trade center, in late August 1621, {{just as the}} Ottoman army was approaching Khotyn, tying-up the Polish <b>forces</b> <b>there.</b> The city, stormed several times, had to surrender a month later. Moving inland to the south the Swedes next entered Courland. With Riga the Commonwealth lost the most important Baltic seaport {{in the region and}} an entry to northern Livonia, the Daugava River crossing. The 1622 Truce of Mitawa gave Poland the possession of Courland and eastern Livonia, but the Swedes were to take over most of Livonia north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian forces were able to keep Dyneburg, but suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Wallhof.|$|E
5|$|In Brest, {{command of}} Marseillois passed to Captain Henri-César de Castellane Majastre, {{and she became}} part of a {{squadron}} under Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. A young Pierre-Charles Villeneuve served aboard as an ensign. On 22 March 1781, the fleet sailed for America to reinforce D'Estaing's <b>forces</b> <b>there,</b> arriving off Martinique on 29 April. There, the fleet met the British forces under Admiral Hood, and the Battle of Fort Royal broke out, an inconclusive long-ranged artillery duel that lasted until the British retreated the next day due to the damage sustained by HMS Intrepid, Centaur and Russell.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, Dragan Vasiljković was {{deployed}} {{from the}} Croatian Serb capital Knin to Banovina to coordinate rebel <b>forces</b> <b>there.</b> By 21 July, {{his work was}} commended by local commanders, and two days later, a regional command of Croatian Serb forces was announced {{at a meeting in}} Dvor attended by Milan Martić, {{one of the most prominent}} SAO Krajina leaders. On 24 July, one day after the regional command was established, the Serb rebels adopted a military plan, presented by Vasiljković, aimed at removing Croatian forces from Banovina. On 25 July, 14 mortar rounds were fired at the Kozibrod police station. Nobody was injured in the attack, and in its aftermath, SAO Krajina authorities requested a ceasefire until 10 August because of the harvest.|$|E
