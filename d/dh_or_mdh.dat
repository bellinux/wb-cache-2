In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} electrolytic lesions of the fimbria/fornix (FX) or entorhinal cortex (EC), the primary afferent projection systems to the DH, on contextual fear conditioning in rats. Conditioning consisted of the delivery of unsignaled footshocks in a novel observation chamber, and freezing served as the measure of conditional fear. Electrolytic lesions of the FX, <b>DH,</b> <b>or</b> EC made 1 week before training produced anterograde impairments in both immediate postshock freezing on the conditioning day and freezing during the context extinction test 24 h following training. The deficits in conditional freezing produced by FX, DH, and EC lesions were not statistically different, although the deficits in rats with FX or EC lesions tended to be more severe than those in rats with DH lesions. In addition to producing deficits in conditional freezing, FX, <b>DH,</b> <b>or</b> EC lesions produced a pronounced locomotor hyperactivity. Within the lesion and sham groups, however, locomotor activity was not significantly correlated with conditional freezing.

Thirdly, three time periods were defined and genetic correlations between subpopulations were estimated within each period. Heritability was moderate (0. 17 - 0. 39) for both DH and JH. Genetic correlations between traits measured in <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> JH were not different from one considering the posterior standard deviation of the estimation; however, in most of the traits, a clear trend in reduction of the genetic correlation for traits expressed in DH and JH and an increase in their posterior standard deviation for recent years was observed.

Rats were given the D 1 -like receptor agonist SKF 38393 alone or {{in combination with the}} D 2 -like receptor agonist LY 171555 into the NAcc core, and lidocaine into the <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> the VH. Then, locomotor activity was recorded. Focal injection into the NAcc core of SKF 38393 alone or in combination with LY 171555 resulted in an increase of locomotor activity. Administration of lidocaine into the DH further potentiated the increase in locomotor activity induced by activation of D 1 -like receptors or co-activation of D 1 -like and D 2 -like receptors in the NAcc core. Administration of lidocaine into the VH also potentiated the increase in locomotor activity induced by D 1 -like receptor activation, but decreased that produced by co-activation of D 1 -like and D 2 -like receptors in the NAcc core. Taken together, these results suggest that under lidocaine-free conditions the DH may exert a tonic inhibitory modulation on hyperlocomotion mediated by D 1 -like and D 2 -like postsynaptic receptors in the NAcc core, while the VH may exert a tonic inhibitory on hyperlocomotion mediated by D 1 -like receptors and a tonic facilitatory control on hyperlocomotion mediated by D 2 -like postsynaptic receptors.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPositive {{responses}} to bronchodilators (BDs) on spirometry {{can be found}} in up to 30 % of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). However, no previous studies have investigated the impact of BDs on exercise outcomes, including dynamic hyperinflation (DH). MethodsA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted on 38 patients with LAM, comparing inhaled placebo versus salbutamol. Pulmonary function tests and a cycle endurance test at 75 % of the maximal work capacity, with evaluation of DH by serial measurement of inspiratory capacity (IC), which was the primary endpoint, were performed after each intervention. ResultsAlthough salbutamol produced a slight improvement in airway obstruction, compared with placebo, there was no significant variation in resting IC or air trapping. A total of 18 % of the patients met the criteria for a positive response to BD. During submaximal exercise, BD did not reduce <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> dyspnoea nor did it improve exercise tolerance in the entire population. In addition, BD produced only slight improvement in FEV 1 and air trapping in patients who had DH during incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing, without the beneficial effects on exercise outcomes. ConclusionsAlthough salbutamol produced a slight improvement in airway obstruction, it did not lead to a reduction in <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> increase in exercise tolerance in patients with LAM.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} the dorsal (DH) and the ventral (VH) poles of the hippocampus are structurally, molecularly and functionally different regions. While the DH is preferentially involved in the modulation of spatial learning and memory, the VH modulates defensive behaviors related to anxiety. Acute restraint is an unavoidable stress situation that evokes marked and sustained autonomic changes, which are characterized by elevated blood pressure (BP), intense heart rate (HR) increases, skeletal muscle vasodilatation and cutaneous vasoconstriction, which are accompanied by a rapid skin temperature drop followed by body temperature increases. In addition to those autonomic responses, animals submitted to restraint also present behavioral changes, such as reduced exploration of the open arms of an elevated plus-maze (EPM), an anxiogenic-like effect. In the present work, we report a comparison between the effects of pharmacological inhibition of DH and VH neurotransmission on autonomic and behavioral responses evoked by acute restraint stress in rats. Bilateral microinjection of the unspecific synaptic blocker cobalt chloride (CoCl 2, 1 mM) into the <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> VH attenuated BP and HR responses, as well as the decrease in the skin temperature, elicited by restraint stress exposure.

40|$|RATIONALE: Dopamine D 1 -like {{receptor}} signalling {{is involved}} in contextual fear conditioning, but the brain regions involved {{and its role in}} other contextual fear memory processes remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate (1) the effects of SCH 23390, a dopamine D 1 /D 5 receptor antagonist, on contextual fear memory encoding, retrieval and reconsolidation, and (2) if the effects of SCH 23390 on conditioning involve the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and/or basolateral amygdala (BLA). METHODS: Rats were used to examine the effects of systemically administering SCH 23390 on the acquisition, consolidation, retrieval and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory, and on locomotor activity and shock sensitivity. We also determined the effects of MK- 801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, on contextual fear memory reconsolidation. The effects of infusing SCH 23390 locally into <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> BLA on contextual fear conditioning and locomotor activity were also examined. RESULTS: Systemic administration of SCH 23390 impaired contextual fear conditioning but had no effects on fear memory consolidation, retrieval or reconsolidation. MK- 801 was found to impair reconsolidation, suggesting that the behavioural parameters used allowed for the pharmacological disruption of memory reconsolidation. The effects of SCH 23390 on conditioning were unlikely the result of any lasting drug effects on locomotor activity at memory test or any acute drug effects on shock sensitivity during conditioning. SCH 23390 infused into either <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> BLA impaired contextual fear conditioning and decreased locomotor activity.

40|$|Salt appetite, the {{primordial}} instinct to favorably ingest salty substances, represents a vital evolutionary important drive to successfully maintain body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. This innate instinct was shown here in Sprague-Dawley rats by increased ingestion of isotonic saline (IS) over water in fluid intake tests. However, this appetitive stimulus was fundamentally {{transformed into a}} powerfully aversive one by increasing the salt content of drinking fluid from IS to hypertonic saline (2 % w/v NaCl, HS) in intake tests. Rats ingested HS similar to IS when given no choice in one-bottle tests and previous {{studies have indicated that}} this may modify salt appetite. We thus investigated if a single 24 h experience of ingesting IS <b>or</b> HS, dehydration (<b>DH)</b> <b>or</b> 4 % high salt food (HSD) altered salt preference. Here we show that 24 h of ingesting IS and HS solutions, but not <b>DH</b> <b>or</b> HSD, robustly transformed salt appetite in rats when tested 7 days and 35 days later. Using two-bottle tests rats previously exposed to IS preferred neither IS or water, whereas rats exposed to HS showed aversion to IS. Responses to sweet solutions (1 % sucrose) were not different in two-bottle tests with water, suggesting that salt was the primary aversive taste pathway recruited in this model. Inducing thirst by subcutaneous administration of angiotensin II did not overcome this salt aversion. We hypothesised that this behavior results from altered gene expression in brain structures important in thirst and salt appetite.
