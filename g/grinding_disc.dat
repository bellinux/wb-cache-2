E 335 GC (11600), X 20 Cr 1 3 (19436) a 102 Cr 6 (14109) materials were machined in hardened and non-hardened condition. Abrasive (grinding) material affects the size of the cutting forces and thus flexibility of technological system and the repeatability of products. High cutting forces are generated when using sintered corundum, and white electrocorundum. Due to the geometry of the abrasive grain is more advantageous to use diamond or cubic boron nitride material. The porosity of the grinding wheel also affects the resulting machine tool load and technological areas. The greater the porosity is, the lower the value of cutting forces is. Unfortunately, with the porosity increases significantly an average roughness. These grinding wheels are suitable for roughing. The higher value of porosity ensures colder cut and smaller heat affected surfaces. Surface quality, while maintaining other process conditions are best when using white electrocorundum, slightly is impaired for other abrasive materials.

40|$|Vibration {{injury in}} the hand-arm system from {{vibrating}} hand-held machines {{is one of the}} most common occupational health injuries and causes severe and often chronic nerve and vascular injuries to the operator. The objective with this study is to contribute to reduce hand-arm vibration injuries, first by developing methods of redesigning machines that will lower their vibration level and second to study how high frequency vibrations (HFV) above 1250 Hz effect the finger tissue which are not included in the current standard for risk evaluation. Vibrating hand-held machines can be divided into two main groups depending of the source of the vibration. The first and largest group is machines where a reciprocating piston creates a vibration, e. g. breakers and hammer drills. The second group is rotating machines, e. g. grinders and polishing machines, where the vibration is generated by the unbalance force from the <b>grinding</b> <b>disc</b> or the rotating force from the friction between the abrasive pad and the work piece. This study has mainly been focused on reciprocating machine vibrations by development of a method for attenuation of these vibrations based on tuned vibration absorbers (TVA). The TVA comprises of a spring and an additional mass connected to the main vibrating body that creates a counterforce to attenuate system vibration. The limitation of conventional TVA is that they are only effective in a narrow frequency span and thereby have a limited practical use. However by introducing appropriate gap and spring preload into classical TVA makes the absorber dynamics nonlinear. It was shown that this kind of nonlinearity can lead to frequency auto tuning vibration attenuation. The efficiency of the developed technology called Auto Tuning Vibration Absorber (ATVA) was proven by simulations and the results were validated both in a dedicated test rig as well as in prototype machines. The results from a prototype machine showed that the vibration could be reduced by approx. 80 % and at the same time reduce the weight with 50 % compared to the original machine without affecting the efficiency. The study of the mechanical effects from HFV on finger tissue was made by, first: development of measurement technique based on Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers to be able to accurately measure vibrations up to 50 kHz, second: create a Finite Element (FE) model for simulating the pressure wave propagation into the finger tissue, and third: development of methods to reduce the HFV content in machines. Measurements show that there are high frequency high amplitude accelerations from impact tools and that these accelerations create a pressure wave that propagates into the tissue. It was also shown that there is a large potential to effectively reduce the HFV content in machines. On the study of effects on finger tissue from HFV clearly indicated that there is potentially an increased risk that HFV will cause vibration injuries on humans and on biological tissues and that the current standard ISO  5349 underestimates the associated risks...|$|E

The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20 cm in length, complicating fruit harvesting. When the fruit is ripe, the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) drops to the ground. The fruit contains a yellow flesh often consumed by rodents as food, which leave the seeds clean.

50|$|Grinding is {{abrasion}} of {{the surface}} of interest by abrasive particles, usually diamond, that are bonded to paper or a metal <b>disc.</b> <b>Grinding</b> erases saw marks, coarsely smooths the surface, and removes stock to a desired depth. A typical grinding sequence for ceramics is one minute on a 240-grit metal-bonded diamond wheel rotating at 240 rpm and lubricated by flowing water, followed by a similar treatment on a 400-grit wheel. The specimen is washed in an ultrasonic bath after each step.|$|R
40|$|Vibrations arising {{during the}} {{sharpening}} process of disc blades are a crucial problem in paper manufacturing for {{they can cause}} a considerable loss of quality and productivity in the paper cutting process. In the technical literature no specific works are reported but similar problems such as those related to <b>grinding</b> and brake <b>discs</b> are dealt with. In this work {{the results of an}} experimental investigation carried out on a paper cutting machine are presented and discussed. The sharpening process of a disc blade has also been simulated by means of the explicit code LS-DYNA, integrated with the finite element code ANSYS.

40|$|Background: In 2007, three {{patients}} from Impregnated Web Technology (IWT) factory {{were referred to}} Groote Schuur occupational clinic with contact dermatitis. The IWT factory manufactures sanding and <b>grinding</b> <b>discs,</b> traditionally a low latex exposure industry. Workers at this factory were introduced to latex gloves in 2004 to protect their hands for various reasons. One of the patient was referred with raised latex specific IgE. Our preliminary diagnosis was irritant contact dermatitis. The dermatitis cleared after avoiding latex gloves. The other two were referred with negative latex specific IgE. One was subsequently diagnosed of fiberglass dermatitis confirmed with histology {{and the other with}} urticaria based on the history. Because of the perception that skin problems equate to latex allergy we decided to study the relevance of a positive latex specific IgE in a nonmedical setting. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the prevalence and relevance of latex sensitization at this traditionally a low latex exposure factory. It also aimed to increase awareness of latex exposure and provide recommendations for preventing and managing latex allergies. Methods: A cross sectional study of the workers on duty was conducted at the IWT factory over 2 days. There were no exclusion criteria. Ethics approval was obtained. Workers who volunteered were asked to sign informed consent and answer 3 questionnaires. Questioned asked were related to glove use at work and at home. They were also examined by the investigator and had a blood sample taken for total IgE and latex specific IgE measurement. Results: There were 160 workers on the factory floor over the study period. Only 81 workers volunteered giving a response rate of 51 %. The point prevalence of latex sensitization was 16 %(13 / 81). There was a significant relationship between workers who had skin signs and wore glove, however there was no association between glove usage and total and latex specific IgE. A raised latex specific IgE was associated with permanent employment. Conclusion: The prevalence of elevated latex specific IgE amongst workers at IWT factory was high, in the range of that reported of medical personnel, suggesting a source of latex exposure in the work place. The reasons for glove use amongst the workers revealed an appropriate use of natural rubber latex gloves with unnecessary latex exposure. Although we could not link the high prevalence of latex specific IgE to the use of gloves, subgroup analysis with larger numbers of workers may expose an association suggested by a higher prevalence in permanent workers. We suggest the use of more appropriate gloves selected for the protection needed. A latex specific IgE test should be performed only for workers with strong suspicion of latex sensitization, not simply skin signs and symptoms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractModern {{technological}} processes make {{it possible}} to produce high strength steel with up to 1200  MPa yield strength. This high yield strength gives potential for considerable improvements in performance and reduction in weight, which are of increasing importance in the transport sector and in vehicles used in the construction industry. However, data found in literature show that welded structural parts using these high and ultra-high strength steels have a fatigue resistance not very different in comparison with those obtained in conventional steels with a much lower yield stress. In this work a fatigue study was performed in a high strength steel in order to evaluate the influence on fatigue strength of the following factors: stress concentration at weld toe, internal defects and welding process method. The material used in this study was a steel sheet called DOMEX 600 DC from SSAB with 5  mm of thickness. This is a high strength steel with a yield stress of 670  MPa and a tensile strength of about 750  MPa. Butt welded specimens using MAG welding process were submitted to cyclic loading in servo hydraulic machine. Three welding conditions of transverse butt joints and base material were investigated in this fatigue study: as welded; welds overfill removed by grinding; welds overfill and first weld root removed by grinding. The overfill removing by grinding promotes a significant improvement of the fatigue resistance in comparison with the as welded condition. The removing of the root of the first weld by <b>disc</b> <b>grinding</b> improves significantly the weld quality by reducing the level of internal defects, leading to a further increasing on fatigue strength close to the parent material. The comparison of characteristic curves obtained for each welding condition and the fatigue class (FAT) indicates that, in general, fatigue strength of DOMEX 600 DC steel is significantly higher than fatigue strength recommended by IIW for conventional steels. The higher difference was found for welds with overfill removed and the first weld root submitted to a <b>disc</b> <b>grinding</b> operation...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{quantify}} the temperature {{changes in the}} dental pulp associated with equine dental procedures using power grinding equipment. Design A matrix experimental design with replication on the same sample was followed to allow the following independent variables to be assessed: horse age (young or old), tooth type (premolar or molar), powered <b>grinding</b> instrument (rotating <b>disc</b> or die grinder), grinding time (15 or 20 seconds) and {{the presence or absence}} of water coolant. Procedure Sound premolar and molar teeth from a 6 -year-old horse and a 15 -year-old horse, which had been removed postmortem, were sectioned parallel to the occlusal plane to allow placement of a miniature thermocouple at the level of the dental pulp. The maximum temperature increase, the time taken to reach this maximum and the cooling time were measured (n= 10 in each study). The teeth were placed in a vice and the instrument used on the tooth as per clinical situation. Results Significant differences were recorded for horse age (P < 0. 001), instrument type (P < 0. 001), grinding time (P < 0. 001) and presence or absence of coolant (P < 0. 001). There was no significant difference for tooth type. Conclusion Thermal insult to the dental pulp from the use of power instruments poses a significant risk to the tooth. This risk can be reduced or eliminated by appropriate selection of treatment time and by the use of water irrigation as a coolant. The increased dentine thickness in older horses appears to mitigate against thermal injury from frictional heat...|$|R
