40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{tolerancing}} of assemblies composed of compliant components.

The synthesis of both specifications and tolerances is carried out to provide the <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerancing</b> of components of the system. Work relating to the mechanical behaviour of the systems is based mainly on digital models resulting from the CAD. They make possible to know, according to the boundary conditions in displacements and/or forces, the values of the stress, strain and displacements at the various points of the studied structure. Currently, the two studies are separated and give independent results. The influence of tolerancing on boundary conditions is not always negligible.

40|$|A peg-and-hole {{assembly}} may adopt clearance, transition or interference fits {{depending on}} the functional requirements of the particular design. The international standards that are used for the specification {{of the nature of}} a fit refer, nevertheless, only to dimensional deviations. They do not consider the actual geometry of the assembly components. <b>Geometrical</b> <b>tolerances</b> are assigned in addition to the dimensional tolerances whereas, for certain applications, the latter may also include some provision for them. Maximum and minimum functional clearances, dimensional and <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerances</b> of a peg-and-hole assembly consist of a system where values of the first two variables are design-imposed and the dimensional/geometrical tolerance values have to be suitably allocated. This tolerance allocation cannot, however, be effected by a straightforward approach. The unknown variables are more than the available clearance/tolerance relationships and in the current engineering practice, the problem solution is usually based on experimental/empirical data and/or general tolerance assignment guidelines. The paper addresses this problem through a systematic analysis of the accuracy requirements of a peg-and-hole clearance fit assembly. The analysis is then followed by the development of a methodology for the evaluation of the dimensional and <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the assembly components.

40|$|Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) is a {{technical}} language which covers the standardization for micro/macro- geometry specifications. In today’s environment of globalization, out-sourcing and sub-contracting is increasing. Geometrical specifications {{of a product}} need to be detailed to a degree where nothing is left open to interpretation. To fulfil this, and {{to meet the requirements}} of digital manufacturing, it is necessary to integrate the design and inspection process of a geometrical specification. At the technical level, many functional operator/operations are employed in a geometrical specification. These functional operators/operations are based on rigorous mathematics, and they are intricately related and inconvenient to be used directly. Consequently, it is of practical utility to build an integrated information system to encapsulate and manage the information involved in GPS. This thesis focuses on <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerancing,</b> including form/orientation/ location tolerancing, and its integrated geometry information system. The main contributions are: Firstly, a global data expression for modelling the integration between the design and inspection process of a geometrical tolerance is presented based on category theory. The categorical data model represents, stores and manipulates all the elements and their relationships involved in design and inspection process of a geometrical tolerance, by categories, objects and morphisms, flexibly; the relationships between objects were refined by pull back structures; and the manipulations of the model such as query and closure of query are realized successfully by functor structures in category theory. Secondly, different categories of knowledge rules have been established to enhance the rationality and the intellectuality of the integrated geometry information system, such as the rules for the application of geometrical requirement, tolerance type, datum and datum reference framework and, for the refinement among geometrical specifications. Finally, the host system for drawing indication of geometrical tolerances in the framework of GPS was established based on AutoCAD 2007 using ObjectARX.

40|$|Appropriate {{and cost}} {{effective}} assignment {{and interpretation of}} dimensional and <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerances,</b> in conjunction with tolerancing principles such as the maximum material condition (MMC), constitute a major area of concern for manufacturing SMEs.

40|$|Introduction In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, {{there exist}} several assistance {{technologies such as}} imaging and navigation systems, positioning robots and additive-manufacturing patient-specific instrumentation (PSI). These generic technologies {{can be used for}} different applications, i. e. knee arthroplasty, spine instrumentation and bone tumor resection. Practically, these technologies enable surgeons to identify patient anatomy, define preoperative surgical planning and intraoperatively replicate this planning on the patient. Since 2010, there exists a standard protocol from ASTM society to assess technical specifications of navigation systems and positioning robots in CAOS [1]. The standard presents both parameters to be used and tracking tests to be performed to define accuracy and precision (bias and variability) of navigation and robotic systems. The logical continuation of this first ASTM standard is to develop new standard protocols to evaluate quality of bone-preparation tasks, i. e. bone cutting, milling, drilling and assembly of bone fragments, performed with the aid of such CAOS systems. This paper introduces a practical guide for orthopaedic surgeons to plan and evaluate bone-preparation tasks in CAOS. The pratical guide consists in a systematic six-steps approach to plan and evaluate a bone-preparation task, independent from the CAOS systems being used to execute the task. The practical guide also provides guidelines to implement the systematic approach for specific task and surgical application, i. e. femoral and tibial cutting in knee arthroplasty, vertebral drilling in spine instrumentation, and bone cutting and assembly in tumor surgery. Materials and methods Systematic approach to plan and evaluate bone-preparation tasks in CAOS The systematic approach is composed of six steps (Figure) : (1) Planning frame is defined as a coordinate system presenting three orthogonal axes (x, y, z) according to patient anatomy; (2) Target specification of the task (cutting, milling, drilling or assembly) is defined in the planning frame as nominal (desired) geometry of the bone being prepared; (3) Accepted tolerances on nominal geometry are defined with relevant quality indicators accounting for desired functional outcomes and the level of accuracy provided by available CAOS systems; (4) Evaluation frame is defined as a new coordinate system with three orthogonal axes being registered to planning frame; (5) Errors on nominal geometry are computed and expressed in the registered planning frame; (6) Computed errors are investigated to determine whether the geometrical tolerances are respected. Validation process The implementation of the systematic approach for a specific task during a CAOS surgery may be validated in two phases. First, in-vitro experimentation on synthetic bone models with realistic simulations of the CAOS surgery will enable to validate the relevancy of the quality indicators used to define the geometric tolerances on bone cutting and drilling. This step will also enable to statistically investigate input factors with potential significant effect on outputs of the planning and evaluation process (i. e. geometric distortion during 3 D reconstruction of medical images, manual identification of anatomical landmarks to define planning frame, semi-automatic registration between planning and evaluation frames, automatic identification of cut planes in postoperative images, [...] .). Second, in-vivo studies with data provided by actual CAOS surgeries will enable to validate the reliability of the planning and evaluation process. This step will also enable to detect potential irrelevancies and inconsistencies in the planning and evaluation of the task (i. e. the postoperative CT images are unsuitable for the evaluation process {{because of the presence of}} a metallic implant). Results The systematic approach is currently undergoing the validation process for three specific tasks and surgical applications: bone cutting in knee arthroplasty, bone drilling in spine instrumentation (pedicle screw insertion), and bone cutting and assembly in pelvic tumor surgery. Simulations currently performed on experimental models of the knee, spine and pelvis, are validating the relevancy of the planning and evaluation process of computer-assisted planar cutting and axial drilling of bones. We demonstrated that target specifications and geometrical tolerances can be defined by relevant quality indicators in accordance with ISO 1101 standard [2], such as location (L) and flatness (F) parameters for planar cutting of bones, and angularity (A) and position (P) for axial drilling. As an example, detailed information on the use of location L to evaluate bone-cutting can be found in [3]. Clinical studies are currently validating the reliability of the planning and evaluation process of planar cutting and axial drilling of bones with data taken from actual CAOS surgeries. For bone tumor surgery, we showed that a millimetric accuracy can be evaluated by registering pre- and postoperative CT images and computing location L between planned and achieved cuts. For spine surgery, we also showed that a millimetric accuracy of inserted pedicle screws (in terms of angularity A) can be measured using intra-operative fluoroscopic images and compared with the preoperative CT-based insertion planning. Discussion The work presented here in the form of a practical guide is a first step toward developing new standard protocols to evaluate quality of bone-preparation tasks that could be assisted with CAOS technologies. The philosophy of these new standard protocols is not only to perform a quantitative evaluation of the quality in CAOS, but also to improve the objectivity of the planning and evaluation process in CAOS. Practically, for surgeons, such a practical guide can serve as a standard application-specific protocol to evaluate how accurately a preoperative planning can be intraoperately replicated on the patient. For researchers, this can be a standard protocol to investigate performances of new CAOS technologies that are still in prototyping in laboratories. For industrials, this can be useful for the certification of new CAOS technologies that are ready for marketplace. In 2014, joint application to ISO and CAOS societies will aim the setting-up of a new international technical committee composed of voluntary academicians and industrials, surgeons and engineers, to develop new application-specific ISO standards dedicated to the planning and quality evaluation in CAOS.

The methods and instruments used to inspect <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the parts are quite conventional and require a high skill and knowledge to assess the quality of the machined parts. For this reason, this research develop a method to effectively perform the inspection process by recommending non-contact approach using machine vision and new simple mathematical models {{that can be used for}} the creation of an inspection system to assist in the {{verification of}} an important form tolerance of machined parts. The main goal of this research is to develop method and procedure of roundness measurement that are simple to implement but at the same time is fast and effective to provide reliable technique that help the metrologist to make evaluation for the inspected parts. Two samples of cylindrical machined parts are selected to be measured by this non-contact approach. A test-rig set-up which consists of main components such as workholding fixture, CCD camera, lighting device and motor was developed in order to carry out this study. This research proposes new procedure in image processing by using WiT software. In addition, a new mathematical model for evaluation of roundness error is proposed according to the analogy given by Minimum Zone Circle (MZC) method. The proposed approach and mathematical models were analyzed using several set of number of part images. The results showed that the noncontact inspection system for roundness error were effective and reliable enough to assess this form tolerance. This concept of measurement can be further improved to obtain better accuracy of the roundness error assessment. In summary, this research suggests a new method for <b>geometrical</b> <b>tolerance</b> inspection for machined parts by using machine vision.
