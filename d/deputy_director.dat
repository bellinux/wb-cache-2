5000|$|The Government Accountability Office {{has found}} that this law authorizes the ONDCP to {{disseminate}} information in order to oppose legalization:Finally, apart from considerations of whether any particular law has been violated, you have asked whether the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> letter disseminated misleading information in connection with statements relating to the debate over legalization of marijuana. Clearly, the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> statements reflect one perspective regarding marijuana - a perspective that is disputed by others with different viewpoints. However, ONDCP is specifically charged with the responsibility for [...] "taking such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use" [...] of certain controlled substances such as marijuana - a responsibility which logically could include the making of advocacy statements in opposition to legalization efforts. The <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> statements about marijuana are thus within the statutory role assigned to ONDCP. Given this role, {{we do not see}} a need to examine the accuracy of the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director's</b> individual statements in detail.|$|R
