5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
5000|$|The {{catch is}} that any such {{characteristic}} that is possessed by all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> will not <b>be</b> possessed only by <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> For example, all <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> but not only <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>are</b> capable of feeling pain; and while only <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> capable of solving complex mathematical problems, not all humans can do this.|$|R

25|$|For example, the {{biological}} half-life {{of water in}} a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> about 9 to 10 days, though this can be altered by behavior and various other conditions. The biological half-life of cesium in human beings is between one and four months.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Aquinas {{claimed that}} X’s soul was X’s only {{substantial}} form, although X also had numerous accidental forms {{that accounted for}} X’s nonessential features. Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which {{in the case of}} a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> rational capacity. He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms. However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person. He held that a proper <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person. So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.|$|E
25|$|Culture is {{understood}} as the sphere in which the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> educated and knows himself, in which values are formed, in which he recognizes and appreciates truth, goodness, and beauty.

40|$|Consciousness and {{intentionality}} {{are perhaps}} the two central phenomena {{in the philosophy of}} mind. <b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> conscious beings: there is something it is like to <b>be</b> us. <b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> intentional beings: we represent {{what is going on in}} the world.

25|$|An {{androgen}} (from Greek andros meaning male <b>human</b> <b>being)</b> <b>is</b> any {{natural or}} synthetic steroid hormone that regulates {{the development and}} maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates by binding to androgen receptors. This includes the embryological development of the primary male sex organs, {{and the development of}} male secondary sex characteristics at puberty. Androgens are synthesized in the testes, the ovaries, and the adrenal glands.|$|E
25|$|According to Rajneesh every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> a Buddha {{with the}} {{capacity}} for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that {{is nothing but a}} barrier of dreams. Otherwise man's innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.|$|E
25|$|Human beings exists because God {{wanted to}} share His life with them. In this sense, every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> God's child. In a fuller sense, to come to {{salvation}} is to be reconciled to God through Christ and to be united with His divine Essence via Theosis in the beatific vision of the Godhead. The graces of Christ's passion, death, and resurrection {{are found in the}} seven sacraments of the Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|The {{central point}} of the Church doctrine, does not, however, lie {{in the areas of}} {{sexuality}} and creation but in the doctrine of justification. The <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> always a sinner, completely unable to reach God by his own merit. However, Christians are atoned by the grace of God, through the sacrifice of Christ, completely undeservedly. The Christian is simultaneously a sinner and a righteous person. At the end of time, Christ will return and subject all to his judgment. Then everlasting perdition can only be avoided by Christ's mercy.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or a homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeling of}} an {{electric}} shock {{is caused by the}} stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body. The energy stored as static electricity on an object varies {{depending on the size of}} the object and its capacitance, the voltage to which it is charged, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. For modelling the effect of static discharge on sensitive electronic devices, a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> represented as a capacitor of 100 picofarads, charged to a voltage of 4000 to 35000 volts. When touching an object this energy is discharged in less than a microsecond. While the total energy is small, on the order of millijoules, it can still damage sensitive electronic devices. Larger objects will store more energy, which may be directly hazardous to human contact or which may give a spark that can ignite flammable gas or dust.|$|E

2500|$|Darwin's {{approach}} to arguing for {{the evolution of}} <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>is</b> to outline how similar <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> to other animals.

He then moves on to argue for the similarity of mental characteristics.|$|R

25|$|Max Heindel {{divided the}} subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our {{instrument}} for specializing the vital {{energy of the}} sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about {{an inch and a}} half outside the body; the Desire body, which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16inches outside our visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>is</b> seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.|$|E
500|$|The alto aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, {{what is a}} <b>human</b> <b>being),</b> <b>is</b> {{accompanied}} by a solo oboe d'amore that [...] "expresses wonder {{about the nature of}} man" [...] and God's interest in him. The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why do you do all this for man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E
