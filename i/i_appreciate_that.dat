500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} season, Collider.com's Kayti Burt opined that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is [...] "the X-Men TV show you should be watching". Burt noted that the X-Men film {{franchise}} was expanding to television with the series Legion, but that S.H.I.E.L.D. already served that purpose well, highlighting {{the similarities between the}} X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who [...] "are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains", and face [...] "the same fears and prejudices" [...] from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between S.H.I.E.L.D.s Inhumans and the X-Men became [...] "particularly pointed" [...] in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film [...] that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that S.H.I.E.L.D. executed the storyline [...] "much better" [...] than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the mutant cure storyline, the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of Rogue in the first X-Men film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it [...] "not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most X-Men-like quality." [...] Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to 20th Century Fox holding the rights, [...] "we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through S.H.I.E.L.D." ...|$|E

Admiral Dewey also refuted Aguinaldo's account, stating that he had promised nothing regarding the future: [...] "From my observation of Aguinaldo and his advisers I decided {{that it would be}} unwise to co-operate with him or his adherents in an official manner. ...

2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making them talk about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that,</b> but can you tell me more about new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E

He hunted me up as soon as he came here, and has done me a hundred favors since, and says if I will come to China in the first trip of the great mail steamer next January and make his house in Pekin my home, he will afford me facilities that few men can have there for seeing and learning. He will give me letters to the chiefs of the great Mail Steamship Company which will be of service to me in this matter.
