40|$|An {{evidence}} {{synthesis of}} a medical intervention should assess the balance of benefits and <b>harms.</b> Investigators performing system-atic reviews of <b>harms</b> face challenges in finding data, rating the quality of <b>harms</b> reporting, and synthesizing and displaying data from different sources. Systematic reviews of <b>harms</b> often rely primarily on published clinical trials. Identifying important <b>harms</b> of treatment and quantifying the risk associated with them, how-ever, often require {{a broader range of}} data sources, including unpublished trials, observational studies, and unpublished infor-mation on published trials submitted to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Each source of data has some potential for yield-ing important information. Criteria for judging the quality of <b>harms</b> assessment and reporting are still in their early stages of development. Investigators conducting systematic reviews of <b>harms</b> should consider empirically validating the criteria they use to judge the validity of studies reporting <b>harms.</b> Synthesizing <b>harms</b> data from different sources requires careful consideration of internal validity, applicability, and sources of heterogeneity. This article highlights examples of approaches to methodologic issues associated with performing systematic reviews of <b>harms</b> from 96 Evidence-based Practice Center evidence reports...|$|R

40|$|This study argues that, to {{understand}} {{the sources of the}} modern preoccupation with obscenity, we need {{to understand}} how claims of <b>harms,</b> constructions of victims and offenders and broader moral governance objectives given by the transition from disciplinarian to risk-based governance articulate in judicial opinion. The study employed grounded theory analysis on 1, 823 federal judicial opinions between 1873 and 2007. The analysis identified five main categories of harm: (1) socialization <b>harms,</b> (2) <b>harms</b> of intrusion, (3) <b>harms</b> of defilement, (4) <b>harms</b> of inducement, and (5) ecological <b>harms.</b> <b>Harms</b> of socialization refer to a faulty transmission of cultural capital and a breakdown in norm learning. They are distinctly disciplinarian <b>harms</b> organized around main complaints against the bad thoughts and habits induced by exposure to obscene content. <b>Harms</b> of intrusion refer to <b>harms</b> ensuing from intrusion into an individual 2 ̆ 7 s privacy. These <b>harms</b> construct offenders as 2 ̆ 2 panderers 2 ̆ 2, guilty not as much of ill motive as of excess. <b>Harms</b> of defilement justify the creation of offenders as disciplinary typologies of deviance and are handled with the rhetoric of disgust. <b>Harms</b> of inducement, more visible in the context of licensing and zoning regulation, refer to direct effects of obscenity on individual conduct; the main claim is that exposure to obscenity or pornography will induce anti-social behavior in certain categories of individuals. Finally, ecological <b>harms</b> refer to <b>harms</b> distributed not onto individuals, but on social units whether particular locales, urban spaces or markets. <b>Harms</b> in this category have a distinct (but not exclusive) economic dimension, but may include a host of other social problems indirectly caused by providers of pornographic content, such as increased health risks or criminality. Ecological <b>harms</b> inaugurated risk-based regulatory strategies focused on risk minimization through the implementation of global social environmental controls, as well as strategies of risk-spreading and liability-shifting. Articulation between disciplinary assumptions and risk-based rationales in judicial discourse produced a type of hybrid discourse easily appropriated by conservative judges to tighten regulatory controls over sexual content at the detriment of First Amendment liberties. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{historical}} perspective on our own attempts to define the social <b>harms</b> associated with the abuse of alcohol. Challenging the notion that categories are necessarily objective and constant, it instead emphasizes {{the extent to which}} even <b>harms</b> that are visible and thus susceptible to measurement are in fact socially constructed. English sources from the preindustrial era revealed six broad categories of social <b>harms</b> associated with the abuse of alcohol. Four of the categories consisted of visible <b>harms</b> in the form of income lost, domestic violence, brawling, and accidents, all of which are still recognized as social <b>harms</b> associated with the abuse of alcohol. The other two categories, reversal of the established moral order and susceptibility to trickery, were of an essentially intrinsic or subjective nature and have since dropped from the lexicon of social <b>harms...</b>|$|R
