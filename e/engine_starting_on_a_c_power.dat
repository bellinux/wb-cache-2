50|$|Louis Coatalen, Sunbeam <b>engine</b> designer, <b>started</b> work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> diesel powered aero-engine, {{that would}} be {{suitable}} for use in airships, in 1928. Using his experience with both aero-engines and auto-mobile diesel engines, the result, given the company designation P.1, {{was based on the}} Dyak. Given the name Pathan, a prototype engine was displayed at the 1929 Olympia Aero Show, but attracted no orders.|$|R
50|$|From 1932 {{the diesel}} engines were changed to use Ricardo style heads, and {{referred}} to as Dorman-Ricardo engines. Large numbers of these engines were used in early diesel trucks, either fitted to new chassis, or for the conversion of existing petrol engines trucks. Production of Dorman-Ricardo marine and transport engines, mainly 4- or 6-cylinder units was to continue up to the war, at about which time Dorman introduced direct injection <b>engines.</b> Dorman <b>started</b> work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> V8 <b>engine</b> (model VRM) in 1938.|$|R

50|$|In 1932, IH {{produced}} {{their first}} diesel engine, in the McCormick-Deering TD-40 crawler. This <b>engine</b> <b>started</b> <b>on</b> gasoline, then switched over to diesel fuel. Diesel engines of this era {{were difficult to}} start in cold weather, and using gasoline allowed the <b>engine</b> to <b>start</b> easily and thoroughly warm up before making the switch to diesel in all weather conditions. In 1935, this engine was put in the International Harvester WD-40, becoming the first diesel tractor on wheels in North America (the world's first diesel tractor was the German Benz-Sendling BS 6, introduced in 1922).|$|R

50|$|In July 1940 the RAE {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Metrovick to build a flight-quality pure-turbojet engine based on the Freda turbine. This emerged as the F.1 concept, which was built in several forms, with the first runnable <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> <b>on</b> the testbed in late 1941. The design cleared its special-category flight-tests in 1942, and flew {{for the first time on}} 29 June 1943 in the open bomb bay of an Avro Lancaster. Compared to the centrifugal-flow Whittle designs, the F.1 was extremely advanced, using a nine-stage axial compressor, annular combustion chamber, and a two-stage turbine.|$|R

50|$|In the mid-20th century, {{kerosene}} or tractor vaporising oil (TVO) {{was used}} as a cheap fuel for tractors.

50|$|This {{particular}} {{version of}} the Y-block engine was used in Argentina in the F-100 pick-up well into the 1960s, and was known as Fase I (Phase I). In 1971, the engine was modified to accept a new-style cylinder head with a different valve arrangement (E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I versus E-I-I-E-E-I-I-E), new intake and exhaust manifolds and was renamed Fase II (Phase II). In this form, the 292 Fase II continued into the 1980s in the F-100, and was also used in the Argentine Ford Fairlane (built from 1969-1982, and based heavily on the U.S. 1968 model). All Argentine versions of this engine feature a cast crankshaft rather than the forged example that equipped US heavy-duty engines. The 292 version was also produced by Ford of Brazil and equipped the Brazilian LTD starting in 1969. Both the 272 and 292 engines were replaced on Brazilian cars by the 302 <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> <b>on</b> 1976 model year.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{very lonely}} place--a colony of half-finished streets, and half-inhabited houses, which {{had grown up in}} the {{neighbourhood}} of a great railway station. I heard the fierce scream of the whistle, and the heaving, heavy throb of the <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> <b>on</b> its journey, as I advanced along the gloomy Square in which I now found myself. The cab I had been following stood at a turning which led into a long street, occupied towards the farther end, by shops closed for the night, and at the end nearest me, apparently by private houses only. Margaret and Mr. Mannion hastily left the cab, and without looking either to the right or the left, hurried down the street. They stopped at the ninth house. I followed just in time to hear the door closed on them, and to count the number of doors intervening between that door and the Square.|$|R
