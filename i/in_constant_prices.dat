40|$|High maternity-related {{health care}} {{spending}} is often cited as an important barrier in utilizing quality health care during pregnancy and childbirth. This study has two objectives: (i) to measure the levels of expenditure on total maternity care in disaggregated components such as ANCs, PNCs, and Natal care expenditure; (ii) to quantify the extent of catastrophic maternity expenditure (CME) incurred by households and identify the factors responsible for it. Data from the 71 st round of the National Sample Survey (2014) was used to estimate maternity expenditure and its predictors. CME was measured {{as a share of}} consumption expenditure by different cut-offs. The two-part model was used to identify the factors associated with maternity spending and CME. The findings show that household spending on maternity care (US$ 149 <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>price)</b> is much higher than previous estimates (US$ 50 <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>price).</b> A significant proportion of households in India (51 %) are incurring CME. Along with economic and educational status, type of health care and place of residence emerged as significant factors in explaining CME. Findings from this study assume importance {{in the context of an}} emerging demand for higher maternity entitlements and government spending on public health care in India. To reduce CME, India needs to improve the availability and accessibility of better-quality public health services and increase maternity entitlements in line with maternity expenditure identified in this study...|$|R

This study intends to find out the behavioral relationship between the foreign employment and economic growth of Sri Lanka. To test this relationship, the time series data were considered during the period of 1977 to 2014. While the remittances of foreign employment were exploited as explanatory variable and the gross domestic product <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>price</b> was considered as explained variable. In this study, the multiple regression model was used to test the relationship between dependent and independent variables. According to this model the R- squared was 0. 99 and its Durbin Watson test statistic was 1. 198, therefore this model was fitted very well. In the meantime the coefficient of the foreign employment factor in the estimated model was 0. 834510 and its ‘t’ statistic was 16. 743 (0. 000), therefore this factor was significantly impacted on the dependent variable. Finally this study concluded that the foreign employment had positive behavioral relationship on the gross domestic product of Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the nature of economic growth in 19 manufacturing industries between 1970 - 92. There is substantial heterogeneity (both across sectors and time) in rates of growth of value-added, hours worked, labour productivity and Total Factor Productivity during the sample period. The decline <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>price</b> value-added <b>in</b> aggregate manufacturing during the sample period is associated with significant changes in the relative size of individual sectors, and with noticeable changes in performance between the two peak-to-peak business cycles 1973 - 79 and 1979 - 89. Despite changes in the relative size of sectors, the vast majority of aggregate productivity growth is explained by within-sector productivity growth. An analysis of productivity levels also reveals considerable heterogeneity. The distribution of productivity levels across sectors exhibits an increase in dispersion and becomes increasingly positively skewed during the sample period. There is evidence of productivity levels in a number of industries converging at values just below the mean; productivity levels in a few sectors persistently remain above and rise away from mean values. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{biotechnology}} industry {{has the potential}} to add economic spillover effects to a national economy but heavy investment and systematic planning are required. In 2007, Korea started the second stage of an ambitious government-led program, Bio Vision 2016, which is aimed to create an extended market size of 60 billion U. S. dollars by 2016. But, our long-term forecasting techniques predict roughly 5. 5 billion U. S. dollars <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>price</b> by 2016. Considering both professional judgment and the degree of current Korean government policies toward heavy investments in the biotechnology industries, however, is crucial to produce an accurate forecast. Thus, after these adjustments, the forecast value of the market size increases from 13 billion to 33 billion nominal U. S. dollars, depending on the investment strategy choices. We explain how our long-term forecasting values are computed and discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between those prediction values. Also, we provide policy debates on whether the government goals are fully achievable.

50|$|Until the mid-1970s, {{agriculture}} in Syria {{had been the}} primary economic activity. At independence in 1946, agriculture (including minor forestry and fishing) {{was the most important}} sector of the economy, and in the 1940s and early 1950s, agriculture was the fastest growing sector. Wealthy merchants from such urban centers as Aleppo invested in land development and irrigation. Rapid expansion of the cultivated area and increased output stimulated the rest of the economy. However, by the late 1950s, little land that could easily be brought under cultivation remained. During the 1960s, agricultural output stagnated because of political instability and land reform. Between 1953 and 1976, agriculture's contribution to GDP increased (<b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>prices)</b> by only 3.2 percent, approximately the rate of population growth. From 1976 to 1984 growth declined to 2 percent a year. Thus, agriculture's importance in the economy declined as other sectors grew more rapidly.|$|E
50|$|Ukraine stabilised by {{the early}} 2000s. The year 2000 was {{the first year of}} {{economic}} growth (since (Ukraine's) independence). The economy continued to grow thanks to a 50% growth of exports from 2000 till 2008. Mainly exports from the traditional industries of metals, metallurgy, engineering, chemicals, and food. Between 2001 and 2008 metals and chemicals prices boomed because of fast international economic growth while the price of natural gas imported from Russia remained low. Monetization also helped to drive the economic boom Ukraine experienced between 2000 and 2008. Attracted in part by relatively high interest rates foreign cash was injected in Ukraine's economy and money supply grew rapidly: from 2001 to 2010 broad money increased {{at an annual rate of}} 35%. In 2006 and 2007 credit growth averaged 73%. An effect of this was that Ukrainian assets began to look like a large economic bubble and high inflation started to damaged Ukraine's export competitiveness. The ratio of credit to GDP grew extremely fast—from 7 to almost 80 percent over just several years. From 2000 to 2007, Ukraine’s real growth averaged 7.4%. This growth was driven by domestic demand: orientation toward consumption, other structural change, and financial development. Domestic demand grew <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>prices</b> by almost 15% annually. It was supported by expansionary—procyclical—fiscal policy. Ukraine benefited from very low labor costs, slightly lower tariffs, and high prices of its main export goods, but at the same time faced notably higher non-tariff barriers. Russia does not charge Ukraine below world market prices for natural gas since the end of 2008; this led to various Russia-Ukraine gas disputes.|$|E
40|$|Structural {{decomposition}} techniques {{based on}} input-output table {{have become a}} widely used tool for analyzing long term economic growth. However, due to limitations of data, such techniques have never been applied to China's regional economies. Fortunately, in 2003, China's Interregional Input-Output Table for 1987 and Multi-regional Input-Output Table for 1997 were published, making decomposition analysis of China's regional economies possible. This paper first estimates the interregional input-output table <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>price</b> by using an alternative approach: the Grid-Search method, and then applies the standard input-output decomposition technique to China's regional economies for 1987 - 97. Based on the decomposition results, the contributions to output growth of different factors are summarized at the regional and industrial level. Furthermore, interdependence between China's regional economies is measured and explained by aggregating the decomposition factors into the intraregional multiplier-related effect, the feedback-related effect, and the spillover-related effect. Finally, the performance of China's industrial and regional development policies implemented in the 1990 s is briefly discussed based on the analytical results of the paper.

In Western Australia GSP per head was below the national mean until 1967 - 68 and above the national mean in subsequent years. The extent to which the GSP per head in the States differed from the national mean also showed considerable variability over the period. ...|$|R
