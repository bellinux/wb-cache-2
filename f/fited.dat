40|$|Person-environment (PE) <b>fit</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most pervasive concepts in psychology. This study presents an integrative investigation of three levels of PE fit: person-vocation (PV) <b>fit,</b> person-organization (PO) <b>fit,</b> and person-job (PJ) <b>fit,</b> using multiple conceptualizations (e. g., value congruence, needs-supplies <b>fit)</b> of each <b>fit</b> level. While a trend in the PE <b>fit</b> literature has been the inclusion of only one <b>fit</b> level with a single conceptualization, researchers call for the addition of multiple conceptualizations of multiple <b>fit</b> levels in a single study. Traditionally, PO <b>fit</b> has been conceptualized as value congruence, whereas PV <b>fit</b> has remained untouched in the literature investigating the direct measurement of <b>fit</b> perceptions. Therefore, new <b>fit</b> perceptions scales assessing PO <b>fit</b> using a needs-supplies <b>fit</b> conceptualization and PV <b>fit</b> using a variety of conceptualizations were introduced. To address the limitation of employing direct measures, common method variance was modeled with a positive affect factor. The study accomplished two objectives. First, a previously supported three-factor model of <b>fit</b> perceptions consisting of PO value congruence (PO-VC), PJ needs-supplies (PJ-NS), and PJ demands-abilities (PJ-DA) <b>fit</b> was strongly replicated. Second, this model was expanded by examining additional conceptualizations (needs-supplies, demands-abilities <b>fit,</b> value, personality, and interest congruence) of <b>fit</b> levels (PV, PO, and PJ <b>fit).</b> Results suggested that professionals make distinctions based on both the <b>fit</b> level and <b>fit</b> conceptualization and these <b>fit</b> perceptions uniquely influence their attitudes and behaviors. A six-factor model (PO-VC, PJ-NS, PJ-DA, PO needs-supplies <b>fit</b> [PO-NS], PV demands-abilities <b>fit</b> [PV-DA], and general PV <b>fit)</b> best <b>fit</b> the data. Providing ample evidence of construct validity, PO <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-VC and PO-NS <b>fit)</b> were related to the organization-focused outcome of organizational identification, whereas the profession-focused outcome of occupational commitment was exclusively predicted by PV <b>fit</b> perceptions (PV-DA and general PV <b>fit).</b> As expected, both needs-supplies <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-NS and PJ-NS <b>fit)</b> predicted intentions to quit and job satisfaction.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to {{illuminate}} the concept of <b>fit</b> in cause-related marketing (CRM) by proposing and testing a valenced model for CRM <b>fit.</b> The model was created based on an integration of extant CRM <b>fit</b> literature and theoretical frameworks. It distinguishes three general <b>fit</b> types (positive, neutral, negative) along the two dimensions of commonality and valence. Within the general <b>fit</b> categories, a further classification into nine sub-types of <b>fit</b> was suggested. In two studies it was shown that negative <b>fit,</b> compared to positive and neutral <b>fit,</b> constituted a <b>fit</b> type that was most difficult to interpret and classify {{in that it was}} seen as negative, positive, and also neutral <b>fit.</b> Commonality and valence ratings, together with <b>fit</b> categorizations, suggested a re-ordering of some <b>fit</b> categories, particularly natural theme, prevention, created theme, and general interest <b>fit.</b> In terms of CRM attitudes and purchase intentions, positive <b>fit</b> types were rated most favorable.

40|$|Fundamental {{understanding}} of the light-matter interaction {{in the context of}} nano-particles is immensely bene- <b>fited</b> by the study of geometry dependent tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) and has been demonstrated to have potential applications in various areas of science. The polarization characteristics of LSPR in addition to spectroscopic tuning can be suitably exploited in such systems as contrast enhancement mech- anisms and control parameters. Such polarization characteristics like diattenuation and retardance have been studied here using a novel combination of Muller-matrix polarimetry with the T-matrix matrix approach for silver nano-rods to show unprecedented control and sensitivity to local refractive index variations. The study carried out over various aspect ratios for a constant equal volume sphere radius shows the presence of longitu- dinal (dipolar and quadrupolar) and transverse (dipolar) resonances; arising due to differential contribution of polarizabilities in two directions. The overlap regions of these resonances and the resonances themselves exhibit enhanced retardance and diattenuation respectively. The spectral and amplitude tunability of these polarimetric parameters through the aspect ratios to span from the minimum to maximum ([0, 1] in the case of diattenuation and [0, π] in the case of retardance) presents a novel result {{that could be used to}} tailor systems for study of biological media. On the other hand, the high sensitivity of diattenuation dip (caused by equal contribution of polarizabilities) could be possibly used for medium characterization and bio-sensing or bio-imaging studies.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that gamma (γ) and ultraviolet (UV) rays are applicable to sterilize agricultural products for reducing storage losses. In practical application, D_ - and D_ -value in γand UV irradiation {{have been used as}} sterilization indices. However, our preliminary results showed that these survival curves were exponential having a shoulder at the beginning and a tailing at the end in many strains of molds. This suggests the difficulty in assessing a sterilization level accurately using these indices. The survival curves of several molds infecting agricultural products for γ irradiation were simulated by a multihit theory in molecular radiation biology. On the other hand, the effect of UV irradiation on the survival curves was simulated by a modified multihit theory considering the decrease in UV-intensity in liquid suspensions due to Lambert 2 ̆ 7 s law. It was found that the models based on a multihit theory well simulated the effects of γ and UV irradiation. Among molds tried in this study, the four hits model best <b>fited</b> to the observed data in both cases of Ascomycetes and Phycomycetes. These results demonstrated that D_ - and L-values, instead of conventional indices based on D_ -and D_ -values, should be used to assess the sterilization level accurately. To obtain more reliable measurement, a target area and a hit number, a parameter of penetration in UV- sterilization should be taken into considerations. 1) 藻菌類のRhizopusとMucorのγ線の生存曲線も子嚢菌類のAspergillusとPenicilliumや細菌と同様に肩を有する指数関数型となり, この生存曲線に標的論の 4 ヒットを適用すると数量的解析が可能なことを確認した. 2) 藻菌類, 子嚢菌類に紫外線を照射した生存曲線もまた肩を有する指数関数型となり, しかもテーリングを生じた. このような場合に対して材料に多ヒットを適用すると共に, 吸収率に関するLambert式を導入して懸濁液全体に対する積分式を導入した. この式によって菌濃度による紫外線強度の減衰係数をパラメータとしたシミュレーションを行うことにより, これらの生存曲線の数量的解析が可能となった. 3) γ線と紫外線殺菌のL値はD_ 値の少なくとも半分以上にもなり, 糸状菌の場合もL値がD_ 値に比べて無視できない値となることが示された. したがって, 農産物等にγ線や紫外線を照射して長期間の貯蔵を行う場合には従来のD_ 値やD_ 値のみを指標として用いる方法で殺菌に要する照射時聞を算出するよりもD_ 値とL値の併用がより有効であり, さらに, 基本的には標的面積, ヒット数, 紫外線では吸収率を考慮した数量的解析曲線を利用することの必要性を示した...|$|E

Also found data of this research were <b>fited</b> with Langmuir and Freundlich models, kinetic data with pseudo- first order, pseudo- second order and modifited pseudo- first order  models. "nResults: The results showed that with increasing of pH of solution, removal efficiency was decreased and optimum pH was found to be in the range of 5 to 7. Also removal efficiency of fluoride was increased with increasing of adsorbent dosage and decreasing of initial concentration of fluoride.

Kinetics of sorption of fluoride onto Activated alumina was well described by pseudo- second order model. "nConclusion: The concentration of Activated Alumina had significant effect on the reduction of fluoride ions concentration in water. The higher fluoride removals were observed for batch experiments at pH= 5 because no free fluoride ion is present in the solutions, and it could be casued by electrostatic interactions between the surface of alumina and the dominant fluoride species in solution The kinetic model can adequately describe the removal behaviors of fluoride ion by alumina adsorption in the batch system...|$|E
