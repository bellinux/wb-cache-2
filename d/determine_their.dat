5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> identities.|$|E

In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> mass.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

5|$|His {{policies}} and tactics highlighted {{and increased the}} separation between the king and his subjects. Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. He made a demonstration of royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy (talismans), previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends, restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative. The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, 15 {{conservative}} Episcopal churches {{voted to}} split from the Diocese of Virginia over {{the ordination of}} openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided {{in favor of the}} mainline diocese, was a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to <b>determine</b> <b>their</b> relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
