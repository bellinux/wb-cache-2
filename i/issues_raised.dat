5|$|Criticism must {{generally}} {{be expressed in}} a temperate and dispassionate manner. This allows rational debate about the <b>issues</b> <b>raised,</b> and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> on appeal was that the defendants' {{political}} advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|Due to the overshadowing {{issue of}} the Soviet vs. U.S. Space Race, the ethical <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by this {{experiment}} went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show, the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while the health and retrieval—or lack thereof—of Laika only became an issue later.|$|E

5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by The Da Vinci Code and other critics.|$|E
5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|Gierek government's growing {{difficulties}} led also {{to increased}} {{dependence on the}} Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The constitution, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after protests by intellectuals and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier {{and replacing it with}} other tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the legal}} <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by {{geothermal}} energy resources include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource, the grant of exploration permits, exploitation rights, royalties, {{and the extent to}} which geothermal energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws. Other questions concern overlap between geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development.|$|E
5|$|The all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, re-established in December 2002, was {{conducting}} {{a review of}} the entire Constitution. In October 2004, it invited submissions on the Articles related to the family. Chairman Denis O'Donovan stated that it was examining these Articles to ascertain {{the extent to which they}} are serving the good of individuals and the community, with a view to deciding whether changes in them would bring about a greater balance between the two. Among the many <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by the committee were the definition of the family and the rights of same-sex couples to marry.|$|E

5|$|The six {{judges of}} the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled {{unanimously}} that all <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by Abu-Jamal, including {{the claim of}} ineffective assistance of counsel, were without merit. The Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for certiorari against that decision on October 4, 1999, enabling Ridge to sign a second death warrant on October 13, 1999. Its execution in turn was stayed as Abu-Jamal commenced his pursuit of federal habeas corpus review.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened {{to ruin the}} Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{work for}} Xenosaga Episode III began during the later {{development}} of Xenosaga Episode II in 2004. The development team's {{aim was to}} address <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by fans and staff with the previous two Xenosaga games, along with bringing the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Due to the decision to turn the intended six-part series into a trilogy, the original draft for Episode III was substantially reworked. As with previous Xenosaga titles, the subtitle was drawn {{from the work of}} German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. While the game was praised by critics and went on to sell over 340,000 copies worldwide, the mixed response to the Xenosaga series as a whole left Monolith Soft staff in a state of low morale, partially leading to the development of Xenoblade Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{original}} announcement, {{release of information}} became sporadic, leading to video game journalists labeling it as vaporware and eventually to rumors of its cancellation. After its public rebranding in 2013, the silence continued until its appearance at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show, at which point development and progress information was released on a regular basis. A demo for the game, Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae, was released in March 2015 with first print copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. Promotion for the title was effectively restarted at the 2015 Gamescom. Its release was delayed due to polishing work and the wish for a simultaneous worldwide release, something no other mainline Final Fantasy title had managed to accomplish. Cosmetic, gameplay and story-based downloadable content were developed following the game's release to fix <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by players and expand upon the base game.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{published}} a book of short stories, The Voice of the Dolphins (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by the Cold War and his own {{role in the development}} of atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Benefits Street was aired at 9:00 pm on Monday 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. A live one-hour debate to discuss <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by the series was then {{scheduled}} to air after the final episode, Channel 4 announcing plans for this {{a few days after}} the second episode had been transmitted. During the week following the broadcasting of the third episode, West Midlands Police charged several James Turner Street residents with drugs-related offences in connection with a raid their officers had carried out in June 2013. Those facing charges included some people seen in episodes of the series. Channel 4 said they had no plans to alter any footage from the episodes yet to be transmitted.|$|E
5|$|War {{film is a}} film genre {{concerned}} with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.|$|E
5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 {{called for the}} port to be {{transformed}} into a container port, which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two <b>issues</b> <b>raised</b> were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing. The port received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E
