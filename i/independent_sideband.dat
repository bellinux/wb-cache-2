Design criteria for the transformer are presented and the experimental results are discussed for a typical voice-band channel having a nominal bandwidth of 300 to 3500 Hz.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a dipolar-chemical shift correlation technique for sign-sensitive {{determination of the}} torsion angle f in solid peptides and proteins under magic-angle spinning. The indirect dimension of the experiment is obtained by separate but synchro-nous evolution of the magnetization under the 15 N chemical shift and the C-H dipolar coupling. The resulting sum and difference spectrum of the two frequencies, with more than ten <b>independent</b> <b>sidebands,</b> depends strongly on the relative orientation of the 15 N chemical shift tensor and the Ca-Ha bond. This relative orienta-tion reflects the C(O) i 21 -N-C a-C(O) i torsion angle. The technique can distinguish f angles over {{the full range of}} 360 ° when the amide 15 N chemical shift tensor does not possess reflection sym-metry with respect to the peptide plane. Thus it complements our previous HNCH experiment, in which two mirror-symmetric con-formers of the HN-N bond relative to the Ca-Ha bond around the N-Ca axis cannot be distinguished. © 1998 Academic Pres...|$|R

50|$|AM stereo {{is a term}} {{given to}} a series of {{mutually}} incompatible techniques for radio broadcasting stereo audio in the AM band {{in a manner that is}} compatible with standard AM receivers. There are two main classes of systems: <b>independent</b> <b>sideband</b> (ISB) systems, promoted principally by American broadcast engineer Leonard R. Kahn; and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) multiplexing systems (conceptually closer to FM stereo).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>{{sideband}}</b> (ISB) is an AM {{single sideband}} mode {{which is used}} with some AM radio transmissions. Normally each sideband carries identical information, but ISB modulates two different input signals [...] - [...] one on the upper sideband, {{the other on the}} lower sideband. This is used in some kinds of AM stereo (sometimes known as the Kahn system), but is generally otherwise prohibited in the U.S. by the FCC.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{spurred by the}} exodus of musical {{programming}} to FM stations, the AM radio industry in the United States developed technology for broadcasting in stereo. (FM broadcasting in the United States adopted a common stereo standard in 1961.) The effort was challenging due {{to the need to}} limit the transmissions to a 20 kHz bandwidth, while also making the transmissions backward compatible with existing non-stereo receivers. In 1975 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requested proposals for AM stereo standards, and four competing standards were submitted: Harris Corporation's V-CPM (Variable angle Compatible Phase Multiplex), Magnavox's PMX, Motorola's C-QUAM (Compatible Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), and Kahn-Hazeltine <b>independent</b> <b>sideband</b> system." [...] All except the Kahn-Hazeltine system used variations on the same idea: the mono (Left + Right) signal was transmitted in the amplitude modulation as before, while the stereo (Left — Right) information was transmitted by phase modulation.|$|E
