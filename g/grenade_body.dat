50|$|However, the Type 91, as well {{as other}} Japanese hand grenades {{suffered}} from faults in manufacturing and production of the fuse, <b>grenade</b> <b>body,</b> and explosive compound, resulting in inconsistent detonation, variable fuse burning times, and incomplete or variable fragmentation of the <b>grenade</b> <b>body.</b> During the war, these manufacturing issues remained unresolved.|$|E
50|$|The No. 5 Mk. 1 was {{the first}} version. The {{explosive}} was filled through a small circular plug on the upper half, the detonator assembly was inserted into the centertube of the mills through {{the bottom of the}} <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> via the baseplug, the striker and spring is held in tension through the middle by the lever that was held down on the lugs (ears) located {{on the top of the}} <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> via a split pin and ring called the safety pin/ pullring. It was first issued in May 1915 and entered general issue when mass production caught up a year later in 1916.|$|E
50|$|Predecessors to the M68, these impact fuzed grenades {{used the}} M33 <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> fitted with the M217 impact fuze, without a safety clip {{on the safety}} lever, and are marked {{in a similar manner}} to the M68.|$|E
50|$|Fragmentation is {{enhanced}} by a special pre-notched fragmentation coil that lies along {{the inside of the}} <b>grenade's</b> <b>body.</b> This coil had a circular cross-section in the M26 grenade and an improved square cross-section in the M26A1 and later designs.|$|R
50|$|When {{the war had}} ended, many of the grenades {{had become}} dangerous, due to {{corroding}} of the inferior tin plate steel used {{in the manufacture of}} the <b>grenade</b> <b>bodies.</b> In 1948 the grenade was determined to be obsolete and all were destroyed to minimize the danger they could have caused.|$|R
50|$|The SNES version {{included}} cheat {{codes that}} are accessed by pausing {{the game with}} the start button, and then followed by a sequence of button presses to acquire a particular power up, or skip to the next level. The accessible power ups are: shotgun, magnum pistol, full health, extra life, hand <b>grenades,</b> freeze <b>grenades,</b> <b>body</b> armor, and flame grenades.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the soldier}} throws the grenade, the safety lever releases, the striker throws the safety lever {{away from the}} <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> as it rotates to {{detonate}} the primer. The primer explodes and ignites the fuse (sometimes called the delay element). The fuse burns down to the detonator, which explodes the main charge.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the XM47 series, {{which is in the}} {{following}} section, the XM48 is a skittering type smoke grenade: the filler is burned internally and vented through ports in the <b>grenade</b> <b>body,</b> making the grenade spin erratically. The XM48 series burns an unknown filler for a red-colored smoke, probably WP or HC based, and is not known to be standardized.|$|E

500|$|In Liew Sai Wah v. Public Prosecutor (1968), the {{appellant}} {{was arrested}} at the Singapore train station for having six <b>grenade</b> <b>bodies</b> in his bag. He was charged and found guilty of possession of ammunition by the High Court, and sentenced to death. The conviction was upheld by the Federal Court of Malaysia (then part of Singapore's court hierarchy). However, on further appeal to the Privy Council, their Lordships held that <b>grenade</b> <b>bodies</b> did not come within the term ammunition, which was defined as [...] "ammunition for any fire-arm as hereafter defined and includes grenades, bombs and other like missiles whether capable of use with such a fire-arm or not and any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to contain any noxious liquid, gas or other thing". Counsel for the Public Prosecutor suggested that <b>grenade</b> <b>bodies</b> might fall within the definition of explosive, which includes [...] "any material for making an explosive and any apparatus, machine, implement or material used or intended to be used or adapted for causing or aiding in causing any explosion in or with any explosive, and any part of any such apparatus, machine or implement". However, the Privy Council declined to allow this submission as it involved the presentation of a case completely different {{to the one that}} the appellant was required to meet during his trial and the appeal before the Federal Court. The appellant was therefore acquitted.|$|R
50|$|The URG-N is a {{reusable}} {{training model}} of the RGD-5 of cast iron construction (rather than sheet steel) and a modified fuze containing a tiny explosive charge which simulates the detonation of the <b>grenade.</b> The <b>body</b> of this <b>grenade</b> is painted black with white markings.|$|R
50|$|The Type 99 {{hand grenade}} could either be thrown by hand or {{fired from a}} Type 100 grenade discharger. Unlike the earlier Type 91 or Type 97 <b>grenades,</b> the <b>body</b> was not segmented, but was smooth and flanged on both ends. It was also {{slightly}} smaller in diameter than the Type 91.|$|R
50|$|The M67 can {{be thrown}} 30 to 35 m {{by the average}} male soldier. Its fuze delays {{detonation}} between 4 and 5 seconds after the spoon is released. Steel fragments (not {{to be confused with}} shrapnel) are provided by the <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> and produce an injury radius of 15 m, with a fatality radius of 5 m, though some fragments can disperse as far out as 250 m.|$|E
50|$|Practice grenades {{are similar}} in {{handling}} and function to other hand grenades, except that they only produce a loud popping noise and {{a puff of smoke}} on detonation. The <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> can be reused. Another type is the throwing practice grenade which is completely inert and often cast in one piece. It is used to give soldiers a feel for the weight and shape of real grenades and for practicing precision throwing.|$|E
50|$|A {{rubber ball}} riot control grenade, the XM47 series {{are known as}} skittering grenades, as the gas is burned {{internally}} and vented through ports in the <b>grenade</b> <b>body,</b> in effect making the grenade spin erratically. This is designed {{to make it harder}} for the target or targets to retrieve and throw back the grenade. The XM47E3 is filled with CS, but information on the other variants is scarce. It is probably safe to assume that at least one is filled with CN, and then others might have the filler in different solid forms. The XM47E3 was the standardized as the M47.|$|E

50|$|The M15 {{is a white}} {{phosphorus}} smoke grenade, nicknamed Willie Peter or Willie Pete (for {{white phosphorus}}), used for screening and signaling purposes. It is cylindrical, but with rounded edges compared {{to those of the}} M8. WP has many of the same properties of HC, and is also burned to create the effect, giving the M15 a similar incendiary capability. The M16 was a version of the grenade, featuring a number of colors. The M16 was originally available in green, orange, red, violet, yellow, black and blue smoke versions, later reduced to red, yellow, green, and violet. The M34 grenade was a variant of the M15 designed to be usable as a rifle grenade using the M2 series of grenade launching adapters, and was ribbed to give the fins better grip on the <b>grenade</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{death and}} woundings took place {{due to the}} direct blast or blast {{reflection}} and the primary and secondary fragmentation effect. In addition to the fragmentation/shrapnel effect, broken windows and concerete etc. are the causes for severely wounding and deaths too. The shrapnels from the <b>grenade</b> <b>body</b> and the secondary fragments from environment travel at air by the effect of detonation blast and give fatal damages. Glass causes many of the secondary blast injuries (up to 50 % of all blast injuries). Victims that are peppered with glass are often difficult to distinguish from victims that are peppered with glass and have penetrating injuries (White et al., 2008; Wong et al., 1997).|$|E
5000|$|The Mk 2 grenade {{replaced}} the failed Mk 1 grenade {{used by the}} U.S. military during World War I. 44 million were ordered and over 21 million were completed (it was possible to convert Mk 1 <b>grenade</b> <b>bodies</b> to the Mk 2 configuration) before the war ended, but few reached American troops overseas. It was formally standardized in 1920. The Mk 2, like the Mk 1, was manufactured of cast iron with a grooved surface divided into 40 knobs in 5 rows of 8 columns. This was to enhance fragmentation (in practice, {{it was found that}} the grooves did not enhance fragmentation as much as desired) and provide a better grip when handling and throwing the grenade. The grooves and knobs gave it the appearance of a pineapple, and are the origin of that nickname. It was also commonly referred to as a [...] "frag" [...] grenade, in contrast to other types of grenades such as the Mk 3 grenade concussion grenade ...|$|R

50|$|The Model 17 Eierhandgranate ("Egg grenade") {{is a small}} {{defensive}} and offensive hand grenade which was used by Germany during World War I. The average soldier could throw it 40 meters or farther. It was more portable than the heavier Kugelhandgranate and less awkward to handle than the Stick <b>grenade.</b> The <b>body</b> of the <b>grenade</b> was initially smooth and thus difficult to hold so the design was modified {{with the addition of}} a raised band to provide better grip.|$|R
