40|$|The {{wireless}} communications arena {{consists of a}} wide range of products and services, each with a specific target market and approach. Having characteristic advantages and disadvantages, all attempt to increase their market share through diversification and innovation. Ultra wideband (UWB) is a recent entry into the commercial short-range communications world, differentiated by its sparse spectral profile and low peak power emissions. Being unlicensed and capable of operating simultaneously with conventional communication systems, it has seen considerable attention by both industry and academia. This thesis explores diversification improvements available for UWB systems, explicitly through orthogonal user multiplexing schemes, channel equalization, and forward error correction. A review of this communication method is presented, considering its technical evolution and standardization. Multi-user sequencing is researched with regard to a time hopped UWB architecture. The successful adoption of UWB into commercial devices greatly depends upon the development of efficient user access mechanisms. A comparative analysis of varied time, frequency, and direct sequence hopping codes is presented in terms of their performance, diversity, and computational requirements. It is shown that for low user utilization levels, short periodicity deterministic codes attain a similar performance to randomly generated sequences. However, within a fully utilized system deterministic codes slightly out-perform short length random sequences. The application of multiplexing codes to UWB chip level interleaving is also examined. Interleaver performance is compared when designed through long length random codes versus design through deterministic hopping sequences, exemplifying similarities between the approaches. A unique approach to sequence analysis is introduced, developing a set of state probabilities for pulse separations generated by each multiplexing code. Providing insight into optimal code design procedures, this separation profile is employed in the closed-form derivation of intersymbol and multi-user interference expressions. These formulations adopt a transmitter-side equalization process, with comparisons against a receiver-side approach presented. Derivations are based upon an analysis of transmission overlaps, together with the probabilities of each overlap. A close alignment against a simulated UWB system is evident for varied system parameters, exemplifying numerous properties of each <b>equalization</b> <b>measure.</b> Despite diversification efforts to improve communication procedures, data errors are an unavoidable consequence of operation across a wireless medium. Forward error correction is researched within this dissertation for both binary and a non-binary encoding. Utilizing a transmitter-side equalization scheme, conventional binary turbo decoding is considered at the binary data level. Also, non-binary turbo decoding is applied to combine data encoding and user multiplexing stages. This latter method presents an innovative means of time hopping code generation. A comparative analysis of each technique against a simulated performance is given for both single- and multi-user scenarios, together with observations on the multi-user interference effects of signals employing forward error correction. A performance improvement for scarcely populated systems was evident, although a binary turbo scheme is shown to achieve optimal performance in high traffic systems. The mapping scheme required for non-binary encoding is evaluated in terms of random generation and design through deterministic coding schemes. Truncated orthogonal codes are shown to achieve a performance gain for higher turbo iteration levels, also having the advantage of simpler design. Wireless communications are inherently subject to numerous signal degradations. With its revolutionary and unlicensed communication approach, UWB has emerged as a formidable contender in the wireless arena. Having an array of error mitigation techniques, including orthogonal user multiplexing, channel equalization, and advanced error correction, it prevails as a high rate and low power consuming system for the modern world of telecommunications...|$|E

However, {{although some of the}} diffusion studies have examined cross-country diffusion processes, {{there is a lack of}} research investigating how the disparity of diffusion processes of a given set of countries has evolved. The aim of this study is to empirically measure, whether the diffusion of mobile communications in the European Union has converged or diverged. In this study, this process is quantified by penetration rates of mobile communications subscribers. Subsequently, the annual dispersion is captured by appliance of inequality measures: It is first depicted by Lorenz curves and subsequently measured by GINI coefficients.

40|$|Academic work on Brazil {{has long}} underscored the state's shortcomings. Past {{scholarship}} portrayed a state beset by patronage, held captive to elite interests and mired in inefficiencies that impeded the basic practice of governance. The literature on Brazilian urbanism depicted {{the state as}} particularly deficient. State interaction with favelas, disadvantaged communities common throughout the country's cities, demonstrated state-society relations at their most fraught. The state alternatively neglected favelas, failing to extend to them same services and rights that the formal city enjoyed; abused them, destroying communities through violent demolition campaigns, sanctioning police brutality and colluding with drug traffickers; or exploited them for political gain through clientelistic networks. In the wake of democracy's return to Brazil there are many indications of substantial changes to state capacity. These advances demand a re-evaluation of state-society relations and an interrogation of the continued utility of past theoretical frameworks. Through {{a case study of}} Rio de Janeiro, this dissertation explores the ramifications of the re-emergence of state sponsored welfare for disadvantaged urban communities. I examine how relationships among the state, favela residents and drug traffickers change with the proliferation of new <b>equalization</b> <b>measures.</b> Through quantitative, geographic and qualitative analyses, my data reveal impressive gains in the scale and reach of recent social policies. New connections linking the Brazilian state with favela residents have emerged. Each conceptualizes and interacts with the other in novel ways. Such achievements, however, are accompanied with the notable cost of further complicating the state's relationship with drug trafficking. Nevertheless, these developments underscore the need to cease privileging deficit perspectives when analyzing the Brazilian state. The recent social policies reflect a newly re-invigorated beneficent dimension of the Brazilian state, one that warrants closer scrutiny...|$|R

40|$|On-board {{joint power}} {{amplification}} of multiple-carrier DVB-S 2 signals using a single High-Power Amplifier (HPA) is an emerging configuration {{that aims to}} reduce flight hardware and weight. However, effects specific to such a scenario degrade power and spectral efficiencies with increased Adjacent Channel Interference caused by non-linear characteristic of the HPA and power efficiency loss due to the increased Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The paper studies signal processing techniques that counteract for both aspects enabling efficient multicarrier on board amplification. Digital pre-distortion (DPD) at the gateway and equalization (EQ) at the User Terminal are the designed avenues of attack to mitigate the non-linear effects and improve power as well as spectral efficiencies. This paper builds on our initial work in Ref. 1 that performed a survey on the adaptability of various compensation techniques to the considered scenario and short-listed the most favourable ones.

The structure is of second order and implements two transmission zeros and two reflection zeros {{in the frequency}} response of the filter.

A modification of the original structure is introduced to allow an additional direct coupling between the source and the load.

In this way, small modifications in the basic structure allow to obtain band-pass or band-stop responses.

40|$|Outside the United States, fiscal equity is {{a common}} {{explicit}} objective for intergovernmental transfers at the central and regional levels, with transfers often having specific equalization targets. In contrast, the United States {{does not have a}} comprehensive federal transfer scheme for explicit fiscal equalization but rather employs an array of categorical and block grants, some of which are formula-based while others are project-driven. However, the allocation of many of these grants has equalization effects resulting in the narrowing of fiscal disparities among jurisdictions. Indeed, almost half of federal grants in the United States are allocated to healthcare and another quarter to income security programs. In addition, the largest category of state grants is allocated to school districts using formulae similar to those used in other countries for fiscal equalization by the central government, including the measurement of fiscal capacity and expenditure needs. Few studies have attempted to quantify the extent of equalization achieved with federal and state grants in a manner that would allow comparisons across states and over time. While recently several important studies have been published on fiscal inequities between and within states (e. g., Murray et al., AER 1998), their focus has been narrowed to school districts. In this study we set out to take this literature further by measuring the extent of equalization across local governments in the United States that is implicit in the federal grants system and more explicit in the grants implemented by the individual states. Rather than focusing on specific types of local services, we look at the evolution of per capita resources available to all types of local governments combined. The extent of <b>equalization</b> is <b>measured</b> by the ratio of inequality indices before and after the allocation of grants, following the methodology used in Martinez-Vazquez and Timofeev (JCE 2008). We find that, on average, state grants tend to considerably reduce the within-state inequality but tend to slightly increase the between-state inequality. States showing more equalization are those with less socio-political fractionalization, higher income inequality, less decentralization of revenue, and court-ordered reforms of school financing. The equalizing impact of direct federal grants to local governments has fluctuated over time but all in all it has been much smaller than that of the state grants. Overall, federal grants tend to slightly reduce the between-state inequality but slightly increase the within-state inequality. Because the within-state disparities in own-source revenues have become dominant, the overall level of inequality across local jurisdictions has tended to increase with the allocation of federal grants. ...|$|R
