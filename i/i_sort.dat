[...] Lennon later said the composition [...] "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song.

[...] When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind [...] "Imagine".|$|E

500|$|Eckhart first gained wide {{exposure}} in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh's drama Erin Brockovich. The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, but every day I was reading scripts, I was producing my own material, I was taking meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E

They were such pros – they had all these scenes with Steve Carell and they were completely unafraid. They got along effortlessly." [...] Kaling injected elements of Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice into her character's relationship with Ryan, with her parents attempting to persuade her to date an Indian doctor. She remarked, [...] "Kelly's family has, like, nine daughters, and if only they could marry them off it would be wonderful. But Kelly is {{the oldest and most}} idiotic of them all." ...|$|E

He came down, rewrote the scene, and before {{he got back to}} his plane <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of grabbed him and said, 'And this scene and this scene?' And he rewrote two other scenes that I thought had problems." [...] In October 2013, Tony Curran tweeted that he would be portraying Odin's father, Bor, in a flashback sequence. In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the [...] "Loki trilogy", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout Thor, The Avengers and this film.

500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected."

500|$|The album's {{production}} expanded on that of The Chronic, with new, sparse {{beats and}} reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: [...] "At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized {{me as the}} nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [...] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine." [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Time has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating [...] "Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine {{in a room full}} of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound." ...|$|E
500|$|AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw wrote, [...] "The whole storyline {{with the}} creepy dual-personality doc and the mind-control-dreams was good, though <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of knew the doc must be {{involved}} from the beginning.

Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly believed that [...] "in some ways, {{this was one of}} the less-distinctive, more X-Files-ish episodes of Fringe on Thursday night... But as usual, there was another narrative layer at work here" [...] involving a grieving Olivia. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.4/10, explaining the case-of-the-week failed to have [...] "excitement, surprise, and suspense" [...] and lacked [...] "what makes a typical Fringe episode unique and intriguing". While calling certain parts [...] "kind of boring", Isler did however praise the episode's directing, acting, sets, and other technical aspects. He concluded his review by noting the best part of [...] "Dream Logic" [...] was the ending depicting a young Peter, [...] "It's a haunting scene, and it adds yet another stone in this long pathway to revelation that the Fringe team is building up to... But besides that great little scene at the end, I thought this was an average episode. Granted, Fringes 'average' episodes are still better than a lot of the other stuff on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|After his co-stars Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller, Jan Hooks and Dana Carvey had left, Hartman {{said he felt}} [...] "like {{an athlete}} who's watched all his World Series {{teammates}} get traded off into other directions [...] It was hard to watch them leave because <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of felt we were {{all part of the}} team that saved the show." [...] This cast turnover contributed to his leaving the show in 1994. Hartman had originally planned to leave the show in 1991, but Michaels convinced him to stay to raise his profile; his portrayal of Clinton contributed to this goal. Jay Leno offered him the role of his sidekick on The Tonight Show but Hartman opted to stay on SNL. NBC persuaded him to stay on SNL by promising him his own comedy–variety show entitled The Phil Show. He planned to [...] "reinvent the variety form" [...] with [...] "a hybrid, very fast-paced, high energy [...] with sketches, impersonations, pet acts, and performers showcasing their talents". Hartman was to be the show's executive producer and head writer. Before production began, however, the network decided that variety shows were too unpopular and scrapped the series. In a 1996 interview, Hartman noted he was glad the show had been scrapped, as he [...] "would've been sweatin' blood each week trying to make it work". In 1998, he admitted he missed working on SNL, but had enjoyed the move from New York City to Southern California.|$|E

During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are."
