40|$|Nowadays, {{the focus}} of {{industries}} is changed from efficiency of workers to efficiency of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> Thus, the performance appraisal process of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> is important. A basic drawback of previous methods for performance evaluation is their biased results due to influence of rater's personal motivations. In this study, by developing a Result Base Method (RBM) approach, the criteria of performance appraisal of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> in outsourcing conditions is identified in Hedayat-e-Farhikhtegan-e-Javan Institution (HFJ). Different models of data envelopment analysis (DEA) are validated on 25 <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> working at {{the research and development}} department at the institution. The DEA was able to classify <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> into efficient and inefficient ones. Based on project career development plans, a set of efficient <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> was used to establish an internal best practice benchmark for improving the performance of other inefficient <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> The findings show that 4 <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> are efficient.

40|$|ORIENTATION: Organisations {{are still}} {{structured}} {{according to the}} Industrial Age control model that restricts optimising the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> RESEARCH PURPOSE: The general {{aim of the research}} was to explore the organisation design elements and competencies that contribute to optimising the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> in a shared services centre. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: Current organisational design methodologies do not emphasise optimising the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> This research addresses the challenge of how an organisation design can improve the creation and availability of the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN/APPROACH METHOD: The researcher followed a qualitative case study research design and collected data in six focus group sessions (N = 25). MAIN FINDINGS: The findings showed that the shared services centre (SSC) is not designed to enable its structure, culture and codifying system to optimise the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> In addition, the SSC does not share the knowledge generated with other <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> Furthermore, it does not use the output of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> to improve business processes. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: The expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> is the basis of competitive advantage. Therefore, managers should create an organisational design that is conducive to optimising knowledge work expertise. CONTRIBUTION/VALUE ADD: This research highlights the important organisational design elements and supportive organisational structures for optimising the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers.</b> The research also proposes a framework for optimising the expertise of <b>knowledge</b> <b>workers</b> and helping an organisation to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.
