In particular, Ephrin-B2 and EphB4 determine the arterial and venous fate of endothelial cells, respectively, though regulation of angiogenesis by mitigating {{expression in the}} VEGF signalling pathway. [...] Ephrin-B2 affects VEGF-receptors (e.g.VEGFR3) through forward and reverse signalling pathways. The Epherin-B2 path extends to lymphangiogenesis, leading to internalization of VEGFR3 in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells. Though the role of ephrins in developmental angiogenesis is elucidated, tumor angiogenesis remains nebulous. Based on observations in Ephrin-A2 deficient mice, Ephrin-A2 may function in <b>forward</b> <b>signalling</b> in tumor angiogenesis; however, this ephrin does not contribute to vascular deformities during development. Moreover, Ephrin-B2 and EphB4 may also contribute to tumor angiogenesis {{in addition to their}} positions in development, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. The Ephrin B2/EphB4 and Ephrin B3/EphB1 receptor pairs contribute more to vasculogenesis in addition to angiogenesis whilst Ephrin A1/EphA2 appear to exclusively contribute to angiogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|Firing trials {{revealed}} that the blast of 'A' and 'B' turrets on forward bearings caused damage to many weather-deck fittings and conditions on the mess-decks became very uncomfortable. When 'X' turret was fired 30 degrees abaft the beam and elevation of 40 degrees, considerable damage occurred to the vertically stacked two rows of bridge windows. As a result, the guns of [...] "X" [...] turret were usually prohibited from firing abaft of the beam at high elevations during peacetime practice firing. Fitting tempered glass in the bridge windows was tried, but gun blast still shattered some of them and filled the bridge with flying debris. The design of the Captain's bridge was altered on Nelson circa 1930-33 to reduce the window area and enclose the upper portion of the previous two rows of glass. A great deal of effort was expended in correcting this problem, and fitting of protective ledges below the new smaller windows proved successful. A new enclosed Admiral's bridge with its requisite reduced windows was built {{on top of the}} Captain's bridge and the <b>forward</b> <b>signalling</b> lamps were moved up one level and towards the aft of the bridge. The Admiral's bridge on Rodney remained stepped back somewhat from the forward edge of the tower, but the Captain's bridge had the same reduced area of glass that Nelson now had, with larger ledges. Blast was also a problem elsewhere; D.K. Brown tells of a test firing that was suspended when DNC observer H.S. Pengelly, who was beneath the foredeck, reported a bright red flash after firing all guns in [...] "A" [...] turret.

40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP), a major cellular correlate {{of memory}} storage, depends on {{activation of the}} ERK/MAPK signalling pathway, but the cell type-specific localization of activated MAPKs remains unknown. We found that in the CM field of the hippocampus, shortly after LTP induction, {{an increase in the}} number of MAPK-positive cells occurred specifically among astrocytes of the stratum radiatum, suggesting a putative role of astrocytes for LTP. Desipramine (DMI) is an antidepressant which is used to treat major depressive disorder, but also other pathologies such as neuropathic pain or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants such as DMI may cause memory impairment as a side effect. However, biological underpinnings of this effect still remain unclear. Here, we show that DMI inhibited the astrocytic MAPK activation and thereby hindered synaptic potentiation. These effects correlated with a reduced neuronal activation in the stratum pyramidale, thereby prompting us to analyse a regulator of LTP located at the astrocyte-neuron interface in the stratum radiatum, namely the ephrinA 3 /EphA 4 signalling pathway. DMI enhanced EphA 4 clustering, which favoured an increased ephrinA 3 -mediated EphA 4 phosphorylation and elevated EphA 4 <b>forward</b> <b>signalling.</b> The co-administration of DMI with the Src inhibitor SU 6656, which blocks EphA 4 <b>forward</b> <b>signalling,</b> could partially reverse the LTP attenuation, further supporting the targeting of the ephrinA 3 /EphA 4 pathway by DMI. Thus, our findings suggest a putative novel mechanism for DMI to modulate LTP through the regulation of the ephrinA 3 /EphA 4 signalling pathway. A further exploration of the molecular and behavioral consequences of targeting ephrinA 3 /EphA 4 might help to improve the clinical use of DMI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Diffuse {{invasion of the}} brain parenchyma, including along preexisting blood vessels, is {{a leading cause of}} therapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that ephrin-B 2 mediates GSC perivascular invasion. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in murine GBM models and patient-derived GSC, revealed that endothelial ephrin-B 2 compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells. In contrast, upregulation of the same ephrin-B 2 ligand in GSC enabled perivascular migration through homotypic <b>forward</b> <b>signalling.</b> Surprisingly, ephrin-B 2 reverse signalling also promoted tumourigenesis cell-autonomously, by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis via RhoA. In human GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts, EFNB 2 knock-down blocked tumour initiation and treatment of established tumours with ephrin-B 2 -blocking antibodies suppressed progression. Thus, our results indicate that targeting ephrin-B 2 may be an effective strategy for the simultaneous inhibition of invasion and proliferation in GBM.

Here {{we report that}} complementary expression of ephrin-A 5 in hair cells and EphA 4 receptor among spiral ganglion neuron populations controls the targeting of type I and type II afferent fibres to inner and outer hair cells, respectively. In the absence of ephrin-A 5 or EphA 4 <b>forward</b> <b>signalling,</b> a subset of type I projections aberrantly overshoot the inner hair cell layer and invade the outer hair cell area. Lack of type I afferent synapses impairs neurotransmission from inner hair cells to the auditory nerve.

Within these islets, communication between β cells inhibits basal insulin secretion and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thus contributing to glucose homeostasis during fasting and feeding. In {{the search for}} the underlying molecular mechanism, we have discovered that β cells communicate via ephrin-As and EphAs. We provide evidence that ephrin-A 5 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We further show that EphA-ephrin-A-mediated β cell communication is bidirectional: EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> inhibits insulin secretion, whereas ephrin-A reverse signaling stimulates insulin secretion. EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> is downregulated in response to glucose, which indicates that, under basal conditions, β cells use EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> to suppress insulin secretion and that, under stimulatory conditions, they shift to ephrin-A reverse signaling to enhance insulin secretion. Thus, we explain how β cell communication in pancreatic islets conversely affects basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to improve glucose homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|Human adult {{dental pulp}} cells (DPSC) reside within the {{perivascular}} niche of dental pulp and {{are thought to}} originate from migrating cranial neural crest (CNC) cells. During development, CNC cells respond to the environmental cues to migrate and differentiate into the different cell types {{that contribute to the}} formation of craniofacial structures and the peripheral nervous system. The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrin molecules, play an essential role in the migration of neural crest cells during development and postnatal stem cell (SC) niche maintenance. "The present study demonstrated multiple Eph receptors expressed primarily on DPSC within the perivascular niche, while the surrounding pulp tissue expressed ephrin-B ligands. EphB/ephrin-B bi-directional signalling inhibited DPSC attachment and spreading, while DPSC migration was restricted through uni-directional ephrin-B 1 activated EphB <b>forward</b> <b>signalling</b> in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that ephrin-B was down-regulated in diseased adult teeth compared to paired uninjured controls.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are {{the most}} {{aggressive}} and devastating tumours {{of the brain and}} are essentially incurable. They are defined by diffuse invasion of the surrounding brain parenchyma along preexisting structures like the vasculature. Glioma stem cells (GSC) are thought to be largely responsible for tumour recurrence following treatment due to their high resistance to therapy, their ability to recapitulate tumours from single cells and their marked invasive potential. Here we show, that normal neural stem cell in the subventricular zone are compartmentalised by endothelial ephrinB 2 and their proliferation limited through activation of p 53 in an Eph signalling dependent manner. GSCs however evade both compartmentalisation and proliferation inhibition and are able to invade perivascularly. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that upregulation of ephrinB 2 in highly aggressive, mesenchymal GSCs enables escape from endothelial compartmentalisation through homotypic <b>forward</b> <b>signalling.</b> Surprisingly we also find that that ephrinB 2 reverse signalling promotes tumourigenesis by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis through activation of RhoA. In preclinical models using human GSCs we show, that inhibition of ephrinB 2 by RNA silencing or with ephrinB 2 -blocking antibodies strongly suppresses tumourigenesis of established glioblastoma by inducing cell-cycle arrest and blocking GBM/vascular interactions. Thus, ephrinB 2 is an oncogene and represents an attractive candidate for anti-GBM therapies aimed at eradicating the GSC compartment by targeting both glioma invasion and proliferation.

40|$|International audienceAcute kidney injury (AKI) {{is common}} in hospitalized {{patients}} and has a poor prognosis, the severity of AKI being linked to progression to chronic kidney disease. This stresses the need to search for protective mechanisms during the acute phase. We investigated kidney repair after hypoxic injury using a rat model of renal artery branch ligation, which led to an oxygen gradient vertical to the corticomedullary axis. Three distinct zones were observed: tubular necrosis, infarction border zone and preserved normal tissue. EphA 2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with pivotal roles in cell architecture, migration and survival, upon juxtacrine contact with its membrane-bound ligand EphrinA 1. Following hypoxia, EphA 2 was up-regulated in cortical and medullary tubular cells, while EphrinA 1 was up-regulated in interstitial cells adjacent to peritubular capillaries. Moreover, erythropoietin (EPO) messenger RNA (mRNA) was strongly expressed in the border zone of infarcted kidney within the first 6  h. To gain more insight into the biological impact of EphA 2 and EphrinA 1 up-regulation, we activated the signalling pathways in vitro using recombinant EphrinA 1 /Fc or EphA 2 /Fc proteins. Stimulation of EphA 2 <b>forward</b> <b>signalling</b> in the proximal tubular cell line HK 2 increased cell attachment and laminin secretion at the baso-lateral side. Conversely, activation of reverse signalling through EphrinA 1 expressed by Hep 3 B cells promoted EPO production at both the transcriptional and protein level. Strikingly, in co-culture experiments, juxtacrine contact between EphA 2 expressing MDCK and EphrinA 1 expressing Hep 3 B was sufficient to induce a significant up-regulation of EPO mRNA production in the latter cells, {{even in the absence}} of hypoxic conditions. The synergistic effects of EphA 2 and hypoxia led to a 15 – 20 -fold increase of EPO expression. Collectively, our results suggest an important role of EphA 2 /EphrinA 1 signalling in kidney repair after hypoxic injury through stimulation of (i) tubular cell attachment, (ii) secretion of basal membrane proteins and (iii) EPO production. These findings could thus pave the way to new therapeutic approaches. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|In {{the central}} nervous system, myelination of axons is {{required}} to ensure fast saltatory conduction and for survival of neurons. However, not all axons are myelinated, and the molecular mechanisms involved in guiding the oligodendrocyte processes toward the axons to be myelinated are not well understood. Only a few negative or positive guidance clues {{that are involved in}} regulating axo-glia interaction prior to myelination have been identified. One example is laminin, known to be required for early axo-glia interaction, which functions through a 6 b 1 integrin. Here, we identify the Eph-ephrin family of guidance receptors as novel regulators of the initial axo-glia interaction, preceding myelination. We demonstrate that so-called <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>signaling,</b> mediated by members of both Eph and ephrin subfamilies, has distinct and opposing effects on processes extension and myelin sheet formation. EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> inhibits oligodendrocyte process exten-sion and myelin sheet formation, and blocking of bidirectional signaling through this receptor enhances myelination. Similarly, EphB <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> also reduces myelin membrane formation, but in contrast to EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling,</b> this occurs in an integrin-dependent manner, which can be reversed by overexpression of a constitutive active b 1 -integrin. Furthermore, ephrin-B reverse signaling induced by EphA 4 or EphB 1 enhances myelin sheet formation. Combined, this suggests that the Eph-ephrin receptors are important mediators of bidirectional signaling between axons and oligodendrocytes. It further implies that balancing Eph-ephrin <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>signaling</b> is important in the selection process of axons to be myelinated...|$|R

The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the <b>forward</b> <b>signal,</b> while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the <b>forward</b> <b>signal</b> tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it.

Eph/ephrin signaling is a complex phenomena characterized by receptor <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> through the tyrosine kinase of the receptor and ephrin reverse signaling through various protein–protein interaction domains and phosphorylation motifs of the ephrin ligands. Therefore, interfering with EphR/ephrin signaling by the means of targeted gene ablation, soluble receptors, dominant negative mutants or antisense molecules often does not allow to discriminate between inhibition of Eph/ephrin <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>signaling.</b> We developed a specific small molecular weight kinase inhibitor of the EphB 4 kinase, NVP-BHG 712, which inhibits EphB 4 kinase activity in the low nanomolar range in cellular assays showed high selectivity for targeting the EphB 4 kinase when profiled against other kinases in biochemical as well as in cell based assays. Furthermore, NVP-BHG 712 shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and potently inhibits EphB 4 autophosphorylation in tissues after oral administration. In vivo, NVP-BHG 712 inhibits VEGF driven vessel formation, while it has only little effects on VEGF receptor (VEGFR) activity in vitro or in cellular assays.
