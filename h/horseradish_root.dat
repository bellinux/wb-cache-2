Thus, {{there is a}} strong need for a recombinant production process enabling a steady supply with enzyme preparations of consistent high quality. However, most current recombinant production systems are limited at titers in the low mg/L range. In this study, we used the well-known yeast Pichia pastoris as host for recombinant HRP production. To enhance recombinant enzyme titers we systematically evaluated engineering approaches on the secretion process, coproduction of helper proteins, and compared expression from the strong methanol-inducible PAOX 1 promoter, the strong constitutive PGAP promoter, and a novel bidirectional promoter PHTX 1.

The decay of the pump-induced ground-state bleaching is modulated by clearly visible oscillations and occurs exponentially with a time constant depending on the observed spectral component of the transmission difference signal, ranging from 270 fs up to 700 fs. The slower decaying process characterizes the spectral component corresponding to the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transition. The excited-state decay rate is significantly lower than in other blue copper proteins, probably because of the larger energy gap between ligand- and metal-based orbitals in umecyanin. Wavelength dependence of the recovery times {{could be due to}} either the excitation of several transitions or the occurrence of intramolecular vibrational relaxation within the excited state. We also find evidence of a hot ground-state absorption, at 700 nm, persisting for several picoseconds. The vibrational coherence induced by the ultrashort pump pulse allows vibrational activity to be observed, mainly in the ground state, as expected in a system with fast excited-state decay. However, we find evidence of a rapidly damped oscillation, which we assign to the excited state. Finally, the Fourier transform of the oscillatory component of the signal presents additional bands in the low-frequency region which are assigned to collective motions of the protein. 1...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Manganese {{has been}} known to be {{essential}} for photosynthesis for almost 30 years. Subsequent experimentation indicated a definite function for manganese in oxygen evolution. However, the mode of action of manganese and further localization of its site of action have not been determined. Ten years ago it was demonstrated that illuminated chloroplasts were capable of oxidizing manganese. The role of manganese in photosynthesis and the observed photooxidation of manganese by chloroplasts have often been correlated theoretically but never experimentally. Peroxidase was secondarily implicated since it is a stimulant for the manganese oxidizing reaction. The experiments presented in this thesis were conducted in order to determine more about the manganese oxidizing reaction and its relation to photosynthesis, and to characterize spinach peroxidase both as a stimulant in manganese oxidation and as a separate entity. If added, excess manganese replaces water in the photo-oxidizing system, the reaction should have properties {{similar to those of the}} Hill reaction. Results presented herein show the photo-oxidation to be sensitive to DCMU and simazine. Also the light saturation is practically identical to that of Hill reaction as is the response to temperature. Unlike the Hill reaction, the system is inhibited by acriflavin and KCN and is stimulated by FMN. Since the system requires oxygen as the oxidant and is stimulated by peroxidase, the latter results are to be expected. Additional information on the requirement for plastoquinone and other cofactors is presented. It appears that manganese is a redox intermediate acting at a site in photosynthetic electron transport between the point of oxygen evolution and the site of DCMU and simazine inhibition. Peroxidase is known to be present in almost all plants. The specific function of the enzyme is not known. It has been studied extensively in extracts from <b>horseradish</b> <b>roots</b> but not from green leaf tissue. Therefore, a preliminary study of spinach peroxidase was conducted.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Horseradish {{peroxidase}} (HRP) {{has been}} investigated extensively and for many years. In spite of this it still exhibits unexplained anomalies. Among these is variation in the reported number of isozymes (from 7 to 42), and reports of instability of the isozyme patterns. Since horseradish is {{a rich source of}} organic isothiocyanates (mustard oils), it seemed likely that artifactual chemical modification of the enzyme might occur during or after extraction. The present investigation demonstrates that isothiocyanates can in fact cause extensive modification of HRP without corresponding loss of catalytic activity. Incubation of HRP with isothiocyanates at alkaline pH and 4 °C altered the isozyme pattern. Peroxidase activity was shifted from bands of higher p 1 to bands of lower p 1, some of them preexisting bands and some of them newly generated. With time, the basic "C" band, initially the principal isozyme, virtually disappeared, and enzyme activity shifted to bands of lower pr. These were discrete bands, presumably formed by stepwise blocking of successive amino groups. Modification of HRP was found to be dependent on pH, reaction time, and isothiocyanate concentration. Amino acid analysis showed loss of 50 % of the lysine residues after reaction of HRP with allylisothiocyanate at pH 10. Reaction of phenyl- (¹⁴C) isothiocyanate with HRP at pH 10 resulted in an average of five phenylisothiocyanates incorporated per enzyme molecule. Autoradiography showed four radioactive HRP bands, corresponding to a shift of enzyme activity into these bands. Incubation of HRP with allylisothiocyanate in the presence of L-lysine at pH 10 showed little protective effect of the lysine, although the concentration of lysine was 800 times the enzyme concentration. This suggested that hydrophobic sites that bind isothiocyanates to the enzyme surface enhance the reaction of the isothiocyanates with the enzyme. Extraction of HRP from <b>horseradish</b> <b>roots</b> in the presence of adsorbent pclystyrene resulted in extracts that were colorless and odorless, in contrast to the brown color and pungent odor of untreated extracts. The initial extracts showed no difference in isozyme pattern between polystyrene-treated and untreated extracts.

40|$|The phytocyanins are {{a family}} of plant cupredoxins that have been {{subdivided}} into the stellacyanins, plantacyanins, and uclacyanins. All of these proteins possess the typical type 1 His 2 Cys equatorial ligand set at their mononuclear copper sites, but the stellacyanins have an axial Gln ligand {{in place of the}} weakly coordinated Met of the plantacyanins, uclacyanins, and most other cupredoxins. The stellacyanins exhibit altered visible, EPR, and paramagnetic 1 H NMR spectra at elevated pH values and also modified reduction potentials. This alkaline transition occurs with a pKa of ~ 10 [Dennison, C., Lawler, A. T. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 3158 - 3166]. In this study we demonstrate that the alkaline transition has a similar influence on the visible, EPR, and paramagnetic NMR spectra of cucumber basic protein (CBP), which is a plantacyanin. The mutation of the axial Gln 95 ligand into a Met in umecyanin (UMC), the stellacyanin from <b>horseradish</b> <b>roots,</b> and the axial Met 89 into a Gln in CBP have very limited, yet similar, influence on the pKa for the alkaline transition as judged from alterations in visible spectra. The complete removal of the axial ligand in the Met 89 Val variant of CBP results in a slightly larger decrease in the pKa for this effect, but similar spectral alterations are still observed at elevated pH. Thus, the axial Gln ligand is not the cause of the alkaline transition in Cu(II) stellacyanins, and alterations in the active site structures of the phytocyanins have a limited effect on this feature. The conserved Lys residue found adjacent to the axial ligand in the sequences of all phytocyanins, and implicated as the trigger for the alkaline transition, has been mutated to an Arg in UMC. The influence of increasing pH on the spectroscopic properties of Lys 96 Arg UMC is almost identical to those of the wild type protein, and thus, this residue is not responsible for the alkaline transition. However, a positively charged residue in this position seems to be important for the correct folding of UMC. Other possible triggers for the effects seen in the phytocyanins at elevated pH are discussed along with the relevance of the alkaline transition...|$|R
