Attacking ports, shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas, especially the distribution of coal, an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War, would net a positive result. However, the use of delayed-action bombs, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate.

500|$|Brown opposes a {{proposed}} multibillion-dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, {{said that he}} is [...] "opposed to higher taxes, especially {{in the midst of a}} severe recession". He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get our <b>economy</b> <b>moving</b> again." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper overviews {{and compares}} China's gradual {{economic}} liberalization with other transitional <b>economies</b> <b>moving</b> from planned <b>economy</b> to market economy such as Vietnam in Asia and Russia. China liberalized its economy {{more slowly than}} Vietnam and Russia. In the early stage of reform, China achieved macroeconomic stabilization by controlling credit through state banking system. However, state owned banking system has been handicapped in allocating capital efficiently. Some economists say that, in explaining the relatively bad Russian economy, Russia got the order of liberalization wrong. In contrast, within {{a short period of}} time, Vietnam completely transformed its economic system and achieved successful economic results. The economic liberalization in Vietnam was more radical and rapid than that of China. What transitional economies need in liberalizing their economy is a economic liberalization policy combined with strict financial supervision, strict monetary policy, fiscal reform and management of external debt structure. That is, it is not speed or sequence of economic liberalization but the state's capacity for setting up stable institutional incentive structure which is the crucial determinant of success. ...|$|R

Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) are largely middle-income economies but it is not certain whether they have achieved a threshold of technological capability required for catching up to high-income economies status. In exploring this issue we apply theoretically relevant and empirically grounded middle level conceptual and statistical framework based on three dimensions: intensity and breadth of technological upgrading, and technology and knowledge exchange. As an outcome we construct composite indicator of technology upgrading based on 35 indicators which reflects different drivers and patterns of technology upgrading of countries at different income levels. Based on simple statistical analysis we show that the middle income trap is present in all dimensions of technology upgrading but their importances vary across different dimensions. A trap seems to be higher for dimensions of ‘breadth’ of technology upgrading than for index of ‘intensity’ of technology upgrading. We explore in detail positioning of the CEE economies in the broader comparative contex...|$|R

While the economics of the crisis are relatively straightforward and generally accepted by experts, there remains no definitive synthesis of cultural and historical factors that contributed to the economy?s lost decade. Japan?s incredible post-war growth made it the darling of economists and historians who praised the nation?s rapid industrialization and highly efficient economy. Despite the plethora of literature in support of Japan?s ?miracle,? skeptics published their own body of literature, which vaguely predicted the economic difficulties that Japan encountered beginning in 1989 with the bursting of its stock and real estate bubbles. The highly rigid and traditional nature of Japanese society greatly informed the growth of its post war economy, enabling it to achieve significant expansion, but ultimately handicapping reform. The inability of companies to effectively adapt to market conditions and the unwillingness of regulators to intervene in a prompt manner contributed to the ?lost decade? and severe economic distress in the country. Examining the cultural underpinnings of Japanese business and societal attitudes toward the economy, as well as the various economic components of the crisis provides a more holistic and meaningful understanding of the lost decade...|$|R
