500|$|Duff {{explained}} of the album's title, [...] "I'm {{older and}} more mature now than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> made my last record, but I don't think I know it all. Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{listened to}} it on my crappy {{computer}} speakers and then I had to go find my headphones because as soon as I listened to a few bars, I had to listen more closely and I got chills. I remember where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E

500|$|During a MTV interview, Mars {{explained}} why the track {{was the first}} on the track list of the album [...] "It really shows you what this album is going to be, and just where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started this album". He felt that anyone can easily relate to the record [...] "There's a moment in your life where you start going out every night, and it's so fun, but then you start to lose yourself; you {{get lost in the}} sauce". The singer compared the song's sentiment to [...] "Lookin' for Love In All the Wrong Places", adding [...] "It's another confession". In a different interview Mars furthered the concept of the track as it's about you [...] "losing yourself", which happened to him in L.A. during his early years. He added, [...] "If you're out there wilding out, drinking and partying, that's not real life." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 29, 2011 Walker {{announced}} that he was considering a return to the NFL. [...] "I've told everyone that at 50 I might try football again to show people I can do that," [...] Walker said. [...] "I want to be the George Foreman of football, come back and do that one more time... The two teams I would come back to play for are Minnesota or Atlanta. It would probably be Atlanta because that's home for me." [...] According to Walker, his mixed martial arts training made him, [...] "a much better-conditioned athlete now than when I was playing football. I'm 48 and in better shape now than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in my early 20s, playing football." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} the {{character}} of Hermione carries several autobiographical influences: [...] "I did not {{set out to make}} Hermione like me but she is...she is an exaggeration of how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was younger." [...] She recalled being called a [...] "little know-it-all" [...] in her youth. Moreover, she states that not unlike herself, [...] "there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure" [...] beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopaedic knowledge, she can always be used as a plot dump to explain the Harry Potter universe. Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, [...] "who's the brightest character" [...] and is a [...] "very strong female character".|$|E
2500|$|After {{a lengthy}} musical break, Norwood {{established}} a flourishing acting career with her sitcom Moesha. She eventually entered recording studios on October 1997, {{to begin work}} on her second studio album, barely satisfied with the material that was presented to her. However, the recording of the album was postponed several times as Norwood felt that many songs wouldn't express {{what she wanted to}} tell at this point of her career. [...] "Many of the songs I heard were not 'me'," [...] the singer stated during a promotional interview with Jet in 1999, [...] "And If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it. I'm not the little girl <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> made my first record. My voice is a strong instrument now; my vocals come from both my heart and my diaphragm. My heart because I matured in the four years since the last album; I'm more emotionally there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elric's {{albinism}} appears {{influenced by}} Monsieur Zenith, an albino Sexton Blake villain whom Moorcock appreciated enough to write into later multiverse stories. [...] Moorcock read Zenith stories {{in his youth}} and has contributed to their later reprinting, remarking that it [...] "took me forty years to find another copy of Zenith the Albino! In fact it was a friend who found it {{under lock and key}} and got a copy of it to Savoy who are, at last, about to reprint it! Why I have spent so much energy making public the evidence of my vast theft from Anthony Skene, I'm not entirely sure... [...] Moorcock later said, [...] "As I've said in my introduction to Monsieur Zenith: The Albino, the Anthony Skenes character was a huge influence. For the rest of the character, his ambiguities in particular, I based him on myself at the age <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> created Elric, which was 20". The influence of Zenith on Elric is often cited in discussions of Zenith.|$|E
