40|$|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6 n- 3), a {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} (PUFA), is linked to various health benefits in humans including cognitive and visual development of infants and reduced risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and mental illnesses of adults. Fish oil, with an annual production of about 600, 000 tons is at present {{the major source of}} DHA. However, the production of fish oils is expected to become inadequate for supplying an expanding market within few years. Thraustochytrids are marine heterotrophic producers of PUFA-rich triacylglycerols which represent an alternative source of DHA. The focus of this thesis has been split between a basic study of the osmolyte system of traustochytrids and work towards an understanding of their growth kinetics, effects of nutrient depletion, and lipid and DHA accumulation. Three new osmotolerant thraustochytrid isolates (T 65, T 66, and T 67) and the previously known Schizochytrium sp. strain S 8 (ATCC 20889) were assigned to the genus Aurantiochytrium based on 18 S ribosomal DNA phylogeny, morphology and PUFA profiles (approximately 80 % DHA). Strains T 66 and S 8 displayed a nearly linear increase in cellular content of endogenously synthesized (-) - proto -quercitol and glycine betaine with increasing osmotic strength. This represented the first demonstration of accumulation of principal compatible solutes in thraustochytrids. A less osmotolerant isolate (Thraustochytriidae sp. strain T 29), which was closely phylogenetically related to Thraustochytrium aureum (ATCC 34304) did not accumulate glycine betaine or (-) - proto -quercitol, illustrating a variation in osmolyte systems and osmotolerance levels among thraustochytrids. To study the effects of nutrient limitations, Aurantiochytrium sp. strain T 66 was grown in batch bioreactor cultures in a defined glutamate and glycerol containing medium with various medium limitations. N and P starvation and O 2 limitation initiated lipid accumulation. N starvation alone or in combination with O 2 limitation yielded the <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>contents</b> <b>obtained</b> in this study, i. e., 54 to 63 % of cell dry weight with a corresponding cell density of 90 to 100 g l - 1 dry biomass. The DHA-content of N starved cells was 29 % of total fatty acids, while O 2 limitation increased the DHA-content up to 52 %. Simultaneously, O 2 limitation abolished accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acids. We inferred that the biological explanation is that O 2 limitation hindered activity of the O 2 -dependent desaturase(s) responsible for production of monounsaturated fatty acids, and favored the O 2 -independent PUFA synthase. The highest DHA-productivity observed was 93 mg l - 1 h -l, obtained during sequential N starvation and O 2 limitation. This productivity approaches the highest values previously reported for thraustochytrids, and indicates that T 66 may become a candidate organism for a future large-scale microbial PUFA production process. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

The increase in starch content increased the loss of lipid, the expansion ratio, the degree of gelatinization (DG) of starch, and the water absorption index (WAI). Increasing <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> resulted in <b>higher</b> loss of <b>lipids</b> and a lower WAI and water solubility index (WSI). Water content had the most influence. Increasing water content resulted in increased loss of <b>lipids,</b> <b>higher</b> moisture <b>content</b> of extrudates, and in lower die temperature, expansion ratio, DG, WAI and WSI. The high DG (>= 91 %) of all extrudates demonstrated that the very-low-cost extruder manufactured in Vietnam is suitable {{for the production of}} ready-to-eat infant flour. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This work tested and optimized the effect of blend composition on the characteristics of rice-based extrudates obtained using a very-low-cost extruder (VLCE) manufactured in Vietnam and on derived gruels. Our results enable prediction of the characteristics of extruded products, when the starch, <b>lipid</b> and water <b>contents</b> of the blends are known. Thus, VLCE users will be able to choose the nature and relative proportion of ingredients to obtain extrudates with specific targeted characteristics. In addition, this study demonstrated that serious loss of lipids occurs during extrusion of blends with <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>contents.</b> To <b>obtain</b> the <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> recommended for complementary food, it is thus preferable to add ingredients with <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> after extrusion.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} {{and the consequences of}} its use for the environment have created the need for greater production of fuels derived from renewable raw materials. In this sense, the use of lipids obtained from the biomass of microalgae {{has been described as a}} promising alternative to petro-diesel industry and involves steps such as cultivation of microalgae, biomass harvesting, oil extraction and its transesterification. Information on total <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> in Chlorella spp is presented in the literature, however different values are found for different methodologies and there is little information about percentage of the raw material for biodiesel, the triacylglycerides in fat mass. The objective of this study was to compare different methods of extraction, with respect to the <b>content</b> of total <b>lipids</b> extracted and the percentage of triacylglycerides in lipid mass. For all experiments, the biomass of Chlorella vulgaris was grown under normal conditions described in the literature. Extractions of total lipids were carried out with ethanol, hexane, a mixture of chloroform and methanol in the ratio 2 : 1 and 1 : 2. Mixtures of chloroform and methanol were used to evaluate cell disruption methods such as ultrasound and Potter. Once selected the most efficient methodology, the <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> at different stages of growth (exponential phase, early stationary phase and late stationary phase) was evaluated. The percentage of triacylglycerides in total lipids was determined by glycerol- 3 -phosphate oxidase-p-chlorophenol (K 117 monoreagent triglycerides; Bioclin). Among the tested solvents, a mixture of chloroform: methanol (2 : 1) associated with the use of ultrasound was more efficient reaching on average 23 % of total lipids, being almost 2 % of these represented by triacylglycerides.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Engineering and Architecture, Washington State UniversityMicroalgae have {{attracted}} growing attention for renewable biofuel production. In this work, microalga Chlorella sorokiniana was explored for {{its potential for}} lipid production. The results showed that C. sorokiniana could tolerate high temperature (up to 42 oC) and had high productivity. Under batch fermentation condition, 37. 6 g L‒ 1 of biomass could be achieved with 80 g L‒ 1 of initial glucose supplementation. Rapid growth rate and <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> were <b>obtained</b> through mixotrophic cultivation under the experimental conditions. The specific growth rate (3. 40 d─ 1) and the biomass yield (0. 82 g g─ 1) were 1. 8 - and 2. 4 -folds of those in heterotrophic culture. Most significantly, <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> in mixotrophic cells reached 45 %, whereas it was only 13 % in the control heterotrophically cultured cells. Linear electron flow and CO 2 refixation were demonstrated to be critical factors for boosting the cell growth and lipid accumulation in mixotrophic culture. To gain further insights into the mixotrophic growth, regulation of photosynthesis was examined. Photosynthetic activities and fluorescence parameters were measured and characterized, followed by analysis of 77 K fluorescence spectra, enzyme activities and enzyme expression levels. In the exponential phase, the mixotrophic cells exhibited enhanced photosynthetic activity; in the stationary phase, down-regulation of photosynthesis was observed, which was proved to be closely correlated with nitrogen limitation. Starch is another major carbon and energy storage compound in many microalgal cells. This study revealed the pattern of starch and lipid accumulation in C. sorokiniana controlled by nitrogen levels: when nitrogen was replete, starch was the predominant form of carbon storage; after nitrogen was depleted, large amounts of lipid accumulation occurred accompanied by starch degradation. Finally, lipid became the only carbon sink in the biomass partially contributed from starch degradation and the turnover of some primary metabolites. These results provide insight for using microalga C. sorokiniana for biofuel production. College of Engineering and Architecture, Washington State Universit...|$|R
