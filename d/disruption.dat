5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The <b>disruption</b> lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst <b>disruption</b> to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into {{the cause of the}} <b>disruption.</b> The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 <b>disruption,</b> LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E
40|$|Background: The article aims at {{presenting}} a study into <b>disruptions</b> {{in a network}} supply chain of metallurgic products. The research {{was carried out in}} the years 2011 - 2013. Network supply chains include key chain links for building the resistance. These chain links affect material flows of the whole supply chain through silencing <b>disruptions.</b> Those predisposed to form a strategy strengthening the resistance of the whole network supply chain are organizations fulfilling the assumptions of flagship enterprise. 	Material and methods:  The research is carried out in two stages: the stage of identification of <b>disruptions</b> (risk factors) and the stage of identification of strengthening <b>disruptions</b> zones. The authors carried out simulation experiments based on three models built in the management system dynamics technique (VensimDSS). The proposed methodology required constructing original tools for measuring <b>disruptions</b> and zones strengthening the <b>disruptions</b> in the form of cards for measuring <b>disruptions.</b> 	Results: The value added is grouping of <b>disruptions</b> in risk factors distinguished in terms of the frequency of the occurrence of <b>disruptions</b> and their results. The authors proposed and defined the notion of zones of strengthening <b>disruptions.</b> The zones are formed from sets of factors strengthening <b>disruptions</b> with similar influence on <b>disruptions.</b> 	Conclusions: The IT system composed of a module for identification of <b>disruptions</b> in material flows and a simulation model is a proposal dedicated to organizations controlling material flows in a network supply chain in the conditions of <b>disruptions...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractLine service large <b>disruptions</b> {{are commonplace}} in rapid transit systems with large {{deviations}} from planned operations.

A robust network design {{may be too}} expensive to be operated in a daily basis because {{if there are no}} <b>disruptions,</b> a low utilization of the infrastructure may occur. Therefore, a less robust approach is proposed accounting for possible <b>disruptions.</b> We propose a recoverable robust network design as an alternative to robust design {{in order to reduce the}} effect of <b>disruptions</b> and the cost of the recovery process. The recoverable robust design is defined considering several disrupted scenarios with their associated probabilities. To demonstrate that the developed model reduces recovery and robustness costs some computational experiments are presented...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional <b>disruption</b> of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of <b>disruption</b> of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such <b>disruption</b> would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E

40|$|Poor economies {{not only}} produce less; they {{typically}} produce things that involve fewer inputs and fewer intermediate steps. Yet the supply chains of poor countries face more frequent <b>disruptions</b> [...] -delivery failures, faulty parts, delays, power outages, theft, government failures [...] -that systematically thwart the production process. To understand how these <b>disruptions</b> affect economic development, we model an evolving input [...] output network in which <b>disruptions</b> spread contagiously among optimizing agents. The key {{finding is that}} a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent <b>disruptions</b> by producing simpler, less valuable goods, yet <b>disruptions</b> persist. Growing out of poverty requires that agents invest in buffers to <b>disruptions.</b> These buffers rise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction consistent with global patterns of input inventories.

40|$|AbstractWithin {{the last}} decade, several {{cases of the}} supply chain {{vulnerability}} to major <b>disruptions</b> have been observed. The typical mitigation strategies such as safety inventory and excess capacity are inadequate to cover the major <b>disruptions.</b> Furthermore it is not economical to invest in such costly proactive strategies to recover from infrequent <b>disruptions.</b> The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide a decision making tool achieving robust supply flow by incorporating strategic stock and reconfigurable back-up supplier in mitigating <b>disruptions.</b> We consider a firm with two suppliers where the main supplier is cost-effective but prone to <b>disruptions</b> and the back-up supplier is reliable but expensive due to re-configurability characteristics. We present a multi-stage robust optimization model to determine optimal strategic stock levels and layout configuration of the back-up supplier for a supply chain subject to random realization of <b>disruptions</b> and available capacity during the ramp-up time. Furthermore, the partial available capacity of the backup supplier during the response time has been modelled using queuing theoretical models. The results show the optimality of highly scalable configuration as the decision maker becomes more risk averse...|$|R
40|$|Electric power {{transmission}} systems {{are a key}} infrastructure and blackouts of these systems have major direct and indirect consequences {{on the economy and}} national security. Analysis of North American Electrical Reliability Council blackout data suggests the existence of blackout size distributions with power tails. This is an indication that blackout dynamics behave as a complex dynamical system. Here, we investigate how these complex system dynamics impact the assessment and mitigation of blackout risk. The mitigation of failures in complex systems needs to be approached with care. The mitigation efforts can move the system to a new dynamic equilibrium while remaining near criticality and preserving the power tails. Thus, while the absolute frequency of <b>disruptions</b> of all sizes may be reduced, the underlying forces can still cause the relative frequency of large <b>disruptions</b> to small <b>disruptions</b> to remain the same. Moreover, in some cases, efforts to mitigate small <b>disruptions</b> can even increase the frequency of large <b>disruptions.</b> This occurs because the large and small <b>disruptions</b> are not independent but are strongly coupled by the dynamics. 1...|$|R
