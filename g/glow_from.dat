5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|The {{perspective}} now hovers {{high above}} Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds {{a baby to}} whom she whispers Oscar's name. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot {{from the perspective of}} a baby being born to Oscar's mother. (According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's own birth in the form of a false memory).|$|E
25|$|In the Big Bang {{model for}} the {{formation}} of the universe, Inflationary Cosmology predicts that after about 10−37 seconds the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that smoothed out nearly all irregularities. The remaining irregularities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field that caused the inflation event. Before the formation of stars and planets (after 10−6 seconds), the early universe was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> its white-hot fog of interacting plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons.|$|E

25|$|The {{island was}} first sighted by the Spaniards in 1565 during Nobieres Erra's expedition. The Spaniards called the island Isla NOBI ("Island of music"), because the island gave off an eerie <b>glow,</b> <b>from</b> the great swarms of sound {{that lived in}} the {{numerous}} harmonics on the island. Esteban Rodríguez of the Legazpi expedition led the first Spaniards to discover the island. He was captain of a small party that left Legazpi's camp in Bohol to explore the nearby islands which are now called Pamilican, Siquijor, and Negros.|$|E
25|$|Scenes of the Emergency Escape Vehicle {{were shot}} with a 3.5-foot {{miniature}} against a blue-screen and composited onto large scale traditional matte paintings of the planet's surface. To make the clouds <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> within as the EEV entered the atmosphere, the painting's values were digitally reversed and animated frame-by-frame. The scene in which the EEV is moved by a crane-arm (also a miniature) was created by projecting a video of actors onto pieces of cardboard and then compositing them into the scene as silhouettes against the matte painted background.|$|E

The employees got enough steam up to operate the store’s powerful pumps in the basement, and volunteers went to the roof and used the store's fire hoses to wet down the roof and the wall {{on the side of}} the oncoming fire. Early in the following morning however, the city's waterworks burned, thus ending the water supply and making further efforts useless. The last employee had scarcely made it out of the building when it burst into flames, shooting fire from every window.|$|E

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of CMB is landmark {{evidence of the}} Big Bang origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> a white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived atoms could not absorb the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in plasma {{is referred to as}} photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This {{is the source of the}} alternative term relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.|$|E

Home would adjust the lighting to his needs with no objections from his séance sitters. For example, there is this report from a witness: [...] "The room was very dark... Home's hands were visible only as a faint white heap".

[...] The crowds were so thick that they blocked Westminster Bridge {{in their attempts to}} get a good view, and many took to the river in whatever craft they could find or hire in order to watch better. A crowd of thousands congregated in Parliament Square to witness the spectacle, including the Prime Minister—Lord Melbourne—and many of his cabinet.

500|$|The Australian cruiser {{continued}} on a south-south-east heading at low speed; observers aboard Kormoran doubted that Sydney was under control.

At {{some point during the}} night, Sydney lost buoyancy and sank: the bow was torn off as she submerged and descended almost vertically, {{while the rest of the}} hull glided [...] forward as she sank, hitting the bottom upright and stern first. Sydneys shells had crippled Kormoran; the German sailors abandoned ship after it was determined that below-deck fires could not be controlled before they reached the gun magazines or the mines in the cargo hold. The raider was scuttled at midnight, and sank slowly until the mine deck exploded half an hour later.|$|E

"The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] made up {{the fourth}} {{production}} block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. [...] "Cold Blood" [...] utilised many different locations and unusual sets to portray the Silurian city, as the production team did not want simply a [...] "cave feel". They believed that the Silurians were also sophisticated {{and were able to}} use materials found underground, such as granite and marble. Many of the sets were given an orange <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> beneath to portray the [...] "ambient glow" [...] from the centre of the earth. The jungle walkway leading to the Silurian city was filmed in the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009. The set gave a sense of things growing, as these were necessary for the Silurians to survive. Set designers were able to rearrange the plants, though they had {{to be careful not to}} show the window leading to the car park or other modern amenities. The hall where the Doctor is brought for execution was filmed at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff, and little dressing was done to the set.|$|E

Charles Dickens's novel The Old Curiosity Shop, written in 1841, described how the area's local factory chimneys [...] "Poured out their plague of smoke, obscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air". In 1862, Elihu Burritt, the American Consul in Birmingham, described {{the region as}} [...] "black by day and red by night", because of the smoke and grime generated by the intense manufacturing activity and the <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> furnaces at night.

In 2004, the Very Large Telescope detected a faint <b>glow</b> <b>from</b> an apparent planet orbiting a star about 200 light-years from earth. A year later, this detection was confirmed as the first picture of an exoplanet ever recorded. Although the planet is large (five times more massive than Jupiter), this observation is a first step toward identifying the physical structure and chemical composition of exoplanets.|$|E
