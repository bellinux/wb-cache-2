40|$|In this master thesis {{work the}} {{possibilities}} with an active fuse {{system has been}} investigated, with the background in the increased number of electric loads in commercial vehicles. Different design possibilities have be considered together with implementation alternatives. A prototype was built for testing turn-o_ times of an analogue switch circuit design. Experiments were also carried out on a power distribution unit, constructed by Volvo 3 P in 2003 {{hereinafter referred to as}} the PDU, which utilizes a digital switch circuit design. The results shows that a analogue switch design is to prefer for best protection, with turn-o_ times down to 0, 5 _s. The digital switch design was slower in all tests. The power losses for a traditional blow out fuse were compared to the prototype showing an equal power loss up to 10 A and a greater power loss in the prototype afterward. A mix of an analogue and digital circuitry design was thought as the best alternative. This design will have rapid response times and <b>flexible</b> <b>fuse</b> levels together with diagnostic features. The implementation of the active fuse system in a commercial vehicle has to be evaluated with respect to case specific needs...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} with optical fibers {{have reached a}} remarkable development for optical communication spectroscopy {{as well as a}} medical technology. Hollow optical fibers are required for optical communications. The measurement of the transmission of light through fibers can provide information about the fiber quality and about the far-field energy which radiates from the fiber end. We used five <b>flexible</b> hollow <b>fused</b> quartz fibers to study laser beam propagation down the fiber axis. Five different refractive index fluids were prepared and inserted into the fiber core to measure the transmitted intensity as a function of core property. The plots of the normalized, relative transmitted intensity measured {{as a function of the}} beam insertion point show the dependence of the transmitted intensity as a function of fiber diameter and refractive index fluid...|$|R
40|$|Phytosterols (PS) and {{the related}} phytostanols are {{bioactive}} compounds of many foodstuffs, especially in food items of plant origin, such as vegetable oils, cereal grains, nuts and seeds. PS {{are known to have}} several bioactive properties with various implications on human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic activities and cholesterol lowering capacity. Analytical methods are critical elements for the correct and accurate determination of PS. A review of the last three decades, based on compilation of the available information on the different steps (extraction, saponification, derivatization and chromatographic method) of PS determination was performed. The preparation samples for PS analyses should take into account the nature of matrix, its physical sate, among others. Most of the times, ethanolic or methanolic potassium hydroxide are the selected reagents for the saponification, which can be performed at room temperature or with heating. For derivatization, N,O-Bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1 % of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) or N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) are the most used reagents. Capillary gas-chromatography (GC), with flame ionization detector (FID) or mass spectrometry (MS), proved to be simple and accurate to perform analytical determinations on this group of compounds. However, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with different detection systems has also been used. Analysis of PS are best carried out using 30 m x 0. 25 mm i. d. x 0. 25 µm film thickness, <b>flexible,</b> <b>fused</b> capillary columns coated with 5 % phenyl and 95 % methyl siloxane, because it has a high thermal stability and provides better resolution of peaks. Some of these columns are supplied under the trade designations: DB- 5, HP- 5, RTx- 5 or CP Sil- 8. This review aims to contribute for {{a better understanding of the}} analytical approaches adopted to determine PS and to follow the tendency over the last few years to enhance the knowledge towards PS content found in food products.

40|$|We {{present a}} <b>flexible</b> method for <b>fusing</b> {{information}} from optical and range sensors {{based on an}} accelerated highdimensional filtering approach. Our system takes as input a sequence of monocular camera images {{as well as a}} stream of sparse range measurements as obtained from a laser or other sensor system. In contrast with existing approaches, we do not assume that the depth and color data streams have the same data rates or that the observed scene is fully static. Our method produces a dense, high-resolution depth map of the scene, automatically generating confidence values for every interpolated depth point. We describe how to integrate priors on object motion and appearance and how to achieve an efficient implementation using parallel processing hardware such as GPUs. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of visual {{recognition}} such as scene categorization, representing an image based on the local feature (e. g., the bag-of-visual-word (BOVW) model and the bag-of-contextual-visual-word (BOCVW) model) has become popular {{and one of the most}} successful methods. In this paper, we propose a method that uses localized maximum-margin learning to fuse different types of features during the BOCVW modeling for eventual scene classification. The proposed method fuses multiple features at the stage when the best contextual visual word is selected to represent a local region (hard assignment) or the probabilities of the candidate contextual visual words used to represent the unknown region are estimated (soft assignment). The merits of the proposed method are that (1) errors caused by the ambiguity of single feature when assigning local regions to the contextual visual words can be corrected or the probabilities of the candidate contextual visual words used to represent the region can be estimated more accurately; and that (2) it offers a more <b>flexible</b> way in <b>fusing</b> these features through determining the similarity-metric locally by localized maximum-margin learning. The proposed method has been evaluated experimentally and the results indicate its effectiveness. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved. postprin...|$|R
50|$|Its bone {{structure}} {{is similar to}} many other bats, with minor differences that define the species.Its skull is only small, with a braincase breadth of only 7 mm. The supraorbital swellings are not pronounced {{and there is no}} median crest on the brain case. The total skull length around is 11.7 mm. Little Pied Bats have 7 cervical vertebrae, 11 thoracic vertebrae, 4 lumbar vertebrae and are thought to have 3 caudal vertebrae that make up the small tail structure. The pelvic girdle bones (ilium, ischium and pubis) are strongly fused, more so than in other mammals.The lower hind limb is composed mainly of the tibia, the fibia being vestigial and fused to the tibia. The hind limb is rotated through 180°, so when walking knees point ventrally. The entire hindlimb is capable of a wide angle rotation, allowing a complete 360° turn when hanging. The toes of this hind limb have claws that are extremely strong and laterally compressed. A tendon that runs through cartilaginous rings attached to the phalange allow an automatic locking system. The weigh tof the bat keeps the tendon taught, and hence the toes gripping when hanging, so the bat may sleep without falling from its roost. The uropatagium, the flap of skin that extends between the back legs and tail is supported by the calcaneum bone, which is located near the ankle.The forelimb bones are all elongated, with the degree of elongation increasing the farther the bones are from the body. The ulna is vestigial and fused to the radius. The forearm commonly between 31-33 mm in length. The thumb is not overly enlarged but is capable of free movement. The wrist is highly <b>flexible.</b> The <b>fusing</b> of the radius and ulna allow for strength to hold up the wing. The bones of the wing are controlled by a single muscle for each action. At the elbow, there is a small bone called the ulna sesamoid, it is similar to the patella.|$|R
40|$|A highly {{efficient}} and <b>flexible</b> approach to <b>fused</b> polycyclic ethers that couples {{the synthesis of}} C-glycosides with enol ether-olefin ring closing metathesis (RCM) and/or acid mediated cyclizations has been presented. We have developed a single flask, enol ether oxidation, carbon-carbon bond forming approach to the generation of C-glycosides. We {{have been successful in}} the formation of both alpha- (Table 1. 11) and beta- (Table 1. 10) C-glycosides from a single glycosyl donor (glycal anhydride). Both Schrock's Mo catalyst 123 and the 2 nd generation Grubbs' Ru catalyst 124 have been used in enol ether-olefin RCM reactions to generate alpha-substituted enol ethers. PPTS, pyridine, and heat have been effective in generating alpha-unsubstituted enol ethers. Our ability to couple the formation of C-glycosides with RCM or acid mediated cyclizations directed our attention to the use of this strategy in the synthesis of fused polycyclic ether natural products. We initially targeted the synthesis of hemibrevetoxin B (2). We have completed a formal total synthesis of ±-hemibrevetoxin B to Mori intermediate 167 in 21 overall steps and in 3. 9 % yield from the Danishefsky-Kitahara diene 74. Our success in the formal total synthesis of hemibrevetoxin B gave us great confidence to pursue the synthesis of gambierol 6. We have synthesized the A-D ring system 283 in 20 steps and in 4. 2 % overall yield. The FG ring system 302 was synthesized in 9 steps and in 13 % overall yield. We have been successful in the generation of C-glycosides and have been able to apply them in the formation of fused polycyclic ether natural products...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This {{document}} {{contains the}} majority of the research on multistatic feature-aided tracking that I have done in my graduate student career at the University of Washington. It contains an overview of sonar and the measurements that an active sonar system generates. It also gives an overview of a tracker based on joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) which is the basis for the research on integrating features into tracking. Several methods for integrating features are compared: integration into JPDA itself at two places, integration into track management, and simply rejecting contacts that appear to be clutter. The methods were tested on the TNO benchmark dataset, showing that integrating the features into track management performed the best, resulting in increased accuracy, fewer ``spurs'' coming off of target tracks, and decreased track fragmentation. In addition, the use of tracking information to improve classification was explored. By using a tracker to predict the aspect of the target at the current time, contacts can be classified based on their aspect-dependent features, target strength and Doppler. The results of this were interesting for two reasons: a high average accuracy can be obtained by using the aspect estimate along with the uncertainty from the prediction, and that only using the prediction (no uncertainty) always performed worse than using no information at all. This document also describes the development of two preprocessing techniques (posterior distribution preprocessing and likelihood-based clustering) that allow the combination of measurements that come from different sources, which can then be tracked by a standard JPDA-based tracker. This is especially key for multistatic sonar, as the preprocessing techniques allow a tracker to track very dim targets (Probability of Detection of approximately 0. 1) in high clutter scenarios (44 clutter contacts per receiver). The posterior distribution preprocessing technique is extremely <b>flexible</b> and can <b>fuse</b> extremely different types of measurements (IR and HD video data, imaging sonar and HD video data, multistatic sonar). It allows for the appropriate modeling of the measurement noise, resulting in a system that can be applied to many types of data. In addition, this work describes how the preprocessing step can be modified to incorporate any additional feature data. The likelihood-based clustering technique works well on multistatic sonar data, and allows for the incorporation of any features when calculating the similarity between contacts. This is especially useful for aspect-dependent features, such as Doppler or amplitude. The clustering step is followed by a fusion step that allows for the estimation of target heading or velocity if the appropriate features are used. Using the preprocessing step results in a tracking system that has improved performance, especially on dim targets in a large amount of clutter...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) have {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} versatile new materials platform for biomedical applications. By tuning their surface functionality, NPs can be engineered to resemble proteins in terms of size, shape, and chemistry, making them ideal for use in vivo. However, a theoretical understanding of how NPs interact with the biological milieu has lagged far behind experiments. In particular, {{it is critical to}} gain physical insight into the behavior of NPs at cell surfaces in order to minimize cytotoxic side effects while maximizing NP efficacy. In this thesis, I use several biomolecular simulation techniques to model the interactions of amphiphilic, monolayer-protected NPs with lipid bilayers. This work is motivated by the recent experimental finding that certain gold NPs can penetrate into cells via an unexplained non-endocytic, non-disruptive mechanism. I propose that such a penetration process is possible if the surface properties of the NP can effectively reorganize {{in the presence of the}} lipid bilayer. I show that such environmentally-responsive NPs can stably insert into lipid bilayers as a precursor to cell penetration. The thesis divides this study into three Parts. In Part I, I study the thermodynamics of NP-bilayer interactions using both a coarse-grained methodology and a novel implicit bilayer, implicit solvent model. I show that NPs with <b>flexible</b> ligands can <b>fuse</b> with lipid bilayers by "snorkeling" charged end groups out of the bilayer core and into solution. Several experimental studies confirm aspects of this fusion hypothesis and indicate that fusion may be a precursor to cellular internalization. In Part II, I use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the kinetic pathway for NP-bilayer fusion. Fusion occurs spontaneously if the NP comes into contact with lipid tail protrusions which occur stochastically over long timescales. In Part III I perform initial studies on cooperative NP behavior. I first show that NPs must be carefully engineering to avoid aggregation in solution prior to contact with the bilayer. I then show that embedded NPs induce membrane deformations similar to those around transmembrane proteins, a finding that implies thats NPs may aggregate due to membrane-mediated forces. On the basis of these results, I propose several examples of cooperative interactions that bear future investigation. The findings of this thesis are a comprehensive study of novel nano-bio interactions that reveal a previously unknown pathway for NP-bilayer fusion. Moreover, the physicochemical similarity between the NPs studied here and both other NP formulations and proteins implies that the results may generalize to a large variety of other synthetic and biological systems. This work will be essential in guiding the design of novel biomaterial systems for bioimaging, biosensing, and drug delivery applications and provides significant physical insight into behavior at the cell surface. by Reid Chi Van Lehn.
