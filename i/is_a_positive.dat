5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|If k2 {{is greater}} than one, F2−F1 is a {{negative}} number; thus, the added inverse-cube force is attractive, as observed in the green planet of Figures1–4 and 9. By contrast, if k2 is less than one, F2−F1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> number; the added inverse-cube force is repulsive, as observed in the green planet of Figures5 and 10, and in the red planet of Figures4 and 5.|$|E

The duo were not happy with the episode, particularly the ending, and were surprised by the positive response it received from fans. Parker said he also wanted the episode to convey, in part, that Halloween <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> holiday for children.|$|E

5|$|While {{lanthanum}} has pharmacological {{effects on}} several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the GABA receptor is unique among trivalent cations. Lanthanum acts {{at the same}} modulatory site on the GABA receptor as zinc, a known negative allosteric modulator. The lanthanum cation La3+ <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.|$|E
5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E

The study <b>was</b> <b>a</b> survey conducted in Medan with 79 sample of Medan University employees, selected randomly. The data were analyzed by using path analysis.    The result of this research were as follows: (1) there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect of leadership on job satisfaction; (2) there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> affect of job design on job satisfaction; (3) there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect of organizational climate on job satisfaction; (4) there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect of leadership on organizational climate; and (5) there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect of job design on organizational climate. In order to improved job satisfaction, leadership in line with context and situation, the relevant job design, and the conducive organizational climate should be put into human capital management; however other variables  were necessary {{to be taken into}} account by next job satisfaction research...|$|R
