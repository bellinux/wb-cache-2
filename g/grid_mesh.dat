50|$|The virtual <b>grid</b> <b>mesh</b> that {{underlies}} the fused grid network structure is expressed at 400 m intervals, {{five times the}} size of the traditional city block (about 80 m). At this scale there is greater flexibility to adapt the network elements to the topography and to specific site boundary constraints that are common in property configurations. Within the 16 ha quadrant, the discontinuous character of the streets and the possible combination of cul-de-sac and loop types provide sufficient latitude to the site plan designer to lay out an adapted version of the fused grid. There are at least 15 variations of the quadrant design that can be moulded to fit specific conditions. The site adaptability of the model has been demonstrated in the two approved layout plans.|$|E
50|$|FDFD, and FDTD {{for that}} matter, does {{not lend itself}} well to complex {{geometries}} or multiscale structures, as the Yee grid is restricted mostly to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by either using a very fine <b>grid</b> <b>mesh</b> (which increases computational cost), or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions. Non uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, as the zero divergence conditions are not maintained when the grid is not uniform along an interface boundary. E and H field continuity can be maintained to circumvent this problem by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM. Perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions {{can also be used}} to truncate the grid, and avoid meshing empty space.|$|E
50|$|The {{main idea}} of multigrid is to {{accelerate}} the convergence of a basic iterative method (known as relaxation, which generally reduces short-wavelength error) by a global correction of the fine grid solution approximation from time to time, accomplished by solving a coarse problem. The coarse problem, while cheaper to solve, {{is similar to the}} fine grid problem in that it also has short- and long-wavelength errors. It can also be solved by a combination of relaxation and appeal to still coarser grids. This recursive process is repeated until a grid is reached where the cost of direct solution there is negligible compared to the cost of one relaxation sweep on the fine grid. This multigrid cycle typically reduces all error components by a fixed amount bounded well below one, independent of the fine <b>grid</b> <b>mesh</b> size. The typical application for multigrid is in the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations in two or more dimensions.|$|E

40|$|The only {{implicit}} {{smoothing method}} {{implemented in the}} DLR Flow Solver TAU is the LU-SGS method. It was chosen several years ago because of its low memory requirements and low operation counts. Since {{in the past for}} many examples a severe restriction of the CFL number and loss of robustness was observed, it is the goal of this paper to revisit the LU-SGS implementation and to discuss several alternative implicit smoothing strategies used within an agglomeration multigrid for unstructured meshes. Starting point is a full implicit multistage Runge-Kutta method. Based on this method we develop and suggest several additional features and simplifications such that the implicit method is applicable to high Reynolds number viscous flows, that is the required matrices fit into the fast memory of our cluster hardware and the arising linear systems can be approximately solved efficiently. To this end we focus on simplifications of the Jacobian as well as efficient iterative approximate solution methods. To significantly improve the approximate linear solution methods we take care of grid anisotropy for both approximately solving the linear systems and agglomeration strategy. The procedure creating coarse <b>grid</b> <b>meshes</b> is extended by strategies identifying structured parts of the mesh. This seems {{to improve the quality of}} coarse <b>grid</b> <b>meshes</b> in the way that an overall better reliability of multigrid can be observed.
