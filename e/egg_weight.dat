A biological experiment was conducted using 160 (32 -week old) white leg horn hens to assess the beneficial effect of Sugarcane Press Residue (SPR) in soya and fish based diets. Two BIS (1992) specified practical control diets for both soya (T) and fish based (T) test diets were formulated, while the SPR was included at three levels (5 %, 10 % 1 5 and 15 %) in test diets of both soya based (T to T) and fish based (T to T) types to form a total of eight 2 4 6 8 treatment diets. Each of such formulated diets was offered to five replicates of four birds each reared in colony cages {{for a period of}} twelve weeks. Among the egg characteristics studied, the 84 day mean <b>egg</b> <b>weights</b> were found to be 54. 70, 53. 58, 52. 46, 54. 69, 54. 09, 54. 22, 53. 21 and 52. 62 g in T through T groups, 1 8 respectively.

50|$|The {{peak time}} for egg {{production}} is early May, with some birds, particularly first-time breeders, laying {{later in the}} month or in June. The clutch size is normally three eggs; larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest. Egg size averages 41 x 31 mm, although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid. The average <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> is 20.2 g, of which 5% is shell. The <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> depends on how well-fed the female is, {{as well as on}} its position in the clutch. The eggs are cream, buff, or pale brown, marked with streaks, spots or blotches of black, brown or grey which help to camouflage them. Incubation is by both sexes, although more often by the female, and lasts 21-22 days, extending to 25 days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended; nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34 days. On hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to the eggs, thus affording the eggs some cooling. Except when the colony suffers disaster, 90% of the eggs hatch. The precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings, and like the eggs, is similar to the equivalent stage of the Arctic tern. The chicks fledge in 22-28 days, usually 25-26. Fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days, and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions. The young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents {{until the end of the}} breeding season, and beyond. Common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds, at least until the adults move further south in about December.Like many terns, this species is very defensive of its nest and young, and will harass humans, dogs, muskrats and most diurnal birds, but unlike the more aggressive Arctic tern, it rarely hits the intruder, usually swerving off at the last moment. Adults can discriminate between individual humans, attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers. Nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks; colonies can be wiped out by rats, and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present.|$|E
5000|$|Megapodes {{are mainly}} solitary birds {{that do not}} {{incubate}} their eggs with their body heat as other birds do, but bury them. Their eggs are unusual in having a large yolk, making up 50-70% of the <b>egg</b> <b>weight.</b> The birds are best known for building massive nest-mounds of decaying vegetation, which the male attends, adding or removing litter to regulate the internal heat while the eggs hatch. However, some bury their eggs in other ways; there are burrow-nesters which use geothermal heat, and others which simply rely on {{the heat of the}} sun warming sand. Some species vary their incubation strategy depending on the local environment. [...] Although the Australian brushturkey was thought to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, this was later proven false; temperature does, however, affect embryo mortality and resulting offspring sex ratios. The non-social nature of their incubation raises questions as to how the hatchlings come to recognise other members of their species, which is due to imprinting in other members of the order Galliformes. Recent research suggests an instinctive visual recognition of specific movement patterns is made by the individual species of megapode.|$|E
50|$|Unusually for a {{wading bird}} of the llanos, this ibis breeds {{in the dry}} season months from August until February; whereas the {{majority}} of llanos avifauna breeds in the wet season around May to October. The sharp-tailed ibis breeds solitarily in gallery forests, where egg-laying is believed to occur from August to September; and fledged offspring remain with their parents until late February. Average egg measurements have been reported as 65.9 x 44mm and the average <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> as 70g. In a six-year wading bird survey of Masaguaral in the llanos, the sharp-tailed ibis was never seen on the lowland grasslands during the dry-season months of August and December. In one other study, it was not sighted in the months of December and January. Its secretive nesting behaviours probably explains its apparent absence from the open llanos grasslands during the breeding season. Details of courtship in this species are largely unknown. However, preening behaviours between mates have been observed in which one individual nibbles with its bill {{at the base of}} the other’s bill; which could potentially be part of courtship. Additionally, larger individuals have been observed to preen smaller individuals assumed to be their offspring, which also sometimes gently peck with their bills at the larger individuals in return.|$|E

Both <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> and chick weight: <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> ratio differences were highly significant (P<. 01).

40|$|ABSTRACT Egg {{quality and}} {{reproductive}} traits were measured and compared in four medium-bodied and seven large-bodied lines of turkeys. In the medium-bodied lines, hatchability of fertile eggs displayed a negative linear relationship with yolk weight and shell weight and a negative curvilinear relationship with <b>egg</b> <b>weight,</b> albumen weight, and {{the percentages of}} yolk, shell, and albumen. In contrast, hatchability of fertile eggs in large-bodied turkeys was related to <b>egg</b> <b>weight,</b> albumen weight, percent yolk, and percent albumen in a linear manner only. Selection for increased 16 -week body weight resulted in a 5. 8 g increase in <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> when compared to a randombred control. The increased <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> was due {{to an increase in}} both the absolute and relative amounts of albumen. Selection for increased egg production resulted in a major decrease in <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> which was associated with the production of relatively less albu-men. 1980 Poultry Science 59 : 417 - 42...|$|E
40|$|Aim: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> on hatchability, embryonic deaths and hatchling weight of three rural breeds (Fayoumi, Desi and crossbred (Rhode Island Red X Fayoumi) chickens. Materials and Methods: Three different <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> groups classified into small: (45 g) were used in the experiment. A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. Simultaneously quadratic type equation was used to determine the <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> for optimum hatchability and hatchling weight. Results: Percentage hatchability of medium-sized eggs was higher (P < 0. 05) than those in large sized eggs. Similarly, large–sized eggs had higher (P < 0. 05) percentage hatchability than small sized eggs in all breeds. Hatchability percentage changed by ratio 0. 4077 with one unit change in mean <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> of Fayoumi. The hatchability changed by ratio 0. 5488 with one unit change in <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> of Desi. The hatchability changed by ratio 0. 3767 with one unit change in <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> of crossbred chickens. Mean hatchling weight in Fayoumi eggs changed by ratio of 0. 6760; Desi eggs by ratio of 0. 5955 and crossbred chicken eggs by ratio of 1. 3613 with one unit change in mean <b>egg</b> <b>weight.</b> The overall mean hatchling weight as percentage of mean <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> in case of Fayoumi was 67. 10, in Desi 62. 42 and 68. 36 in case of cross birds. There was no evidence that hatchabilitypercentage increased with increase in <b>egg</b> <b>weight</b> in all the three strains of birds. Small-sized eggs had higher (P< 0. 05) embryonic deaths than those of medium and large-sized eggs in three breeds. Hatchling weight from large eggs were (P < 0. 05) higher than those of small eggs in three breeds. Mean hatchling weight of Fayoumi changed by ratio 0. 676 with one unit change in mean <b>egg</b> <b>weight.</b> In case of Desi chickens, mean hatchling weight changed by ratio 0. 5955 with one unit change in <b>egg</b> <b>weight.</b> In case of crossbred chicken, mean hatchling weight changed by ratio 1. 3613 with one unit change in egg. Conclusion: This study revealed that medium sized eggs were more appropriate for better hatchability percentage and lower embryonic deaths in three rural breeds. However, large sized eggs were suitable for better hatchling weigh...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The TA-XT 21 texture {{analyzer}} (TA) {{was used}} to evaluate vitelline membrane strength (VMS). Fresh and aged (1 wk at 25 C) eggs (n = 48 eggs × 2 replications) were evaluated. Fresh and aged eggs were further divided into two groups of yolk only or whole egg (with intact albumen). Yolk index, Haugh units, pH, broken-out <b>egg</b> <b>weights,</b> VMS, yolk viscosity, and scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM) images were evaluated. Results from the TA indicated a decrease in VMS in aged eggs compared to fresh eggs and in yolk-only eggs com-pared to whole eggs. The SEM images indicated a loss of structural integrity in aged eggs as compared to fres...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Pullets {{from high}} and low social-dominance strains of the White Leghorn (W. L.) and Rhode Island Red (R. I. R.) breeds were {{assembled}} in 32 flocks at 6 weeks of age; eight flocks per strain. At 19 weeks all birds were moved to strange pens; four flocks per strain were kept intact as to membership, whereas the other four were reassembled within strains so as to maximize number of strangers. Data were collected and analyzed for agonistic behavior from 19 to 31 and from 52 to 56 weeks, age at sexual maturity, <b>egg</b> <b>weights</b> at 32 and 55 weeks, hen-day rate of lay, hen-housed production and mortality. Intra-flock variability was significantly greater for the W. L. high dominance strain for rate of lay and hen-housed production, whereas the W. L. low strain was more variable for age at first <b>egg</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>weights.</b> High dominance strain R. I. R. pullets were more variable for age at sexual maturity only. Analyses of variance, based on flock means, indicated pullets of the W. L. high strain to be significantly inferior in egg production, survival, and to have smaller eggs than the W. L. low strain. Within the R. I. R. breed, the high strain matured earlier. Age at final assembly of flocks had no long-term effects on agonistic activity levels. However, pullets in flocks reassembled at 19 weeks interacted at elevated frequencies from 19 to about 26 to 30 weeks of age. Productivity traits were not significantly influenced by final flock assembly at 6 as compared to 19 weeks of age. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} agonistic behavior, social stress and how both appear to relate to productivity traits...|$|R
40|$|Dois experimentos foram realizados para avaliar, no primeiro, o efeito da idade da matriz sobre a uniformidade do peso de 1080 ovos e gemas e, no segundo, a influência da classificação de 9260 ovos sobre a eclodibilidade, a mortalidade embrionária e os pesos, absoluto e relativo, do pinto e do saco vitelino. Os tratamentos do experimento I foram ovos das matrizes com 31 (M 31), 38 (M 38) e 43 (M 43) semanas de idade. No segundo, os ovos das matrizes com 31, 38 e 43 semanas foram distribuídos em seis tratamentos; A: ovos com pesos entre 66 e 72 g, 33, 3 % deles originados de matrizes com diferentes idades; B: ovos com pesos entre 58 e 65 g, 33, 3 % deles originados de matrizes com diferentes idades; C: ovos com pesos entre 52 e 57 g, 33, 3 % deles originados de matrizes com diferentes idades; D: ovos com pesos entre 52 e 72 g, produzidos por matrizes com 31 semanas; E: ovos com pesos entre 52 e 72 g, produzidos por matrizes com 38 semanas; e F: ovos com pesos entre 52 e 72 g, produzidos por matrizes com 43 semanas. As aves de M 31 produziram ovos com pesos do ovo e da gema mais uniformes que as do M 43. Ovos do tratamento A apresentaram a pior eclosão e a maior mortalidade embrionária após 15 dias de incubação, e produziram pintos com maiores pesos absoluto e relativo do saco vitelino. Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} broiler breeder age on weight uniformity of 1, 080 eggs and yolks, and the effects of 9, 216 eggs classified prior to setting on hatchability, embryonic mortality, and the relationship between chick and yolk sac weights. In the first study, the three treatments were eggs from broiler breeders on 31 st (M 31), 38 th (M 38), and 43 th (M 43) -week of age. In the second study, eggs produced by three broiler breeders flocks (31 st, 38 th, and 43 th wk of age) were divided in six treatments; A: <b>eggs</b> <b>weighting</b> from 66 to 72 g, 33, 3 % of them produced by broiler breeders of different ages; B: <b>eggs</b> <b>weighting</b> from 58 to 65 g, 33, 3 % of them produced by broiler breeders of different ages; C: <b>eggs</b> <b>weighting</b> from 52 to 57 g, 33, 3 % of them produced by broiler breeders of different ages; D: eggs from 31 -wk-old broiler breeders, weighting from 52 to 72 g; E: eggs from 38 -wk-old broiler breeders, weighting from 52 to 72 g; F: eggs from 43 -wk- old broiler breeders weighting from 52 to 72 g. Eggs produced by M 31 had <b>egg</b> and yolk <b>weights</b> more uniform than the eggs collected from M 43. Treatment A had the worst hatchability, higher embryonic mortality after 15 days of incubation, and produced heavier hatched chicks with superior absolute and relative weights of yolk sac...|$|R
