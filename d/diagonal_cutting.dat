5000|$|Diagonal pliers (or wire cutters or <b>{{diagonal}}</b> <b>cutting</b> pliers or diagonal cutters or {{side cutting}} pliers) are pliers {{intended for the}} cutting of wire (they are generally not used to grab or turn anything). The plane defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or [...] "on a diagonal", hence the name.|$|E

The elegant parabola of the wharf induces serenity. Stretching into infinity, it evokes the immensity of the sea. Simultaneously, the sweeping <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutting</b> the composition in two provides contrasting movement.|$|E

Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.|$|R

This urban landscape synthesized the river, trees, clouds, buildings, steel bridges and smoke of the modern city. Partially geometrized forms—such as the green arc of tree on the upper left or arched doors and windows on the rectangular buildings in the center—are subjectively evoked through limited colour range; shifting perspectives, signified by long vertical and <b>diagonal</b> bands <b>cutting</b> off the edges of objects contained within them; and shifting relative scales of objects, such as the two steel bridge spans. [...] the Cubists justified this novel approach to pictorial space {{in part on the}} basis of the mathematician Henri Poincaré's theory of 'conventionalism'.|$|R
40|$|Cleaving {{crystals}} in {{a vacuum}} chamber is a simple method for obtaining atomically flat and clean surfaces for materials that have a preferential cleaving plane. Most in-situ cleavers use parallel cutting edges that are applied from two sides on the sample. We found in ambient experiments that <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutting</b> pliers, where the cleavage force is introduced in a single point instead of a line work very well also for hard materials. Here, we incorporate the <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutting</b> plier principle in a design compatible with ultra-high vacuum requirements. We show optical microscopy (mm scale) and atomic force microscopy (atomic scale) images of NiO(001) surfaces cleaved with this device.

40|$|Cutting plane {{methods are}} an {{alternative}} to interior methods to solve semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. In this paper, {{we are going to}} present five different cutting plane algorithms for semidefinite programming. The methods use relaxations and the semi-infinite representation of SDP’s. The presented methods are the polyhedral cutting plane method, the polyhedral bundle method, the block <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutting</b> plane method and the primal active set approach. We present also a generic cutting plane methods which tries to unify all the other methods. In the second part the implementation of the polyhedral cutting plane method into MATLAB is presented followed by some test examples...|$|E
40|$|A {{development}} of oil palm pruner and harvester machinery design {{implemented in the}} field still faces a problem {{due to the lack}} of effective and efficient design which is need to be solved. It was noted that in order to develop the design, an early data and information of physical and mechanical properties of palm oil frond and stem fruits is critically important. The objective of the research was to obtain the physical and mechanical properties of palm oil frond and stem in order to develop the design of pruner and harvester machinery. The result showed that tool machinery was been advantageous by the physical properties of the plant i. e. the total weight of frond and leaf which enable to support the cutting process. The average of total weight of frond and leaf was 16. 8 kg. The <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutting</b> trajectory was been more advantageous because of total weight and frond shape toward to the different of the plant tissue area. The measurement result shows that cutting curve follows the time required for cutting. The comparison among cutting curve shows differences in cutting thickness or length. In this case, the thickness is linear with cutting time. Besides, those curves show differences at the height which determine the maximum value of tested material cutting resistance. Alternative solution for machinery development design is pruner-harvester for height plant below 6 m and among 6 to 12 m. For below 6 m, pruner-harvester was designed by incorporating motor as power source and cutter-disc as the knife cutter. That condition was relied on that estate which was maintenance intensively commonly used cutter-disc. Pruner-harvester above 6 m and up to 12 m was improved based on manual egrek-designed by adding fresh fruit bunch alley supply glide in order to keep the fruits still in intact form. The consideration was based on affectivity and efficiency. It also considers homogenous ecological of palm oil plant which should be maintained to reduce global warming effect. Information obtained in this research could become positive consideration and alternative solution to provide problem solvingat early development design of palm oil pruner and harvester machinery.

40|$|We {{focus on}} the central spindle which {{supports}} the rotating magnetic platters which hold all of the data. The spindle must operate with great precision and stability at high rotational speeds. Design practice has converged on oil-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings as the most common choice for spindles. That is, a layer of viscous oil separates a rotating shaft (the bearing) from the fixed outer sleeve (the journal). In hard drives, {{it is very important}} for the shaft to be centered within the sleeve. Plain journal bearings (i. e. both surfaces are circular cylinders) are unstable to perturbations that push the shaft off-center. It was found that this stability problem can be overcome by <b>cutting</b> <b>diagonal</b> grooves into the journal in a pattern called a herring-bone. Another consequence of this design is that very high pressures are generated by the grooves as they drive the oil {{to the middle of the}} bearing, away from the top/bottom ends of the spindle. This pumping action generally works to oppose leakage out of the bearing. We examine how choices for the groove pattern can influence the key properties of the bearing. The focus is to understand the effect of the groove geometry on the pumping action. In particular the undesirable behavior caused by the low pressures created near the top/bottom ends of the bearing which, under many conditions, may result in the pressure becoming negative, relative to atmospheric pressure. Negative pressure can result in cavitation or, when it occurs near an air-oil interface, can cause air to be ingested and hence create bubbles. Any bubbles in the oil can corrupt the lubricating layer in the bearing and, as they are created and collapse, can cause significant undesirable vibrations. The negative pressures have therefore been identified as one of the key problems in design of hard disk drive bearings. We will use numerical computations and some analysis to show that by modifying the groove geometry we can reduce the negative pressure while retaining good stability characteristics...|$|R
