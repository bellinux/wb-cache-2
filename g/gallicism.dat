2500|$|It must {{be noted}} that {{anglicism}} is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, some anglicisms are actually Old French words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb [...] "to flirt" [...] cites influence from the Old French expression conter fleurette, which means [...] "to (try to) seduce". (Other possible origins for the word include flit, E. Frisian flirt (a flick or light stroke) and E. Frisian flirtje (a giddy girl)). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English <b>Gallicism</b> [...] "to flirt" [...] has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins.|$|E
2500|$|In Nature and Human Nature (Houghton Mifflin, 1892), [...] "Emerson {{treats the}} efforts {{that men have}} made to {{interpret}} the world through art. She discusses first the ideals in men's minds, then the various forms {{in which they have}} sought to embody these, – in music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. A specially interesting interpretation is given of landscape painting and Gothic architecture, with reference to the spiritual qualities which give significance to pictures and buildings. The Dial was less complimentary in its review of Nature and Human Nature stating: A desire to cover too large a field is apparent in Mrs. Ellen Russell Emerson’s “Nature and Human Nature” (Houghton). Literature, language, and art, including music, also come in for discussion. In her treatment of art, and symbolism in art, the author shows herself most at home, despite an occasional fanciful idea or far-fetched analogy. Her interpretation of the Laocoön as suggesting, in the serpents’ undulating folds, “the gliding stanchless waves of the sea, against whose onward movement there is no barrier,” is new to us. Were Poseidon the offended divinity in the case, this reading of the symbol would be more plausible. But the temptation to subtilize on art, as Lessing says in his “Laokoon,” sometimes leads one into whimsical theories. As an interpreter of nature, Mrs. Emerson is helpful. Passing to letters, she asserts that when a poet willingly becomes a translator of another's verse, he thereby stands confessed as a minor poet. Hence she refuses to recognize Longfellow and Bryant as great poets. Leaving Pope out of the account, does she forget that Goethe and Schiller and Browning also tried their hand at translating ? Or would she deny greatness to them as well? Evidently not; for she afterwards speaks of Browning in the same breath with Shakespeare, ascribing to both the “balance of heart and brain.” that marks the true poet. The writer's thought, it must be said in conclusion, suffers for lack of terseness and incisiveness in its presentation. We choose, almost at random, a sentence that cries out for the pruning-knife, – “Interpretation of the sublimity of an uplift of rock, forest, and tableland is product of a vision dependent on the soul's sight, and sublimity is not more intrinsic to mountainous scenery than is color to a garden of flowers.” The <b>Gallicism</b> in the following is so harsh, and so unnecessary, as to merit censure, – “Scientific discovery, indeed, has laid its axe to the root of many errors, and among which the error of self-importance is not the least conspicuous.” May linguistic discovery soon lay its axe to the root of this error of speech ! A number of new or little-used words, as “sculptuary” (i.g. sculpture), “bolide,” “landscapist,” are encountered in Mrs. Emerson's pleasant pages." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{a study of the}} {{translation}} from Swedish to French of the novel Montecore, The silence of the tiger by Jonas Hassen Khemiri. I have compared a number of <b>Gallicisms</b> (words or idioms borrowed from French) chosen in the original text with their translations in the French version. Using the theories on translation procedures of Vinay and Darbelnet from Stylistique comparée du français et de l’anglais (1999 [1958]), I have distinguished the strategies employed by the translators in the translation of the <b>Gallicisms.</b> I have also discussed the effects of the translation on the target text, the effects of normalisation in particular. Moreover, I have identified a few methods applied by the translators to compensate for the traits of normalisation on the target text. During my research I have discovered that the translation of the <b>Gallicisms</b> present in my study is more or less impossible. The effect of the <b>Gallicisms</b> in the original text remains untranslatable, regardless of which ”procédé technique de la traduction” (technical translation procedure) that has been used, oblique or direct. However, I notice that the translators have managed, by other means, to convey a certain absurdity from the original text to the French readers...|$|R

60|$|Mistress Carmen's {{little room}} was {{opposite}} to Thatcher's, and once or twice, the doors being open, Thatcher had a glimpse across {{the passage of}} a black-haired and a sturdy, boyish little figure in a great blue apron, perched on a stool before an easel, and on the other hand, Carmen had often been conscious of the fumes of a tobacco pipe penetrating her cloistered seclusion, and had seen across the passage, vaguely enveloped in the same nicotine cloud, an American Olympian, in a rocking chair, with his feet on the mantel shelf. They had once or twice met on the staircase, on which occasion Thatcher had greeted her with a word or two of respectful yet half-humorous courtesy,--a courtesy which never really offends a true woman, although it often piques her self-aplomb by the slight assumption of superiority in the humorist. A woman is quick to recognize the fact that the great and more dangerous passions are always SERIOUS, and may be excused if in self-respect she is often induced to try if there be not somewhere under the skin of this laughing Mercutio the flesh and blood of a Romeo. Thatcher was by nature a defender and protector; weakness, and weakness alone, stirred the depths of his tenderness,--often, I fear, only through its half-humorous aspects,--and on this plane he was pleased to place women and children. I mention this fact {{for the benefit of the}} more youthful members of my species, and am satisfied that an unconditional surrender and the complete laying down at the feet of Beauty of all strong masculinity is a cheap <b>Gallicism</b> that is untranslatable to most women worthy the winning. For a woman MUST always look up to the man she truly loves,--even if she has to go down on her knees to do it.|$|E
60|$|I {{will take}} first those {{cases in which}} {{something}} like the French sound has been preserved in certain single letters and diphthongs. And this opens a curious question as to how long this <b>Gallicism</b> maintained itself in England. Sometimes a divergence in pronunciation has given as two words with different meanings, as in genteel and jaunty, which I find coming in toward {{the close of the}} seventeenth century, and wavering between genteel and jantee. It is usual in America to drop the u in words ending in our--a very proper change recommended by Howell two centuries ago, and carried out by him so far as his printers would allow. This and the corresponding changes in musique, musick, and the like, which he also advocated, show that in his time the French accent indicated by the superfluous letters (for French had once nearly as strong an accent as Italian) had gone out of use. There is plenty of French accent down to the end of Elizabeth's reign. In Daniel we have riches' and counsel', in Bishop Hall comet', chapëlain, in Donne pictures', virtue', presence', mortal', merit', hainous', giant', with many more, and Marston's satires are full of them. The two latter, however, are not to be relied on, as they may be suspected of Chaucerizing. Herrick writes baptime. The tendency to throw the accent backward began early. But the incongruities are perplexing, and perhaps mark the period of transition. In Warner's 'Albion's England' we have creator' and crëature' {{side by side with the}} modern creator and creature. E'nvy and e'nvying occur in Campion (1602), and yet envy' survived Milton. In some cases we have gone back again nearer to the French, as in rev'enue for reven'ue, I had been so used to hearing imbecile pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, which is in accordance with the general tendency in such matters, that I was surprised to find imbec'ile in a verse of Wordsworth. The dictionaries all give it so. I asked a highly cultivated Englishman, and he declared for imbeceel'. In general it may be assumed that accent will finally settle on the syllable dictated by greater ease and therefore quickness of utterance. Blas'-phemous, for example, is more rapidly pronounced than blasphem'ous, to which our Yankee clings, following in this the usage of many of the older poets. Amer'ican is easier than Ameri'can, and therefore the false quantity has carried the day, though the true one may be found in George Herbert, and even so late as Cowley.|$|E

At the end of the article, the Author illustrates his text by an amusing story, which contains a lot of <b>Gallicisms</b> that are universally applied in contemporary Polish. M.

6000|$|Newman {{called upon}} the comical duchess {{and found her}} at home. An old gentleman with a high nose and a gold-headed cane was just taking leave of her; he made Newman a {{protracted}} obeisance as he retired, and our hero supposed {{that he was one}} of the mysterious grandees with whom he had shaken hands at Madame de Bellegarde's ball. The duchess, in her arm-chair, from which she did not move, with a great flower-pot on one side of her, a pile of pink-covered novels on the other, and a large piece of tapestry depending from her lap, presented an expansive and imposing front; but her aspect was in the highest degree gracious, and there was nothing in her manner to check the effusion of his confidence. She talked to him about flowers and books, getting launched with marvelous promptitude; about the theatres, about the peculiar institutions of his native country, about the humidity of Paris about the pretty complexions of the American ladies, about his impressions of France and his opinion of its female inhabitants. All this was a brilliant monologue on the part of the duchess, who, like many of her country-women, was a person of an affirmative rather than an interrogative cast of mind, who made mots and put them herself into circulation, and who was apt to offer you a present of a convenient little opinion, neatly enveloped in the gilt paper of a happy <b>Gallicism.</b> Newman had come to her with a grievance, but he found himself in an atmosphere in which apparently no cognizance was taken of grievance; an atmosphere into which the chill of discomfort had never penetrated, and which seemed exclusively made up of mild, sweet, stale intellectual perfumes. The feeling with which he had watched Madame d'Outreville at the treacherous festival of the Bellegardes came back to him; she struck him as a wonderful old lady in a comedy, particularly well up in her part. He observed before long that she asked him no questions about their common friends; she made no allusion to the circumstances under which he had been presented to her. She neither feigned ignorance of a change in these circumstances nor pretended to condole with him upon it; but she smiled and discoursed and compared the tender-tinted wools of her tapestry, as if the Bellegardes and their wickedness were not of this world. [...] "She is fighting shy!" [...] said Newman to himself; and, having made the observation, he was prompted to observe, farther, how the duchess would carry off her indifference. She did so in a masterly manner. There was not a gleam of disguised consciousness in those small, clear, demonstrative eyes which constituted her nearest claim to personal loveliness, there was not a symptom of apprehension that Newman would trench upon the ground she proposed to avoid. [...] "Upon my word, she does it very well," [...] he tacitly commented. [...] "They all hold together bravely, and, whether any one else can trust them or not, they can certainly trust each other." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{come back}} to the matter in hand. Our 'uplandish man' retains the soft or thin sound of the u in some words, such as rule, truth (sometimes also {{pronounced}} tr[)u]th, not trooth), while he says noo for new, and gives to view and few so indescribable a mixture of the two sounds with a slight nasal tincture that it may be called the Yankee shibboleth. Voltaire says that the English pronounce true as if it rhymed with view, and this is the sound our rustics give to it. Spenser writes deow (dew) which can only be pronounced with the Yankee nasality. In rule the least sound of a precedes the u. I find reule in Pecock's 'Repressor.' He probably pronounced it rayoolë, as the old French word from which it is derived was very likely to be sounded at first, with a reminiscence of its original regula. Tindal has reuler, and the Coventry Plays have preudent. In the 'Parlyament of Byrdes' I find reule. As for noo, may it not claim some sanction in its derivation, whether from nouveau or neuf, the ancient sound of which may very well have been noof, as nearer novus? Beef would seem more like to have come from buffe than from boeuf, unless the two were mere varieties of spelling. The Saxon few may have caught enough from its French cousin peu to claim the benefit of the same doubt as to sound; and our slang phrase a few (as 'I licked him a few') may well appeal to un peu for sense and authority. Nay, might not lick itself {{turn out to be the}} good old word lam in an English disguise, it the latter should claim descent as, perhaps, he fairly might, from the Latin lambere? The New England ferce for fierce, and perce for pierce (sometimes heard as fairce and pairce), are also Norman. For its antiquity I cite the rhyme of verse and pierce in Chapman and Donne, and in some commendatory verses by a Mr. Berkenhead before the poems of Francis Beaumont. Our pairlous for perilous is of the same kind, and is nearer Shakespeare's parlous than the modern pronunciation. One other <b>Gallicism</b> survives in our pronunciation. Perhaps I should rather call it a semi-Gallicism, for it is the result of a futile effort to reproduce a French sound with English lips. Thus for joint, employ, royal, we have jynt, emply, r[)y]le, the last differing only from rile (roil) in a prolongation of the y sound. I find royal so pronounced in the 'Mirror for Magistrates.' In Walter de Biblesworth I find solives Englished by gistes. This, it is true, may have been pronounced jeests, but the pronunciation jystes must have preceded the present spelling, which was no doubt adopted after the radical meaning was forgotten, as analogical with other words in oi. In the same way after Norman-French influence had softened the l out of would (we already find woud for veut in N.F. poems), should followed the example, and then an l was foisted into could, where it does not belong, to satisfy the logic of the eye, which has affected the pronunciation and even the spelling of English more than is commonly supposed. I meet with eyster for oyster as early as the fourteenth century. I find viage in Bishop Hall and Middleton the dramatist, bile for boil in Donne and Chrononhotonthologos, line for loin in Hall, ryall and chyse (for choice) dystrye for destroy, in the Coventry Plays. In Chapman's 'All Fools' is the misprint of employ for imply, fairly inferring an identity of sound in the last syllable. Indeed, this pronunciation was habitual till after Pope, and Rogers tells us that the elegant Gray said naise for noise just as our rustics still do. Our cornish (which I find also in Herrick) remembers the French better than cornice does. While clinging more closely to the Anglo-Saxon in dropping the g from the end of the present participle, the Yankee now and then pleases himself with an experiment in French nasality in words ending in n. It is not, so far as my experience goes, very common, though it may formerly have been more so. Capting, for instance, I never heard save in jest, the habitual form being kepp'n. But at any rate it is no invention of ours. In that delightful old volume, 'Ane Compendious Buke of Godly and Spirituall Songs,' in which I know not whether the piety itself or the simplicity of its expression be more charming, I find burding, garding, and cousing, and in the State Trials uncerting used by a gentleman. I confess that I like the n better than ng.|$|E

40|$|The anglicization of French {{has long}} been {{perceived}} as a major problem and much effort has been made both in France and in Canada to minimize its effects. The gallicization of English, though a problem of much smaller magnitude, has also been observed, particularly {{in areas such as}} Quebec where French is the dominant language. However, gallicization his received much less attention than anglicization. In fact, there seems to be little concern among Quebec's anglophones over the gallicization of English, which many do not perceive as being a problem. This lack of interest is not without potential consequences, for, as several linguists have noted, if the current trend towards "Frenglish" is not halted, the English of Quebec's anglo-phone minority may eventually become unintelligible to other English-speaking Canadians. This thesis studies gallicization and has two main objectives: to provide a theoretical and historical background to the phenomenon, and to create a prototype checker of <b>gallicisms.</b> The study includes: a discussion of interference, borrowing and <b>gallicisms,</b> including a definition of the term "gallicism"; a brief history of the English language in Canada with an emphasis on the various influences that have shaped Canadian English; a discussion of Quebec English and its distinguishing feature [...] gallicisms; a classification system of the different types of gallicism; a set of procedures for verifying suspected gallicisms; the results of an informal experiment where commercially-available tools were applied to a test document containing known gallicisms; a description of a prototype <b>gallicisms</b> checker...|$|R

For instance, one attested origin of the verb [...] "to flirt" [...] cites influence from the Old French expression conter fleurette, which means [...] "to (try to) seduce". (Other possible origins for the word include flit, E. Frisian flirt (a flick or light stroke) and E. Frisian flirtje (a giddy girl)).
