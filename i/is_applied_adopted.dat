The frontal view smiling photograph was modified to create from 1 mm to 5 mm deviations in the upper midline to the left side. The photographs were cropped in two different manners and divided into two groups of six photographs each: group LCN included the lips, chin, and two-thirds of the nose, and group L included the lips only. The laypersons performed the rate of each smile using a visual analog scale (VAS).

40|$|Cloud-resolving model {{simulations}} of radiative–convective equilibrium are conducted in both {{two and three}} dimensions (2 D and 3 D) to {{examine the effect of}} dimensionality on the equilibrium statistics. Convection is forced by a fixed imposed profile of radiative cooling and surface fluxes from fixed temperature ocean. In the control experiment, using the same number of grid points in both 2 D and 3 D and a zero mean wind, the temperature and moisture profiles diverge considerably after a few days of simulations. Two mechanisms are shown to be responsible for this. First, 2 D geometry causes higher perturbation surface winds resulting from deep convective downdrafts, which lead to a warmer, moister boundary layer and a warmer tropospheric mean temperature state. Additionally, 2 D geometry encourages spontaneous large-scale organization, in which areas far away from convection become very dry and thus inhibit further convection there, leading to a drier mean atmosphere. Further experiments were conducted in which horizontal mean winds <b>were</b> <b>applied,</b> <b>adopting</b> both constant and sheared vertical profiles. With mean surface winds that are of the same magnitude as downdraft outflow velocities or greater, convection can no longer increase mean surface fluxes, and the temperature differences between 2 D and 3 D are greatly reduced. However, the organization of convection still exists with imposed wind profiles. Repeating the experiments on a small 2 D domain produced similar equilibrium profiles to the 3 D investigations, since the limited domain artificially reduces surface wind speeds, and also restricts mesoscale organization. The main conclusions are that for modeling convection that is highly two-dimensionally organized, such as squall lines or Walker-type circulations over strong SST gradients, and for which a reasonable mean surface wind exists, it is possible that a 2 D model can be used. However, for random or clustered convection, and especially in low wind environments, it is highly preferable to use a 3 D cloud model. 1...|$|R

In {{the field}} of modern manufacturing, {{flexible}} manufacturing systems (FMS) is very important because it can scheduleand optimize multipurpose machines to produce multiple types of products.

Therefore, reachability analysis is one of the most important problems of FMS.
