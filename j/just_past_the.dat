5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} runway before it could become airborne.

5|$|US395 {{returns to}} California as a freeway, but is soon {{downgraded}} to a divided highway <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> state line. The road follows Long Valley Creek {{along the edge}} of the Sierra towards Honey Lake. From this point north, the highway follows a rail line originally built by the Nevada-California-Oregon Railway; the line is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|After NY448, NY117 {{becomes a}} four-lane, {{undivided}} at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> NY448 junction, NY117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY9A and NY100) and the northbound {{direction of the}} Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on {{its way into the}} village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. NY117 remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community's central business district.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> far post.|$|E

5|$|In Massena, {{the forests}} along NY420 subside {{slightly}} {{as it passes}} by industrial warehouses and residences. The route curves back to the northwest as it enters the village of Massena. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> village line, NY420 crosses the St. Lawrence Subdivision, a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation. The highway continues on, curving northward to cross the Raquette River. It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY37 south of the village center. NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north {{into the heart of}} the village as Main Street.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> county line in Oneida Castle, NY5 intersects NY365, a route leading northward to the New York State Thruway in Verona. NY5 presses on, {{passing through}} the city of Sherrill and the village of Vernon (briefly {{overlapping}} NY31) {{and the town of}} Westmoreland to the town of Kirkland, where NY5 intersects NY233, crosses over Oriskany Creek, and meets the western terminus of NY5B. The spur of NY5 later rejoins its parent yards from where NY5A departs NY5 to serve western Utica. NY5 itself continues eastward through New Hartford, meeting NY12B prior to merging with NY12 at Genesee Street. Both routes continue eastward across the Sauquoit Creek into Utica.|$|E
5|$|NY268 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY97 in eastern Hancock. The route heads northeast, paralleling the Quickway (NY17) {{and following the}} east branch of the Delaware River's northern bank through the town of Hancock toward the hamlet of Cadosia. South of the hamlet, NY268 connects to NY17 at exit87A; however, there is no access between NY268 and westbound NY17. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> exit, NY268 leaves the pre-Quickway routing of NY17 and follows Cadosia Creek north through a large valley into Cadosia.|$|E

5|$|The {{lopsided}} victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren {{entered the}} game in the thirdquarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> midpoint of the fourthquarter. Since Colt McCoy was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005season, choosing to redshirt him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, Jevan Snead – ranked {{as one of the top}} high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from University of Florida to Texas.|$|E
5|$|The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944, under section10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939. However, {{the highway}} was mostly {{a series of}} tracks through remote {{pastoral}} areas, with the sealed road ending <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or worse still, were completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|The river then {{runs along}} the west of V. Everit Macy Park. As part of the park facilities, the Saw Mill River is impounded into Woodlands Lake, the largest {{impoundment}} on the Saw Mill River, used as a water supply by the local communities of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, whose northern village line is just to the south. The river runs close to {{the boundary between the}} two, as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Ashford Avenue bridge.|$|E

At 7miles (11km) the trail leaves the park and Fayette County, and enters Lower Turkeyfoot Township in Somerset County and Pennsylvania State Game Lands No. 111. Just before 15miles (24km), the trail enters Laurel Ridge State Park for the first time, where it continues northeast. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> 17miles (27km) <b>the</b> trail turns north, and crosses back into Fayette County (now Springfield Township), where the second overnight shelter with potable water is found.|$|R
50|$|<b>Just</b> <b>past</b> Brunswick Junction, <b>the</b> highway heads {{southwest}} towards Western Australia's third-largest city, Bunbury. The typical scenery on {{this part}} of the highway includes small dairy farms and orchards, jarrah and marri remnant forests and pine plantations.|$|R
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses the Mojave Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave. Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's goalscoring chance came in {{the fifth}} minute when Poyet found Di Matteo, who fumbled his {{opportunity}} as it went over the goal. Stuttgart almost took the lead through Bobic, who took advantage of Steve Clarke's poor clearance but Bobic's attempt went <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> right goalpost. The Germans continued to push forward, as Balakov had a chance on goal, after being found by Poschner, but his shot was kept out by Ed de Goey to mark the first save of the match. Chelsea held on however; a few minutes later, Poyet ran towards the ball to direct a powerful volley on goal following a weak clearing header from Berthold, but a well-placed Franz Wohlfahrt dived to read the attempt. Chelsea had another chance before half time, which saw Wise from a Di Matteo free kick launch another volley, with the successive effort going just off the target.|$|E
5|$|Further {{north in}} Lysander, NY48 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Baldwinsville Subdivision {{before turning to}} the {{northeast}} as it passes through the hamlet of Wrights Corners and entering Oswego County. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> county line in Granby, the route turns northwest, following the western bank the Oswego River (and paralleling County Route57 or CR57 on the opposite side) as it intersects CR46 near the hamlet of Hinmansville. NY48 continues along the riverbank {{to the city of}} Fulton, where it gains the name West First Street south of an intersection with NY176. Like NY31 in Baldwinsville, NY48 originally overlapped NY176 north to NY3 (Broadway), where NY176 continued east. Now, however, NY176 ends here and NY48 continues solo to NY3. Past Broadway, NY48 proceeds north through the remainder of Fulton, now paralleling NY481 extremely close with just Oswego River separating the two.|$|E
50|$|The R238 travels {{north from}} the N13 at Bridge End. The road travels along Lough Swilly to reach Buncrana. From there the road {{proceeds}} inland to Carndonagh.

50|$|The byway goes between La Pine and <b>just</b> <b>past</b> Lakeview at <b>the</b> California border. It runs {{southeast}} on Oregon Route 31 {{for most}} of its length, then continues at the intersection with U.S. Route 395 to the Oregon-California border.|$|R
5|$|I-70 enters Colorado from Utah, {{concurrent}} with US6 and US50, on {{a plateau}} {{between the north}} rim of Ruby Canyon of the Colorado River and the south rim of the Book Cliffs. The plateau ends <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> state line and the highway descends into the Grand Valley, formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area, the largest conurbation in the area locally known as the Western Slope. The highway directly serves the communities of Fruita, Grand Junction and Palisade. Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City and serves as the economic hub of the area. The freeway passes {{to the north of}} downtown, while US6 and 50 retain their original routes through downtown. US6 rejoins I-70 east of Grand Junction; US50 departs on a course toward Pueblo.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
5|$|It {{continues}} south through {{blocks of}} small-scale dense urban development to 14th Street. Glenwood Springs High School {{is on the}} west <b>just</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> intersection heralds the end of downtown. For two blocks the land around the road becomes a commercial strip with large parking lots. At Hyland Park on the east just afterwards, the land across the road is devoted to larger houses on larger lots. Strip development resumes {{on the west side}} south of 19th Street, two blocks west of Valley View Hospital. At 23rd Street, Highway 82 turns southeast to follow South Glen Avenue, paralleling the adjacent Rio Grande rail trail. Development along the highway becomes predominantly commercial, and south of 27th Street a continuous strip begins on the east side as the valley narrows. After passing Rosebud Cemetery on the west side, Highway 82 turns more to the southeast and draws alongside the Roaring Fork as it reaches the city limits.|$|E
