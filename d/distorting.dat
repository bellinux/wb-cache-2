5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without <b>distorting</b> {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots.

40|$|Abstract. Histology {{acquisition}} often introduces tissue distortions {{that make}} 3 D reconstruction difficult. We present a framework to detect <b>distorted</b> slices, <b>distorted</b> structures and eventually correct the distortions by a reasonable estimation. The first detection specifies <b>distorted</b> slices by comparing similarity measures {{in a group}} of neighbouring slices. The <b>distorted</b> structures detection attempts to predict the type, size and position of the distortions {{in the absence of a}} priori information about expected distortions. The last algorithm uses undistorted tissue information in corresponding regions in neighbouring slices to correct <b>distorted</b> areas, facilitating pair-wise slice registration for 3 D reconstruction. ...|$|R

5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation <b>distorting</b> the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E

Given that the tail conditional distribution is a particular <b>distorted</b> distribution, a natural question is whether this result can be extended to include other classes of variability measures associated to general <b>distorted</b> distributions. As we show in this paper, the answer is yes, by focusing on <b>distorted</b> distributions associated to concave distortion functions.

5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, <b>distorting</b> the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other <b>distorting</b> factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|The temple pattern could vary considerably, {{apart from}} the <b>distorting</b> effect of {{additional}} construction. Many temples, known as hypogea, were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at Wadi es-Sebua. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at Deir el-Bahari, the processional path ran {{up a series of}} terraces rather than sitting on a single level. The Ptolemaic Temple of Kom Ombo was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run the length of the building. The most idiosyncratic temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at el-Amarna, in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} {{criticism}} of MIS companies generally, and Great Southern Group (as the largest {{company in the}} sector) in particular, suggesting that their appetite for land for plantations and agribusiness was driving up land prices in some regions, and <b>distorting</b> some commodity markets. In 2004, Great Southern's leading competitor Timbercorp reported a rise in plantation land prices from around A$3,000 to around A$6,000 per hectare in just five years. The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land, with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations. Some farmers claimed that MIS were driving up prices in agricultural water markets. Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing shrinkage of towns or was, conversely, stimulating employment.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the <b>distorting</b> effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{following}} {{a flash of}} light, the stone {{at the base of}} the Mana Tree cracks, <b>distorting</b> time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower to pray, and goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When the bird is defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana.|$|E

40|$|For {{humans as}} social beings, other people’s hands are highly {{visually}} conspicuous. Exceptionally striking are hands in other than natural configuration {{which have been}} found to elicit distinct brain activation. Here we studied response strength and lateralization of this activation using event-related potentials (ERPs), in particular, occipitotemporal N 1 responses as correlates of activation in extrastriate body area. Participants viewed computer-generated images of hands, half of them showing <b>distorted</b> fingers, the other half showing natural fingers. As control stimuli of similar geometric complexity, images of chairs were shown, half of them with <b>distorted</b> legs, half with standard legs. The contrast of interest was between <b>distorted</b> and natural/standard stimuli. For hands, stronger N 1 responses were observed for <b>distorted</b> (vs natural) stimuli from 170 ms post stimulus. Such stronger N 1 responses were found for <b>distorted</b> hands and absent for <b>distorted</b> chairs, therefore likely unrelated to visuospatial processing of the unusual <b>distorted</b> shapes. Rather, N 1 modulation over both hemispheres - but robustly right-lateralized - could reflect <b>distorted</b> hands as emotionally laden stimuli. The results are in line with privileged visual processing of hands as highly salient body parts, with distortions engaging neural resources that are especially activated for biological stimuli in social perception...|$|R

5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, <b>distorting</b> the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E

A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, <b>distorting</b> it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
