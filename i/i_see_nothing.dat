25|$|Let us {{remember}} that we form a government for millions not yet in existence.... In the course {{of four or five}} hundred years, I do not know how it will work. This is most certain, that Papists may occupy that chair, and Mahometans may take it. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> against it.|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{continued}} the educational projects {{that had always}} been important to him, helping to establish the [...] "Northumberland Academy" [...] and donating his library to the fledgling institution. He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with Thomas Jefferson, who used this advice when founding the University of Virginia. Jefferson and Priestley became close, {{and when he had}} completed his General History of the Christian Church, he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that [...] "it is now only that I can say <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{continued}} the educational projects {{that had been}} important to him throughout his life, helping to establish a [...] "Northumberland Academy" [...] and donating his library to the fledging institution. He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with Thomas Jefferson, who used the advice when founding the University of Virginia.

[...] Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume General History that was the most important. Stretching from 475 CE to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its [...] "corruptions", referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1772â€“74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.|$|E

500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Louisa May Alcott's father Amos Bronson Alcott {{predicted}} the sketches [...] "likely to be popular, {{the subject and}} style of treatment alike commending it to the reader, and to the Army especially. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> {{in the way of}} a good appreciation of Louisa's merits as a woman and a writer. Nothing could be more surprising to her or agreeable to us." [...] Her father was right; when it proved popular, Alcott was surprised by her own success. As she wrote: [...] "I cannot see why people like a few extracts from topsey turvey letters written on inverted tea kettles, waiting for gruel to warm, or poultices to cool, [...] for boys to wake and be tormented." [...] Henry James, Sr. wrote her a letter to applaud [...] "her charming pictures of hospital service." [...] The Boston Evening Transcript called the book [...] "fluent and sparkling, with touches of quiet humor and lively wit". Alcott herself wrote, [...] "I find I've done a good thing without knowing it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Vanderbank was {{conscious}} of a deep desire to draw from him whatever might come; so sensible was it somehow that whatever in him was good was also thoroughly personal. But our young friend had to think a minute. [...] "I <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Nothing's</b> more probable than that I've said something nasty; but which of my particular horrors?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting {{inequality}} of fortune, {{and perhaps}} a little disparity of age, <b>I</b> can <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> unsuitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless my soul! {{this is most}} extraordinary. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> of this," [...] he said, {{appealing}} in dumb show to his companion.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is my opinion, doctor," [...] said Gavin, [...] "that {{you will}} have bones to set before that game is finished. <b>I</b> can <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> but legs now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So do I, Bob," [...] she {{returned}} fondly. Then {{she gave a}} sigh. [...] "I wonder when we will reach Cedar Island. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> like cedar trees around here." ...|$|E
60|$|OCTAVIUS. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>nothing</b> {{new about}} him, except {{your way of}} {{chaffing}} him. But I don't {{want to talk about}} him just now. I want to speak to you about Ann.|$|E

6000|$|I {{followed}} cautiously; but, although I groped {{about in}} all directions, <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>nothing.</b> So <b>I</b> stood quite still {{with my back}} to the wall, and called out softly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dingaan?" [...] she asked. [...] "Is Dingaan dead? He {{was well}} enough when--when Richard came to Zululand, {{and since then}} <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> of him. How did he die?" ...|$|R
