25|$|While in Staten Island, Intrepid {{underwent}} {{the next}} phase of her refurbishment, and received an $8million interior renovation. Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general berthing quarters and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Around 1,200 tons of her original weight in steel were removed and 339 <b>epoxy-coated</b> steel pilings ranging in length from 60 to 183 feet were installed. Intrepid also received a new coat of paint, using almost 7,000 gallons to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks. Total cost of the renovation was $120million — $55million for the ship and $65million for Pier86.|$|E
25|$|Although fully mineralized and {{containing}} no water—and {{therefore not}} subject to dehydration and subsequent crazing as seen in opal—ammolite is often damaged due to environmental exposure. The thin, delicate sheets in which ammolite occurs are also problematic; for these reasons, most material is impregnated with a clear epoxy or other synthetic resin to stabilize the flake-prone ammolite prior to cutting. Although the tessellated cracking cannot be repaired, the epoxy prevents further flaking and helps protect the relatively soft surface from scratching. The impregnation process was developed {{over a number of}} years by Korite in partnership with the Alberta Research Council. Impregnated and <b>epoxy-coated</b> ammolite first entered the market in 1989 and the treatment significantly increased the availability and durability of the gem.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), <b>epoxy-coated,</b> hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

50|$|Many {{states are}} {{retrofitting}} older highways with <b>epoxy-coated</b> dowel bars. The retrofit begins with cutting of six slots (three in each wheel path) across all transverse joints or cracks. The slots are cut with ganged diamond saws that make six cuts in each wheel path. The concrete between the saw cuts is then removed with lightweight jackhammers (heavy-weight jackhammers tend {{to damage the}} concrete around the cuts). The <b>epoxy-coated</b> dowel bars are placed in the slots, then the slots are filled with grout and the joints or cracks are filled with waterproof caulk. The final step is to diamond-grind the joint to remove both excess grout and any displacement of the panels.|$|E

5000|$|Common rebar {{is made of}} {{unfinished}} tempered steel, {{making it}} susceptible to rusting. Normally the concrete cover is able to provide a pH value higher than 12 avoiding the corrosion reaction. Too little concrete cover can compromise this guard through carbonation from the surface, and salt penetration. Too much concrete cover can cause bigger crack widths which also compromises the local guard. As rust takes up greater volume than the steel from which it was formed, it causes severe internal pressure on the surrounding concrete, leading to cracking, spalling, and ultimately, structural failure. This phenomenon is known as oxide jacking. This is a particular problem where the concrete is exposed to salt water, as in bridges where salt is applied to roadways in winter, or in marine applications. Uncoated, corrosion-resistant low carbon/chromium (microcomposite), <b>epoxy-coated,</b> galvanized or stainless steel rebars may be employed in these situations at greater initial expense, but significantly lower expense over the service life of the project. Extra care is taken during the transport, fabrication, handling, installation, and concrete placement process when working with <b>epoxy-coated</b> rebar, because damage will reduce the long-term corrosion resistance of these bars. Even damaged bars have shown better performance than uncoated reinforcing bars, though issues from debonding of the epoxy coating from the bars and corrosion under the epoxy film have been reported. [...] These bars are used in over 70,000 bridge decks in the USA.|$|E

50|$|Dowel Bar Retrofit (DBR) is {{a process}} that re-establishes load {{transfer}} capability on doweled joints and cracks by installing <b>epoxy-coated,</b> round steel dowels into existing concrete pavement across transverse joints and/or cracks. Slots are cut using diamond-tipped saw blades; the existing concrete is removed and the dowels are placed in the slots across the joints or cracks. The slots are then backfilled with a non-shrink grout and the pavement is diamond ground to restore smoothness. The diamond grinding removes excess grout and any displacement of panels. The entire road is often diamond ground to remove bumps or dips and provide a safe, quiet riding surface. In Wisconsin, researchers found that the overall accident rate for diamond ground surfaces was only 60 percent of the rate for the non-ground surfaces.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "reef ready" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "drilled" [...] tank is often used. This style of tank has holes drilled {{into the rear}} pane {{allowing}} water to drain into the sump or refugium. These drains are usually housed in an internal overflow apparatus made of plastic or glass which encloses a drain standpipe and a water return line (See fig 1, a). The surface water pours over the overflow, down the standpipe (See fig 1, b), through PVC piping, into the sump. After transiting the sump, water is pushed by a return water pump through the second hole and into the aquarium (See fig 1, c). Alternatively, standard non-drilled aquariums employ an external [...] "hang-on" [...] overflow that feeds water via continuous siphon to the sump (See fig 1 d).

The average bond ratios were 0. 78 and 0. 75 for repeated loading test. ^ Higher concrete compressive strength resulted in lower bond ratio. Higher stress range resulted in lower splitting load. The influence of stress range on bond ratio was not clear. Higher peak stress resulted in larger splitting and failure deflection. Higher mean stress caused larger splitting and failure load for uncoated specimens. The influence of deformation pattern on crack width and deflection was unclear. The influence of extra-thickness of coating on bond ratio was not significant. Specimens with extra thickness of coating had larger deflection. The influence of extra thickness of coating on crack width was inconclusive. The post splitting load for epoxy coated specimens was smaller than that of uncoated specimens.
