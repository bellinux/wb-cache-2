5|$|Brachytherapy {{treatment}} for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary {{symptoms such as}} urinary retention, urinary <b>incontinence</b> or painful urination (dysuria).|$|E
5|$|Unilateral pudendal nerve {{neuropathy}} inconsistently causes fecal <b>incontinence</b> in some, but not others. This {{is because}} crossover innervation {{of the external}} anal sphincter occurs in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{symptoms}} are frequently {{lacking in the}} elderly. The presentations may be vague with <b>incontinence,</b> a change in mental status, or fatigue as the only symptoms, while some present to a health care provider with sepsis, an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms. Diagnosis can be {{complicated by the fact}} that many elderly people have preexisting <b>incontinence</b> or dementia.|$|E
5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal <b>incontinence.</b> Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary <b>incontinence,</b> and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary <b>incontinence</b> can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural {{interventions}} {{attempt to}} identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as <b>incontinence.</b> There {{is a lack of}} high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, <b>incontinence</b> of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal <b>incontinence.</b> The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal <b>incontinence.</b> Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal <b>incontinence,</b> forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her <b>incontinence,</b> beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is suitable}} for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and {{has been shown to}} be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and <b>incontinence.</b> The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after 1 to 2 days.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal <b>incontinence.</b> The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary <b>incontinence.</b> It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary <b>incontinence,</b> and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as <b>incontinence</b> and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary <b>incontinence,</b> nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal <b>incontinence,</b> vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk <b>incontinence,</b> and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{continuous}} spectrum of different clinical presentations from <b>incontinence</b> of flatus (gas), through <b>incontinence</b> of mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term anal <b>incontinence</b> often {{is used to}} describe flatus <b>incontinence,</b> however it is also used as a synonym for FI generally. It may occur together with <b>incontinence</b> of liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. Flatus <b>incontinence</b> {{may be the first}} sign of FI. Once continence to flatus is lost, it is rarely restored. Anal <b>incontinence</b> may be equally disabling as the other types. Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe <b>incontinence</b> of liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity (staining, soilage, seepage and accidents). Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as encopresis. Fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge, but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of <b>incontinence.</b> Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production, or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum. Solid stool <b>incontinence</b> may be called complete (or major) <b>incontinence,</b> and anything less as partial (or minor) <b>incontinence</b> (i.e. <b>incontinence</b> of flatus (gas), liquid stool and/or mucus).|$|E
25|$|Urinary <b>incontinence.</b> An {{accepted}} use for amitriptyline in Australia is {{the treatment}} of urinary urge <b>incontinence.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} with surgery is the {{development}} of anal <b>incontinence.</b> Anal <b>incontinence</b> can include inability to control gas, mild fecal soiling, or loss of solid stool. Some degree of <b>incontinence</b> can occur in up to 45 percent of patients in the immediate surgical recovery period. However, <b>incontinence</b> is rarely permanent and is usually mild. The risk should be discussed with one's surgeon.|$|E
25|$|Related {{conditions}} can include apraxia, dysarthria or other communication disorders, sensory impairments, urinary <b>incontinence,</b> fecal <b>incontinence,</b> or behavioural disorders.|$|E
25|$|Flatus <b>incontinence</b> {{where there}} is {{involuntary}} passage of gas, {{is a type of}} faecal <b>incontinence,</b> and is managed similarly.|$|E
25|$|LIS does, however, have {{a number}} of {{potential}} side effects including problems with incision site healing and <b>incontinence</b> to flatus and faeces (some surveys of surgical results suggest <b>incontinence</b> rates of up to 36%).|$|E
25|$|Duloxetine {{failed to}} receive US {{approval}} for stress urinary <b>incontinence</b> amid concerns over liver toxicity and suicidal events; however, it was approved for this {{use in the}} UK, where it is recommended as an add-on medication in stress urinary <b>incontinence</b> instead of surgery.|$|E
25|$|Urinary <b>incontinence</b> and vaginal {{prolapse}} {{are well}} known adverse effects that develop with high frequency {{a very long time}} after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery. For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for urinary <b>incontinence</b> is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary stress <b>incontinence</b> following hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Urinary <b>incontinence</b> {{is often}} found in old age.|$|E
25|$|May {{be used to}} {{evaluate}} <b>incontinence,</b> but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan. There may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram. Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative <b>incontinence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{is linked}} to urinary <b>incontinence,</b> though its {{appearance}} may be under-recognized.|$|E
25|$|Neutering {{also has}} been {{associated}} with an increased likelihood of urethral sphincter <b>incontinence</b> in male dogs.|$|E
25|$|An adult diaper (or adult nappy) is {{a diaper}} {{made to be}} worn by {{a person with a}} body larger than that of an infant or toddler. Diapers can be {{necessary}} for adults with various conditions, such as <b>incontinence,</b> mobility impairment, severe diarrhea or dementia. Adult diapers are made in various forms, including those resembling traditional child diapers, underpants, and pads resembling sanitary napkins (known as <b>incontinence</b> pads).|$|E
25|$|Progressive spastic {{weakness}} in legs and <b>incontinence</b> {{may be caused}} by tumors that overlie the parasagittal frontoparietal region.|$|E
25|$|Repetitive penetrative {{anal sex}} {{may result in}} the anal sphincters {{becoming}} weakened, which may cause rectal prolapse or affect the ability to hold in feces (a condition known as fecal <b>incontinence).</b> Rectal prolapse is relatively uncommon, however, especially in men, and its causes are not well understood. Kegel exercises {{have been used to}} strengthen the anal sphincters and overall pelvic floor, and may help prevent or remedy fecal <b>incontinence.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was no {{difference}} in the rates of <b>incontinence,</b> constipation, measures of sexual function or alleviation of pre-surgery symptoms.|$|E
