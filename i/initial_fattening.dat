40|$|The {{objective}} of these investigations {{was to examine}} the influence of prebiotics based on mannan-oligosaccharides and polysaccharide complexes of micro elements (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) on production results and abattoir parameters for broilers of the hybrid Arbor Acres. The experiment was performed on 186 chicken divided into three equal groups, it lasted 42 days and was divided into 3 phases. The first phase lasted 21 days, the second 14, and the third seven days. The complete mix for <b>initial</b> <b>fattening</b> of broilers was used from days 1 - 21, and complete fodder mixes for closing fattening from days 21 - 35, and on days 35 - 42 of the experiment. Feeding was ad libitum and the broilers were maintained in a floor system. Broilers fed mixes of standard raw material composition and the usual nutritive values achieved an average daily growth of 49. 10 g at an average daily feed consumption of 115. 55 g and with food conversion of 2. 35, while the yield was 71. 90 %. The addition of prebiotics based on mannan-oligosaccharides resulted in an increased average daily growth by 14. 95 % with a lower feed consumption by 2. 67 % and better conversion by 15. 32 %, while the yield was approximately the same as in the control group. The use of mixes to which polysaccharide complexes of micro elements have been added (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) resulted in a higher daily growth by 11. 43 %, with a lower feed consumption by 4. 28 % and better conversion by 14 %. The yield was approximately the same in this group as in the controls. The results realized in these investigations, throughout the experimental period, indicate that the use of the examined additives significantly affected the growth and body mass of chicks and that it is nutritionally and economically justified...|$|E
40|$|Nutrition {{represents}} {{a significant portion}} of the total cost in the production of broiler chickens, and it is increased by the current competition between generating food and producing biofuels from raw plant materials. The experiment aimed to determine the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) of free methanol glycerol for broilers at <b>initial</b> and <b>fattening</b> phases. The method of total excreta collection was used in two metabolic tests with broilers: the first with birds aged 15 to 19 days using a controlled diet and a controlled diet with added glycerol at a 1 : 9 ratio, each treatment containing four replicates; the second was with birds between 30 and 34 days old using the same treatments as the first experimental period, but containing five repetitions, using 52 birds. AME and AMEn of 4, 108 and 3, 832 kcal kg- 1 for glycerol were obtained between 15 and 19 days and 4, 121 and 3, 900 kcal kg- 1 between 30 and 34 days, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{different}} <b>initial</b> ages of <b>fattening</b> on the weight gain, feed intake and feed efficiency characteristics as well as carcass and non-carcass components of the native Eastern Anatolian Red cattle raised in Eastern region of Turkey were studied in this research. According to the age {{at the beginning of}} the fattening, 61 EAR male cattle was allocated into two age treatment groups named as group I (9 - 14 months of ages) and group II (17 - 22 months of ages). Total weight gain throughout the fattening was numerically greater in younger group compared with the elderly group, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Total dry alfalfa hay and concentrate intake as dry matter did not differ significantly between age groups. However, feed efficiency ratios were significantly (p< 0. 01) influenced by initial age of the fattening in favour of younger EAR cattle. Carcass cutability and yield grade values of the EAR cattle in group I did not differ significantly from those in group II. Overall results of the study revealed that as initial age of the fattening lowers, fattening performance and feed efficiency ratio of EAR male cattle improved, but, carcass quality traits were not adversely influenced...|$|R
40|$|Sheep {{is the one}} of meat animal {{commodity}} {{which have}} export potential, beside that domestic demand of sheep increase trend every year. The main product of sheep is meat which not only quantity to increase, but the quality have to fulfill consumer taste and healthful. The objective of the research is to produce lean Iamb with feedlot complete feed from local feedstuff with nutrient and slaughter weight exact. The plan of the research go on three years. At the preliminary stage, local lamb which were used as subject research were from Temanggung, i. e. healthy male lamb, aged 1. 5 - 12 months were slaughtered at 6 categories slaughter weight with range 5 - 30 kg. The objective of the research was to study the growth of carcass and its components (meat, fat and bone) with allometric model Y = aXb and to study chemical composition and physical characteristic of meat from local male lambs slaughtered at different slaughter weight and at Longissitnus dorsi (LD) and Biceps femoris (BF) muscle with the nested ANOVA and any differences among groups were further tested using Duncan Multiple Range Tests (DMRT). The use of the first research to determine <b>fattening</b> <b>initial</b> body weight and slaughter weight from fattening observation.

40|$|This manual was {{originally}} produced in Spanish by the Ministry of Sugar Production in Cuba. With funds from CTA, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) {{was able to}} translate it and produce it in English {{in order to help}} increase duck production as a source of protein for the Caribbean in particular, and also for other ACP countries. The domestic duck has a rapid growth rate: while fattening chickens require 23 % and 19. 7 % of total protein (TP) during the <b>initial</b> growing and <b>fattening</b> stages respectively, ducks can perform very well with 20 % and then 16 % protein up to the time of slaughter. Perhaps {{the most important aspect of}} duck-rearing for the Caribbean and other cane producing countries is their preference for liquid diets, which makes ducks particularly suitable for rearing on some by-products of sugar. Sugar by-products such as intermediate syrups A and B, syrup-off, or even sugar cane juice, can provide the required energy component of up to 65 % of dry matter, while soyabeans or soya flour, sunflowers, fish silage, earthworms or organic waste can provide the protein element of the diet. This small manual covers all aspects of duck rearing, production, reproduction, housing, hygiene and management. Sixteen pages are devoted to feeding, with tabulated sugar-based formulae for different stages of duck growth, and tables which show the use of differing amount sand types of compounds that may be utilized.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the ryanodine receptor gene- RYR 1 T polymorphism on the <b>initial</b> growth and <b>fattening</b> and slaughter values of Polish Synthetic Line 990 pigs reared in standardized litters. The study was carried on 276 offspring of hyperprolific sows. The sows gave birth to at least 12 live-born piglets. On the first day after birth, litters were equalised to 12 piglets in litter. The body weight was examined on the 21 st (21 BW), 28 th (28 BW), 63 rd (63 BW) and 180 th (180 BW) days of life. During evaluation, the live average daily gain (LADG) from birth to day 180 of life and the average daily gain (ADG) from day 63 to day 180 of life were determined. The percentage meat content (PMC), backfat thickness (BFT) and loin eye thickness (LET) was determined using PIGLOG 105 ultrasound apparatus. Two alleles of the RYR 1 gene (RYR 1 C, RYR 1 T) and three genotypes (C/C, C/T and T/T) were identified. The 21 BW and 28 BW of the T/T genotype were significantly lower than that of the C/C and C/T. The highest PMC was characteristic of the T/T genotype, whereas the lowest one of the C/C genotype (p ≤ 0. 05). The T/T genotype had a higher LET than the C/C genotype (p ≤ 0. 05). No significant differences with respect to LADG, ADG and BFT between RYR 1 genotypes were found. It can be stated that early identification of homozygous animals with respect to the RYR 1 T gene may allo...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{producers}} of mycotoxins are fungi {{of the genera}} Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. Toxins are of extreme importance {{because it can be}} transmitted from animals to humans through milk and animal products, some of which are carcinogenic and teratogenic. Mycotoxins cause a health disturbance of all animals, but the effects are more noticeable in highly productive animals in the farm way of keeping considering the much greater consumption of concentrate feeds, although forages also can be contaminated with mycotoxins in a significant manner. Mycotoxicoses are the most com­mon seasonal illnesses, and are an important diagnostic problem in veterinary practice, because its characteristics often resemble diseases caused by pathogens or nutritional deficiency or imbalance. The degree of health disturbances depends on the amount of toxins in feed and the length of intaking as on types and categories of animals. The presence of mycotoxins in animal feed is inevitable and therefore testing of raw materials and products is necessary so that feed for humans and animals can be safe for use. Damages arising as consequences of mycotoxicosis in poultry and swine production, due to the direct loss because of animals lossor, more commonly, indirectly due to the fall productive and reproductive performances of animals, imposed the need for continuous monitoring of the hygienic quality of feed mixtures for feeding these animals. During a five year period (2007 - 2012) were analyzed a total of 104 samples from the territory of Republic of Serbia intended for nutrition of all categories of poultry and mixtures for the <b>initial</b> and final <b>fattening</b> broilers (50 samples) and laying hens (54). The analysis included 57 samples of feed mixtures intended for all categories of swine - feed mixture for young (20 samples) and the old categories (37 samples) and 196 of the samples, which are commonly used in formulating rations for listed species (maize, soybean and sunflower meal). For the analysis of the samples was used thin layer chromatography and Elisa test. The results were compared with current Regulations {{on the quality of the}} feed (Official Gazette of RS 41 / 09) in force since 1. 05. 2010. in the part where the maximum allowable quantities of hazardous substances (Article 99) gives the value of the maximum permitted levels of mycotoxins in animal feed. The number and types of mycotoxins vary depending on the feed, as well as on the year which can be directly related to climatic factors, and the average annual humidity. The fact that in the samples was not detected the presence of aflatoxin indicate that in our conditions toxin producing fungi do not find fertile ground for the production of toxins, as well as the absence of certain nutrients in the production of complete feed mixtures for pigs and poultry, which are the traditional sources of aflatoxin (peanut oil meals). The results are encouraging given the fact a relatively small number of defective mixtures and nutrients. However, the fact that only a limited number of feed sam­ples we received for the analysis suggests further caution and constant monitoring of the presence of mycotoxins in animal feed.
