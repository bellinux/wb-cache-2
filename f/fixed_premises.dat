40|$|Patent {{medicines}} in late Georgian England {{have been}} misunderstood. Rather than just being visible constituents of irregular practice, {{they were a}} separate, substantial, industry providing {{a wide range of}} popular products. Most of the prominent medicine owners were either reputable tradesmen who did not practice medicine, or medical professionals; they operated from <b>fixed</b> <b>premises</b> for substantial periods of time, and they employed practices specific to the industry. A minority of nationally-available medicines were indeed owned and distributed by irregulars who were regarded as quacks by contemporaries, yet even these participants attempted to follow regular medicine. Wholesaling was initially led by London booksellers, but later moved to medicine specialists and chemists. The patent medicines industry was a separate entity, different from regular medicine and from irregular practice though linked to both of them, and restoring it to its rightful place changes our picture of late Georgian healthcare...|$|E
30|$|Both model 1 {{and model}} 2 that were {{estimated}} using the parametric ordered probit show {{the positive and}} statistically significant correlation between individual age and job satisfaction at 90 % level. Since the variable on age represents an individual experience in our model, people, {{who have been working}} a longer time with their current employer, are more satisfied. Consequently, there is a negative average partial effect of age on the probability of a working individual being dissatisfied with her job. Coefficients on the number of children in both parametric models have negative signs but are not statistically significant: more children in families requires parents {{to spend more time with}} them, while under the fixed working time framework at the majority of employers in Tajikistan, parents cannot easily choose to increase their spare time, which increases their job dissatisfaction. The monthly per capita consumption of families increases the individual job satisfaction. Since the current consumption related with wealth status, having more wealth makes people happier. The average partial effect confirms this: being wealthier decreases the probability of job dissatisfaction. Variables which define individual education are positively correlated with job satisfaction: both variables on education from vocational schools and university have positive coefficients, and negative average partial effects on the probability of job dissatisfaction. While the estimated coefficient on the highest level of education from vocational schools is not statistically significant, the coefficient on university level of education is statistically significant at 99 % level in both models. The affiliation of an employer with a social security scheme has a positive and significant at 90 % level correlation with worker’s job satisfaction. The coefficients on male gender dummy variable are positive and significantly different from zero at 90 % level in model 1. Living in the capital city has a significant negative impact on the individual job satisfaction in both models at 99 % level. Working in <b>fixed</b> <b>premises</b> has a significantly positive impact on individual job satisfaction at 90 % significance level. Unlike working in <b>fixed</b> <b>premises,</b> working in streets or markets decreases individual job satisfaction at 99 % significance level in both model specifications. The average partial effect of this variable on the probability of job dissatisfaction is positive.|$|E

Roger Penrose writes that to mathematicians, mathematics is "not just as a cultural activity that we have ourselves created, but [...] . has a life of its own, and much of it finds an amazing harmony with the physical universe. " This is also true of literature. Literature is a game, but it is also an activity that reveals much about the relation between humans and their world. It can help us to understand what it means to live as individuals in society, specifically in Australia in the 21 st Century. In other words, it places us in our history, a history that is not merely a collection of facts, but must be assembled into narratives and understood imaginatively to apprehend its meanings. In this it differs from mathematics, which proceeds logically from <b>fixed</b> <b>premises</b> or observations. The writing and reading of literature proceeds dialectally, from an experience of words towards a common understanding...|$|E

40|$|This {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the market-land degradation linkages by focusing on output traders in Uganda. The data presented originates from {{the first round of}} the survey, conducted in 1999 - 2000. A total of 544 output traders - dealing in coffee, maize, cotton, and cassava were sampled for interview. Depending on their operational size and location, sample traders were divided into four categories: (i) exporters, (ii) Kampala traders, (iii) main town traders, (iv) small trader in primary market with a <b>fixed</b> <b>premise,</b> and (v) itinerant traders. The exporters are the largest traders, largely based in the nation's capital, and well-endowed with capital. The number of respondents for each district was determined depending on the contribution of the district to the national production of the commodity considered. The Output Marketing Survey is part of a larger project "Policies for Improved Soil Nutrient Management in Uganda" which attempts to assess the impact of different causal factors and identify effective policy strategies to combat soil nutrient depletion problem in the highlands of Uganda. The research has utilized market, community, and household surveys to measure the impact of past and present policies on soil nutrient management in the Ugandan highlands; and developed market and household level models based on the surveys to evaluate the impact of alternative policy options. A related survey conducted under the same larger project is Uganda: Policies for Improved Land Management Dataset, 1999 - 2001 which offers data on community concerns and priorities, establishment and change of local council boundaries, population change, use of local council revenue, infrastructure and services, programs and organizations, land rights, and collective resource management from 107 communities across Uganda.

40|$|AbstractValuation for M&A {{and other}} {{transactions}} is peculiar topic. Quite often it's the business valuation translated into compensation {{that causes the}} discontent of the leaving shareholders {{and it is the}} valuation analysis that is opposed and becomes a subject of litigation at court. The value drivers like earnings, profit margin or discount rate are usually discussed. Another important variable - the valuation date - may stay unchallenged. Even though it may seem rather a technical matter only, the task to choose a proper valuation date is a cornerstone of every valuation analysis. The facts presented in this paper suggests that the choice of the valuation date is not solely formal, legal issue, but it obviously has a material impact to the rights of individuals, i. e. owners of companies, and also to the financial statements of the companies involved. It is therefore not correct to talk about the well known value drives and leave the valuation date in the background. In fact, it's exactly the opposite - the date of valuation determines the value drivers, and also <b>fixes</b> the <b>premises</b> and circumstances, regardless of whether the appraiser decides to use valuation models based on market comparison, DCF or asset-based models...|$|R
40|$|In {{dealing with}} (urban) sustainability, {{it may be}} useful to start with a review of {{conventional}} economic thinking on environmental externalities. Traditionally, Gross National Product (GNP) has been considered as the best performance indicator for measuring national economy and welfare. But if resource depletion and degradation are factored into economic trends, what emerges is a radically different picture from that depicted by conventional methods. Is our traditional analytical framework able to incorporate conflicting issues caused by social and environmental costs? From an epistemological point of view, economists belonging to the Neo-Classical school take inspiration from Newton's mechanics, as they tend to believe in value neutrality and objectivity and regard their arguments and statements as "scientific". Rational decisions are connected with the existence of optimal solutions based on calculations m monetary or other unidimensional terms. Central premises of this economic paradigm are [Klaassen & Opschoor, 19911 :- the maximisation premise- the weighting premise- the <b>fixed</b> content <b>premise.</b> The maxirnisa tion premise on behaviour states that "economic men" (individuals and groups) try to maximise their objective function (especially welfare for individuals and profit for enterprises) and individual welfare judgements are the ultimate criterion.

40|$|Patent {{medicines}} were a {{major constituent}} {{of the healthcare}} of late Georgian England, but {{their position in the}} medical market has escaped the attention of scholars. In this thesis, information from advertisements for medicines in runs of provincial newspapers have been combined with contemporary reports and opinions, surviving printed bills, some preserved financial accounts and official documents to provide a systematic and inclusive account of the industry. My argument is that the production, distribution and sale of patent medicines constituted a stable, substantial and largely respectable industry, with only a minority of its participants being irregular practitioners. The thesis first analyses the status of patent medicines and the imperfect boundary between regular and irregular practice before exploring the functional components of the industry, which include the crucial role of the printed word. The industry employed specific practices from <b>fixed,</b> longstanding, <b>premises,</b> the owners being predominately reputable tradesmen or medical practitioners and the wholesaling being led initially by London booksellers before passing to medicine specialists and chemists. The retail market was national and structured, with the wholesalers organising and paying for much of the publicity. Medicine vending was initially dominated by the newspaper printers and the booksellers, and it was a substantial part of the income of some of them: it was later shared with the druggists. The advertising built up confidence in the medicines by a predominately low-key factual approach and by repetition, and contemporary physicians were aware that this confidence often ensured that the benefits of the medicines were greater than the sum of their pharmaceutical constituents. Thus we can regard the printed word as an essential ingredient of an effective patent medicine. The findings necessitate a reassessment of the late Georgian medical market with the patent medicines industry positioned as a distinct entity, separate from orthodox and irregular medicine, but overlapping both of them...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{fundamental}} revolution under way regarding the relationship between gender and the state, both domestically and internationally. Across the world, the rise and visibility of transgender rights movements have forced a persistent rethinking of the cornerstone legal presumptions associated with science, sex, and gender. As many people, along with multiple courts, colleges, and workplaces, now recognize, the binary presumptions {{of male and female}} identity are largely outdated and often fail to capture the complexity of identity and expression. The question for legal scholars and legislatures is how the law can and should respond to this complexity. Taking this observation as an invitation, this Article provides a different way to conceive of the relationship between sex and gender that might provide another vantage point in demonstrating the limits of our jurisprudence. Drawing on Professor Cheryl Harris’s groundbreaking article exploring whiteness as property published in the Harvard Law Review over twenty years ago, this Article argues that, {{in order to understand the}} relationship between sex and gender, it might be helpful to explore a parallel type of affiliation between identity, property, and intellectual property. My thesis is that sex is to gender as property is to intellectual property. Unpacking this further, this Article argues that, instead of thinking of sex as a construct of biology alone, it might be helpful for us to reconceptualize state-assigned sex along the lines of tangible property—bordered, seemingly <b>fixed,</b> rivalrous, and <b>premised</b> on a juridical presumption of scarcity in terms of its rigid polarities of male and female. In contrast, regarding gender, I argue that thinking through gender as a performance, if taken seriously, also suggests that gender is more akin to intellectual property—permeable, malleable, unfixed, nonrivalrous—and ultimately deeply nonexclusive. Normatively, I argue that a model of gender pluralism is an important framework with which to examine the importance of gender diversity and fluidity...|$|R
40|$|When {{offenders}} commit crime {{there is}} the potential that they may leave behind trace amounts of their DNA, even when {{there has been no}} apparent body fluid spill. During the examination of crime scenes, scene investigators try to identify areas that may be sampled to locate these traces. Specialist techniques are then required within the laboratory to enable such small amounts to be analysed to obtain a profile. These techniques are referred to as Low Template DNA analysis (LTDNA), of which Low Copy Number DNA (LCN DNA) is one instance. In 2008, following the Omagh Bombing trial, and comments made by Judge Weir, the UK Forensic Regulator commissioned a review of the science of LTDNA analysis. The subsequent report made specific mention {{of the fact that there}} was no available information on the success rate of the use of such DNA techniques and that there seemed to be confusion over what constituted a success. The report went on to state that there was no information on where such trace amounts of DNA were likely to be found, or what factors could influence the likelihood of obtaining a trace DNA profile (Caddy, 2008). This research considered the outcomes of LCN DNA analysis from 3, 552 samples to try to establish where trace amounts of DNA could be found, whether some areas sampled were more successful in generating profiles than others, and the likelihood of the profiles obtained being of use to a criminal investigation. Analysis of results identified areas that were more successful in generating profiles of use to an investigation and highlighted significant differences in results across a variety of items from which samples were taken. DNA samples taken from items associated with communication such as mobile phones were much more likely to produce a profile useful to a criminal investigation than those taken from <b>fixed</b> surfaces within <b>premises.</b> The results obtained showed that obtaining a DNA profile did not necessarily correlate with the profile being of use to a criminal investigation. This was due to the fact that a large number of these profiles were anticipated eliminations from legitimate sources. Items that produced high numbers of profiles but were anticipated eliminations, and therefore of no value to an investigation, came from items associated with skin samples and clothing. The research went further to identify key factors that affected the profiling rates. Factors that had a positive influence on the ability to obtain a profile included: any area that had been in close proximity to saliva (direct contact was not required); samples that had been recovered from the inside of premises or vehicles and therefore protected from the elements; those that were dry; items that were of a porous nature; and those that had a rough texture. No differences were found between the actual surface materials (plastic, glass, wood, metal), as all showed a propensity to generate profiles. Other factors that were considered but proved to have no effect on the profiling rates included seasonal differences and whether the area targeted for sampling was clearly defined. Items that had had high contact with a victim, were recovered from outside or had been wet, all proved to be less useful to an nvestigation. A further finding of the research was that swabs that had been recovered and stored frozen appeared to deteriorate in their ability to profile. This was particularly notable if they were submitted later than 5 months after recovery. Items stored in dry conditions did not deteriorate in this way. Overall the research can be used to provide investigators with the knowledge of what areas of crime scenes are most likely to yield trace DNA material, the key factors that can affect the likelihood of obtaining a profile, and those areas that are more likely to produce profiles useful to criminal investigations.
