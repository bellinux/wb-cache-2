I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
500|$|Moore wrote lyrics for {{the album}} by [...] "mumbling {{along to the}} song and then {{deciphering}} what I'm saying." [...] The lyrics feature political themes ("Hello, Helicopter!" [...] is about the US supplying military arsenals to other countries to protect its own national interests), although Matheos stated that the album was not political in nature. Moore said that he writes lyrics based on personal experiences, and {{that much of the}} album's lyrical content stems from how the September 11 attacks affected him. Moore's brother was a firefighter who worked at the World Trade Center after the attacks, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> apolitical before this, politically naïve and I still am," [...] Moore stated. [...] "I was like, 'Whoa, what the fuck {{is going on in the}} world?'" ...|$|E
500|$|As Friedman noted, if {{the price}} of silver had {{remained}} high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously." [...] One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, Thomas F. Bayard, in 1878, [...] "at the beginning... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized." ...|$|E

500|$|Vikram allotted 18 {{months and}} 190 {{days of his}} call sheet for the film, {{including}} 165 days of bulk dates spread across six months. Speaking {{on the extent of}} his involvement in the filmmaking process, Vikram said, [...] "Before beginning the film, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> involved in the research and preparation, but once on the sets, I go by what the director says." [...] He further clarified that he discussed every shot with Shankar, went for re-takes where necessary to make the scenes better, and gave suggestions, but left the [...] "ultimate verdict" [...] to the director. Disclosing that, among the three shades to his character, he found playing Ambi to be the toughest, he reasoned, [...] "Because as a hero you are not used to being a wimp on screen. It's difficult digesting getting beaten up." [...] In contrast, being a graduate in English literature, he found playing Remo much easier and more in his comfort zone.|$|E

2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening for me at the time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time for anything else. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose for}} {{creating}} the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a [...] "bull force" [...] neighborhood watch.

But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> wrong. And eventually, we morphed into the monster we were addressing." [...] Washington himself has stated that he founded the Crips not with the intention of eliminating other gangs, but to create a force powerful enough to protect local black people from racism, corruption and brutality {{at the hands of the}} police.|$|E

[...] McEachron remained on for one more year, and resigned for good in 1959. He had compiled a 6-23-1 record at Nevada.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was while}} in school that Pisemsky started writing. [...] "My 5th form teacher of {{literature}} credited me with having talent; in the 6th form I wrote a novella called The Circassian Girl, {{and in the}} 7th a still longer one entitled The Iron Ring, both worthy of mention, apparently, only as stylistic exercises, dealing {{as they did with}} things <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> ignorant of at the time," [...] Pisemsky remembered. He sent The Iron Ring (a novel telling of his first romantic passion) to several Saint Petersburg journals and met with all-round rejection. Several months later, already a university student, he gave the novel to Stepan Shevyryov. The professor's reaction was negative and he made a point to discourage the young man from writing about things he knew nothing about.|$|E

I soon learned that my sisters could say [...] "no" [...] when they meant [...] "yes." [...] And they could say [...] "yes" [...] and mean [...] "no" [...] at the same time. They could offer another sister an apple and hold it back. And I began studying nonverbal language and body language.|$|E

Murray, described {{by one of}} the Hustle production team as [...] "that rare specimen – a stunningly beautiful actress who can actually act", and who auditioned in platform shoes to match her 5ft7in height with Stacie's description as having [...] "legs that go on for miles", was reportedly [...] "terrified" [...] to be working with the more famous actors Vaughn and Lester, saying [...] "when we were filming the first couple of episodes I was absolutely petrified and was convinced that it would be really obvious on screen. So when I watched some of it on tape <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> amazed that you couldn't see how frightened I really was. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God!

Details of signals which had been repeatedly passed at danger should have been supplied to trainers and passed on to trainees; no trainer had done so, and the practical trainer quoted above was unaware that SN109 was a multi-SPAD signal. Testing of trainees was similarly unstructured and unstandardised, with no clear pass/fail criteria. Under the previous British Railways training regime, trainees would have spent far longer in training and once qualified, {{were not allowed to}} drive over the notoriously difficult approach to Paddington until they had at least two years' experience on less complex routes. Hodder had only qualified 13 days earlier; he was ex-navy with no previous experience as a railway worker, but no special attention was paid to this in either training or testing.|$|E
