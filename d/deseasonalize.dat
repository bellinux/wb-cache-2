40|$|International audienceThe Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) {{allows the}} {{retrieval}} of tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO 2 {{on a global}} scale. Regions with enhanced industrial activity can clearly be detected, but the standard spatial resolution of the GOME ground pixels (320 x 40 km 2) is insufficient to resolve regional trace gas distributions or individual cities. Every 10 days within the nominal GOME operation, measurements are executed in the so called narrow swath mode with a much better spatial resolution (80 x 40 km 2). We use this data (1997 - 2001) to construct a detailed picture of the mean global tropospheric NO 2 distribution. Since - due to the narrow swath - the global coverage of the high resolution observations is rather poor, it {{has proved to be}} essential to <b>deseasonalize</b> the single narrow swath mode observations to retrieve adequate mean maps. This is done by using the GOME backscan information. The retrieved high resolution map illustrates the shortcomings of the standard size GOME pixels and reveals an unprecedented wealth of details in the global distribution of tropospheric NO 2. Localised spots of enhanced NO 2 VCD can be directly associated to cities, heavy industry centers and even large power plants. Thus our result helps to check emission inventories. The small spatial extent of NO 2 "hot spots" allows us to estimate an upper limit of the mean lifetime of boundary layer NO x of 17 h on a global scale. The long time series of GOME data allows a quantitative comparison of the narrow swath mode data to the nominal resolution. Thus we can analyse the dependency of NO 2 VCDs on pixel size. This is important for comparing GOME data to results of new satellite instruments like SCIAMACHY (launched March 2002 on ENVISAT), OMI (launched July 2004 on AURA) or GOME II (to be launched 2005) with an improved spatial resolution...|$|E

40|$|Physical {{uncertainties}} in global-warming projections {{are dominated}} by uncertainties about how the fraction of incoming shortwave radiation that clouds reflect will change as greenhouse gas concentrations rise. Differences in the shortwave reflection by low clouds over tropical oceans alone {{account for more than}} half of the variance of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) among climate models, which ranges from 2. 1 to 4. 7 K. Space-based measurements now provide an opportunity to assess how well models reproduce temporal variations of this shortwave reflection on seasonal to interannual time scales. Here such space-based measurements are used to show that shortwave reflection by low clouds over tropical oceans decreases robustly when the underlying surface warms, for example, by −(0. 96 ± 0. 22) % K^(− 1) (90 % confidence level) for <b>deseasonalized</b> variations. Additionally, the temporal covariance of low-cloud reflection with temperature in historical simulations with current climate models correlates strongly (r = − 0. 67) with the models’ ECS. Therefore, measurements of temporal low-cloud variations can be used to constrain ECS estimates based on climate models. An information-theoretic weighting of climate models by how well they reproduce the measured <b>deseasonalized</b> covariance of shortwave cloud reflection with temperature yields a most likely ECS estimate around 4. 0 K; an ECS below 2. 3 K becomes very unlikely (90 % confidence) ...|$|R

For most of the locations in the western US that we considered, there are significant inter-site correlations in the <b>deseasonalized</b> monthly means. This indicates that there are large scale factors that influence the monthly mean O 3 concentrations across the western US. At seven out of nine sites in the western US, there is a statistically significant increase in O 3 with a mean trend of 0. 26 ppbv year− 1 (range at the seven sites is 0. 19 – 0. 51 ppbv year− 1).

The precision of these measurements and their calibration allow very small signals, ∼ 1 % of total column ozone, to be clearly seen. Using MOD, we have carried out an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) study of the temporal and spatial patterns of the interannual variability of total column ozone in the tropics. The first four EOFs of our study capture over 93 % of the variance of the <b>deseasonalized</b> data.

The motivation for this research comes from a recent stream of literature in energy economics concerning electricity spot price models.

The analysis of the long-term ozone trends is performed using annual mean time series derived from the average of the <b>deseasonalized</b> monthly TOC series.
