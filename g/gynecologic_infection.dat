40|$|A 22 -year-old {{woman on}} CAPD {{developed}} recurrent peritonitis with organisms suggestive of a gynecologic source. A concomitant vagi nalleaking of dialysate confirmed an abnormal communication between peritoneum and vagina. The recurrent infection led to fungal over-growth, abcess formation and catheter loss. The appearance of peritoneal infection with normal vaginal organisms should prompt {{a search for}} a gynecologic source of contamination such as that demonstrated in this case. Experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has shown that certain underlying medical conditions may predispose patients to the development of complications such as peritonitis. Among these predisposing conditions are anatomic abnormalities such as diverticulitis and in-cipient subcutaneous catheter infections, or constitutional factors such as leukopenia, diabetes mellitus, concomitant corticosteroid therapy, or underlying malignancy (1 - 3).

Treatment with imipenem-cilastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of E. coli and S. faecalis in uteri, as compared with the proliferation in untreated controls. Cefazolin failed to affect the E. coli infection. With the S. faecalis infection, ampicillin effectively reduced bacterial growth, as compared with that in untreated controls. However, ampicillin was inferior to and comparable to imipenem-cilastatin in progesterone-treated virgin rats and postpartum rats, respectively. A further experiment with S. faecalis infections in rats made neutropenic by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide showed that the therapeutic effectiveness of imipenem-cilastatin was superior to that of ampicillin and was not influenced by neutropenia.

40|$|Bacterial vaginosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{disorders}} in women of reproductive age worldwide and while not life-threatening, it leads to increased risk of more serious <b>gynecologic</b> <b>infections</b> and pre-term labor. It is a pathology which has been recognized to possess several microorganisms involved such as Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and other anaerobic bacteria of difficult identification, whose fragile balance may determine the appearance or not the pathology. Currently diagnosis is made mostly based on symptoms and is variable dependent on the symptoms which the physician judge to be most important for diagnosis, and laboratory culture techniques for the identification of bacterial strains present is very time consuming and not always successful in identifying most microorganisms present. In order to have a better understanding of the aetiology of BV and thus be able to identify better tools for the correct diagnosis of this pathology, more effective tools for identification of bacteria commonly associated with the vaginal flora are need. The use of new molecular biology techniques, such as PCR, has begun to be extensively developed for the study of pathologies such as BV. Besides conventional PCR there have been key developments made to this techniques such as multiplex PCR (allowing the detection of the presence of several strains of organisms in a single reaction) and qPCR which allows the fast quantification of organism which would otherwise take many days to quantify using traditional microbiology techniques. Here we describe the development of a multiplex PCR assay for the identification of 3 of the most commonly studied bacterial strains for the diagnosis of BV: Lactobacillus spp., G. vaginalis and A. vaginae...|$|R
40|$|Vaginal {{infection}} {{is the main}} disorder in women of reproductive age worldwide and while not life-threatening, it leads to increased risk of more serious <b>gynecologic</b> <b>infections</b> and pre-term labor. Although this infection varies between countries {{and it is a}} mix of various etiologies, the pathogenic infection analysis represents a major challenge for clinical treatment. The key factor is therefore to get a precise diagnosis so clinical treatment selection be the most adequate each vaginal disorder. During infectious vaginitis,, the adhered lactobacilli present in the vaginal epithelium are usually replaced by pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (Mobiluncus spp., Atopobium vaginae and many others), yeast (such as, Candida albicans) and parasitic protozoan (for example, Trichomonas vaginalis). However, the detection of Lactobacillus spp. imbalance in vaginal microflora due to pathogenic microorganisms in the initiation and progression of {{infection is}} vital for clinical treatment. The detection of lactobacilli based on selective growth culture has improved the sensitivity of classical methods. Many media and incubation conditions for the lactobacilli growth have been tested for optimal recovery from clinical samples. However, numerous comparisons have shown that molecular methods may be a suitable alternative to the classical techniques. However, they are more expensive and the reduced incubation time still remains too long for same-day results. So, molecular techniques can be employed to decrease the time needed for bacteria detection by classical methods with a low detection threshold. Lactobacilli adhered to vaginal epithelium was detected in situ by molecular methods, more precisely: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Peptide Nucleic Acid Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (PNA-FISH) techniques. In addition, another main goal of this research is the application of PNA-FISH specific for Lactobacilli spp. to study the spatial organization of beneficial lactobacilli strains against a background of pathogenic microorganisms present in clinical samples. To conclude, we evaluate and validate the efficiency of PNA-FISH and PCR methods against selective growth media for Lactobacillus spp. detection in clinical samples...|$|R

We hypothesized that the prevalence of urinary symptoms in WSW is similar to population norms and that urinary symptoms in WSW would be associated with known risk factors for urologic problems. WSW were recruited to participate in an internet-based survey via invitations, listserves, and social media. Primary outcome measures were the validated Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) and a single question assessing stress urinary incontinence (SUI). OAB status was dichotomized by OAB-q score (0 - 8 =none/mild; > 8 =moderate/severe). SUI was dichotomized by single item response (none/little bit of the time=none/mild; sometimes through always=moderate/severe). Ethnodemographic, health, sexuality, and relationship data was also collected. Multivariable logistic regression utilizing 17 factors was performed with SAS V 9. 2, followed by multivariable analysis with stepwise selection based on the initial analysis (included factors, p < 0. 25).

A Triton X- 114 extract of M. hominis enriched with lipoproteins was shown to stimulate the production of IL- 23 by human dendritic cells (hDCs). The inflammasome activation of the host cell has never been reported upon M. hominis infection. We studied here the interaction between M. hominis PG 21 and hDCs by analyzing both the inflammation-inducing mycoplasmal lipoproteins and the inflammasome activation of the host cell. IL- 23 -inducing lipoproteins were determined using a sequential extraction strategy with two non-denaturing detergents, Sarkosyl and Triton X- 114, followed by SDS-PAGE separation and mass spectrometry identification. The activation of the hDC inflammasome was assessed using PCR array and ELISA. We defined a list of 24 lipoproteins that could induce the secretion of IL- 23 by hDCs, 5 with a molecular weight between 20 and 35 kDa and 19 with a molecular weight between 40 and 100 kDa. Among them, the MHO_ 4720 lipoprotein was identified as potentially bioactive and a synthetic lipopeptide corresponding to the N-terminal part of the lipoprotein was subsequently shown to induce IL- 23 release by hDCs. Regarding the hDC innate immune response, inflammasome activation with caspase-dependent production of IL- 1 β was observed. After 24 h of co-incubation of hDCs with M. hominis, down-regulation of the NLRP 3 -encoding gene and of the adaptor PYCARD-encoding gene was noticed. Overall, this study provides insight into both protagonists of the interaction, M. hominis and hDCs.
