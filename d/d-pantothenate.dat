40|$|P ANTOTHENIC acid occurs {{naturally}} as the D(+) isomer. This isomer {{is usually}} sep-arated from the synthetic racemic mixture {{for use in}} food and vitamin supplements; however, in some instances, the racemic prep-aration is used, particularly in animal feeds. Experiments with bacteria ’ and short-term studies in rats and chicks 2 showed that DL-pantothenate had half of the biological ac-tivity of <b>D-pantothenate,</b> suggesting that the L isomer had no biological activity. The L isomer had practically no activity in either bacteria or’ In the present experiments L-pantothenate was also found to have no apparent biological activity in rats when fed with equal amounts of the D isomer; however, when an excess of the L isomer was fed there were marked decreases in weight gain and acetylating ability(a measure of pantothenate stores). These {{data suggest that the}} L isomer of pantothenate is a competitive inhibitor of <b>D-pantothenate</b> in the rat. L (-) -Pantothenyl alcohol (L-pan-thenol) did not inhibit utilization of D(+) -pantothenate by the rat. METHODS In each of the three experiments various levels of <b>D-pantothenate</b> were incorporated into an otherwise complete diet, and the effects of added L-pantothen-ate were studied.

40|$|L-Lysine <b>d-pantothenate,</b> a 1 : 1 amino acid-vitamin complex, {{crystallizes}} in the monoclinic {{space group}} P 21 with Image Full-size image (1 K). The structure has been solved by direct methods and refined to an R value of 0. 053 for 1868 observed reflections. The zwitterionic positively charged lysine molecules {{in the structure}} assume the sterically most favourable conformation with an all-trans side chain trans to the α-carboxylate group. The pantothenate anion has a somewhat folded conformation stabilised by an intramolecular bifurcated hydrogen bond. The unlike molecules aggregate into separate alternating layers. The molecules in the lysine layers form a head-to-tail sequence parallel to the a-axis. The interactions which hold the adjacent layers together include those between the side chain amino group of lysine and the carboxylate group in the pantothenate anion. The geometry of these interactions is such that each carboxylate group is sandwiched between two amino groups in a periodic arrangement of alternating carboxylate and amino groups...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Corynebacterium glutamicum {{were made}} and enzymatically {{characterized}} to clone ilvD and ilvE, which encode dihydroxy acid dehydratase and transaminase B, respectively. These genes of the branched-chain amino acid synthesis were overexpressed together with ilvBN (which encodes acetohydroxy acid synthase) and ilvC (which encodes isomeroreductase) in the wild type, which does not excrete L-valine, to result in an accumulation of this amino acid to a concentration of 42 mM. Since L-valine originates from two pyruvate molecules, this illustrates the comparatively easy accessibility of the central metabolite pyruvate. The same genes, ilvBNCD, overexpressed in an ilvA deletion mutant which is unable to synthesize L-isoleucine increased the concentration of this amino acid to 58 mM. A further dramatic increase was obtained when panBC was deleted, making the resulting mutant auxotrophic for <b>D-pantothenate.</b> When the resulting strain, C. glutamicum 13032 DeltailvADeltapanBC with ilvBNCD overexpressed, was grown under limiting conditions it accumulated 91 mM L-Valine. This is attributed to a reduced coenzyme A availability and therefore reduced flux of pyruvate via pyruvate dehydrogenase enabling its increased drain-off via the L-valine biosynthesis pathway...|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{studies were}} {{performed}} on nine Bacteroides strains, by use of the methodology and media of anaerobic rumen microbiology. Ristella perfoetens CCI required l-arginine hydrochloride, l-tryptophan, l-leucine, l-histidine hydrochloride, l-cysteine hydrochloride, dl-valine, dl-tyrosine, and the vitamin calcium-d-pantothenate, since scant turbidity developed in media without these nutrients. R. perfoetens was stimulated by glycine, dl-lysine hydrochloride, dl-isoleucine, l-proline, l-glutamic acid, dl-alanine, dl-phenylalanine, dl-methionine, and the vitamins nicotinamide and p-aminobenzoic acid, since maximal turbidity developed more slowly in media without these nutrients than in complete medium. Medium A- 23, which was devised for R. perfoetens, contained salts, 0. 0002 % nicotinamide and calcium <b>d-pantothenate,</b> 0. 00001 % p-aminobenzoic acid, 0. 044 % l-tryptophan, 0. 09 % l-glutamic acid, and 0. 1 % of the other 13 amino acids listed above. Zuberella clostridiformis and seven strains of R. pseudoinsolita did not require vitamins, and showed no absolute requirement for any one amino acid. Various strains produced maximal turbidity more slowly in media deficient in l-proline, glycine, l-glutamic acid, dl-serine, l-histidine hydrochloride, dl-alanine, or l-cysteine hydrochloride, than in complete medium. These eight strains grew optimally in medium A- 23 plus 0. 1 % dl-serine but without vitamins...|$|E

40|$|The {{conformational}} analysis of d-pantothenic acid using classical semiempirical methods {{has been carried}} out. The pantothenic acid molecule can exist in the neutral form (I) or in the ionised form (II) with a deprotonated negatively charged carboxyl group. The neutral molecule {{as well as the}} anion is highly flexible and has an ensemble of several allowed conformations rather than one or two unique conformations. The distribution of allowed conformations indicate that the β-alanine as well as the pantoic acid part of the molecule prefers partially folded conformations. The conformation of the former is greatly affected by the ionisation state of the carboxyl group whereas that of the latter is not. Possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in different allowed conformations has also been explored. A bifurcated hydrogen bond involving a carboxyl (or carboxylate) oxygen atom and a hydroxyl oxygen atom, as acceptors, and the amide nitrogen atom as the donor occurs frequently in both I and II. Amongst the two crystal structures containing pantothenic acid reported so far, the conformation of the molecule in l-lysine <b>d-pantothenate</b> lies in the allowed region and is stabilised by a bifurcated intramolecular hydrogen bond, whereas that in the calcium bromide salt falls in a disallowed region, presumably due to the requirement of tridentate metal coordination...|$|E
40|$|Four {{groups of}} {{juvenile}} Megalobrama amblycephala were fed three times daily with six semi-purified diets containing 3. 39 (PA unsupplied diet), 10. 54, 19. 28, 31. 04, 48. 38 and 59. 72 mg kg(- 1) calcium <b>D-pantothenate.</b> The {{results showed that}} survival rate, final weight, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio and nitrogen retention efficiency all increased significantly (P< 0. 01) as dietary PA levels increased from 3. 39 to 19. 28 mg kg(- 1), whereas the opposite was true for feed conversion ratio. Whole-body crude protein increased as dietary PA levels increased, while the opposite pattern was found for the crude lipid content. Intestinal α-amylase, lipase, protease, Na+-K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities were all elevated in fish fed PA-supplemented diets. Hepatic catalase activities improved with increases in dietary PA, while the opposite was true for malondialdehyde contents. The liver PA concentration and coenzyme A content rose significantly (P< 0. 01), up to 31. 04 mg kg(- 1), with increasing dietary PA levels and then plateaued. The percentage of hepatic saturated fatty acids increased significantly (P< 0. 01) as dietary PA levels increased, while the percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) decreased as dietary PA increased. Fish fed diets containing 19. 28 and 31. 04 mg kg(- 1) PA exhibited higher (P< 0. 01) docosahexaenoic acid and PUFA percentages in muscle than those fed with other diets. The expression of the gene encoding pantothenate kinase was significantly up-regulated (P< 0. 01) in fish fed PA-supplemented diets. Hepatic Acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, fatty acid synthetase, stearoyl regulatory element-binding protein 1 and X receptor α genes all increased significantly (P< 0. 01) as dietary PA levels increased from 3. 39 to 31. 04 mg kg(- 1). Based on broken-line regression analyses of weight gain, liver CoA concentrations and PA contents against dietary PA levels, the optimal dietary PA requirements of juvenile blunt snout bream were estimated to be 24. 08 mg kg(- 1) ...|$|E
