40|$|Load {{balancing}} is {{the process}} of redistributing the work load among nodes of the distributed system to improve both resource utilization and job response time while also avoiding a situation where some nodes are heavily loaded while others are idle or doing little work. A dynamic load balancing algorithm assumes no a priori knowledge about job behavior or the global state of the system, i. e., load balancing decisions are solely based on the current status of the system. The development of an effective dynamic load balancing algorithm involves many important issues: load estimation, load levels comparison, performance indices, system stability, amount of information exchanged among nodes, job resource requirements estimation, <b>job’s</b> <b>selection</b> for transfer, remote nodes selection, and more. This paper presents and analyses the aforementioned issues that need to be considered in the development or study of a dynamic load balancing algorithm.

50|$|Metaheuristics {{are used}} for {{combinatorial}} optimization in which an optimal solution is sought over a discrete search-space. An example problem is the travelling salesman problem where the search-space of candidate solutions grows faster than exponentially as {{the size of the}} problem increases, which makes an exhaustive search for the optimal solution infeasible. Additionally, multidimensional combinatorial problems, including most design problems in engineering such as form-finding and behavior-finding, suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which also makes them infeasible for exhaustive search or analytical methods. Metaheuristics are also widely used for jobshop scheduling and <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> problems. Popular metaheuristics for combinatorial problems include simulated annealing by Kirkpatrick et al., genetic algorithms by Holland et al., scatter search and tabu search by Glover. Literature review on metaheuristic optimization,suggested that it was Fred Glover who coined the word metaheuristics.|$|E
5000|$|Research done by Isen and Patrick {{put forth}} {{the theory of}} [...] "mood maintenance" [...] which states that happy {{decision-makers}} are reluctant to gamble. In other words, happy people decide against gambling, since they {{would not want to}} undermine the happy feeling. Alternatively, the influence of negative feelings at the time of decision-making was studied by Raghunathan and Tuan Pham (1999). They conducted three experiments in gambling decisions and <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> decisions, where unhappy subjects were found to prefer high-risk/high-reward options unlike anxious subjects who preferred low-risk/low-reward options. They stated that [...] "anxiety and sadness convey distinct types of information to the decision-maker and prime different goals." [...] It was found that [...] "while anxiety primes an implicit goal of uncertainty reduction, sadness primes an implicit goal of reward replacement". Thus emotions cannot simply be classified as positive or negative as we need to consider the consequences of the emotions in ultimate decision-making.|$|E

40|$|The {{strong market}} for new {{accounting}} faculty {{coupled with the}} significant costs of recruiting faculty necessitates {{an understanding of the}} preferences of job candidates by employer institutions. Candidates for entry-level positions could also benefit from an understanding of the past experiences of their peers. This study explores the initial <b>job</b> <b>selections</b> of new accounting faculty. A survey of 196 individuals who accepted an entry-level accounting faculty position during 1996 or 1997 resulted in one hundred seventeen usable responses. Thirty-eight of the 54 variables in the survey were rated "somewhat important " or "important. " Generally, respondents at teaching-oriented schools and schools without doctoral programs regarded personal variables as more important, while respondents at research-oriented schools and schools with doctoral programs placed more importance on research-related variables and graduate education. Factor analyses indicated that respondents sought adequate research resources, low service expectations, and good benefits from a school located in an area which would afford them quality of life outside of work. Contrary to prior research, compensation variables were not included in any of the reported factors. Regardless of affiliation and consistent with prior research, the typical faculty work load included a significant research component and research effectiveness was perceived as the most important criteria for promotion and tenure...|$|R
50|$|Sex {{discrimination}} in education persists beyond graduation, influencing one’s process of entering the workforce. Networking trends, gender norms, {{and the perception}} of parenthood differ based on one’s gender. A study done by Lindsey Trimble was conducted to understand how gender influences job networking. Through extensive research, the results shed light on a host of variances in both the execution of networking and its success levels between men and women. Firstly, {{people are more likely to}} find a job through same-gender contacts (about 65%), most of which are found through social functions that are already segregated by sex. Gender norms influence this networking process as well. Certain jobs are commonly perceived as only being fit for one gender. For example, only 9% of nurses are male, while only 4% of women work in local sheriff departments. Furthermore, women only make up 4% of CEO positions at S&P 500 companies. Thus, if people are finding jobs through same-gender contacts, these contacts are most likely in gender-segregated positions themselves, perpetuating gender inequality within the <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> process. These gender norms influence how decisions are made regarding whom to network for and whom to hire. People are more likely to help someone out if they think they're fit for the particular job. Gender is often considered to be one of the many indicators of an individual's level of capability. This could lead a contact to assist a man over a woman for careers considered more masculine. Employers decision making process is influenced by gender stereotypes as well. For example, assertiveness is often considered to be a sign of strength or good leadership in a man, yet, on the contrary, can cause others to think a woman is too opinionated or bossy. Additionally, parenthood affects one’s chance of being hired differently based on one's gender. Fatherhood is associated with a greater chance of getting a promotion, while motherhood decreases promotion rates, especially if the children are younger. Statistically, women experience internal promotion rates that are 34-46% lower than for men. Another aspect of parenthood that creates workforce discrimination is the presence of a societal pressure put on women to stay at home with their children. Not only could this make employers less inclined to hire a woman for time-consuming jobs, but it leaves a stigma on mothers who chose to work full-time, something men don't experience. Workforce discrimination is the result of a very complex list of causes, including gender norms and stereotypes, networking patterns, {{and the perception of}} parenthood. By better understanding these concepts, one can begin to combat them and create more gender equality.|$|E

It is people who lead the organization towards performance, and selecting competent employees is critical for competitive success. The paper is focused on the <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> practices implemented by hiring organizations in a developing country. Due to the differences that exist regarding the employee selection policy between public and private organizations, the paper aims to understand the characteristics of the <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> process according to the ownership of the employer agent. Based on a quantitative survey applied on 64 companies, the results analyze the main selection stages implemented in private vs. public sector employers in a developing country. While in private companies the most frequently used selection stages are the <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> interview, CVs screening and trial period, in public institutions the hiring process is based on the <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> interview, written knowledge tests, and practical tests. Compared to private companies, in public institutions the written knowledge tests rank a higher position in the selection stages hierarchy, but the private employers rely more on CVs screening stage than public institutions. Emphasis is laid on understanding the reasons leading to variations in <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> practices according to the ownership of the employing agent.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{two classes}} of <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> policies that control how a network of autonomous aerial vehicles delivers goods from depots to customers. Customer requests (jobs) occur according to a spatio-temporal stochastic process not known by the system. If <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> uses a policy in which the first job (FJ) is served first, the system may collapse to instability by removing just one vehicle. Policies that serve the nearest job (NJ) first show such threshold behavior only in some settings and can be implemented in a distributed manner. The timing of <b>job</b> <b>selection</b> has significant impact on delivery time and stability for NJ while it has no impact for FJ. Based on these findings we introduce a methodological approach for decision- making support {{to set up and}} operate such a system, taking into account the trade-off between monetary cost and service quality. In particular, we compute a lower bound for the infrastructure expenditure required to achieve a certain expected delivery time. The approach includes three time horizons: long-term decisions on the number of depots to deploy in the service area, mid- term decisions on the number of vehicles to use, and short-term decisions on the policy to operate the vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{applications}} in scheduling, such as resource allocation or steel manufacturing, can be modeled using the NP-hard Independent Set problem (given an undirected graph and an integer k, find {{a set of}} at least k pairwise non-adjacent vertices). Here, one encounters special graph classes like 2 -union graphs (edge-wise unions of two interval graphs) and strip graphs (edge-wise unions of an interval graph and a cluster graph), on which Independent Set remains NP-hard but admits constant-ratio approximations in polynomial time. We study the parameterized complexity of Independent Set on 2 -union graphs and on subclasses like strip graphs. Our investigations significantly benefit from a new structural "compactness" parameter of interval graphs and novel problem formulations using vertex-colored interval graphs. Our main contributions are: 1. We show a complexity dichotomy: restricted to graph classes closed under induced subgraphs and disjoint unions, Independent Set is polynomial-time solvable if both input interval graphs are cluster graphs, and is NP-hard otherwise. 2. We chart the possibilities and limits of effective polynomial-time preprocessing (also known as kernelization). 3. We extend Halldórsson and Karlsson (2006) 's fixed-parameter algorithm for Independent Set on strip graphs parameterized by the structural parameter "maximum number of live jobs" {{to show that the}} problem (also known as <b>Job</b> Interval <b>Selection)</b> is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter k and generalize their algorithm from strip graphs to 2 -union graphs.
