40|$|Background There {{have been}} {{numerous}} articles {{as to whether the}} staining index (SI) of astrocyte ele-vated gene- 1 (AEG- 1) adversely affects clinical progression and prognosis of gastrointesti-nal cancers. Nevertheless, controversy still exists in terms of correlations between AEG- 1 SI and clinicopathological parameters including survival data. Consequently, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to confirm the role of AEG- 1 in clinical outcomes of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>carcinoma</b> patients...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil antibody-dependent {{cellular}} cytotoxicity (ADCC) against Raji target cells was {{studied in}} 32 patients with lung or <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and 25 healthy controls. Seventeen {{of the patients}} (53 %) had defective ADCC. Moreover, neutrophils obtained from patients with defective ADCC were found to bind IgG-coated target cells normally. Thus, the defect responsible for the impaired lysis appears to be distal to the Fc receptor (FcR) -mediated target cell binding by neutrophils...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{excision}} repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC 1) protein {{is the key}} enzyme of the nucleotide {{excision repair}} (NER) pathway. Loss of protein expression on immunohistochemistry is predictive for platinum-based chemotherapy response. Frequently, the diagnosis of malignancy is made on cytologic effusion samples. Therefore, we evaluated the staining quality of monoclonal anti-ERCC 1 antibodies 8 F 1 and D- 10 on microarrays of malignant pleural and peritoneal effusions by automated immunochemistry. Methods Cores from effusion cell blocks of 117 patients with > 40 malignant cell clusters per whole section (pleural n = 75, peritoneal n = 42) were assembled together with 30 histologic control cores from large tissue blocks (lung, breast and ovarian carcinoma, each n = 10) on hybrid cytology-tissue microarrays (C/TMA). Four immunochemistry protocols (Mab 8 F 1 and D- 10, CC 1 -mono Ventana and H 2 - 60 Bond automat) were performed. Immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively scored for intensity and intensity multiplied by percentage staining (H-score). Results Tumors were classified into female genital tract carcinoma (n = 39), lung adenocarcinoma (n = 23), mesothelioma (n = 15), unknown primary (n = 14), breast carcinoma (n = 10), <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (n = 12) and other (n = 4). On both platforms, reproducible nuclear ERCC 1 immunoreactivity was achieved with both antibodies, although D- 10 was slightly weaker and presented more background staining {{as well as more}} variation in the low expression range. No {{significant differences were found between}} cytologic and histologic cores. Using the 8 F 1 CC 1 -mono protocol, lung and breast carcinomas had lower ERCC 1 expression in comparison to the other entities (p-value Conclusions Cytology microarrays (CMA) are suitable for investigation of clinical biomarkers and can be combined with conventional TMA's. Dichotomization of ERCC 1 immunoreactivity scores is most suitable for patient stratification since definition of negativity is antibody-dependent. </p...|$|E
40|$|A bispecific MAb {{was derived}} from the fusion of a {{hybridoma}} producing MAb CD 3 with a hybridoma producing MAb L-DI (which is directed against a 41 -kDa glycoprotein expressed in most <b>gastro-intestinal</b> and pancreatic <b>carcinomas).</b> Bispecific antibody molecules were isolated from parental antibody molecules by the use of hydroxylapatite-HPLC and shown to target human cytolytic T lymphocytes, irrespective of their original specificity, to specifically lyse human colon carcinoma cells. Localization studies in vivo using nude mice bearing human colon carcinoma xenografts showed significant accumulation of the HPLC-purified 125 I-labelled bispecific antibodies into the tumor compared to 131 I-labelled control CD 3 antibody...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Shared Pathology Informatics Network (SPIN) is {{a tissue}} {{resource}} initiative that utilizes clinical {{reports of the}} vast amount of paraffin-embedded tissues routinely stored by medical centers. SPIN has an informatics component (sending tissue-related queries to multiple institutions via the internet) and a service component (providing histopathologically annotated tissue specimens for medical research). This paper examines if tissue blocks, identified by localized computer searches at participating institutions, can be retrieved in adequate quantity and quality to support medical researchers. Methods Four centers evaluated pathology reports (1990 â€“ 2005) for common and rare tumors to determine the percentage of cases where suitable tissue blocks with tumor were available. Each site generated a list of 100 common tumor cases (25 cases each of breast adenocarcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma) and 100 rare tumor cases (25 cases each of adrenal cortical <b>carcinoma,</b> <b>gastro-intestinal</b> stromal tumor [GIST], adenoid cystic carcinoma, and mycosis fungoides) {{using a combination of}} Tumor Registry, laboratory information system (LIS) and/or SPIN-related tools. Pathologists identified the slides/blocks with tumor and noted first 3 slides with largest tumor and availability of the corresponding block. Results Common tumors cases (n = 400), the institutional retrieval rates (all blocks) were 83 % (A), 95 % (B), 80 % (C), and 98 % (D). Retrieval rate (tumor blocks) from all centers for common tumors was 73 % with mean largest tumor size of 1. 49 cm; retrieval (tumor blocks) was highest-lung (84 %) and lowest-prostate (54 %). Rare tumors cases (n = 400), each institution's retrieval rates (all blocks) were 78 % (A), 73 % (B), 67 % (C), and 84 % (D). Retrieval rate (tumor blocks) from all centers for rare tumors was 66 % with mean largest tumor size of 1. 56 cm; retrieval (tumor blocks) was highest for GIST (72 %) and lowest for adenoid cystic carcinoma (58 %). Conclusion Assessment shows availability and quality of archival tissue blocks that are retrievable and associated electronic data that can be of value for researchers. This study serves to compliment the data from which uniform use of the SPIN query tools by all four centers will be measured to assure and highlight the usefulness of archival material for obtaining tumor tissues for research. </p...|$|R
