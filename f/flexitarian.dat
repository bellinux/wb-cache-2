50|$|A {{semi-vegetarian}} or <b>flexitarian</b> diet is {{one that}} is plant-based with the occasional inclusion of meat. In 2003, the American Dialect Society voted <b>flexitarian</b> as the year's most useful word.|$|E

50|$|Vegetarianism is the {{practice}} of abstaining from consuming meat. Along with the term <b>flexitarian,</b> which was listed in the mainstream Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2012, other neologisms for semi-vegetarianism are reducetarianism and lessetarianism.|$|E
40|$|Meat is {{critical}} {{with respect to}} sustainability because meat products {{are among the most}} energy-intensive and ecologically burdensome foods. Empirical studies of the meat-consumption frequency of Dutch consumers show that, apart from meat-avoiders and meat-eaters, many people are meat-reducers that eat no meat at least one day per week. Meat-consumption frequencies provide empirical evidence for different modes of “flexitarianism,” including light, medium, and heavy <b>flexitarians.</b> In particular, the existence of heavy <b>flexitarians</b> suggests that the customary position of meat and other animal-based dietary products in the food hierarchy is not inviolable. To improve our understanding of meat reduction, cluster analysis adds information about differences across <b>flexitarians.</b> Given the enormous environmental impact of animal-protein consumption and the apparent sympathy of consumers for meat reduction, it is surprising that politicians and policy makers demonstrate little, if any, interest in strategies to reduce meat consumption and to encourage more sustainable eating practices...|$|R
50|$|A 2015 {{study found}} that Belgian omnivores, semi-vegetarians (<b>flexitarians),</b> and vegetarians have {{fundamentally}} different moral outlooks on animal welfare concerns. However, the three groups were found to donate equally to human-focused charities.|$|R
5000|$|The term demi is {{from the}} Latin dimedius meaning half. [...] The Demitarian diet is to {{literally}} “halve” the standard portion of meat products that would be consumed in a regular meal. This portion is to be replaced with a correspondingly larger portion of vegetables or other food products. The diet also allows {{for the practice of}} not eating meat on certain days but is {{not to be confused with}} “Flexitarians”. <b>Flexitarians</b> eat a predominantly vegetarian diet, are not opposed to eating meat occasionally but do not have the same unifying environmental reasons for reduction in consumption as Demitarians.|$|R

40|$|Veganism {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} and {{is associated with}} multiple benefits regarding a sustainable society. However the group of vegans is relatively small and the literature about this group is very scant. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide insight on what vegans stimulate to the development and maintenance of a vegan lifestyle and which factors complicate this. By conducting literature research, this study provides an overview of the internal and external stimuli and barriers which are involved in the development and maintenance of a vegan lifestyle. It is found that being receptive; having a catalysing experience; a supportive social network and physical environment; instrumental and communicative learning; learning to deal with social situations; ethical motivation; associated positive feelings; and the formation of a new (collective) identity, are the main stimuli. Besides, it appears that the two main obstacles to developing and maintaining a vegan lifestyle are an unsupportive social and physical environment and the confrontation with difficult or unpleasant social situations. Barriers and stimuli faced by people who might develop towards a vegan lifestyle, like <b>flexitarians</b> or vegetarians are excluded from the research. Further empirical research is needed to verify how relatively relevant the identified stimuli and barriers are for contemporary vegans...|$|R
40|$|Our {{growing demand}} for meat and dairy food {{products}} is unsustainable. It {{is hard to imagine}} that this global issue can be solved solely by more efficient technologies. Lowering our meat consumption seems inescapable. Yet, the question is whether modern consumers can be considered as reliable allies to achieve this shift in meat consumption pattern. Is there not a yawning gap between our responsible intentions as citizens and our hedonic desires as consumers? We will argue that consumers can and should be considered as partners that must be involved in realizing new ways of protein consumption that contribute to a more sustainable world. In particular the large food consumer group of <b>flexitarians</b> offer promising opportunities for transforming our meat consumption patterns. We propose a pragmatic approach that explicitly goes beyond the standard suggestion of persuasion strategies and suggests different routes of change, coined sustainability by stealth, moderate involvement, and cultural change respectively. The recognition of more routes of change to a more plant-based diet implies that the ethical debate on meat should not only associate consumer change with rational persuasion strategies and food citizens that instantiate “strong” sustainable consumption. Such a focus narrows the debate on sustainable protein consumption and easily results in disappointment about consumers’ participation. A more wide-ranging concept of ethical consumption can leave the negative verdict behind that consumers are mainly an obstacle for sustainability and lead to a more optimistic view on modern consumers as allies and agents of change...|$|R
40|$|Practicing the <b>Flexitarian</b> diet, a plant-based diet, in {{conjunction}} with physical activity can promote a lifestyle consistent with the American Cancer Society’s recommendations for reducing risks of breast and prostate cancer (American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention, 2015) College students were assessed on knowledge {{of the relationship between}} diet and cancer risk prior to and after accessing information on the American Institute of Cancer Research site or the WKU <b>Flexitarian</b> Pinterest Page. Participants were recruited from the National Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council memberships and the International students at Western Kentucky University. Participants completed a three-phase survey to identify current lifestyle and willingness to modify lifestyle behaviors related to nutrition and cancer. A majority of participants that accessed The WKU <b>Flexitarian</b> Pinterest page or the American Institute of Cancer Research Diet and Cancer Page reported willingness to make a least one lifestyle modification related to diet and cancer risk (91 % of participants who accessed the WKU <b>Flexitarian</b> Pinterest Page and 93 % of participants that accessed the American Institute of Cancer Research Page) ...|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{worldwide}} trend of expanding appetite for meat, scrutiny reveals that {{high levels of}} absolute meat consumption and high percentages of <b>flexitarian</b> consumers, who abstain from eating meat regularly, exist simultaneously. This article briefly examines this paradoxical combination of flexitarianism among Dutch food consumers in times of a dominant carnivorous food culture. Two representative surveys show that significant numbers of respondents declare that they eat no meat at dinner time for several days per week. Flexitarianism amid paramount carnivorism also emerges from consumers’ reactions to questions about both past changes in meat eating and intended future change. Considerable percentages of consumers indicate that their meat consumption has reduced and express their intention to mitigate meat eating in the foreseeable future. At the same time, large majorities of consumers report no change in their meat consumption pattern {{during the last year}} and an intention to continue this pattern next year. The presence of flexitarianism is an important phenomenon considering the economic, ethical (animal welfare) and environmental (ecological footprint) relevance of meat consumption. However, scientific and political attention on meat reduction and flexitarianism is rare in European countries but is vital in realising a more sustainable Europe...|$|E
40|$|Vegetarian and vegan diets {{have seen}} an {{increased}} interest in recent years all across the world. This {{is the case for}} ‘vegans’ who aim for 100 % vegan food, but also for so-called ‘flexitarians’, meat and fish eaters including one or more vegan and vegetarian days in their weekly diets. This paper focuses specifically on vegan organic horticulture produced in greenhouses or in the open field. Vegan organic production (in contrast to vegetarian = eating no meat) excludes all animal inputs into plant production (e. g. manure, blood-meal or horn-meal). It uses ecosystem services supplied by the soil micro-fauna or wild bees for pollination, but uses no domesticated animals or any of their by-products like manure, horn or leather. This paper critically analyses vegan organic horticulture regarding three main topics: Firstly, it describes its current use in organic horticulture and agriculture. Based on this status-quo analysis it critically discusses the standards currently used for vegan organic horticulture and highlights on-going discussions in the organic movements on ‘stockless’, ‘stockfree’, ‘vegan organic’ and ‘veganic’. Secondly, it discusses the agronomic challenges for intensive organic horticultural production. How to manage soil fertility long-term in such systems, while also reducing other external inputs (finite fossil fuels, like oil and peat) into the organic farming system? Thirdly, the paper studies the socio-economics of a large-scale uptake of vegan diets, or more vegan days in <b>flexitarian</b> diets. How can vegan organic contribute to make organic overall more resource efficient and help in the transition to more sustainable diets and consumptions, worldwide...|$|E
