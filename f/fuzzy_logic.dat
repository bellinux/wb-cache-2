50|$|T-norm <b>fuzzy</b> <b>logics</b> {{belong in}} broader classes of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>logics</b> and many-valued logics. In order to {{generate}} a well-behaved implication, the t-norms are usually required to be left-continuous; logics of left-continuous t-norms further belong {{in the class of}} substructural logics, among which they are marked with the validity of the law of prelinearity, (A &rarr; B) &or; (B &rarr; A). Both propositional and first-order (or higher-order) t-norm <b>fuzzy</b> <b>logics,</b> as well as their expansions by modal and other operators, are studied.

25|$|Several {{different}} forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional or sentential logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false. First-order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>logic,</b> is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). Fuzzy systems {{can be used for}} uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. Subjective logic models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a Beta distribution. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.|$|E
