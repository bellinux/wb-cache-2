Thermal insulation of buildings is currently the most important issue, and it is rather difficult to select the most effective insulation material from the abundance available. Therefore, {{in order to take}} the most rational decision, we can use multiple criteria for assessment.

The research problem. The problem being investigated is how to summarise and compare comprehensively the performance indicators of insulation materials expressed by different measurement units. The aim of the research is to apply multicriterial decision-making methods in order to offer the most efficient insulation material that would be fitted together with a wooden frame.

One {{of the main}} problems is consumption of energy in residential, public and industrial buildings. In Lithuania, year 2013, new requirements of Technical Regulation of Construction STR 2. 05. 01 : 2013 „Projection of energy perfomcance of buildings“ took effect. In accordance with it, buildings were classified by energy performance in these classes: A++, A+, A, A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Buildings of class A++ were regarded as the best, practically not using any energy. From 1 January 2021, all newly built buildings will have to conform this class. In this article I will analyze currently the most popular materials of insulation, which are being used for pitched and flat roofs, frame walls, porous <b>concrete</b> walls, <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> walls, walls of silicate blocks and log walls. With these thermal insulation materials {{it is possible to}} reach the highest class of energy performance, A++. The criteria of calculation were selected at my discretion, and the head people, working at building insulation, will evaluate their importance. The criteria of roofs and walls will be evaluated separately. In their opinion, the most important criteria of the walls is the price of insulation material of 1 m 2, and the least important – immunity to fire and water absorption. The most important criteria of roofs is also the price of insulation material of 1 m 2, and the least important – water absorption. According to calculations, the best insulation material for a flat roof is polystyrene foam(non water absorbing), and the worst – stone wool. By chosen criteria the best pitched roof is the one installed with sprayed eco-wool, and the worst – with polyurethane plate. One of the best insulation materials for a wall is polystyrene foam.

Triaxial permeability is generally used for concrete with higher permeability while concrete with very low permeability are suited for the penetration method. <b>Clay</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens of 0 to 40 % clay content {{were used in the}} study.

Results show that concrete gains moisture during wetting at a much faster rate than it loses during subsequent drying. This could be explained by the contribution of suction pressure created upon drying. When water penetration pressure is applied, more water is driven into pore space than could be responsible for changing the network of the voids. Pore structure during drying may certainly be different in size and shape than its form during wetting, leading to a consequent effect on the permeability of the <b>clay</b> <b>concretes.</b> The modification could be one reason that the moisture gain percentage in <b>clay</b> <b>concretes</b> was higher than in normal concretes...|$|R

In the graduation thesis we examined the main mechanisms that cause autogenous shrinkage. It can be reduced by internal curinginternal water reservoirs. As internal water reservoirs we used pre-soaked <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> Liapor. On specimens, in which we replaced 12 % of aggregate with pre-soaked <b>expanded</b> <b>clay,</b> we measured shrinkage and compressive strength. The results were compared with previously performed tests on high performance concrete without additives and on high performance concrete with addition of pre-soaked lightweight aggregate Lehnjak. We concluded that content of pre-soaked <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> has positive effect on shrinkage, but negative effect on the compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} provides possibilities {{to reuse}} solid waste from aluminium scrap recycling factories and {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) container glass {{for the production of}} lightweight aggregates. The aluminium dross residue is increasing along with the increase in the aluminum production. Similarly the problem of container glass rational utilization is a topical problem over the world. The presented research is focused to solve problems concerning to both industrial and municipal waste collection. The production of <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> aggregate was simulated in the laboratory with pilot rotary furnace and electric furnace. <b>Expanded</b> <b>clay</b> aggregate was produced with different glass waste: aluminium dross: clay mix ratios, where aluminium dross acted as an extra pore-forming agent and glass waste as a fluxing agent. Pore structure was abundant ranging from irregular to spherical, resulting in low apparent density values, which directly was affected with the firing temperature up to 1200 °C and time, controlled with the rotation velocity and furnace incline. The main objectives of this experimental study are {{to examine the effects of}} aluminium dross and glass waste addition to the physical and microstructure properties of <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> aggregate sintered on a laboratory scale. Key words: <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> aggregate, glass waste, aluminium dros...|$|R
