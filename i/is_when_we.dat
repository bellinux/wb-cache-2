Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe {{the same thing happened}} to you, the ultimate breakup in life <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E

As Green wrote, [...] "there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go as we please, and without embarrassment." ...|$|E
500|$|Great Moments in Aviation {{was written}} by Jeanette Winterson, {{directed}} by Beeban Kidron and produced by Phillippa Giles, the same creative team who, in 1990, adapted Winterson's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for television. Giles, for whom Great Moments was her first feature film, believes {{that it was the}} success of Oranges which lead the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to approve the film so easily. The screenplay is inspired by the emigration story of the mother of actress Vicky Licorish, a close friend of Winterson. It is adapted from a short story Winterson wrote entitled [...] "Atlantic Crossing", published in 1999 in her anthology The World and Other Places. The central themes of the story are [...] "race, Hemingway, colonialism, love, lust, the [...] '50s", adapted into the screenplay in a manner Winterson intended to be reminiscent of a fairytale. She ascribes the roles of hero and heroine to Duncan and Gabriel, fairy godmothers to Miss Quim and Dr Bead, and non-archetypal villain to Rex Goodyear. Setting the film on a passenger liner, with brief scenes in Gabriel's native Grenada were intended to contribute towards this fairytale atmosphere, with Winterson explaining that the opening sequence in the Caribbean is [...] "designed to draw the audience out of the world of their own concerns and into a world whose customs are strange. In the new world, objects are unfamiliar and events do not follow the usual rules. The coincidence of colour and language, each more vivid than normal, pull the viewer forward with fairytale immediacy." [...] Of the passenger liner aspect, she explains that it provides the film with: [...] "a sealed and contained world with its own identity and rituals, at once both recognisable and odd. Fairytale never leaves the reader in a familiar spot, we are whisked away to a wood or a lake or a castle or an island, each a law unto itself made all the more uncomfortable because it isn't as weird as, say, planet Mars. We think {{we will be able to}} cope just by using out usual tool kit, how disconcerting it <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Each term in {{the above}} {{equation}} has the units of a [...] "body force" [...] (force per unit volume) with the same dimensions of a density times an acceleration. Each term is thus dependent on the exact measurements of a flow. When one renders the equation nondimensional, that <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> multiply it by a factor with inverse units of the base equation, we obtain a form that does not depend directly on the physical sizes. One possible way to obtain a nondimensional equation is to multiply the whole equation by the factor ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the band was named Force and came together in 1979, in Upplands Väsby, Stockholm, and was integrated by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. [...] "I remember when we started the band Force we were playing covers in the rehearsal room, because {{we just wanted to}} learn our instruments, like all bands," [...] Tempest said, [...] "Then one day I said maybe we should do our own stuff. Nobody had any ideas, so I brought mine into the rehearsal room, and that <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started writing our own stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|On top of {{his grief}} for his family and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered {{by the fact that}} none of the Israelis who had {{accepted}} his mother's hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet in my mother’s chest. We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> saw the real face of the left in Israel." [...] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he says, but he won’t personally. He won’t forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{president}} Aleksander Kwaśniewski told TVN24 that, [...] "It [...] is a cursed place. It sends shivers down my spine. First {{the flower}} of the Second Polish Republic is {{murdered in the}} forests around Smolensk, now the elite of the Third Polish Republic die in this tragic aircraft crash when approaching Smolensk North Airport." [...] Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that, [...] "The contemporary world has not seen such a tragedy". Former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller, who had himself suffered injuries in a helicopter crash while in office, said that Poland's aircraft {{were known to be}} in need of replacement, despite the lack of evidence that anything was wrong with the particular airplane; [...] "I once said that we will one day meet in a funeral procession, and that <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> will take the decision to replace the aircraft fleet," [...] he said. The crash fuelled anti-Russian sentiment among far right extremists, with Polish nationalists invoking the tragedy during a riot outside the Russian embassy in Warsaw in November 2013.|$|E
2500|$|The tour, choreographed by Tina Landon, {{was officially}} {{announced}} on December 9, 2009, {{while on the}} set of the music video for [...] "Hard". She also announced some dates for the European leg of the tour on her official website. It went on to gross over $9.1 million in North America from 26 shows according to Pollstar, and the 2011 Australian leg of the tour added another $10 million to the total. English singer-songwriter Pixie Lott was selected as the opening act for the UK shows, along with last minute additions of Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah. In an interview with MTV, she stated, [...] "We've been ... coming out with different ideas and cool things that we can do. Things that we've never seen before, daring things – but now <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> really start with the rehearsal and we get into the nitty-gritty and the details of everything" [...] while describing the vibe of the tour as [...] "daring".

2500|$|According to Rae Wear, Bjelke-Petersen demanded total {{loyalty of}} the media and was unforgiving and vindictive if {{reporting}} was not to his satisfaction. In 1984, he reacted to a series of critical articles in the Courier-Mail by switching the government's million-dollar classified advertising account to the rival Daily Sun. He banned a Courier-Mail reporter who was critical of his excessive use of the government aircraft and Wear claims other journalists who wrote critical articles became the subject of rumour-mongering, were harassed by traffic police, or found that [...] "leaks" [...] from the government dried up. Journalists covering industrial disputes and picketing were also afraid of arrest. In 1985, the Australian Journalists Association withdrew from the system of police passes because of police refusal to accredit certain journalists. Journalists, editors and producers were also deterred from critical stories by Bjelke-Petersen's increasing use of defamation actions {{in order to try to}} [...] "stop talk about a corrupt government". Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald was threatened with criminal libel in 1984 when he sought to publish a critical history of the state. The premier and his ministers launched 24 defamation actions against the Opposition leader and Labor Party and trade union figures, with 14 of them publicly funded. He saw no role for the media in making government accountable, telling the Australian Financial Review in 1986: [...] "The greatest thing that could happen to the state and the nation <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get rid {{of the media}}. Then we would live in peace and tranquillity and no one would know anything." ...|$|E
