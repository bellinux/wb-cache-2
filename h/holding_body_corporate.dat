40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} {{recent developments}} in the emergence within Europe of systems of criminal law designed to <b>hold</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>bodies</b> liable where they cause the deaths of workers or members of the public. These changes point {{to the emergence of}} a new, more punitive, legal culture in relation to corporate crime. At the same time, however, there is evidence to suggest that this punitive culture is not uniform; different national jurisdictions reflect it to differing degrees. The chapter explores {{the degree to which the}} UK’s willingness to criminalise work-related deaths is mirrored elsewhere in Europe, and identifies some factors that might account for variations in this regard. In particular, attention is paid to the influence that social and political culture have on practices in this area. It is written as part of a research handbook on corporate crime in Europe, so has an eye on a more generalist audience in some regards...|$|R
