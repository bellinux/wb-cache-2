Two of the episodes in this boxed set featured Spidey segments; however, {{in several of the}} other episodes, the Spider-Man segments were <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> minimize the appearance of the character because of rights issues.

50|$|In early repeats of {{the opening}} special, Rufus' dream {{sequence}} set to 'Better Than A Dream' was <b>edited</b> <b>out,</b> due <b>to</b> timing restrictions on TV for standard length episodes.

Almost half of the songs recorded for the film were left out of the final version.|$|R

The first season revolved around an investigation by undercover police officers Víctor Reyes (Yon González) and Laura Cortés (Blanca Romero), alongside their superior, Superintendent Casas (Lluís Homar). In May 2015, {{it was confirmed that}} the series would have a second season, centered on a different investigation, in which Yon González and Lluís Homar would reprise their roles, with Olivia Molina playing the new main female character.|$|R

50|$|The second series began {{broadcasting}} on 2 June 2003 on BBC One {{during the}} 9 to 10 pm timeslot, {{and continued on}} every Monday night until 11 August 2003, {{although there was a}} week break in the schedule midway through the series due to an overrun of a Wimbledon tennis match on 30 June.

In the US, the second series aired on A&E, though each episode had approximately fifteen minutes <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> accommodate for advert breaks.

5000|$|Shooting {{took place}} in Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and the Catskills Mountains. There was a three-month hiatus in the {{shooting}} schedule so that the seasons could change for the exterior shots. [...] Shooting took 26 days. [...] The long take in the survivor's settlement, with the vampires being dropped by the brotherhood, was not originally planned that way but evolved as time limitations forced the scene into a single day's shooting. Mickle decided {{that the best way}} to solve the time issues was to get it over with as a single take. In the end, only a few frames were <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> remove poor acting from extras. The score was performed by Glass Eye Pix regular Jeff Grace, whose work on The Last Winter had impressed Mickle.|$|R

Thus their love scenes were <b>edited</b> <b>out,</b> and <b>to</b> flesh <b>out</b> the sibling relationship, new scenes with child actors as well as narration by Song were added.|$|R

50|$|While quite {{cavalier}} {{with regards}} to geography, Panini was remarkably faithful in his architectural reconstructions.

500|$|He {{received}} the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988 and the MTV Video Vanguard Artist of the Decade Award in 1990 {{to celebrate his}} accomplishments in the art form in the 1980s; in 1991 the first award was renamed in his honor. [...] "Black or White" [...] {{was accompanied by a}} controversial music video, which, on November 14, 1991, simultaneously premiered in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest viewing ever for a music video at that time. It featured scenes construed as having a sexual nature as well as depictions of violence. The offending scenes in the final half of the 14-minute version were <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> prevent the video from being banned, and Jackson apologized. Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Peggy Lipton, and George Wendt. It helped usher in morphing as an important technology in music videos.|$|R

5000|$|Visual Entertainment has {{released}} all three seasons of Riptide, available in Canada only. Unlike the U.S. release, {{all of the}} opening teasers are intact. However, several episodes have music replaced and sequences <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> due <b>to</b> copyright issues.

5000|$|... "Rain Must Fall" [...] is a {{collaboration}} between Deacon (music) and Mercury (lyrics) (as confirmed by producer David Richards and, more recently, May on his website). Taylor recorded a lot of Latin percussion but most of that was <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> in order <b>to</b> have more space for vocal harmonies, guitars and keyboards, the latter shared between Mercury and Deacon in this piece.|$|R
5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would boost its timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes <b>edited</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|R
50|$|Two {{scenes that}} had been filmed for the {{production}} were <b>edited</b> <b>out,</b> due <b>to</b> Lew Grade objecting to their subject matter. These were a dream sequence that involved both Adam and Alex killing Benson and a scene where Hector ripped apart Benson's dead body {{on a table in}} one of the colony's laboratories. Regardless of these cuts, the film received an MPAA rating of R, for scenes of violence and brief nudity. In the UK, the film was given a more relaxed A certificate by the BBFC for its theatrical release, though subsequent home video releases were given a 15 certificate.|$|R
50|$|The series {{originally}} aired live {{on cable}} channel tvN in 16 episodes (14 30-minute episodes aired back-to-back {{over a period}} of 7 weeks, with the last 2 episodes aired separately and lasting 1 hour each due to the amount of material the staff didn't want <b>to</b> <b>edit</b> <b>out).</b> However, due <b>to</b> its popularity, the 15th and 16th episodes were also aired simultaneously on Mnet, OCN, O'live, Ongamenet and OnStyle.|$|R
