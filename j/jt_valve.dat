50|$|Swirl valve {{technology}} has been developed by Twister BV of the Netherlands primarily for the gas processing market. This technology {{is similar to the}} swirl tube and can also be applied for liquid/liquid separation applications such as oil/water separation and for oil degassing. It is currently being used for optimising existing Joule-Thomson (JT-LTS) systems to minimise liquid carryover. The swirl valve is exactly the same as a Joule-Thomson (JT) choke valve, but it enhances the performance of downstream separators for the same pressure drop, by maximising droplet coalescence. The technology can be applied where a low temperature separator is undersized, or when a lower pressure drop over a <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> is needed with a similar dew pointing performance. It can also be applied for reducing glycol/chemical inhibition liquid mist carry-over problems.|$|E
5000|$|The Joule-Thomson (JT) cooler {{was invented}} by Carl von Linde and William Hampson so it is also called the Linde-Hampson cooler. Basically {{it is a very}} simple type of cooler which is widely applied as {{cryocooler}} or as the (final stage) of liquefactors. It can easily be miniaturized, but it is also used on a very large scale in the liquefaction of natural gas. A schematic diagram of a JT liquefier is given in fig. 8. It consists of a compressor, a counterflow heat exchanger, a <b>JT</b> <b>valve,</b> and a reservoir. In fig. 8, the pressures and temperatures refer to the case of a nitrogen liquefier. At the inlet of the compressor the gas is at room temperature (300 K) and a pressure of 1 bar (point a). The compression heat is removed by cooling water. After compression the gas temperature is ambient temperature (300 K) and the pressure is 200 bar (point b). Next it enters the warm (high-pressure) side of the counterflow heat exchanger where it is precooled. It leaves the exchanger at point c. After the JT expansion, point d, it has a temperature of 77.36 K and a pressure of 1 bar. The liquid fraction is x. The liquid leaves the system {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir (point e) and the gas (fraction 1 − x) flows into the cold (low-pressure) side of the counterflow heat exchanger (point f). It leaves the heat exchanger at room temperature (point a). In order to keep the system in the steady state gas is supplied to compensate for the liquid fraction x that has been removed.|$|E
40|$|An advanced, modular bottom-supported cryomodule {{design is}} {{described}} which is highly optimized for mass-production and efficient precision-assembly. The FRIB driver linac uses 4 types of superconducting resonators and 2 solenoid lengths {{which in turn}} require 7 individual cryomodule configurations. To meet alignment tolerances a precision-machined bolted cryomodule rail system is described. A novel, kinematic mounting system of the cold mass is introduced which allows for thermal contractions while preserving alignment. A first prototype will incorporate a wire position monitor for alignment verification. The cold alignment structure is supported by composite posts which also function as thermal isolators. The cryogenic system provides separate 2 K and 4. 5 K liquid helium lines to cavities and solenoids. Details of the <b>JT</b> <b>valves,</b> heat exchanger, cool-down circuit and junction to cryogenic line will be provided. Transient cool-down was simulated for stresses and buckling failure. A 1100 -O Aluminum shield {{is used as a}} thermal radiation shield.

40|$|The main {{components}} of a helium liquefier determines the performance for a given compressor flow rate are Turbine, HE and <b>JT</b> <b>valve.</b> Turbine and <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> produces cooling effect by isentropic and isenthalpic expansion. For each configuration {{main components}} can have different operating process parameters leading to different performance of HRL. This project involves the analysis and optimization of compressor outlet pressure for a given configuration. <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> is at the lowest temperature to get the highest liquefaction which depends {{on the performance of}} other components so optimization of process parameter of <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> is not considered here. One of the different cycle configurations is analyzed and is often used in HRL. This configuration, planned to use for the indigenous helium plant, has 3 turbines and 8 HE which produces liquid helium at 4. 5 K. 1 st and 2 nd turbines operates at warmer temperature compared to 3 rd and those are connected in series. Helium stream coming out of the 1 st turbine passes to HE which will reduce its temperature before entering the 2 nd turbine. Helium flow rate supplied by the compressor system is 210 g/s at 14 bar and 310 k. Effects of compressor flow rate and pressure on the cooling capacity of the plant have been analyzed. A part of this flow rate passes through a 1 st and 2 nd turbine for isentropic expansion to 1. 2 bar and then this low pressure helium stream comes back to compressor suction through different HE to transfer cooling effect to the hot stream coming from the compressor. 3 rd turbine will expand to 4 bar and this stream further passes through a HE before entering the <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> for liquid helium production. This work involves different practical factors and in efficiencies of main components. The analysis result for flow of 140 g/s at 14 bars is further compared with the performance of existing helium plant at IPR which has same compressor flow parameter. The results are also compared with that of the aspen tech software...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{specific}} impulse and favorable thermal properties for storage, liquid methane (LCH 4) is being considered as a candidate propellant for exploration architectures. In order to gain an -understanding of any unique considerations involving micro-gravity pressure control with LCH 4, testing was conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using the Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) to evaluate {{the performance of a}} spray-bar thermodynamic vent system (TVS) with subcooled LCH 4 and gaseous helium (GHe) pressurant. Thirteen days of testing were performed in November 2006, with total tank heat leak conditions of about 715 W and 420 W at a fill level of approximately 90 %. The TVS system was used to subcool the LCH 4 to a liquid saturation pressure of approximately 55. 2 kPa before the tank was pressurized with GHe to a total pressure of 165. 5 kPa. A total of 23 TVS cycles were completed. The TVS successfully controlled the ullage pressure within a prescribed control band but did not maintain a stable liquid saturation pressure. This was likely. due to a TVS design not optimized for this particular propellant and test conditions, and possibly due to a large artificially induced heat input directly into the liquid. The capability to reduce liquid saturation pressure as well as maintain it within a prescribed control band, demonstrated that the TVS could be used to seek and maintain a desired liquid inlet temperature for an engine (at a cost of propellant lost through the TVS vent). One special test was conducted {{at the conclusion of the}} planned test activities. Reduction of the tank ullage pressure by opening the Joule-Thomson valve (JT) without operating the pump was attempted. The JT remained open for over 9300 seconds, resulting in an ullage pressure reduction of 30 kPa. The special test demonstrated the feasibility of using the <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> for limited ullage pressure reduction in the event of a pump failure...|$|E
40|$|Cryogenic {{refrigerators}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular particularly {{in the areas of}} superconducting magnet applications, particle accelerators and medical imaging systems, etc. It has also got wide applications in preservation of live biological materials as well as in scientific equipment. In spite of nearly half a century of R & D experience, our country is still dependent on imports for most of its needs in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers. These components are enormously expensive to buy and to maintain. The customers are often forced to buy equipment due to non-availability of proprietary spares. It is imperative that our country develops an indigenous nitrogen liquefier of capacity in the range 10 to 50 litre/hour. With the support from the Department of Atomic Energy, our institute has initiated a programme on development and study of a turboexpander based nitrogen liquefier of intermediate capacity (20 l/h). The focus of this project is to build a turbine based liquid nitrogen generator of capacity 20 l/h using indigenous technology. This technology and expertise will be extended for the liquefaction of helium in future. The development of the turboexpander based nitrogen liquefier begins with the process design of the cycle. The simulation of the cycles has been done using the software Aspen HYSYS. All the state points are fixed and each equipment specifications are determined. While designing the process, equipment availability, constraints and cost is to be kept in mind. Process design also includes the setting the parameters up to the optimum condition so that maximum amount of liquid will be obtained. After process design the thermodynamics parameters of all the components are available. As per process the nitrogen gas is compressed in the compressor upto 8 bar. The compressed gas passes through the first heat exchanger. Some amount of the gas is diverted through the turboexpander and remaining gas flow through the second heat exchanger. A <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> is used to expand the liquid which is collected in the phase separator at a pressure just above ambient (1. 2 bar). The vapour comes out of phase separator mixes with the cold gas from the turboexpander and the resultant stream meets at the suction side of the compressor, after passing through the second and first heat exchanger as the reversed stream...|$|E

40|$|A report {{discusses}} a cryogenic {{reaction control}} system (RCS) that integrates a Joule-Thompson (<b>JT)</b> device (expansion <b>valve)</b> and thermodynamic vent system (TVS) with a cryogenic distribution system to allow fine {{control of the}} propellant quality (subcooled liquid) during operation of the device. It enables zero-venting when coupled with an RCS engine. The proper attachment locations and sizing of the orifice are required with the propellant distribution line to facilitate line conditioning. During operations, system instrumentation was strategically installed along the distribution/TVS line assembly, and temperature control bands were identified. A sub-scale run tank, full-scale distribution line, open-loop TVS, and a combination of procured and custom-fabricated cryogenic components {{were used in the}} cryogenic RCS build-up. Simulated on-orbit activation and thruster firing profiles were performed to quantify system heat gain and evaluate the TVS s capability to maintain the required propellant conditions at the inlet to the engine valves. Test data determined that a small control valve, such as a piezoelectric, is optimal to provide continuously the required thermal control. The data obtained from testing has also assisted with the development of fluid and thermal models of an RCS to refine integrated cryogenic propulsion system designs. This system allows a liquid oxygenbased main propulsion and reaction control system for a spacecraft, which improves performance, safety, and cost over conventional hypergolic systems due to higher performance, use of nontoxic propellants, potential for integration with life support and power subsystems, and compatibility with in-situ produced propellants...|$|R
40|$|A new CO 2 capture {{technology}} for the IGCC power plant of 500 MW capacity was proposed by Surovtseva, Amin and Barifcani in the year 2011. This technology required a cooling system to cool the flue gas from 35 °C to - 55 °C for effective carbon dioxide capture. The initial work estimated that the energy required for cooling {{will be in the}} order of 13 MW through basic thermodynamic analysis, but the detailed analysis of the refrigeration system was not covered. The cooling system for this technology was further analysed and improved by Qi Tian (CDU Student- 2014 - 2015). But it required energy in the order of 50 MW after heat recovery for operation. This made the capture technology an energy intensive one as it consumed 10 % of the plant capacity when compared to 5 - 7 % for the existing technologies. The objective of this thesis is to research for multiple alternatives for the cooling system and to design an effective cooling system whose energy requirement is in the order of 13 MW as estimated by the initial works. The first alternative involved integration of a conventional JT based cooling cycle with a multistage heat exchanger system. For this case the energy required for achieving the cooling was found to be in the order of 130 MW. This approach did not perform as expected because of the high influence of negative JT coefficient of Hydrogen in the flue gas. The second alternative researched was redesigning the cooler, used after the heat recovery system, with optimum refrigerant combinations at the operating conditions and with different refrigeration cycles. This also did not lead to the expected result as the energy consumption by the system was in the order of 60 MW to 80 MW. The third alternative researched was the sub-cooling of the separated CO 2, which exits the heat recovery system, in a <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> and using it as a cold source to further reduce the feed gas temperature. This further reduced the cooling load on the final stage chiller substantially and brought down the power consumption to 11. 7 MW which is even lesser when compared to initial prediction of 13 MW thus arriving the thesis objective. The additional heat transfer units were designed as another outcome of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculations}} done to size {{the control}} dewar subcooler were done {{to obtain a}} sufficient subcooler size based on some conservative assumptions. The final subcooler design proposed in the design report will work even better because (1) It has more tubing length, and (2) will have already subcooled liquid at the inlet due to the transfer line design. The subcooler design described in the 'Design Report of the 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid for the Fermilab D 0 Detector Upgrade' is the final design proposed. A short description of this design follows. The subcooler is constructed of 0. 50 -inch OD copper tubing with 1. 0 -inch diameter fins. It has ten and one half spirals at a 11. 375 -inch centerline diameter to provide 31 feet of tubing length. The liquid helium supply for the solenoid flows through the subcooler and then is expanded through a J-T valve. The subcooler spirals are immersed in the return two phase helium process stream. The return stream is directed over the finned tubing by an annulus created by a 10 -inch pipe inside a 12 -inch pipe. The transfer line from the refrigerator to the control dewar is constructed such that the liquid helium supply tube is in the refrigerator return stream, thereby subcooling the liquid {{up to the point}} where the u-tubes connect the transfer line to the control dewar. The subcooler within the control dewar will remove the heat picked up in the helium supply u-tube/bayonets. The attached subcooler/heat exchanger calculations were done neglecting any subcooling in the transfer line. All heat picked up in the transfer line from the refrigerator storage dewar to the control dewar is absorbed by the supply stream. The subcooler was sized such that the two phase supply fluid is subcooled at 1. 7 atm pressure and when expanded through a <b>JT</b> <b>valve</b> to 1. 45 atm pressure it is at a saturated liquid state. The calculations apply during steady state operation and at a flow rate of 16 g/s. The analysis of the heat exchanger was broken into two parts relating to the heat transfer mode taking place. The first part is considered the condensing part in which the helium supply stream is changed from two phase fluid to one phase liquid. The second part is the subcooling part where the liquid temperature is lowered, i. e [...] subcooled. A summary of the calculations and results appears on the next page. The raw calculations follow the summary...|$|E
