5000|$|Pushbutton vandal-resistant {{switches}} {{are frequently}} constructed {{of stainless steel}} or other durable materials, and are mounted into panels or housing boxes made out of strong materials, such as polycarbonate plastic, aluminium, or stainless steel. In some cases, the housing may be 1/4 in thick, to protect both the switch and the housing from attempts by vandals to damage the switch or housing using blunt force. The housing for vandal-proof switches is often secured using security screws (which cannot be unscrewed with regular screw drivers). The height of buttons in the panel is often minimized by using <b>flush-mounting,</b> {{to make it more}} difficult to pry them out, a design technique used in ATM banking machines that are located outside.|$|E
30|$|Appearance {{should not}} to be {{overlooked}} {{when it comes to}} installing cameras. If the cameras will be installed in an outdoor environment, large outdoor enclosures may invoke a sense of intimidation (see Figure 4 (a)). It is recommended to take into consideration the environment the cameras will be installed to decide whether discreetness or visibility are higher concerns. As opposed to surface-mounting (installing a camera directly on a ceiling surface), <b>flush-mounting</b> (cutting a hole and installing a camera in the ceiling with the optics exposed) will provide a more discreet and streamlined appearance, but will require permanent alteration to the installation locations. If a network is temporary, readers are recommended to consider the life expectancy of the network before opting for flush mounting.|$|E

Although Ford utilized the longest forward body of any full-size van, the hood was angled downward slightly and the windshield raked back; if specified, all side window glass was <b>flush-mounted.</b> For the first time, the E-Series utilized <b>flush-mounted</b> wraparound taillights and <b>flush-mounted</b> headlights (the latter were an option, standard on Club Wagons).

50|$|In a {{magnetized}} plasma, {{it appears}} to be best to choose a probe size a few times larger than the ion Larmor radius. A point of contention is whether it is better to use proud probes, where the angle between the magnetic field and the surface is at least 15°, or <b>flush-mounted</b> probes, which are embedded in the plasma-facing components and generally have an angle of 1 to 5 °. Many plasma physicists feel more comfortable with proud probes, which have a longer tradition and possibly are less perturbed by electron saturation effects, although this is disputed. <b>Flush-mounted</b> probes, on the other hand, being part of the wall, are less perturbative. Knowledge of the field angle is necessary with proud probes to determine the fluxes to the wall, whereas it is necessary with <b>flush-mounted</b> probes to determine the density.|$|R

40|$|A 0. 0196 -scale {{model of}} the HL- 20 lifting-body, one of several {{configurations}} proposed for future crewed spacecraft, was tested in the Langley 31 -Inch Mach 10 Tunnel. The purpose of the tests {{was to determine the}} effectiveness of fin-mounted elevons, a lower surface <b>flush-mounted</b> body flap, and a <b>flush-mounted</b> yaw controller at hypersonic speeds. The nominal angle-of-attack range, representative of hypersonic entry, was 2 deg to 41 deg, the sideslip angles were 0 deg, 2 deg, and - 2 deg, and the test Reynolds number was 1. 06 x 10 E 6 based on model reference length. The aerodynamic, longitudinal, and lateral control effectiveness along with surface oil flow visualizations are presented and discussed. The configuration was longitudinally and laterally stable at the nominal center of gravity. The primary longitudinal control, the fin-mounted elevons, could not trim the model to the desired entry angle of attack of 30 deg. The lower surface body flaps were effective for roll control and the associated adverse yawing moment was eliminated by skewing the body flap hinge lines. A yaw controller, <b>flush-mounted</b> on the lower surface, was also effective, and the associated small rolling moment was favorable...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the heat {{transfer}} enhancement of {{a bundle of}} <b>flush-mounted</b> ribbons placed {{on the floor of}} a rectangular duct was investigated experimentally.

The state of the art of this work revolves around an experimental investigation of an EHD 1 active method and heat transfer enhancement from the surfaces of the flush- mounted ribbons. Due to the intricacies of the required experiment, a special apparatus needed to be designed and constructed...|$|R
