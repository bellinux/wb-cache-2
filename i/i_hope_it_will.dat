500|$|During {{the trial}} of Sir John Fenwick, who was implicated in a plot to assassinate King William, Gloucester signed {{a letter to the}} King {{promising}} his loyalty. [...] "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," [...] the letter read, [...] "had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be long ere you conquer France." [...] Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: [...] "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in the Saturday Review of Literature, Oswald Garrison Villard criticized America's 60 Families, {{describing}} it as [...] "bitter muckracking", lamenting that it merely revisited old themes, and ultimately dismissing {{it with the}} caution that as [...] "a guidebook to American folly and scandal it has a place. How <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not find its way to Hitler and Mussolini! It would be held by them to be proof positive that our democracy is beyond hope". Several years later, Nazi politician Robert Ley, head of the German Labor Front, published a pamphlet in Germany titled Roosevelt Betrays America! in which he cited Lundberg's book as proof that [...] "nowhere are as many scoundrels running around loose as in the United States".|$|E
500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Manchester United had lost in the {{calendar}} year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he is not coming back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be after his medical and that is the end of it." [...] Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.|$|E

500|$|On December 2, 2010, Hayes {{apologized for}} the pain and {{suffering}} he had caused the Petit family and added that: [...] "Death for me will be a welcome relief and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> bring some peace and comfort to those who I have hurt so much." [...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E
500|$|The British used {{smallpox}} as {{a biological}} warfare agent at the Siege of Fort Pitt during the French and Indian Wars (1754–1763) against France and its Native American allies. The actual use of smallpox had official sanction. British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted {{the use of}} smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by historians, [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy", and [...] "it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox". [...] On June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, [...] "Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> have the desired effect." [...] The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown. There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).|$|E

2500|$|After his crash at Spa, Stewart {{became an}} outspoken {{advocate}} for auto racing safety. Later, he explained, [...] "If I have any legacy {{to leave the}} sport <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{be seen to be}} an area of safety because when I arrived in Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical." [...] By Stewart's reckoning, a driver who raced for five years had a two-thirds chance of being killed in a crash.|$|E
2500|$|Historians Elizabeth Fenn and Benedict Kiernan have shown, [...] "Fort Pitt had {{anticipated}} these orders. Reporting on parleys with Delaware chiefs on June 24, a trader [...] wrote: ' gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief {{out of the}} Small Pox Hospital. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> have the desired effect.' The military hospital records confirm that two blankets and handkerchiefs were 'taken from people in the Hospital to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.' The fort commander paid for these items, which he certified 'were had for the uses above mentioned.' Historian Elizabeth Fenn has documented 'the eruption of epidemic smallpox' among Delaware and Shawnee Indians nearby, {{about the time the}} blankets were distributed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} at the Welsh Kennel Club {{championship}} {{two days after the}} programme aired, Kennel Club Chairman Ronnie Irving said that [...] "If this programme teaches us anything, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> teach the 'purists' in some breeds that they simply must get a move on and realise that in these politically correct and well informed days, some old attitudes are simply no longer sustainable." [...] Maintaining that the majority of dogs are healthy he said that [...] "the roughly 90% of us who thankfully have healthy breeds must continue to guard against exaggeration and must bring pressure to bear on the laggards, otherwise we will – all of us – continue to be tarred with the same brush".|$|E
