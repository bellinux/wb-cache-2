50|$|In {{printing}} inks mainly organic pigments are used, so shifting or bleaching of {{the color}} of a printing product due to presence of the UV light is usually just a matter of time. The usage of the organic pigments is justified especially by their inexpensive price comparing to <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments.</b> The particle size of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments</b> is often larger than on organic <b>pigments</b> thus all <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments</b> are not suitable {{to be used in the}} offset printing.|$|R

30|$|Scientific {{research}} into ancient polychromy (painted surfaces) has expanded {{during the past}} 20 years. However, of the two fundamental constituents of paint, pigments and binders, the former, especially the <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments,</b> have received by far the greatest attention. This focus can, to a large extent, {{be explained by the}} fact that <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments</b> supply the colour, they are visible and therefore intrinsic to the question of what sculptures looked like in the past, rather than to questions of technique such as how the painting was done. Moreover, traces of ancient polychromy are generally extremely sparse and organic components have usually deteriorated or been lost altogether after centuries—even millennia—in the archaeological record, which makes the study of them an even greater challenge.|$|R
30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, in principle, for each colour there is a process that leads to an <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigment</b> and another to an organic dye; this is the case for blue, yellow, red and green.|$|E
40|$|Low atomic oxygen fluence (below 1 x 10 (exp 20) atoms/sq cm) {{exposure}} of polymers and paints {{that have a}} small ash content and/or <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigment</b> fill does not cause {{a significant difference in}} erosion yield compared to unfilled (neat) polymers or paints. However, if the ash and/or <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigment</b> content is increased, the surface population of the inorganic content will begin to occupy a significant fraction of the surface area as the atomic oxygen exposure increases because the ash is not volatile and remains as a loosely attached surface layer. This results in a reduction of the flux of atomic oxygen reacting with the polymer and a reduction in the rate of erosion of the polymer remaining. This paper presents the results of ground laboratory and low Earth orbital (LEO) investigations to evaluate the fluence dependence of atomic oxygen erosion yields of polymers and paints having inorganic fill content...|$|E
40|$|A purple <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigment,</b> YGa 1 -xMnxO 3 (0 < x <= 0. 10), {{based on}} {{hexagonal}} YGaO 3 is reported here. The metastable series of oxides were prepared by a sol-gel technique where the dried gels, obtained from aqueous solutions of metal nitrate-citric acid mixtures, were calcined {{for a short}} duration in a preheated furnace around 850 degrees C. The purple colour of the oxides arises from the specific trigonal bipyramidal ligand field around Mn-III in a YGaO 3 host.

40|$|We {{describe}} a blue/green inorganic material, Ba(3) (P(1 -x) -Mn(x) O(4)) (2) (I) based on tetrahedral MnO(4) (3 -) : 3 d(2) chromophore. The solid solutions (I) which are sky-blue and turquoise-blue for x = 0 - 50, are readily synthesized in air from commonly available starting materials, stabilizing the MnO(4) (3 -) chromophore in an isostructural phosphate host.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{preparation}} of nickel phosphate in aqueous solution and its use as <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigment.</b> Because cerium phosphate is insoluble in acidic and basic solution, the addition of cerium was tried to improve the acid and base resistance of nickel phosphate pigment. The cerium substituted nickel phosphates were prepared from phosphoric acid, nickel nitrate, and ammonium cerium nitrate solution. The additional effects of tetravalent cerium cation were studied on the chemical composition, particle shape and size distribution, specific surface area, color, acid and base resistance of the precipitates and their thermal products...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to find out in what way <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments</b> {{influence}} the identification of egg and yolk tempera using mass spectrometry MALDITOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight). The other aim was to prepare a set of model color layers including ten <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigments</b> combined with the egg and yolk tempera. Using the method of peptide mass fingerprinting mass spectra of the samples were found out and the obtained peptides were compared. Finally the egg tempera was distinguished from the yolk tempera and it was found which pigments negatively influenced the identification of the temperas.

30|$|The {{findings}} show that despite the numerous colourant sources for the red, brown and yellow shades listed in the many accounts of historic barkcloth making (Kooijman) only 5 types of plant colorants and 1 <b>inorganic</b> <b>pigment</b> used singly or in combination were identified. A similar finding was reported by Bisulca et al. who examined 150 cloths from the Bishop Museum (Hawaii).
