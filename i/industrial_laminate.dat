50|$|Micarta {{industrial}} laminates {{are normally}} phenolic, epoxy, silicone, or melamine resin based thermoset materials reinforced with fiberglass, cork, cotton cloth, paper, carbon fiber or other substrates. Micarta <b>industrial</b> <b>laminate</b> sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of prepreg. These layers of laminations are usually of cellulose paper, cotton fabrics, synthetic yarn fabrics, glass fabrics, or unwoven fabrics.

50|$|Micarta is a {{brand name}} for {{composites}} of linen, canvas, paper, fiberglass, carbon fiber or other fabric in a thermosetting plastic. It was originally used in electrical and decorative applications. Micarta was developed by George Westinghouse at least as early as 1910 using phenolic resins invented by Leo Baekeland. These resins were used to impregnate paper and cotton fabric which were cured under pressure and high temperature to produce laminates. In later years this manufacturing method included the use of fiberglass fabric and other resin types were also used. Today Micarta high pressure <b>industrial</b> <b>laminates</b> are produced {{with a wide variety}} of resins and fibers. The term has been used generically for most resin impregnated fibre compounds. Common uses of modern high pressure laminates are as electrical insulators, printed circuit board substrates, and knife handles.|$|R

The LIFE 2 fatigue analysis code for wind turbines is then used for the fatigue analysis of a typical turbine blade with a known load spectrum. In the analysis, a linear damage model, Miner`s Rule, is used to demonstrate the prediction of the service lifetime for a typical wind turbine blade under assumed operating strain ranges and stress concentration factors. In contrast to typical European data, the asymmetry in this data base predicts failures under typical loads to be compressive...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to examlne the various stages of the production of <b>industrial</b> <b>laminates</b> based on phenol-formaldehyde resins, {{with a view of}} suggesting ways of improving the process economics and/or the physical properties of the final product. Aspects of impregnation, drying, and lamination were investigated. The resins used in all experiments were ammonia-catalysed. Work was concentrated on the lamination stage since this is a labour intensive activity. Paper-phenolic lay-ups were characterised in terms of the temperatures experienced during cure, and a shorter cure-cycle is proposed, utilising the exothermic heat produced during pressing of 25. 5 mm thick lay-ups. Significant savings in production costs and improvements in some of the physical properties have been achieved. In particular, water absorption has been reduced by 43 - 61 %. Work on the drying stage has shown that rapid heating of the wet impregnated substrate results in resin solids losses. Drying at lower temperatures by reducing the driving force leads to more resin (up to 6. 5 %) being retained by the prepregs and therefore more effective use of an expensive raw material. The impregnation work has indicated that residence times above 6 seconds in the varnish bath enhance the insulation resistance of the final product, possibly due to improved resin distribution and reduction in water absorption. In addition, a novel process which involves production of laminates by in situ polymerisation of the phenolic resin on the substrate has been examined. Such a process would eliminate the solvent recovery plant - a necessary stage in current industrial processes. In situ polymerisation {{has been shown to be}} chemically feasible...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of an electro-discharge machined ceramic composites consisting of a base non-conductive ceramic component such Al 2 O 3, to which is added sufficient amounts of an electro-conductive ceramic nanoparticles such as TiC, TiNC, NbNC, TaNC, and SiC (whiskers) to achieve an electrical resistance of less than about 100 W. cm. With these compositions intricate geometries and features as holes, chamfers, slots, angles, changing radii and complex curves can be electro-discharge machined (EDM) into the ceramic body after Pulsed Electrical Current Sintering (PECS) to achieve maximum density and mechanical properties. In EDM, the electrically conductive workpiece or ceramic blank is eroded by electric discharges or sparks which on a small scale generate localized shock waves and intense heat. The four compositions studied were in the same proportion for all raw materials: alumina 42 (vol %) + conductive material (TiC, TiNC, NbNC, and TaNC) 22 (vol %) + SiCw 36 (vol %). Processing was carried out mixing raw materials in the suitable proportions in a polypropylene container with zirconia balls and isopropanol media for 72 hours in order to guarantee the homogeneity of the final compositions. The powders were dried and introduced into a PECS furnace for sintering to 1650 °C (100 MPa/ 2 min). The diameters of the pieces obtained were 20 and about 40 mm and 7 mm thickness. SiC whiskers reinforced electrically conductive ceramic compositions provide a fully dense material with optimal mechanical properties. The capability of electro-discharge machining obtains good surface quality, chip-free edges, dimensional accuracy and complex shapes. The fracture toughness is improved two to three fold over individual ceramic components. Strength and hardness is also increased.

50|$|Phenolic resins {{are found}} in a myriad of <b>industrial</b> products. Phenolic <b>laminates</b> are made by {{impregnating}} one or more layers of a base material such as paper, fiberglass or cotton with phenolic resin and laminating the resin-saturated base material under heat and pressure. The resin fully polymerizes (cures) during this process forming the thermoset polymer matrix. The base material choice depends on the intended application of the finished product. Paper phenolics are used in manufacturing electrical components such as punch-through boards, in household laminates, and in paper composite panels. Glass phenolics are particularly well suited {{for use in the}} high speed bearing market. Phenolic micro-balloons are used for density control. Snooker balls as well as balls from many table-based ball games are also made from phenol formaldehyde resin. The binding agent in normal (organic) brake pads, brake shoes and clutch disks are phenolic resin. Synthetic resin bonded paper, made from phenolic resin and paper, is used to make countertops.|$|R

5000|$|The Hermosa area {{originated}} {{as one of}} {{the many}} suburban crabgrass communities of Jefferson Township. The first verifiable proof of European settlement in the area occurred in the early 1880s after railroads where constructed through the area. In 1872, an extension of the Chicago and Pacific Rail Road was extended, passing through Hermosa from east to west. One of the first settlers was named Mr. Lathman, who built his house in the spring of 1882. In the same year, James F. Keeney, who owned much of the land that now comprises Hermosa, started building a number of houses within his subdivision. In 1884, the first large scale successful <b>industrial</b> enterprise, the <b>Laminated</b> Wood Company, was founded. In 1886 several other factories were also established such as the Expanded Metal Company, the Eclipse Furnace Company, and a warehouse belonging to the Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company. The Keeney Company actively promoted the growth of Hermosa and ultimately helped convince the railroad to build a station in the area, which Mr. Kenney constructed at his own expense. By 1884, there were 30 houses and 150 people living in Hermosa, most of these original settlers were Scotch, German and Swedish immigrants. The first schools and churches were established in the area in the late 1880s and 1890s. [...] The first name for Hermosa was likely “Pacific,” but there is no verifiable record to prove this. The first official name for the area was Garfield, in honor of the late president. In 1885 the name of the town was changed to Hermosa for the reason of establishing a post office at Kenney’s rail station—there already was a post office named Garfield and the name could not be duplicated. A Mr. Peebles, secretary to the superintendent of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail Road, is credited with suggesting the name Hermosa, which means beautiful in Spanish.|$|R
