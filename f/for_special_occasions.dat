5|$|As {{far as we}} know, the {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions.</b> The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E
5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions.</b> Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E

5|$|Bach was {{appointed}} organist and chamber musician in Weimar {{at the court}} of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions</b> and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral.|$|E
5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand.

5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions.</b>|$|E

From 18 August to 25 September, she paid her first visit to a foreign port transporting Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes to Rio de Janeiro for Brazil's Centennial Exposition. The next year, after fleet exercises off the Panama Canal Zone, Maryland transited the canal {{in the latter part of}} June to join the battle fleet stationed on the west coast. She continued to be a flagship until 1923 when the flag was shifted to Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions</b> colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions.</b> The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions,</b> Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E

5|$|Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats: The {{mechanical}} engineer Huang Gun served {{the court of}} Emperor Yang Di (r. 604–617) and wrote the book Shuishi Tujing on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on. He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3m (10ft) long and 1.8m (6ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6m (2ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and tumblers, oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive. These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>occasions.</b> The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically stretched out his arm with a full cup of wine. When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied. When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the next stop. The British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been paddle-wheel-driven. Another paddle wheel ship was commanded by Wang Zhen'e and described in his biographies dated from the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). side from the partial remains of the Shuishi Tujing, an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary Yan Shigu (581–645).|$|E
