5|$|During {{the course}} of his expeditions Beebe {{gradually}} developed an interest in marine biology, ultimately leading to his 1930s dives in the Bathysphere, along with its inventor, Otis Barton, off the coast of Bermuda. This was the first time a biologist observed deep-sea animals in their native environment, and set several successive records for the <b>deepest</b> dive ever performed by a human, the <b>deepest</b> of which stood until it was broken by Barton 15 years later. Following his Bathysphere dives, Beebe returned to the tropics and began to focus his study on the behavior of insects. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad which he named Simla, and which remains in operation as part of the Asa Wright Nature Centre. Beebe's research at Simla continued until his death from pneumonia in 1962 at the age of 84.|$|E

In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title– so much so that a 2003 online poll by the Football Fans Census listed Manchester United as Arsenal's biggest rivals, followed by Tottenham and Chelsea.

5|$|As it tracked northward, {{the storm}} failed to {{organize}} at first, {{due to the}} influence of an upper-level low to its south. The circulation became broad and elongated, as well as removed from the <b>deepest</b> convection. However, after moving away from the low, the convection became better organized and more associated with the convection. After some initial slow organization continued, an area of deep convection developed over the center midday on September 20. An eye developed within the convection, and late on September 20 Jeanne re-attained hurricane status about 350mi (570km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the <b>deepest</b> level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E
5|$|Banding {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the <b>deepest</b> convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the <b>deepest</b> convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
