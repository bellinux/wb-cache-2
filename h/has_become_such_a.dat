25|$|Taipei City is also {{famous for}} its effort in garbage recycling, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good {{international}} precedent that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent. This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to {{the world at the}} Shanghai World Expo 2010.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his first}} few appearances, it was {{reported}} that Criss had been confirmed as a series regular for the remainder of season two and for season three of Glee. This was based on comments by Murphy, who said: [...] "Darren <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sensation in one week, which I love. I think there's a hunger for him and a positive relationship role model. He’ll definitely continue through the year and longer." [...] However, the actor later denied that his role had been upgraded and said: [...] "It's never really been officially confirmed to me. I think the option is there and that they want to keep Blaine around." [...] Murphy revealed that Blaine may join New Directions during the third season. Criss hoped that this would not come to pass, as he enjoys being at Dalton Academy, but conceded: [...] "it's not my call. I'm happy to serve whatever story they want." [...] For the third season of Glee, Criss was promoted to a series regular, and Blaine did join New Directions when he transferred to McKinley High to be with Kurt.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviews for}} Hannibal were mixed. Time {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "A banquet of creepy, gory or grotesque incidents {{is on display}} in Hannibal. But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart." [...] Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it [...] "laughable to just plain boring, Hannibal is toothless to the end." [...] David Thomson, writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound, praised the film. [...] "It works. It's smart, good-looking, sexy, fun...dirty, naughty and knowing." [...] Thomson does make clear, however, {{he is a great}} fan of director Ridley Scott's work. He adds: [...] "It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> household joke that he can't be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That's how the movie was saved." [...] Variety magazine in its review said [...] "Hannibal is not as good as Lambs... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling." ...|$|E

2500|$|The American author John Updike {{said of the}} book, [...] "A {{century and}} a half after its publication, Walden <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church, {{quoting the}} Second Vatican Council's {{document}} Lumen gentium, states: [...] "The pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, 'is the perpetual and visible source and {{foundation of the}} unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful.'" [...] Communion with bishop of Rome <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> significant identifier of Catholic identity that at times the Catholic Church has been known in its entirety as [...] "Roman Catholic", though this is inaccurate in Catholic theology (ecclesiology).|$|E
2500|$|The song <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> popular cover song at musical gatherings, venues {{and events}} that some {{discourage}} its performance. At the Swampfire Sessions, Cranford states: [...] "We banned it. (We) literally put signs up that said 'Absolutely No Wagon Wheel.'" [...] “Man, some of us hate that song," [...] he said. [...] "Others play it all the time." [...] Cranford, who used to play [...] "Wagon Wheel" [...] on request, quit doing so after Rucker's cover. [...] "This song was great when Dylan wrote it and Old Crow played it, but once Darius Rucker flooded the airwaves with his version, all hope was lost," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In June, 1989, Beckjord {{was arrested}} for [...] "investigation of {{harassment}} and coercion" [...] at the 8th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Cryptozoology in Pullman, WA, where conference members gathered to discuss Bigfoot scientifically. He spent one night in jail and was released on $2500 bond, but was ordered to leave Pullman and {{stay away from the}} conference. Organizer and then director of the North American Bigfoot Information Network, Mark Francis, initiated the restraining order after receiving letters from Beckjord that, in his view, contained death threats. Francis was frustrated that [...] "flakes", as he characterized people lacking scientific merit, were being allowed to speak at the conference, saying [...] "The whole conference <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> joke." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 21st century, {{democracy}} <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> popular {{method of}} reaching decisions that its application beyond politics {{to other areas}} such as entertainment, food and fashion, consumerism, urban planning, education, art, literature, science and theology has been criticised as [...] "the reigning dogma of our time". The argument suggests that applying a populist or market-driven approach to art and literature (for example), means that innovative creative work goes unpublished or unproduced. In education, {{the argument is that}} essential but more difficult studies are not undertaken. Science, as a truth-based discipline, is particularly corrupted by the idea that the correct conclusion can be arrived at by popular vote. However, more recently, theorists have also advanced the concept epistemic democracy to assert that democracy actually does a good job tracking the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Tensions {{resulting}} from the unauthorized presence of this coalition escalated when Laurent-Désiré Kabila became {{the president of the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo. [...] In 1998, he allied the Congo with Angola, Zimbabwe and other countries to force Rwandan and Ugandan troops out. The web of alliances and the number of conflict-related deaths, estimated around six million, gave the resulting Second Congo War (1998-2003) the popular epithet the “African World War." [...] It {{was one of the most}} deadly conflict in recent history, with most of these deaths being civilian casualties. Estimates from the International Rescue Committee suggest that fewer than 10 percent of victims of these conflict deaths were soldiers killed in direct combat. Violence remained common after 2003, with a number of local conflicts breaking out that have involved kidnapping, torture, and sexual violence of civilians. The rape of women and children <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> widespread issue that the Congo has been titled “the rape capital of the world.” In some areas, two-thirds of all women are victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence.|$|E

Billy Towler, my assistant,--who <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> strapping fellow that you'd scarce know him,--is also much pleased with it.

6000|$|So {{while they}} grew older {{together}} she did watch with him, {{and so she}} let this association give shape and colour to her own existence. Beneath her forms as well detachment had learned to sit, and behaviour had become for her, in the social sense, a false account of herself. There was but one account of her {{that would have been}} true all the while and that she could give straight to nobody, least of all to John Marcher. Her whole attitude was a virtual statement, but the perception of that only seemed called to take its place for him as one of the many things necessarily crowded out of his consciousness. If she had moreover, like himself, to make sacrifices to their real truth, it was to be granted that her compensation might have affected her as more prompt and more natural. They had long periods, in this London time, during which, when they were together, a stranger might have listened to them without in the least pricking up his ears; on the other hand the real truth was equally liable at any moment to rise to the surface, and the auditor would then have wondered indeed what they were talking about. They had from an early hour made up their mind that society was, luckily, unintelligent, and the margin allowed them by this had fairly become one of their commonplaces. Yet there were still moments when the situation turned almost fresh--usually under the effect of some expression drawn from herself. Her expressions doubtless repeated themselves, but her intervals were generous. [...] "What saves us, you know, is that we answer so completely to so usual an appearance: that of the man and woman whose friendship <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> daily habit--or almost--as to be at last indispensable." [...] That for instance was a remark she had frequently enough had occasion to make, though she had given it at different times different developments. What we are especially concerned with is the turn it happened to take from her one afternoon when he had come to see her in honour of her birthday. This anniversary had fallen on a Sunday, at a season of thick fog and general outward gloom; but he had brought her his customary offering, having known her now long enough to have established a hundred small traditions. It was one of his proofs to himself, the present he made her on her birthday, that he hadn't sunk into real selfishness. It was mostly nothing more than a small trinket, but it was always fine of its kind, and he was regularly careful to pay for it more than he thought he could afford. [...] "Our habit saves you, at least, don't you see? because it makes you, after all, for the vulgar, indistinguishable from other men. What's the most inveterate mark of men in general? Why the capacity to spend endless time with dull women--to spend it I won't say without being bored, but without minding that they are, without being driven off at a tangent by it; which comes to the same thing. I'm your dull woman, a part of the daily bread for which you pray at church. That covers your tracks more than anything." ...|$|E
