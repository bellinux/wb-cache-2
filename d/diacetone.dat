50|$|Isophorone is not {{naturally}} available. Various {{techniques are}} available for obtaining isophorone. The most common and used method includes an self-condensation of acetone with KOH. For this reaction a dehydrogenated acetone allows {{one of the side}} faced carbon atoms to attack the central carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon) of another acetone molecule. Hereby a <b>diacetone</b> alcohol (4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one)(1) forms. A follow up dehydration reaction of <b>diacetone</b> alcohol yields (mesityl oxide)(2) and the rest product, water. Dehydrogenated acetone is then able to further react via an addition reaction with mesityl oxide (Michael reaction) to 4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxoheptan-1-ide (3), which successively attacks its own carbonyl carbon to form 3-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexan-1-one(4).

50|$|A marker pen, fineliner, marking pen, {{felt-tip}} marker, felt-tip pen, flow, marker or texta (in Australia) or sketch pen (in India), is a pen {{which has}} its own ink-source, and a tip made of porous, pressed fibers such as felt. A permanent marker consists of a container (glass, aluminum or plastic) and a core of an absorbent material. This filling serves as a carrier for the ink. The upper part of the marker contains the nib that was made in earlier time of a hard felt material, and a cap to prevent the marker from drying out.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{fragrances}} and flavors together with requirements of green chemistry are {{the basis for the}} development of new heterogeneous catalytic syntheses. It was shown that the aldol condensation of acetone and citral to pseudoionone over a basic ion exchanger work with good conversion and high selectivity. The same applies to the analog aldol reactions to the various methylpseudoionones. <b>Diacetone</b> alcohol and mesityl oxide are further possible products. The aldol condensation can be realized both in a batch or continuous process. The batch procedure is easier to build up and generates many results in short time as would be important for example for benchmarking. In a continuous fixed bed reactor higher selectivities are possible. For the reaction of acetone with citral to pseudoionone a selectivity of 96 % is achieved on a conversion of 97 %. A benchmarking shows the influence of matrix and type of the ion exchange resins on conversion, selectivity and lifetime. All current ion exchanger deactivate within a relatively short time. Therefore they are not suitable for industrial use but very usefull for the production of small quantities. In a laboratory scale the various commercially not available isomers of pseudoionone could be prepared separately with high purity. The synthesis of <b>diacetone</b> alcohol can be catalyzed by ion exchange very well. A selectivity of 99 % is achieves with minimal catalyst deactivation. The aldol reaction is a standard reaction in organic chemistry for the formation of new CC bonds. However, there are often problems to stop the reaction at the beta-hydroxy carbonyl compound and prevent condensation. This is exactly what is possible while using strongly basic ion exchangers for the production of <b>diacetone</b> alcohol. An addition of water during the reaction {{have a positive effect on}} selectivity and the lifetime of the basic ion exchanger. The water reduces the Hofmann elimination an at the same time it also reduces the deactivation by the organic fouling. Rare earth metal oxides show good performance for the aldol condensation, especially the use of lanthanum oxid. But rare earth metal oxides need higher temperatures to catalyse an aldol condensation. Therefore, all reactions with these catalysts have been performed in autoclaves. The catalysis of aldol reactions with acetone show exactly the described phenomenon that the reaction does not stop at the stage of the beta-hydroxy carbonyl compound, but directly the condensation occurs. In the case of the aldol condensation of acetone the product obtained, mesityl oxide, is also of economic interest. The experiments indicate that the catalysis with the rare earth metal oxides is possible...|$|E

Cross-linking with pMDI might be slow and was not important in the initial bonding. However, its cross-linking effect might develop gradually, because the adhesive showed good final strengths using pMDI as a cross-linker.|$|E
