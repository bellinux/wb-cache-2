40|$|Individuals, as Vico says, {{especially}} when they still have difficulties in building a correct representation of reality, constantly recur {{to the power of}} fantasy by trying to distort reality and make it as real as possible within the reach of human abilities. Men, not being able to act with God’s eye, the one who sees all in its fullness and perfection, act with men’s eye, analysing the single parts, imagining and strengthening them with fantastic fiction, up to attain a vision of everything. In this investigation I will concentrate on Giambattista Vico’s works, with a careful analysis which follows the development of fantasy, with a chronology which respects the development of the theme of his works. Fantasy, according to Vico, is used by men as a mean to create images that provide a model for the interpretation of reality, in a process of reconstruction and reworking of men’s historical path. The control means of fantasy is identified by Vico with reason, the only one capable to adjust and provide the right argument to make it relevant in the real world. Men, already from childhood, have the need to educate their way of thinking; educate their spirit to reason – Vico continues –to educate the use of the mathematical method. The philosopher distinguishes two phases of a man’s life in whom, according to age and experience, these two intellectual abilities have a specific value and a pre-eminence over the other: in young people, fantasy prevails, among the elder, reason prevails. We’ll also respect the autonomy of fantasy related to sensitivity. We’ll see how these two faculties become independent or establish a relation to one another, to later reach the definition and explanation of the words memory, fantasy and ingenious and clarify their role in the reconstruction of history. It’ll also be essential to underline the concept of fantastic universal, which, regarding to Remaud’s definition is the attitude <b>of</b> still wild <b>men</b> whom take control of a natural phenomenon through language; {{in terms of trying to}} adopt, in the classification of things, a standard of uniqueness. The more a <b>man</b> gets out <b>of</b> his “state of ignorance”, the more also changes the role and intensity of fantasy in the existence. Fantasy, then, will become a refined poetic faculty in a creative force that helps poets’ imagination and their ingenuity. Fantasy as a poet’s quality is the transformation of the use of metaphor from its previous philosophical value to a strictly artistic one. After a careful analysis at Vico’s concept of fantasy, I’ll pass to the second part of my research, which is based on the possible relationship between the concept of Vichian fantasy and the transcendental Kantian imagination. The second part of my doctorate will be focused on the following points: a) The difference between creating (God’s work) and doing (man’s work) in Vico and Kant, according to Otto’s vision; b) The search of a Kantian pure science which enables man to achieve the synthesis of knowledge and the subsequent consideration of referring to mathematics or geometry; c) The transcendental imagination, within Kant’s work. The Kantian theory, therefore, will be built on synthetical judgments a priori based on intuitions that has mathematics as a teaching reference. I will compare the Kantian speech which intends a priori synthesis as the ability to reformulate and to compose new elements that man already possess within himself, with Vico’s theories, who argues that mathematics is based on a structure that is logical-intuitive which relies on the powers of imagination having, the person, to imagine numbers and shapes to achieve the demonstration of theorems that are referenced. Although the concept of imagination in Kant's transcendental imagination not only reduces the Kritik der reinen Vernunft, there are at least two different variants in the author's thought. The first in the Kritik der Urteilskraft, where fantasy is free from the domination of the intellect, and in other cases, had always set the imagination of the patterns within which it is forced to act. The Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht proposes, instead, an imagination that takes matter of its images from senses. Finally, taking the work of Ferdinand Fellmann, I will focus in particular on his view of divine providence as a guide that <b>directs</b> the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> throughout history. The role <b>of</b> <b>man</b> in history, his probation in a first analysis, and then the conviction either of Vico or Kant, is considered to be the historical path <b>of</b> exclusive <b>man</b> work. We conclude with the analysis of the imagination within the work of Kant Mutmaßlichen Anfang der Menschengeschichte, within which it is stated that imagination is used by humans to develop conjectures about the origin of the story...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{long-range}} signal encoded by the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene {{has been}} implicated as the ventral patterning influence from the notochord that induces sclerotome and represses dermomyotome in somite differentiation.

Here we provide evidence that the long-range somite patterning effects of SHH are instead mediated by a <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the amino-terminal cleavage product. We also show that pharmacological manipulations to increase the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A can selectively antagonize {{the effects of the}} amino-terminal cleavage product.
