Thesis, defended in September 16, 2008 Phlebotomus sergenti {{is the main}} vector of Leishmania tropica, a causative agent of human cutaneous leishmaniasis, therefore a sand fly species of great medical importance. As {{it has a very}} broad range of distribution, a notable intraspecific variability was expected and a possibility of several cryptic species was postulated with differences in ecology, host preferences and vectorial capacity, meaning important implications in <b>diagnostics,</b> <b>epidemiology</b> and medical therapy. The presented thesis studied intraspecific {{variability of}} P. sergenti by crossmating analysis of laboratory colonies with different geographical origin as well as by several approaches of molecular taxonomy deployed on specimens from wild populations collected in the field. We demonstrated that crossing is possible between P. sergenti laboratory-reared specimens from colonies originating from Turkey and Israel.

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{advances}} in sequencing technologies have given all microbiology laboratories access to whole genome sequencing. Providing that tools for the automated analysis of sequence data and databases for associated meta-data are developed, whole genome sequencing will become a routine tool for large clinical microbiology laboratories. Indeed, the continuing reduction in sequencing costs and the shortening of the ‘time to result’ makes it an attractive strategy in both research and diagnostics. Here, we review how high-throughput sequencing is revolutionizing clinical microbiology and the promise that it still holds. Wediscuss major applications, which include: (i) identification of target DNAsequences and antigens to rapidly develop diagnostic tools; (ii) precise strain identification for epidemiological typing and pathogen monitoring during outbreaks; and (iii) investigation of strain properties, such {{as the presence of}} antibiotic resistance or virulence factors. In addition, recent developments in comparative metagenomics and single-cell sequencing offer the prospect of a better understanding of complex microbial communities at the global and individual levels, providing a new perspective for understanding host–pathogen interactions.

40|$|SUMMARY Introduction. Species typing in {{leishmaniasis}} gains {{importance in}} <b>diagnostics,</b> <b>epidemiology,</b> and clinical studies. A {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) assay of PCR amplicons from a partial heat-shock protein 70 gene (hsp 70) had been described for the New World, allowing identification of some species. Methods. Based on an initial in silico analysis of 51 hsp 70 sequences, {{most of which}} we recently determined in the frame of a phylogenetic study, species-specific restriction sites were identified. These were tested by PCR-RFLP on 139 strains from 14 species, thereby documenting both inter- and intra-species variability. Results. Our assay could identify Leishmania infantum, L. donovani, L. tropica, L. aethiopica, L. major, L. lainsoni, L. naiffi, L. braziliensis, L. peruviana, L. guyanensis, and L. panamensis by applying 2 subsequent digests. L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, and L. garnhami did not generate species-specific restriction fragment patterns. Conclusion. Currently no assay is available for global Leishmania species discrimination. We present a universal PCR-RFLP method allowing identification of most medically relevant Old and New World Leishmania species {{on the basis of a}} single PCR, obviating the need to perform separate PCRs. The technique is simple to perform and can be implemented in all settings where PCR is availabl...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Tapeworms (Cestoda) {{continue}} {{to be an important}} cause of morbidity in humans worldwide. Diphyllobothriosis, a human disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Diphyllobothrium, is the most important fish-borne zoonosis caused by a cestode parasite. Up to 20 million humans are estimated to be infected worldwide. Besides humans, definitive hosts of Diphyllobothrium include piscivorous birds and mammals, which represent a significant zoonotic reservoir. The second intermediate hosts include both freshwater and marine fish, especially anadromous species such as salmonids. The zoonosis occurs most commonly in countries where the consumption of raw or marinated fish is a frequent practice. Due to the increasing popularity of dishes utilizing uncooked fish, numerous cases of human infections have appeared recently, even in the most developed countries. As many as 14 valid species of Diphyllobothrium can cause human diphyllobothriosis, with D. latum and D. nihonkaiense being the most important pathogens. In this paper, all taxa from humans reported are reviewed, with brief information on their life history and their current distribution. Data on <b>diagnostics,</b> <b>epidemiology,</b> clinical relevance, and control of the disease are also summarized. The importance of reliable identification of human-infecting species with molecular tools (sequences of mitochondrial genes) as well as the necessity of epidemiological studies aimed at determining the sources of infections are pointed out...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMembers of the Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) {{species are}} hantaviruses carried by {{different}} Apodemus mice as reservoir hosts and causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. In Central Europe, the Kurkino genotype of DOBV, {{associated with the}} striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, is prevalent. This paper presents the first extensive study of the serological and molecular <b>diagnostics,</b> <b>epidemiology</b> and clinics of DOBV-Kurkino infections in Central Europe. Serum samples from 570 German patients living in the habitat of A. agrarius (north and northeast Germany) and exhibiting febrile disease, were analysed. All samples were tested by ELISA, subsets of samples were also analysed by immunoblot, neutralization assay, and RT-PCR. A group of 86 individuals was confirmed as DOBV-infected. The virus neutralization assay allowed a reliable identification of DOBV antibodies during both acute and convalescent phases of infection. However, differentiation of relevant DOBV genotypes was not possible by neutralization test but required molecular analysis. Whereas DOBV IgM antibodies tend to persist in the infected organism, RNAaemia seems to be short. Nucleotide sequences were amplified from four patients, and their analysis demonstrated infection by DOBV-Kurkino. With respect to the initial results, {{the high degree of}} identity of local patient-derived and A. agrarius-derived virus sequences may allow a closer allocation of the geographical place where the human infection occurred. In contrast to moderate/severe HFRS caused by the DOBV genotypes Dobrava or Sochi, all available data showed a mild clinical course of HFRS caused by DOBV-Kurkino infection without lethal outcomes...|$|R
