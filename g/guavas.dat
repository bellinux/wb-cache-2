They also have very rapid digestive systems allowing these bats to assimilate high amounts of fruit to ensure that adequate protein is absorbed.

40|$|The Brazilian <b>guava</b> {{processing}} industry generates 5. 5 M Mg <b>guava</b> waste yr- 1 {{that could be}} recycled sustainably in <b>guava</b> agro-ecosystems as slow-release fertilizer. Our objectives were to elaborate nutrient budgets and to diagnose soil, foliar and fruit nutrient balances in <b>guava</b> orchards fertilized with <b>guava</b> waste. We hypothesized that (1) <b>guava</b> waste are balanced fertilizer sources that can sustain crop yield and soil nutrient stocks, and (2) <b>guava</b> agroecosystems remain productive within narrow ranges of nutrient balances. A 6 -yr experiment was conducted in 8 -yr old <b>guava</b> orchard applying 0 - 9 - 18 - 27 - 36 Mg ha- 1 <b>guava</b> waste (dry mass basis) and the locally recommended mineral fertilization. Nutrient budgets were compiled as balance sheets. Foliar and fruit nutrient balances were computed as isometric log ratios to avoid data redundancy or resonance due to nutrient interactions and closure to measurement unit. The N, P and several other nutrients were applied in excess of crop removal while K was in deficit whatever the fertilizer treatment. The foliar diagnostic accuracy of reached 93 % using isometric log ratios and knn classification, generating reliable foliar nutrient and concentration ranges at high yield level. The plant mined the soil K reserves without any significant effect on fruit yield and foliar nutrient balances involving K. High <b>guava</b> productivity {{can be reached at}} lower soil test K and P values than thought before. Parsimonious dosage of fresh <b>guava</b> waste should be supplemented with mineral K fertilizers to recycle <b>guava</b> waste sustainably in <b>guava</b> agroecosystems.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to study the antioxidant activity and free radical-scavenging effects of extracts from <b>guava</b> leaves and dried fruit. The results indicated that 94. 4 - 96. 2 % of linoleic acid oxidation was inhibited by the addition of <b>guava</b> leaf and <b>guava</b> tea extracts at a concentration of 100 mu g/ml. The <b>guava</b> dried fruit extracts exhibited weaker antioxidant effects than did the leaf extracts. The results also demonstrated that the scavenging effects of <b>guava</b> leaf extracts on ABTS(center dot+) radicals and superoxide anion increased with increasing concentrations. The <b>guava</b> leaf extracts displayed a significant scavenging ability on the peroxyl radicals. However, the scavenging effects were decreased when the extract concentration was greater than 10 mu g/ml. The extracts from leaves of various <b>guava</b> cultivars exhibited more scavenging effects on free radicals than did commercial <b>guava</b> tea extracts and dried fruit extracts. The chromatogram data indicated that <b>guava</b> extracts contained phenolic acids, such as ferulic acid, which appeared to be responsible for their antioxidant activity. Correlation analysis indicated that there was a linear relationship between antioxidant potency, free radical-scavenging ability and the content of phenolic compounds of <b>guava</b> leaf extracts.
