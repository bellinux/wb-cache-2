5000|$|Ironically, the U of I {{began the}} {{investigation}} into the [...] "slush-fund" [...] as a good faith gesture to demonstrate to the Big Ten commissioners that {{they would be willing to}} handle any negative consequences <b>in-house.</b> <b>University</b> President, David D. Henry, found that 12 active football and basketball players had received illegal aid, seven football, 5 basketball. It also found that 17 other athletes had received aid since 1962, totaling approximately $21,500. The salt in the wound came from Big Ten commissioner Bill Reed, who emphasized that, even though the university had completed its investigation and dismissed the parties involved, the conference would continue the investigation further and hand down a formal decision on March 4, 1967. The decision, after a fairly brief debate, made by the conference athletic directors, including ex-offenders Biggie Munn and Forest Evashevski, called for Illinois to fire Elliott, Combes and Braun or [...] "show cause" [...] why the university should not be suspended or dropped from Big Ten membership. Based on the fact that the committee making the decision was made up of several members who had been guilty of infractions themselves, President Henry became outraged. The University appealed the decision, meanwhile, [...] "friends of the coaches" [...] began circulating petitions with hopes of pressuring the school into keeping them regardless of the consequences. On March 18, the Big Ten issued its final ultimatum to the University of Illinois. In a statement from the commissioner, it was demanded that the implicated coaches be fired or the school could face an indefinite suspension. When the dust settled, football coach Pete Elliott and basketball coaches Combes and Braun all had their existing contracts terminated on August 31, 1967.|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} methodologies have been achieving {{in the last}} decades remarkable progresses in predicting the complex physical process in internal combustion engines, which need to be continuously optimised {{to get the best}} compromise between fuel economy, emissions and power output/drivability. Among the variety of computational tools developed by researchers to investigate the multi-Phase flow development from high-pressure fuel injection systems for modem diesel and gasoline direct injection engines, the Eulerian-Lagrangian stochastic methodology, which models the air/vapour mixture as continuous phase and the liquid droplets as the dispersed one, has become standard among the developers of commercial or <b>in-house</b> <b>university</b> CFD codes due to its intuitive assumptions and simple implementation. It is generally recognised that this method is specifically suitable for dilute sprays, but it has shortcomings with respect to modelling of the dense sprays present in the crucial region close to the nozzle exit of fuel injection systems. Moreover, the mathematical formulation of the Eulerian-Lagrangian models is intrinsically related to critical numerical issues, like the difficulty of correctly estimating the initial conditions at the nozzle hole exit required by spray modelling calculations and, furthermore, the dependency of the results on the spatial and temporal discretisation schemes used to solve the governing flow equations. To overcome some of these difficulties, a modified Lagrangian methodology has been developed in this study. The interaction between the Eulerian and the Lagrangian phases is not treated on the cell-to-parcel basis, but using spatial distribution functions, which allow for distribution of the spray source terms on a number of cells located within a distance from the droplet centre. The end result is a numerical methodology which can handle numerical grids irrespective of the volume of the Lagrangian phase introduced. These improvements have been found to offer significant advances on Lagrangian spray calculations without the need to switch to Eulerian models in the near nozzle region. Besides these fundamental numerical issues, the present study offers some new insights on the physical processes involved in evaporating sprays under a wide range of operating conditions typical of advanced diesel and gasoline direct injection engines. Attention hag been directed on the topic of liquid droplet vaporisation modelling, which has been addressed by implementing and discussing different models published in the literature. Topics of particular emphasis include phase equilibrium, quasi-steadiness assumption, fuel composition, physical properties correlation, droplet shape and energy and mass transfer in the liquid and gas phases. The models have been implemented and validated against an extensive data base of experimental results for single and multi-component droplets vaporising under suband super-critical surrounding conditions and then implemented in the in-house GFS code, the multi-phase CFD solver developed within the research group over the last decade. A variety of physical sub-models have been assessed against comprehensive experimental data, which include the effect of thermodynamic, operating and physical parameters on the liquid and vapour penetration of diesel sprays. In particular, the effect of liquid atomisation, evaporation, aerodynamic drag, droplet secondary break-up and fuel physical properties has been thoroughly tested. The sensitivity of the predictions on the numerical treatment of the multi-phase interaction has been investigated by identifying and properly modelling the numerical parameters playing the most crucial role in the simulations. Finally the validated code has been used to investigate the flow processes from three high-pressure injection systems for direct injection spark-ignition engines. These have included the pressure swirl atomiser, the multi-hole injector and the outward-opening pintle nozzle. These investigations have enlightened the crucial role of the accurate modelling of the link between the internal nozzle flow prediction and the characteristics of the forming sprays in term of the successive multi-phase flow interaction, as function of the design of the fuel injection system used...|$|E

40|$|The Encyclopedia Americana, 2002 edition, concludes its {{entry on}} Milton Friedman as follows: His major work, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867 1960, was {{published}} in 1963. That {{might be seen as}} an indirect compliment to Anna J. Schwartz, who coauthored the Monetary History with Friedman but is not mentioned in the encyclopedia entry. Similarly, the Nobel Committee neglected to mention Schwartz when, in awarding Friedman his Prize in 1976, it described A Monetary History as h is major work and one of Friedman s most profound and also most distinguished achievements. Fortunately, the economics profession as a whole has not been so negligent, and the phrase Friedman and Schwartz has become second nature to economists when discussing the importance of monetary policy. Beside her collaborations with Friedman, Anna Schwartz is perhaps best known for her longevity, which is on an epoch-shattering scale. Her career as an economic researcher began a quarter-century before the publication of A Monetary History, and has continued in the 40 years since. Schwartz s first journal article {{was published in}} May 1940, the month Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and over 18 months before the United States entered World War II. She has worked at the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York City continuously since 1941. Monetary economics has been a constant interest for her, and she is the only person to have had items published in the inaugural issues of both the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking (February 1969) and the Journal of Monetary Economics (January 1975). The JME piece was a book review, and so does not appear in the bibliography below. Schwartz s numerous book reviews make rewarding reading and include a prediction in Kyklos in 1968 of an era when economists would use Internet connections to download macroeconomic databases. The JME moved into its fiftieth volume in 2003, and Schwartz became one of only two authors (the other being Thomas Sargent) to have published in both volumes 1 and 50 of the journal. With the NBER branching out in the 1970 s into a national network of researchers, Schwartz has been for a quarter century an unmistakable fixture at the NBER monetary economics program s regular meetings at Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the time of the interview, her contributions to the NBER s various working paper series spanned from NBER Technical Paper No. 4, 1947, to NBER Working Paper No. 9321, November 2002. The latter paper covered the issue of equity price behavior, the same subject of her 1940 publication, implying that Schwartz had entered a remarkable seventh decade of research in that area. Much of Schwartz s early research was on UK economic growth and fluctuations in the nineteenth century, and was reflected in a two-volume study essentially completed in the early 1940 s but not published until 1953 Gayer et al. (1953). Robert Lucas, who read the volume as a graduate student in history, describes it as an amazingly ambitious and exciting mix of history and theory. Schwartz s collaboration with Milton Friedman on the relationship between the quantity of money and other variables began in 1948. Their early findings on the importance of money were reported by Friedman in a 1952 American Economic Review paper, but, by and large, he had problems promoting their work in the 1950 s. Friedman s solo work in the fifties on flexible exchange rates, the consumption function, and the limits of stabilization policy would cement his reputation and be cited in his eventual Nobel award, but the monetary policy studies initially made a much more limited impact. All of Friedman s remaining 1950 s writings on money were in <b>in-house</b> <b>University</b> of Chicago publications or in congressional testimony. A short excerpt from a Journal of Political Economy paper by Friedman on money did appear in the 1959 proceedings issue of the American Economic Review. Two books by Friedman in the early 1960 s previewed some findings from the monetary history project with Schwartz. The first of these, A Program for Monetary Stability, is now recognized as a classic, but its muted reception is evidenced by the fact that economists {{have never been able to}} agree on which year it was published. The second book, Capitalism and Freedom (1962), was intended for a wide audience, but was virtually driven underground when all major U. S. newspapers declined to review it. In 1969, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York official, Richard Davis, gave this perspective on reactions to early monetarist work of the 1950 s and early 1960 s: E conomists regarded this group when they regarded it at all as a mildly amusing, not quite respectable collection of eccentrics. The fact is that the view held by Friedman and others on the predominant importance of money was just not given serious attention by most economists. The turning point was in 1963, when Friedman and Schwartz s 15 years of research finally saw print in their Monetary History and the article Money and Business Cycles. The Monetary History is justly celebrated, and has remained in print for 40 years. Furthermore, of the 93 books listed by Princeton University Press in its Economics and Finance Catalogue 2003, the Monetary History is the only pre- 1994 publication included. The Cycles paper, as Davis acknowledged, provided b y far the largest mass of evidence on the cyclical relation between money and output. In addition, the paper s tentative sketch of the monetary transmission mechanism became a cornerstone of the monetarist literature, and an inspiration to many monetary economists, including the late Rudiger Dornbusch, as they endeavored to escape the single interest rate channel view of the transmission mechanism. Schwartz began the 1970 s with another collaboration with Friedman, Monetary Statistics, and went on in 1973 to join a number of economists, including fellow monetarists Karl Brunner and Allan Meltzer, in forming the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC). The SOMC commented regularly on U. S. economic policy and, in particular, offered monetary policy recommendations to address the severe inflation problem of the 1970 s. Schwartz remains on the SOMC 30 years later, the only founding member to serve since the SOMC s inception. Friedman and Schwartz s final major collaboration, Monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom, was published in 1982. Among monetary economists, the response to Monetary Trends was mild compared to the reception for the Monetary History. Work by Friedman and Schwartz and other monetarists had already changed macroeconomic thinking substantially, and most academic work was now concerned with rigorous modeling of short-run dynamics, rather than the empirical evidence on long-run relations that concerned Friedman and Schwartz in their Trends study. Schwartz s own work over the past 20 years has been prolific, and has often been in collaboration with Michael Bordo, with whom she has written some 25 articles. While her areas of research have included banking regulation and the role of international financial institutions, Bordo s and her mutual interest in monetary economics and economic history has repeatedly been evident in their work. Among the issues that their studies, sometimes with further collaborators, have addressed are the role of monetary targets in Canada and the United Kingdom in the face of money demand instability, whether monetary policy rules could have avoided the Great Contraction, the historical record of alternative monetary policy regimes, and the history of economic thought, including the development of monetarism. ...|$|E

A model has been built in the commercial heat and mass balance code IPSEpro to estimate the efficiency of semi-closed dual-pressure oxy-fuel combustion combined cycle using natural gas as a fuel. In order to obtain the real physical properties of the working fluids in IPSEpro, the code was linked to the NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties Database (REFPROP). The oxy-fuel turbine was modeled with the <b>in-house</b> Lund <b>University</b> package LUAX-T. Important features such as stage loading, loss modeling, cooling and geometric features were included to generate more accurate results. The oxy-fuel compressor has been modeled using a Chalmers <b>university</b> <b>in-house</b> tool for conceptual design of axial compressors. The conceptual design of the SCOC-CC process has a net efficiency of 47 %. The air separation unit and CO 2 compression reduce the cycle efficiency by 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively. A single-shaft configuration was selected for the gas turbine simplicity. The rotational speed chosen was 5200 rpm and the turbine was designed with four stages. All stage preliminary design parameters are within ranges of established industrial axial turbine design limits. The main issue is the turbine exit Mach number; the stage must be lightly loaded in terms of pressure ratio to maintain the exit Mach number below 0. 6. The compressor is designed with 18 stages.

40|$|Nowadays {{the main}} driving {{parameters}} for the radio transmitter research are: energy efficiency, frequency re-configurability and integration. Pulsed transmitter architectures have attracted large {{interest in the}} recent years due to their potential to meet these demands. In pulsed transmitters, a highly efficient switch mode power amplifier (SMPA) is used in conjunction with a pulse modulator to achieve high efficiency linear amplification. Digital implementation of the modulator enables wide bandwidth for the signal generation path and improves the level integration. The bandwidth in a pulsed transmitter is however typically limited by the load matching network of the SMPA. This thesis presents two main contributions in the field of pulsed transmitter architectures. In the first part focus is given to bandwidth improvement of class-E switch mode PAs. A continuum of novel closed-form class-E modes is derived extending the traditional class-E design space. The extended design space provides important possibilities for wide band design of the class-E load networks and for further efficiency optimization of class-E PAs. A wide band design methodology is thus developed based on the analytical design equations. In the second part, focus is given to efficiency improvement of RF pulse width modulation (RF-PWM) based transmitters. A new SMPA topology particularly suitable for energy efficient amplification of RF-PWM signals is derived. It is analytically shown that high efficiency can be maintained over a wide power dynamic range if the imaginary part of the class-E load impedance is varied along with the pulse width. Using <b>in-house</b> (Chalmers <b>University)</b> SiC varactor diodes to implement the tunable load impedance, a 2 GHz 10 W peak output power CMOS-GaN HEMT RF-PWM transmitter demonstrator is realized. The static measurements show that a drain efficiency > 70 % can be obtained over a 6. 5 dB dynamic range. A digital pre-distortion based linearization scheme is proposed to enhance the linearity of the transmitter. An adjacent power ratio of - 45 dBc and average drain efficiency of 67 % is achieved using a realistic W-CDMA communication signal. These results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed pulsed transmitter topology for high efficiency linear amplification...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} presents novel algorithms for computing flow {{within an}} unstructured, collocated, finite volume solver {{in the presence}} of non-orthogonality and compressibility in order to extend the range of problems which can be modelled with the <b>University's</b> <b>in-house</b> CFD code: PHYSICA. A new non-orthogonality diffusion correction relaxation parameter has been successfully introduced and tested with benchmarks from the literature. Cases involving geometries meshed with commercial packages have been successfully run with the diffusion correction methods, variable bounding and proper under-relaxation practices. The applicability of a pressure interpolation method has also been tested with these cases. A procedure for solving compressible flow within a finite volume, pressure correction type scheme, has been devised and successfully implemented in different test cases. This method is however prone to numerical diffusion {{in the presence of}} shocks, but does work even in the presence of skewed meshes. The method was then tested with the case of an oxygen jet entering a heated furnace, for which experimental data is available for comparison. The method was successful in predicting the axial variables of the jet, and used to develop a turbulence modification model for such jets. The method was finally used to model the deformation of a free surface impinged by a compressible jet, using a novel zonal method called zonal Gas And Liquid Analyser (GALA). Convergence was achieved with the method developed in this research, together with the application of the counter diffusion method to model the moving interface...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a mobile self powered remote {{monitoring}} system enhanced for field deployment at Savannah River Site (SRS). The system used a localized power source with solar recharging and has wireless data collection, analysis, transmission, and data management capabilities. The prototype was equipped with a Hydrolab's DataSonde 4 a multi-sensor array package managed by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, with an adequate pumping capacity of water samples for sampling and analysis of Trichloroethylene (TCE) in contaminated groundwater wells at SRS. This paper focuses on a study and technology development efforts conducted at the Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) to automate the sampling of contaminated wells with a multi-sensor array package developed using COTS (Commercial Off The shelf) parts. Bladder pumps will pump water from different wells to the sensors array, water quality TCE indicator parameters are measured (i. e. pH, redox, ORP, DO, NO 3 -, Cl-). In order to increase user access and data management, the system was designed to be accessible over the Internet. Remote users can take sample readings and collect data remotely over a web. Results obtained at Florida International <b>University</b> <b>in-house</b> testing and at a field deployment at the Savannah River Site indicate that this long term monitoring technique can be a feasible solution for the sampling of TCE indicator parameters at remote contaminated sites...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance evaluation {{of three different}} cutting fluids used in a minimal quantity lubrication (MQL) system. The MQL system, developed <b>in-house</b> at the <b>University</b> of Malaya, was capable of delivering high velocity cutting fluid in narrow pulsed jet forms {{at a rate of}} 2 ml/min and a pressure of 20 MPa. The three cutting fluids chosen were neat oil, soluble oil and semi-synthetic cutting fluids. The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the fluids at various cutting velocities of 20, 40 and 60 m/min and feed rates of 0. 05, 0. 06 and 0. 07 mm/tooth. The results were measured in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece, the cutting forces and the maximum flank wear. In addition, the resultant chip formations were also observed. Analysis of the results has shown that in general, neat oil had performed the best in low cutting velocities and feed rates. On the other hand, soluble oil gave the lowest cutting forces and flank wears at high cutting velocities and feed rated as compared to neat oil and synthetic cutting fluid. It was observed that performance of soluble oil does not drastically change with variation to the cutting velocities and feed rates. Thus, the choice of soluble oil would be most appropriate for general machining usage. With suitable machining parameter selection, water-mixed cutting fluids (soluble oil and semi synthetics) performed comparatively well to deliver low surface roughness results. Therefore, this can be an economical choice for use in industrial production processes...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy concerning {{the role of}} cadaveric dissection in teaching gross anatomy and the potential of using 3 D computer-generated images to substitute for actual laboratory dissections. There are currently few high-quality 3 D virtual models of anatomy available to evaluate the utility of computer-generated images. Existing 3 D models are frequently of structures that are easily examined in three dimensions by removal from the cadaver, i. e., the heart, skull, and brain. We have focused on developing a 3 D model of the pelvis, a region that is conceptually difficult and relatively inaccessible for student dissection. We feel students will benefit tremendously from 3 D views of the pelvic anatomy. We generated 3 D models of the male pelvic anatomy from hand-segmented color Visible Human Male cryosection data, reconstructed and visualized by Columbia <b>University’s</b> <b>in-house</b> 3 D Vesalius ™ Visualizer. 1 These 3 D models depict the anatomy of the region in a realistic true-to-life color and texture. They {{can be used to}} create 3 D anatomical scenes, with arbitrary complexity, where the component anatomical structures are displayed in correct 3 D anatom-ical relationships. Moreover, a sequence of 3 D scenes can be defined to simulate actual dissection. Structures can be added in a layered sequence from the bony framework to build from the “inside-out ” or disassembled much like a true laboratory dissection from the “outside-in. ” These 3 D reconstructed anatomical models can provide views of the structures from new perspectives and have the potential to improve understanding of the anatomical relationships of the pelvic regio...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of infection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been hindered {{by the lack}} of a “gold standard” for comparison of serological assays used to estimate KSHV prevalence in serosurveys conducted in different settings. We have evaluated the performance of five <b>in-house</b> (developed at <b>University</b> College London [UCL], United Kingdom, and at the virology laboratory of the Instituto de Medicine Tropical [IMT] in Sao Paulo, Brazil) and two commercial (ABI and DIAVIR) serological assays to detect antibodies to latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and to lytic KSHV antigens. We used a variety of serum samples assembled to represent populations likely to be at high, intermediate, and low risk of KSHV infection in Brazil. Composite reference standard panels were prepared based on clinical and serological parameters, against which assay performances were assessed using conventional Bayesian statistics and latent class analysis (LCA). Against the clinical reference standard, in-house immunofluorescence assays to detect anti-LANA antibodies (IFA-LANA) produced at UCL and IMT had similar performances, with sensitivities of 61 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 48 % to 74 %) and 72 % (95 % CI, 58 % to 83 %) and specificities of 99 % (95 % CI, 94 % to 100 %) and 100 % (95 % CI, 96 % to 100 %), respectively, and only the IMT IFA-LANA was included in LCA, together with the IMT IFA-lytic and four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The LCA indicated that the IMT whole-virus ELISA performed best (sensitivity, 87 % [95 % CI, 81 % to 91 %]; and specificity, 100 % [95 % CI, 98 % to 100 %]), confirming the results obtained with the conventional statistical approach. Commercially available ELISA-based tests yielded the lowest specificities using a spectrum of serum samples. The evaluation of KSHV serological assays is warranted before planning serosurveys in various settings...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of the fundamental characteristics of environmental flows by interpreting the turbulence in a 3 D measurement domain. This thesis primarily describes the Tomographic PIV technique and the results of three experimental investigations of environmental flows. Two experiments were conducted in an open channel flow, divided into four sequential, identical pools, by a combination of regular grids. The first set of TPIV measurements were in the water column, while the second set of measurements were made along the channel bottom. The instantaneous structures in the flow were visualised and the turbulent kinetic energy k, energy dissipation ε and vorticity ω were analysed; their decay along the streamwise direction was revealed. Ejections (Q 2) and sweeps (Q 4) were identified along the channel bottom. A major contribution that resulted from the investigation pertains to the vibration correction of the cameras. TPIV measurements were taken of a regime of turbulent, forced fountain flows. The fountains were created by injecting a salt-water solution through a circular opening into the bottom of a reservoir of a water-ethanol solution, with their refractive indices carefully matched. The evolution of the fountain in its initial stages was captured and described in a series of chronological measurement volumes. Measurements of the fully developed fountains captured the large scale structures and their characteristics were analysed by considering the topology of the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor. The TPIV system was designed and built <b>in-house</b> at the <b>University</b> of Sydney. The experimental investigations described in this work revealed some interesting features of the environmental flows. The applicability and versatility of TPIV for these flows were demonstrated. The measurements allowed for the quantification and visualisation of the turbulence in the flows and hence shed light on the physics behind them...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} recent fires in {{single-storey}} warehouses have drawn attention to a current lack of understanding about the structural response of industrial portal frame structures to elevated temperatures. This research project has investigated the subject by conducting fire tests on a scaled model and by computer modelling using the non-linear finite element program VULCAN. This program has been developed <b>in-house</b> by the <b>University</b> of Sheffield and is capable of modelling the behaviour of three-dimensional steel and composite frames at elevated temperatures. It has been validated throughout its development. An initial investigation was conducted to validate the program for analysing inclined members, which form part of a pitched- roof portal frame, but {{for which it was}} not initially developed. Additional features were implemented into the program where necessary. A series of indicative fire tests was conducted at the Health and Safety Laboratories, Buxton. A scaled portal frame model was designed and built, and three major fire tests were conducted in this structure. In the third of these tests the heated rafters experienced a snap-through failure mechanism, in which fire hinges could clearly be identified. The experimental results were then used for validating the numerical results produced by VULCAN analyses. The correlations were relatively close, both for predictions of displacements and failure temperatures. This gave increased confidence in using VULCAN to conduct a series of parametric studies. The parametric studies included two- and three-dimensional analyses, and a number of parameters were investigated, including the effects of vertical and horizontal load, frame geometry, heating profiles and base rotational stiffness. The influence of secondary members was investigated in the three-dimensional studies using different fire scenarios. A simplified calculation method has been developed for estimating the critical temperatures of portal frames in fire. The results compare well with predictions from VULCAN. The current guidance document for portal frames in boundary conditions has been reviewed, and the concept of performance-based design for portal frame structures has been discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{penetration}} of renewable sources, particularly wind and solar, into the grid {{has been increasing}} in recent years. As a consequence, there have been serious concerns over reliable and safety operation of power systems. One possible solution, to improve grid stability, is to integrate energy storage devices into power system network: storing energy produced in periods of low demand to later use, ensuring full exploitation of intermittent available sources. Focusing on stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) energy system, energy storage is needed {{with the purpose of}} ensuring continuous power flow, to minimize or, if anything, to neglect electrical grid supply. A comprehensive study on a hybrid stand-alone photovoltaic power system using two different energy storage technologies has been performed. This study examines the feasibility of replacing electricity provided by the grid with hybrid system to meet household demand. This paper is a part of an experimental and a theoretical study which is currently under development at University of Bologna. A test facility is under construction, at the University of Bologna, for the experimental characterization of the cogenerative performance of small scale hybrid power systems, composed of micro-CHP systems of different technologies : a Micro Rankine Cycles (MRC), a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEM-FC), a battery, an electrolyzer and a heat recovery subsystem. The test set-up is also integrated with an external load simulator, in order to generate variable load profiles. This paper presents the theoretical results of the performance simulations developed considering an hybrid system consisting on a photovoltaic array (PV), electrochemical batteries (B) and electrolyzer (HY) with a H 2 tank and a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEM-FC) stack, in case of a household electrical demand. The performance of this system have been evaluated by the use of a calculation code, <b>in-house</b> developed by <b>University</b> of Bologna; future activities will be the tuning of the software with the experimental results, in order to realize a code able to define the correct size of each sub-system, ones the load profile of the utility is known or estimated...|$|R
