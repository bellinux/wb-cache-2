40|$|Five-year {{longitudinal}} {{data on a}} cohort of early to middle adolescents (N[*]=[*] 923) and a cohort of middle to late adolescents (N[*]=[*] 390) were {{used to examine the}} correlates of <b>hypermaturity</b> (i. e. 12 -year-olds with a personality profile resembling the profile of an average 20 -year-old) and immaturity (i. e. 20 -year-olds with a personality profile resembling the profile of an average 12 -year-old) of personality. Analyses revealed that girls with high levels of <b>hypermaturity</b> exhibited high levels of internalizing problem behaviour and conflict with parents, while <b>hypermaturity</b> in boys was only associated with internalizing problems. Immature girls had low levels of anxiety and high levels of minor delinquency, whereas immature boys reported low levels of anxiety and high levels of physical maturity. These findings suggest that off-time personality development is an interesting concept deserving further exploration...|$|E
40|$|Of 409 {{consecutive}} Arab {{patients in}} Kuwait who had extractions for idiopathic (senile and presenile) cataract 385 were followed {{up for a}} minimum period of one year. Among these the final visual outcome was 6 / 12 or better in 208 eyes (54 %) but visual acuity was 6 / 18 or less in 177 eyes (46 %). Of these 177 eyes 127 eyes (71. 8 %) had poor vision due to preoperative ocular disorders and 31 (17. 5 %) due to surgical complications. The main ocular conditions which limited visual recovery were the presence of corneal opacities, <b>hypermaturity</b> of cataract, advanced glaucoma, senile macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and postoperative retinal detachment in this order of frequency. The prevalence of these disorders in cataract patients among the Arab population was identified and is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the extent of placental lesions associated with blood pressure (BP) levels in pregnancies complicated by hypertension. Methods. 55 singleton pregnancies complicated by mild hypertension were recruited and compared to 55 pregnancies complicated by severe hypertension. The histological assessment was carried out with regard to the following aspects: vessels number/field of vision, infarction, villous fibrinoid necrosis, villous <b>hypermaturity,</b> avascular villi, calcifications, lymphohistiocytic villitis, and thickened vessels. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS. Results. All placental lesions were observed more often in the severe hypertension group. Vessels number was significantly decreased, and infarction and villous fibrinoid necrosis were significantly increased in the placentas of the severe hypertension group compared to the mild hypertension group (< 0. 001). Conclusion. This study supports that the extent of placental lesions in hypertensive pregnancies is correlated with hypertension level and so highlights blood pressure level as a mirror of placental function...|$|E
40|$|Follicular fluid (FF) {{lipoprotein}} {{content was}} evaluated in an in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer and gamete [...] intrafallopian [...] transfer program and correlated to follicular and oocyte maturation. Moreover, the in vitro progesterone response of granulosa-luteal cells from 10 patients to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was assessed. Most FFs contained only HDL. Sixteen out of 97 FFs contained also very {{low levels of}} LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). The presence of LDL was associated to features of follicle and oocyte <b>hypermaturity.</b> LDL alone induced a much more potent increase of progesterone (P) release by granulosa-luteal cells than HDL alone, and the HDL partially reversed the potent effect of LDL. It is concluded that in late follicular phase HDL maintains P release by granulosa cells {{at a low rate}} and prevents a potent stimulation of P production by LDL which might cross the maturating blood-follicle barrier, until increasing passage of LDL in FF decreases the HDL:LDL ratio and the action of LDL becomes prominent...|$|E
40|$|Tremulousness of {{the lens}} on {{movement}} of the eye was observed by D'Ombrain (1 936) in a patient with a mature cataract after an attack of iridocyclitis. He described the tremulousness {{of the lens}} as being of the same quality as iridodonesis, but {{in the absence of}} iridodonesis he could not consider the lens to be dislocated. He suggested that the tremulousness was caused by a fluid vitreous, and for this reason did not proceed with cataract extraction. One might add inflammatory degeneration of the zonule as being a contributory factor. Bellow (I 944) described as cataracta tremulans, a movement of the lens in which <b>hypermaturity</b> and shrinkage have caused stretching of the zonule. In such cases the lens is found in its normal location in the patellar fossa. Bellows (I 944) also described a vibrating lens in which, although the lens remained in its normal position, the anterior chamber was deepened and changes occurred in the vitreous; these cases were associated with retinal detachment. Irvine (I 940) quoted two cases of tremulous lenses associated with pseudocapsular exfoliation without further details...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{reviews the}} {{surgical}} pathology reports of post-partum hemorrhages to support clinicians in malpractice litigation and, potentially, to enhance pregnancy-related diagnoses. Study design: This {{work is a}} retrospective study of surgical pathology reports of term pregnancies between January 2000 and January 2012 selected from the Surgical Pathology database of the I. R. C. C. S Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-IST (Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa). Results: Ninety-five revision reports were identified (0. 22 % "placenta accrete," 0. 46 % "non-accreta placental tissue retention," and 0. 31 % "no placental fragments retention"). Secondary post-partum hemorrhages occurred in 0. 3 %, and primary PPH occurred in 0. 05 %, regardless of the group examined. Both types of PPH were most often associated with vaginal deliveries (58 %). The most frequent endometrial finding was post-partum endometritis (43 %). The entire placenta was submitted to the pathologist in 22 / 95 cases (23 %). <b>Hypermaturity</b> and/or villous immaturity were the main histological patterns. Conclusions: This review supports {{the hypothesis that the}} pathological placenta abnormalities observed, rather than underlying myometrium abnormalities, may underlie the contractile failure and the incomplete removal of the placenta. For these reasons, the authors emphasized the importance of investigating the placenta in cases of complicated deliveries not associated with PPH to support clinicians in malpractice claims. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|E
40|$|The current {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} adolescent identity formation and personality development. We {{focused on how}} these aspects of individuality develop through adolescence, and how individual differences in (the development of) personality and identity relate to problem behavior. For that purpose, we applied: a) variable-centered approaches focusing on how particular traits or dimensions change on average {{in a group of}} individuals, and whether individual differences in traits or dimensions are stable or fluctuate across time; and b) person-centered approaches focusing on how a configuration of traits is organized within an individual. Data were used from three longitudinal projects: CONAMORE, RADAR, and L-TIDES. In addition, data from a cross-sectional project involving juvenile delinquents and clinically referred youth was used. Participants in these projects filled out questionnaires on personality, identity formation, conflicts with parents, friendship quality, academic adjustment, and problem behavior. Variable-centered to personality revealed that adolescent’s personalities matured, as they became more agreeable, extraverted, and open to experience when they grew older. In addition, inter-individual differences became more set, and traits became more consistently organized within individuals. For all aspects of development, girls were ahead on boys. Development of personality traits was strongly interrelated with development of problem behavior symptoms, as specific personality characteristics seemed to put adolescents at risk for developing problem behavior symptoms, but problem behavior symptoms also seemed to affect adolescent personality traits. Person-centered approaches to personality revealed that three classic personality types (Resilients, Undercontrollers, and Overcontrollers) were replicable as trajectories of personality development. With another person-centered approach to personality, we showed {{that it is not the}} stability of a profile that is linked to psychological adjustment, but the degree to which an individual’s personality profile matches the profile of the average person within a sample. From a developmental perspective, an individual’s personality profile can diverge from the profile of the average person in two ways: one can either be ahead (i. e., <b>hypermaturity)</b> or lag behind (i. e., immaturity) in development. We showed that <b>hypermaturity</b> is related to internalizing problems in boys and girls. Immaturity is related to externalizing problems, but only in girls. With regard to identity formation, early adolescents became increasingly more certain about their current commitments as they exhibited decreases in reconsideration. Middle and late adolescents were involved in identity evaluation, as they exhibited increases in in-depth exploration. As with personality development, girls also seemed to be ahead on boys in identity formation. By tracking early adolescents with daily internet assessments, we demonstrated that identity formation is guided by a certainty-uncertainty (commitment-reconsideration) dynamic that operates on day-to-day level. Moreover, fluctuations in reconsideration predicted a weaker sense of identity in general. Finally, we demonstrated that identity formation is more strongly related to severe forms of delinquency than to other types of severe problem behavior, as juvenile delinquents displayed much more problems with identity formation than clinically referred youth did. In sum, we demonstrated important development changes in personality and identity. Individual differences in (changes in) personality and identity were found to be strongly related to problem behavior...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Of 409 {{consecutive}} Arab {{patients in}} Kuwait who had extractions for idiopathic (senile and presenile) cataract 385 were followed {{up for a}} minimum period of one year. Among these the final visual outcome was 6 / 12 or better in 208 eyes (54 %) but visual acuity was 6 / 18 or less in 177 eyes (46 %). Of these 177 eyes 127 eyes (71 - 8 %) had poor vision due to preoperative ocular disorders and 31 (17 - 5 %) due to surgical complications. The main ocular conditions which limited visual recovery were the presence of corneal opacities, <b>hypermaturity</b> of cataract, advanced glaucoma, senile macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and postoperative retinal detachment in this order of frequency. The prevalence of these disorders in cataract patients among the Arab population was identified and is discussed. The visual outcome and complication rate are the objective means of assessing the success of cataract surgery. " While modern cataract extraction is safe and effective, irreversible blindness either from the complications of advanced untreated cataract or from the complications of surgery may occur. 3 In addition associated ocular diseases {{increase the risk of}} complications and reduce the chances of a good visual outcome. 4 The {{purpose of this article is}} to identify the main causes of poor visual achievement after cataract extractions in an Arab population in Kuwait, to highlight associated ocular problems with senile cataract, and to provide data about the prevalence of different eye disorders in this community. Materials and methods Four hundred and nine consecutive idiopathic (senile and presenile) cataract extractions in 352 patients were performed in the year 1983 at the Eye Depart-ment, lbn Sina Hospital, Kuwait. Other types of secondary or traumatic cataracts were excluded. A complete ophthalmic examination was carried out when each patient was admitted. Operations were performed by several surgeons with various levels of experience. There were 329 intracapsular cataract extractions (80. 4 %) and 80 (19 - 5 %) extra...|$|E
