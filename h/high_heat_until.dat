50|$|Sautéed {{mushrooms}} is {{a common}} dish prepared by the sautéing of sliced or whole edible mushrooms. Butter is typically used when sautéing the dish, and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used. Clarified butter can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter. The dish is typically cooked for over a <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> the mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added. Overcooking may create an inferior dish by the causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{relaxation}} peak {{has been}} observed in the internal friction spectrum of 18 -carat AuAgCu yellow gold alloys at about 750 K for 0. 5 Hz. It {{is related to the}} presence of grain boundaries, since it is absent in the spectrum of single crystals. For the 14 -carat yellow gold alloy (Au 38 %Ag 32 %Cu 30 %), a phase decomposition between silver-rich and copper-rich solid solution occurs in the same temperature range. The effects of the phase decomposition on the internal friction and the dynamic modulus are studied by isochronal and isothermal measurements and correlated with the microstructure evolution. Upon cooling, the phase decomposition starts at grain boundaries at about 840 K, producing a fine lamellar structure, and the grain boundary peak amplitude strongly decreases. As the phase decomposition progresses at the interior of the grains upon further cooling, the internal friction background increases. It remains very <b>high</b> in <b>heating</b> <b>until</b> solid solution homogenisation, which occurs above 890 K. Such an increase of the internal friction background is observed also in the single crystalline alloy and may be attributed to the interfaces between lamellae of the silver and copper-rich phase...|$|R
40|$|A {{heat pipe}} is a heat {{transfer}} device {{of very high}} thermal conductance that features two-phase flow. Research at McGill University {{has led to the}} development of the McGill Heat Pipe which includes an internal flow modifier. Such a heat pipe can be operated at very <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes. This area of heat pipe technology has potential in many applications in metallurgical industries. This thesis describes how the McGill heat pipe was developed, tested, modeled and applied in <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> flux situations. <b>Until</b> the development of the McGill Heat Pipe, three main issues had prevented the successful use of heat pipe technology in <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> flux applications. These relate to limitations imposed by film boiling, dry-out, and the structure of the flow. The McGill Heat Pipe has successfully addressed and overcome these limitations. To overcome film boiling and dry-out, a flow modifier was developed. The structure of the flow was changed by introducing a reservoir and a return line. This thesis describes some of the work that is being carried out to develop and evaluate families of flow modifiers, or spiral springs. Results from a number of high flux experiments will be detailed and the effects of the flow modifiers for each case will be described. In addition, the velocity of the return water was visualized with magnesium alloy chips and was measured with a video camera. Comparisons of the operation of the heat pipe both with and without a flow modifier are presented. This is the first study of its kind in which a transparent glass return line and particles were used to visualize the liquid flow in the return line of the heat pipe...|$|R

50|$|Rice {{is often}} rinsed and soaked before cooked. Unpolished brown rice {{requires}} longer soaking time than the milled white rice does. The {{amount of water}} added can vary depending on many factors. Newly harvested rice usually requires less water, and softer varieties need more water than firmer varieties. Rice can be boiled in a heavy-bottomed cookware or steamed in a food steamer. Some boiling methods do not require precise water measurements, as the rice is strained after boiling. This draining method is suitable for the less glutinous varieties such as basmati rice, but not-suitable for varieties like japonica rice which become sticky to some degree when cooked. Optionally, small amount of salt can be added before cooking. If not drained, boiled rice is usually cooked on <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> a rolling boil, then simmered with the lid on, and steamed over the residual heat after turning off the heat. Nowadays, electric rice cookers are also commonly used to cook rice. During cooking, rice absorbs water and increase in volume and mass.|$|E
40|$|Heat {{dissipation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues for the reliability of electronics equipment. Boiling can be a very efficient heat transfer mechanism, thus it can be used to maintain the junction temperature of electronics equipment at values compatible with the technology using efficient and compact heat sinks. On the other hand, the environmental issues associated with the use of synthetic refrigerants call for a continuous improvement in technical solutions. Recently, new low-GWP refrigerants, in particular R 1234 ze(E), have been proposed as possible alternatives of the more traditional R 134 a. Besides, cellular structured materials both stochastic and periodic, particularly open cell metal foams, have been suggested as possible enhanced surfaces to lower electronics temperatures at <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes. <b>Until</b> now, most of the research on metal foams regards only single phase flow, whereas two phase flow is still almost unexplored. This paper presents an experimental study on the heat transfer of R 134 a and R 1234 ze(E) during single phase liquid and flow boiling inside a 5 PPI copper foam. The experimental measurements were carried out by imposing two different heat fluxes: 50 and 100 kW m- 2, at constant saturation temperature of 30 °C; the refrigerant mass velocity was varied between 50 and 200 kg m- 2 s- 1 while the vapor quality varied from 0. 2 to 0. 95. As a result, the effects of the refrigerant mass flow rate, heat flux, and vapor quality on the heat transfer coefficient, dryout phenomenon, and pressure drop are investigated. Furthermore, the flow boiling heat transfer was observed using a high speed video camera allowing for a detailed analysis of the experimental results...|$|R

Pyrolysis oil from Napier grass {{was used in this}} study. Water content was determined with pH adjustment using a Karl Fischer titration unit.

The oil was found to have between 42 and 64 % moisture under the same pyrolysis condition depending on the properties of the Napier grass prior to the pyrolysis. The <b>higher</b> <b>heating</b> value of the pyrolysis oil was determined using an oil-diesel mixture, and 20 to 25 wt% of the oil in the mixture gave optimum and stable results.

40|$|Acid- and rennet-induced {{gelation}} {{properties of}} milk with modified casein micelles, produced by partial renneting at 4 oC for 15 min, followed by inactivation of enzymes by heat at 60 oC/ 3 min (referred as low heat treatment milk) and 85 oC/ 30 min (<b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk), were investigated {{to provide a}} mechanistic understanding of gel formation from partially renneted milk. Acidification of low heat treatment milk gave firmer gel quality, this was reflected by its high elastic modulus (G′) and hardness. In addition, the <b>high</b> <b>heating</b> condition for enzyme inactivation of <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk alone increased the elastic modulus of both the control and renneted milk samples. Gel development of the two milk types (low <b>heat</b> treatment and <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milks) was different. In contrast with acid gelation, rennet-induced gelation of partially pre-rennet treated milk had {{no impact on the}} elastic modulus of low heat treatment milk and the rennet gels were very weak. Similarly, the addition of rennet to pre-rennet treated <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> treatment milk did not produce “true gels,” most likely due to the effect of the heat treatment on impairing the rennet coagulation.
