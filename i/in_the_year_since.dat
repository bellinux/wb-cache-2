5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>since</b> {{publication}} received {{highly critical}} replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions {{and three other}} states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
500|$|After {{its initial}} box-office success, many theaters decided to {{continue}} to show the film {{for more than two}} weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release. In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with a gross $94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned $83,400,000. The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and The Little Mermaid during 2012 and 2013. However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and theatrical re-release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled. In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, [...] "the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>since,</b> meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{main event}} for the 2013 Dos Leyenda show was {{a direct result of}} a long-running slowly {{building}} storyline between the Japanese duo of Namajague and Okumura, collectively known as La Fiebre Amarilla ("The Yellow Fever") and Mexican high-fliers Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa. Namajague, the masked identity of New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) rookie Kyosuke Mikami, made his debut in CMLL a few weeks prior to the 2012 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show as part of CMLL's working arrangement with NJPW. He was immediately teamed up with Okumura, CMLL's resident Japanese wrestler who often acts both as a tag team partner and a mentor for Japanese wrestlers touring with CMLL. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>since</b> Namajague's debut La Fievre Amarilla had several unsuccessful title matches against Stuka Jr. and Fuego for the latter's CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. Through the series of Arena Coliseo Tag Team matches Namajague began targeting Stuka Jr. specifically, more intent on hurting and humiliating him including tearing Stuka Jr.'s mask open during the match. In late 2012 the two began facing off on opposite sides of Six-man tag team matches on various weekly Super Viernes shows, CMLL's main weekly show. In November Stuka Jr. often teamed with Rey Cometa to take on the Japanese team and Puma King, initially as a continuation of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Puma King, who had unmasked Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show, but began to morph into focusing on the escalating issues between Stuka Jr./Rey Cometa and Fiebre Amarilla. On the November 2, 2012 Super Viernes the match started out with Rey Cometa and Puma King being {{the focal point of the}} match, but Okumura won the third and deciding fall for his team when he took advantage of a distracted referee to land an illegal low blow on Stuka Jr. A few weeks later, on the November 23 Super Viernes La Fiebre was on the opposite side of Rey Cometa once again and Namajague tried once again to win the match by illegal means, only to be caught by the referee and disqualified as a result of his actions. On the last Super Viernes of 2012 La Fiebre teamed up with Vangelis to defeat the team of Fuego, Rey Cometa and Stuka Jr. The victory earned La Fiebre another match against the CMLL Arena Coloseo Tag Team Champions. During the title match Namajague, Namajague tried to trick Stuka Jr. into getting disqualified by pulling his own mask off and throwing it to Stuka Jr. to make it look like it was pulled off, which is a disqualification offense in Lucha Libre. Stuka Jr. reacted quickly before the referee noticed and put the mask back on Namajague and then pinned his surprised opponent. The January 4, 2013 Super Viernes saw the rivalry continue as Stuka Jr. and Okumura was on opposite sides of a six-man tag team match, won by Stuka Jr.'s team, while Rey Cometa defeated Namajague by disqualification when Namajague tried to use a low blow on his opponent. Over the next coulple of weeks Stuka Jr. and Namajague found themselves on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches, teaming with a number of different partners which did not always include Rey Cometa or Okumura. Both Rey Cometa and Namajague took part in the 2013 CMLL Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on February 2, 2013 but due to their interaction and a mistimed move Namajague ended up landing wrong during a dive to the floor and had to be taken to the hospital, while moments later Rey Cometa also ended up hurt. Both accidents looked so bad that it put their participation in the follow week's Super Viernes in question, but in the end Rey Cometa teamed with Stuka Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma to take on and defeat Namajague, Okumura and Misterioso Jr.. Following the February 8 match Stuka Jr. challenged Namajague to put his mask on the line in a Lucha de Apuesta, or bet match, an offer that Okumura [...] "in his role as leader of Fiebre Amarilla" [...] declined the challenge, wanting to face Stuka Jr. himself. Rey Cometa responded to that challenge by issuing a team challenge, with himself and Stuka Jr. against La Fiebre Amarilla for the team's mask and hair to be on the line. During the introductions to a six-man tag team match on February 15, 2013 Stuka Jr. and Namajague started to argue while still in the aisle to the ring, only for Stuka Jr. to be attacked from behind by another Namajague. The first Namajague was revealed as Okumura as the two beat Stuka Jr. down. The Japanese team lost the match by disqualification after unmasking Stuka Jr. in the second fall. Following the match Okumura said they accepted the tag team challenge. On Thursday February 21, 2013 CMLL held a press conference announcing, among other things, that the match between the two teams would officially take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas as the main event of the show. On March 3, 2013 La Ola Amarilla defeated Stuka Jr. and Fuego to win the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship in a match that ended in controversy as Stuka Jr.'s shoulder was not on the mat during the count of three, something the referee did not see.|$|E
