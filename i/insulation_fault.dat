However, a first <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> can effectively turn an IT system into a TN system, and then a second <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> can lead to dangerous body currents. Worse, in a multi-phase system, {{if one of the}} line conductors made contact with earth, it would cause the other phase cores to rise to the phase-phase voltage relative to earth rather than the phase-neutral voltage. IT systems also experience larger transient overvoltages than other systems.|$|E

In the absence of any <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> in the consumer device, the equation IL1+IL2+IL3+IN = 0 holds, and an RCD can disconnect the supply as soon as this sum reaches a threshold (typically 10 mA - 500 mA).

5000|$|In the TN-C system, {{a common}} {{conductor}} provides both the neutral and protective grounding.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an image reconstruction method {{to monitor the}} temperature distribution of electric generator stators. The main objective is to identify insulation failures that may arise as hotspots in the structure. The method is based on temperature readings of fiber optic distributed sensors (DTS) and a sparse reconstruction algorithm. Thermal images of the structure are formed by appropriately combining atoms of a dictionary of hotspots, which was constructed by finite element simulation with a multi-physical model. Due to difficulties for reproducing <b>insulation</b> <b>faults</b> in real stator structure, experimental tests were performed using a prototype similar to the real structure. The results demonstrate {{the ability of the}} proposed method to reconstruct images of hotspots with dimensions down to 15 cm, representing a resolution gain of up to six times when compared to the DTS spatial resolution. In addition, satisfactory results were also obtained to detect hotspots with only 5 cm. The application of the proposed algorithm for thermal imaging of generator stators can contribute to the identification of <b>insulation</b> <b>faults</b> in early stages, thereby avoiding catastrophic damage to the structure...|$|R

5000|$|In TN, an <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> is {{very likely}} to lead to a high {{short-circuit}} current that will trigger an overcurrent circuit-breaker or fuse and disconnect the L conductors. With TT systems, the earth fault loop impedance can be too high to do this, or too high to do it within the required time, so an RCD (formerly ELCB) is usually employed. Earlier TT installations may lack this important safety feature, allowing the CPC (Circuit Protective Conductor or PE) and perhaps associated metallic parts within reach of persons (exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts) to become energized for extended periods under fault conditions, which is a real danger.|$|E

Comsol simulation of the measurement process was carried out to show the eﬀect of temperature plot region on the accuracy of loss density estimation. The application of the measuring system was demonstrated in two cases; ﬁrstly, <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> caused by burr contacts created on the cutting edges of laminated steel sheet was measured. DC current was supplied to 10 stacked pieces of laminated steel sheets compressed with a force of 2500 N for 5 seconds. IR camera was used to capture the surface of the sample and the images obtined was visibly analyzed. The temperature rise curves were compared with the simulation results.

40|$|Abstract — When a {{breakdown}} of the thermally insulating vacuum occurs in an energized high power coil system (e. g. a leakage of the He-cooling system or to the surrounding air) the coils warm up and have to be discharged fast to avoid destruction. Due to the coil inductance and the necessary discharge time, a high voltage is produced in the coil and the feeder system. Therefore an unspecified pressure coincides with the occurrence of a high voltage at the coil and feeder system. It is well known that under these conditions arcing can occur at a magnet when it is not perfectly insulated even for voltages < 1 kV (Paschen-effect). The gas dependent breakdown voltage minimum occurs typically in the range of some 100 V at a pressure value that depends from geometry and temperature. For lower and higher pressures the breakdown voltage is increasing. For a high power magnet system an insulation is necessary that can withstand high voltage in the 10 kV range although any possible pressure is applied to the system. Usually a pressure independent solid insulation is used to solve this requirement. In order to test the reliability of this electrical insulation under all pressure conditions, a so-called Paschen test has to be performed. This Paschen test is a high voltage test with pressures varying between good vacuum and ambient pressure. In this paper examples for insulation failures on large coils found with Paschen testing are given. In a series of experiments with samples that have been prepared with intended <b>insulation</b> <b>faults</b> the necessity of Paschen testing is demonstrated to identify insulation problems that are not visible under good vacuum or ambient pressure. Therefore, a Paschen-test is also a useful high voltage diagnostic tool to localize <b>insulation</b> <b>faults</b> in solid insulated magnets...|$|R

During a plasma pulse, a poloidal field magnet experiences an over-voltage condition or an electrical <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> that results in two intense electrical arcs. It is assumed that this event produces two one square meters ruptures, resulting in a pathway that connects {{the interior of the}} vacuum vessel to the cryostat air space room.

In the meantime, all the magnet coils are discharged through the magnet protection system actuation. This postulated event creates the simultaneous failure of two radioactive confinement barrier and it envelopes all type of smaller LOCAs into the cryostat.

40|$|Abstract: Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{analysis has}} been successfully used {{as a means to}} evaluate the integrity of insulation systems, especially high voltage electrical systems such as generators, transformers, and capacitors. In recent years, PD has also gained increasing attention for its application in low voltage insulation systems such as aircraft wiring systems. Besides detecting and acquiring discharge signals/pulses with sufficiently high measuring sensitivities, one of the challenges of using PD for <b>insulation</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis is to accurately interpret the acquired signals. That is, to associate the PD signals with real physical phenomena and specifically the states of the insulation that is being monitored. Like in any diagnostic/classification system, the key to an accurate and reliable PD diagnosis is a set of high quality features/attributes that represent/capture the characteristics of PD signals. More importantly, these features must posses strong discriminant power so that the classifier designed based on those features gives desired performance. This paper is concerned with the application of linear feature transformation techniques for reducing the number of features that are extracted by collectively using different feature extraction methods. More specifically, this paper investigates the effectiveness of the two well-studied linear feature transformation methods, namely, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), in improving the classification performance of PD diagnostic systems. We apply these techniques to experimental partial discharge data from an ongoing study of aircraft wiring diagnostics. We also compare {{the results of this study}} with those from using other feature selection techniques...|$|E

Major research effort has therefore focused on the early detection of faults in the insulating systems of large high voltage power transformers. Although several industrial methods exist for the on-line and off-line monitoring of power transformers, all of them are expensive and complex, and require the use of specific electronic instrumentation. For these reasons, this paper will present the On-Line analysis of transformer leakage flux as an efficient alternative for assessing machine integrity and detecting the presence of insulating failures during their earliest stages. An industrial 400 kVA– 20 kV/ 400 V transformer will be used for the experimental study.
