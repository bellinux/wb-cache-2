50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> <b>terminal</b> and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|E
50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> <b>terminal</b> is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other cameras}} in the series, the <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> <b>terminals</b> are present, however covered due to the {{integrated}} flash gun.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya Press {{is a line}} of medium-format {{rangefinder}} system camera {{manufactured by}} Mamiya. The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and {{a wide array of}} accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm × 9 cm, but images can be taken {{in a number of different}} formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in release cable. The lenses also have <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> <b>terminals.</b> The camera lacks an internal dark slide, so one has to be inserted into the film holder before changing the lens.|$|R
5000|$|PC <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> socket: As built, the T90 lacks a {{separate}} <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> socket. The addition of {{one could be}} performed by request by Canon support centers. If so modified, it is fitted on the left-hand side of the prism housing, as seen by the user.|$|R

The flagship model in this series is the MZ-S which body materials are metal, faster film drive and higher <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> speed. Only MZ-S and MZ-6 are compatible with newly introduced P-TTL flash system. Both models can control remote flash wirelessly by popup flash commander mode in normal or high-speed <b>flash</b> <b>sync.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1953, C.P.Goerz {{introduced}} Goerz Minicord III, {{with key}} feature same as previous model, but with <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> added.|$|R
50|$|The Konica F also {{featured}} a 1/125 <b>flash</b> <b>sync,</b> whereas other cameras {{of the time}} offered 1/30 to 1/60 sync.|$|R
50|$|The XPan {{reverted to}} the focal plane shutter, {{offering}} 8-1/1000 s, and <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> from B (max. 270 s) - 1/125 s.|$|R

5000|$|FED 2c has the <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> port {{moved to}} the top deck from the body. It also has a mushroom-shaped film advance knob.|$|R
50|$|The shutter {{is rated}} to 100,000 shots, and {{is capable of}} speeds up to 1/8000 sec, with a <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> speed of 1/200 sec.|$|R
50|$|Ken Rockwell {{criticized the}} slower <b>flash</b> <b>sync,</b> more megapixels, and lower base ISO. However, he praised the camera's manual focus indicator, {{saying it was}} better than his D3.|$|R
5000|$|FED 2b has <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> added. The new {{shutter speed}} dial has the {{reference}} point on a center post that rotates with the dial as the shutter is fired.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 the OM-4 was {{improved}} to a tougher OM-4Ti (OM-4T in USA) version, with titanium {{top and bottom}} plates, improved weatherproofing and high-speed <b>flash</b> <b>sync.</b> This last version was discontinued in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The shutter {{is rated}} to 200,000 shots, and {{is capable of}} speeds up to 1/8000 s, with a <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> speed of 1/250 s. Using {{compatible}} external <b>flashes,</b> <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> speeds up to 1/8000 s are possible. Additionally, the camera can be set to automatically delay its shutter release to compensate for flickering electric lights. The camera's reflex mirror is driven by a motor which slows the mirror to reduce vibration during high speed shooting. This motor also enables unique new Silent Shooting Modes, which reduce camera noise, {{at the cost of}} a slight increase of shutter lag time from 0.055 s to 0.105 s.|$|R
50|$|Due to its hybrid electronic/mechanical shutter, {{it is in}} fact {{possible}} to <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> the D40 beyond its published 1/500 maximum sync speed up to its maximum shutter speed of 1/4000. The D40x does not share this ability.|$|R
50|$|In a camera, flash {{synchronization}} {{is defined}} as synchronizing the firing of a photographic flash {{with the opening of}} the shutter admitting light to photographic film or electronic image sensor. It is often shortened to <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> or <b>flash</b> synch.|$|R
50|$|The shutter was a {{horizontal}} cloth-curtain focal-plane shutter with a speed range of 1/1 to 1/1000 second. As it was fully mechanical, the camera {{could be used}} even if the battery was dead. <b>Flash</b> <b>sync</b> was set for 1/60 second.|$|R
50|$|The VT used a cloth shutter curtain, and shutter speeds {{were from}} 1s to 1/1000, plus T and B. Available Canon lenses ranged from 25mm to 800mm, and offered lenses {{as fast as}} f/1.2. <b>Flash</b> <b>sync</b> is {{available}} for FP, M, and X.|$|R
5000|$|Leaf shutters, {{which are}} {{generally}} situated within the lens housing, open {{to expose the}} entire image at once, and therefore allow <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> across all shutter speeds (up to 1/1600" [...] with a Schneider Kreuznach lens on a Phase One/Mamiya 645DF camera).|$|R
5000|$|The camera {{does not}} have a <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> on its hot shoe. Instead a pc sync socket is provided. The shutter on early models is a {{horizontally}} running mechanically timed rubberized silk fabric curtain. In 1959 the shutter curtain was changed to titanium similar to the Nikon F.|$|R
50|$|Like the Bessa R2, the Rollei 35 RF has a Leica M-mount and a metal focal-plane shutter. Its TTL {{exposure}} meter requires batteries, but batteries are not otherwise needed. Shutter speeds range from 1 to 1/2000 s and bulb (B), with <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> at 1/125 s on hot-shoe or PC terminal.|$|R
50|$|All the Cosina Voigtländer Bessa {{models have}} a double focal plane shutter with two sets of {{curtains}} to prevent damage by the sun. Shutter speeds range from 1 to 1/2000s and bulb (B), with <b>flash</b> <b>sync</b> at 1/125s on hot-shoe or PC terminal. They all have TTL exposure metering, and manual exposure; the recent R2A and R3A also have an aperture priority automatic mode.|$|R
50|$|For the PlayStation 4 version, the DualShock 4 {{light bar}} <b>flashes</b> in <b>sync</b> with the Transistor's speech.|$|R
50|$|Although the Square shutter {{improved}} the FP shutter in most ways, it still limited maximum flash X-sync speed to 1/125 s (unless using special long-burn FP flash bulbs that burn throughout the slit wipe, making slit width irrelevant.). Any quality leaf shutter of the 1960s could achieve at least 1/500 s <b>flash</b> <b>sync.</b> Greater FP shutter X-sync speed would require further strengthening the curtains, by using exotic materials, {{allowing them to}} move even faster and widen the slits.|$|R
50|$|The cloth {{focal plane}} shutter has speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000 and B. The {{electronic}} <b>flash</b> <b>sync.</b> speed is 1/60. A delayed action timer gives 8 - 10 seconds delay, using the same front of body lever that actuates the stop-down metering. The mirror can be locked up for vibration reduction or for use with special FL lenses like the original 19mm f3.5 wide angle which projects deeply into the body and would foul the mirror.|$|R
