5|$|At WrestleMania IX, Yokozuna {{defeated}} Bret Hart {{to win the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship. His title reign only lasted several minutes, however, as <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> belt to Hulk Hogan in {{an impromptu}} match. Yokozuna regained the title but dropped it to Hart the following year.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc then {{returned}} to Florida, where he was kept mainly in the singles division. In October 1983, he was put over Scott McGhee to win the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship for a second time. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> belt to Barry Windham the following month. In a rematch with Windham the following night, LeDuc won the belt once again. His final reign as Florida Heavyweight Champion was short-lived, however, as the bookers had him drop the belt in a rematch with Windham the next night.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc {{travelled}} to New Zealand {{to wrestle}} in 1981. While there, he was booked in two title reigns. On April 23, {{he won the}} NWA New Zealand British Commonwealth Championship by defeating Steve Rickard. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> belt to Mark Lewin one week later but regained it in a rematch on July 9. His second and final reign {{came to an end}} when he lost the belt to Rickard in mid-August.|$|E

5|$|The Beast {{spent part}} of his early career {{competing}} for Stampede Wrestling, where he faced such wrestlers as Stu Hart. He won his first championship there in 1966. He defeated Stampede veteran Dave Ruhl to win the Calgary version of the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship. Later that year, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> title to Ruhl. He gained a different title the following year, however, when he teamed with Bob Sweetan to defeat the Christy Brothers (Bobby and Jerry) for the Calgary version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship on July 12, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> superhero gimmick in 2005, {{and began}} wrestling under his real name. He once again won the Cruiserweight Championship in early 2006, {{and held it}} {{for over a year}}, {{becoming}} the longest reigning Cruiserweight Champion and the longest reigning champion of any kind in SmackDown history. After being out of action for over a year after neck fusion surgery Helms returned to SmackDown in September 2008, referring to himself as Hurricane Helms, before moving to the ECW brand where he reverted to his Gregory Helms name, and became the backstage interviewer. In mid-2009, he brought back The Hurricane character, and appeared as both Gregory Helms and The Hurricane on the ECW brand. After the ECW brand ended, Helms was released by WWE on February 26, 2010, and returned to the independent circuit.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{continued}} his fantastic first-half performance on Fresno State's next drive, forcing running back Robbie Rouse to fumble. It was recovered by safety Taylor Reed. Hover kicked a 48-yard field goal {{to make the}} score 22-0. Fresno State finally started {{to put together a}} solid drive {{at the end of the}} half including three consecutive first-down passes from Carr to Isaiah Burse for 16 yards, Greg Watson for 12 yards, and Davante Adams for 33 yards respectively that set up first and goal at the three-yard line with 0:39 remaining in the half. The Bulldogs failed to execute, however, and ended the half without scoring at all. The final play of the half was a pass to tight end Marcel Jensen in the end zone, but <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> ball, thus ending the scoring threat.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, The Beast {{became the}} first holder of the IW North American Heavyweight Championship. On August 5, he gained a second title when he teamed with his brother Rudy Kay to defeat The Fabulous Kangaroos (Al Costello and Don Kent) to win the ESA International Tag Team Championship. Three weeks later, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> North American title to The Stomper (Archie Gouldie), who became his {{longtime}} rival. He then began competing for the Amarillo, Texas-based territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He won the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship and held it for several months before losing it in a match against Ricky Romero on February 2, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In the {{run up to}} the 1911 Varsity Match, the Poulton–Geen {{partnership}} was {{a constant}} threat to opposition teams. Ten days before the Varsity Match, Oxford beat London Scottish 39–3. Twice Poulton put Geen in the clear, with the latter ending the day with four tries in total. On 12 December, Cambridge were favourites to win but Poulton captained Oxford to victory, {{in front of a}} crowd of 10,000. Geen's form coming into the game was suspect but he proved his worth. However, Poulton suffered a hamstring injury early on and his replacement Eric Thomas, a forward, lacked the speed and skills to combine effectively with Geen. Nevertheless, he came close to scoring, but, as he had done in the previous year's match, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> ball over the tryline. He was to repeat the error the following year.|$|E

50|$|After {{failing to}} qualify for the 2004 World Championships, Drago entered a decline in snooker. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> out of <b>the</b> top 32 of the rankings a year later, and, after losing to Issara Kachaiwong in his opening {{qualifier}} for the 2008 World Championship, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> off <b>the</b> tour.|$|R
5|$|LeDuc's {{next stop}} was in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), where he resumed teaming with Paul LeDuc. Wrestling {{under the name}} The Canadian Lumberjacks, they were soon pushed to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in December 1973 by {{defeating}} Dusty Rhodes and Dick Slater. They defended the belts for two months before dropping them to Slater and his new partner Stan Vachon, a kayfabe brother of the Vachons from Montreal. This was the final time the LeDuc's held a title together, as Paul LeDuc sustained a legitimate injury that forced Jos to wrestle without him. Jos LeDuc also wrestled as a singles competitor in Florida. He was booked to win the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating Rhodes in late 1973. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> title to Rhodes in January 1974, however. LeDuc and Rhodes were placed in a heated feud at this time, and they frequently faced each other in Death matches.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2008, Matthews {{returned}} to ROH as {{the newest member of}} The Age of the Fall (AotF), where he partnered with Jimmy Jacobs in a losing effort against Roderick Strong and Rocky Romero of the No Remorse Corps. The following night, Matthews lost to Mark Briscoe. Matthews was mainly utilized in a tag team {{role as a}} member of the AotF, teaming with fellow faction members Tyler Black and Necro Butcher. During this time, he continued to work for other promotions, and on March 12, at an OVW television taping, he defeated Jamin Olivencia to win the OVW Television Championship. After successful defenses against Olivencia, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> title to Tommy McNailer a month later on April 16. He continued to wrestle for ROH until Battle For Supremacy in June, when he and Jimmy Jacobs lost to Kevin Steen and El Generico, in what was his last ROH wrestling match.|$|E
5|$|Once Edward's {{force had}} {{gathered}} sufficient strength, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> ruse and headed south towards London. Fighting off Exeter's and Oxford's attacks, he besieged Warwick at Coventry, hoping {{to engage the}} earl in battle. Although Warwick's force had more men than Edward's army, the earl refused the challenge. He {{was waiting for the}} arrival of Clarence, who wanted to use their combined strength to overwhelm the Yorkists. When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwick's surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-law's treachery, Warwick refused to speak to Clarence. Unable to fight the earl at this time, Edward turned again towards London.|$|E
5000|$|Griffiths {{passed the}} 11-plus and {{attended}} Greenhill Grammar School, {{where he met}} English literature teacher Evelyn Ward, who recognised his writing and acting talent.

5|$|During this time, Juggernaut also competed as a singles wrestler. On September 12, 1999, he {{defeated}} Michelle Starr {{to win the}} NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. The following month, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> belt to Johnny Canuck in a three way match. He {{regained the}} belt in a rematch but was stripped of the title in December. A tournament was held for the vacant championship, which Juggernaut won to regain the title. He then became involved in a feud with Kurrgan, and the two traded the belt back and forth. Kurrgan beat Juggernaut for the title on February 25, 2000, but Juggernaut won it back two months later. He held the belt for a day before dropping it back to Kurrgan. When Kurrgan was stripped of the title for being unable to compete at a show in July, Juggernaut won the vacant championship by defeating Leatherface (Rick Patterson). At Juggernaut's request, the match was a {{two out of three}} falls tables match. During the match, he was legitimately unable to move for several minutes and suffered memory loss after Leatherface hit him with a chair.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, Raw was {{transferred}} to Egypt and undertook an operational conversion course that prepared him to fly Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in combat. In July that year he was posted to No. 178 Squadron RAF, a British B-24 Liberator unit based near Foggia in southern Italy. While serving with this squadron, Raw took part in operations in the eastern Mediterranean region as well as Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia. During August 1944 the long-range bomber units controlled by No. 205 Group RAF, including No. 178 Squadron, undertook several risky operations {{as part of the}} Warsaw airlift to supply the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising. Raw participated in three of these flights. His bomber was the only aircraft to deliver its cargo to Warsaw during a mission on 16August; Raw subsequently received the Polish Cross of Valour in February 1945 for this achievement. One of his other flights to Warsaw was conducted on 1September, but due to bad weather Raw was unable to see the city at the time <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> load of supplies.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E

5|$|Martin Varno's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Cormans {{eventually}} led him to take them into formal arbitration proceedings. Although Varno was {{not a member of}} the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans in the past, but were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for not paying him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the cutting room. Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many of their future films if <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> matter, but Varno refused.|$|E
