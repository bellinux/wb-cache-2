On the rocket at the left, the nozzle has been deflected to the left and the thrust line is now inclined to the rocket center line at an angle called the <b>gimbal</b> <b>angle.</b> Since the thrust no longer passes through the center of gravity, a torque is generated about the center of gravity and the nose of the rocket turns to the left.

In this paper, after discussing the gimbal thruster’s structure and its benefits, several configurations based on 2, 3 and 4 gimbal thrusters are investigated in order to identify the most suitable orientation that consume less fuel and raise reliability. Then, a 3 -axis attitude controller based on proportional-derivative control law is applied to satellite dynamics under these configurations.
