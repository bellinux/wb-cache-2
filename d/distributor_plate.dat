Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum remelt furnace, the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig. Before entering the FBWHRS, the flue gases were diluted to 1100 ?F to protect the fluidized bed <b>distributor</b> <b>plate.</b> In a second project, this FBWHRS concept was further developed by replacing the metallic <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> with a Ceramic Tubular <b>Distributor</b> <b>Plate</b> (CTDP), a closely spaced row of alumina rods. The ceramic unit permitted energy from flue gases to be recovered without diluting gases. Elimination of the air diluent system reduced the FBHX fluidized bed volume by 70 % and increased heat recovery by 30 %. Both systems offer several advantages. The fluidized bed particles enhance heat transfer and continually clean the finned tubes in the fluidized beds. Also, only the <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> is exposed to the hot fouling and corrosive flue gases since the fluidized bed quickly cools these gases to a uniform 500 ?F...|$|E

Tested distributor types were perforated perspex plates, with six different perforation grids, metallic mesh and porous ceramic, with pressures drops ranging from 0. 05 to 350 kPa, corresponding to superficial air velocities from 0. 1 to 2. 3 m s- 1. Group B silica ballotini, within the range 0. 355 - 0. 425 mm, were used as bed material.

40|$|Polymer {{exchange}} membrane (PEM) {{fuel cells}} are considered promising power sources, {{with a vast}} application domain that includes consumer electronics, automotive and residential applications. As the technology matures, durability, reliability and cost are amongst the most critical issues, so creating {{the need for a}} more comprehensive knowledge of material’s ageing mechanism. In this work, the Membrane-Electrode Assembly, MEA, is considered a key component subject to material’s ageing with considerable impact on fuel cell performance. As it contains the polymer electrolyte membrane, the active catalysts and the gas diffusion layers (GDL), the mechanisms of degradation are complex. Furthermore, performance is also link to components such as gas <b>distributor</b> <b>plates,</b> since the used design and flow channels dimensions (channel width, channel depth, rib width) allow minimization of the diffusion pathway for gases. Effective oxidant supply and water management is greatly affected by cell geometry and materials. In-situ and ex-situ evaluation of MEA degradation were conducted after fuel cell ageing in extreme testing conditions. Humidified and dry gas feeds were also examined and the effect on cell performance and membrane conductivity examined. Variations of membrane conductivity with temperature and water content were considered critical: drying during operation as a result of dragging of water by protons or over saturated conditions cause condensation at the electrodes causing flooding with the consequent voltage degradation. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was found instrumental in the identification of flooding conditions using an equivalent circuit to model the interfaces at critical current densities, according to the location of identified irreversibility’s in the voltage-current domain of the fuel cell. Electrocatalyst surface area loss due to growth of catalyst particle size and particle agglomeration with the number of load cycles is suggested when using cyclic voltammetry of electrodes, this is thought to be due to a mechanism involving catalyst dissolution/precipitation. Cross sections of the membrane catalyst layers and GDLμs were examined under a FEG-SEM indicating that cathode thickness is considerably reduced as a result of ageing. Catalyst particles were found to migrate outwards and located on carbon backings. Fluoride release was considered as an early predictor of membrane degradation, quantified using an ion selective at gases outlet. MEA degradation mechanisms are discussed together with contributions that might aid design and operating strategies in PEM fuel Cells...|$|R

Comparison is established for the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent regime, Uc, deduced from the pressure fluctuations in the bed using gauge pressure measurements. The effect of the distributor on the flow structure near the bottom region of the bed is studied using differential and gauge pressure transducers located at different axial positions along the bed. The radial voidage profile in the bed is also measured using optical fiber probes, which provide local measurements of the voidage at different heights above the distributor. The <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> has a significant effect on the bed hydrodynamics.

Wheat straw residue gasification has the capability of replacing 7. 5 % (0. 62 EJ) of Canadaâs annual fossil fuel consumption.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of sand particle size, <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> shape and angle, bed height and fluidizing velocity on particle mixing and residence time in the fluidized bed reactor. Greater values of the residence time were obtained with course sand whereas lower values were obtained with fine sand. An in-crease in the angle of convex or a decrease in the angle of a concave of the <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> resulted in an increase in the residence time. Both the concave and convex distributor plates achieved vertical upward and downward movements of the bed material resulting in continuous bed material turnover and, thus, good mixing. However, the concave plate achieved longer residence time which will result in better conversion efficiency. To improve the mixing properties of the binary mixture, which has great tendency for segregation due to density differences, an angled <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> (concave or convex) should be used. Considerable increases in the residence time were recorded with increases in the bed height. Increasing the fluidizing velocity decreased the residence time due to the increase in the bubble velocity.

The dispersion coefficient was obtained by adjusting the experimental profiles of tracer concentration with the predictions of the model. The measured axial dispersion coefficients (DRax,LR) were generally consistent with the predictions of the well established correlations, thus validating the complete dispersion model used in the analysis. The DRax,LR values ranged from 110 to 200 cm P 2 P/s. There was evidence that the existing literature data on DRax,LR in bubble columns are slightly underestimated, as consistent underestimation {{was found to be}} a characteristic of the widely used dispersion model that disregards radial dispersion. The value of the radial dispersion coefficient was typically about 1 to 2 % of the DRax,LR value under any given condition. The mixing time data were generally consistent with the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the distributor configuration on interphase mass transfer, gas axial dispersion and bubble size was studied in a 2 -D fluidised bed reactor for two types of distributor configurations; a novel multi-vortex (MV) distributor with tuyéres directed vertically and horizontally at different heights and a standard perforated <b>plate</b> <b>distributor</b> (baseline). The linear inlet velocity (U 0) ranged between 0. 1 m/s and 0. 35 m/s, with air as fluidising medium at ambient conditions. The ozone decomposition reaction over Fe 2 O 3 impregnated FCC catalyst {{was used as an}} indirect measure of the performance of the FBR and {{it was found that the}} MV distributor causes a significant improvement (15 % average) in the conversion efficiencies at all velocities tested. Bubble size measurements (using two separate techniques) indicated larger bubbles for the MV distributor, while the visual bubbling to turbulent transition boundary (Uc) for the MV distributor was found to be lower than the baseline distributor. The interphase bubble-emulsion mass transfer was quantified using the model derived by Thompson et al. (1999) and was found to be 52 % higher for the MV distributor than the baseline distributor. In addition the MV distributor exhibited near plug flow characteristics at velocities exceeding Uc, while this was not the case for the baseline distributor. The THRIP for the financial support.
