40|$|Most <b>digital</b> <b>documents</b> {{within an}} {{enterprise}} reside outside traditional databases. Search engines {{have been used}} to retrieve these <b>digital</b> <b>documents</b> but the results are often unsatisfactory. Digital libraries yield search results with greater precision than general search engines and are capable of compartmentalizing a wide variety of <b>digital</b> <b>documents.</b> However, <b>digital</b> libraries cannot subtly control application-specific document retrievals because they lack a formal model for recognizing the intrinsic relationships among <b>digital</b> <b>documents.</b> This research proposes a formal model, the Entity-Oriented Enterprise Documentation Model (EOEDM), to facilitate document retrievals for enterprise applications. This EOEDM is a meta-level modeling schema, exploiting the entity-relationship model in database design as well as the object model in application design. Since enterprise documents usually result from business activities, the proposed model targets the enterprise documentation needs and relies on the patterns of business activities to associate and locate <b>digital</b> <b>documents</b> with higher precision and better recall...|$|R

This paper addresses the problem of maintaining long-term access to <b>digital</b> <b>documents</b> and provides a methodology for overcoming access difficulties due to technological obsolescence. The result of this effort led to the creation of a model, which we call the Digital Rosetta Stone that provides a methodology for maintaining long-term access to <b>digital</b> <b>documents.</b> The underlying principle of the model is that knowledge preserved about different storage devices and file formats can be used to recover data from obsolete media and to reconstruct the <b>digital</b> <b>documents.</b> The <b>Digital</b> Rosetta Stone model describes three processes that are necessary for maintaining long-term access to <b>digital</b> <b>documents</b> in their native formats [...] knowledge preservation, data recovery, and document reconstruction.

50|$|For digital {{signatures}} all of thischanges. Documents are immaterial {{because the}} information is represented by logical bits that can bestored on, and copied to, any suitable electronic medium, and they only become meaningful to humanswhen represented through an analogue physical medium such as a computer screen or a printout. Thevalidity of a <b>digital</b> <b>document</b> is authenticated by verifying that the digital signature logicallymatches the bit string representation of the document. Because a <b>digital</b> <b>document</b> in its bit string form can not beobserved or interpreted directly by the signer, the digital signature should only serve {{as evidence of the}} signer’s agreementto the high level semantic interpretation of the document, although technically speaking it represents thesigner’s agreement to the bit string document itself. For human signers, digital signatures should in fact be interpreted as an agreement to the analogue representation of documents e.g. on a computer screen. Highly complex instruments are now needed notonly for interpreting the document but also for producing the digital signature. The complexity of the instruments needed to interpret and visualize the <b>digital</b> <b>document</b> determines the semantic distance between its bit sting representation and its semantic interpretation.|$|E

Based on these requirements, we built a prototype media bridging tool called PaperSpace that uses computer vision to link paper and <b>digital</b> <b>documents.</b> The system also tracks piles of paper documents on the real desktop, and links those papers to <b>digital</b> <b>documents</b> stored in the computer. <b>Digital</b> <b>documents</b> can be sorted and grouped according to the physical layout of the corresponding papers on the desk. The system automatically creates <b>digital</b> piles of <b>documents</b> in a simulated desktop that reflect the paper piles on the real desktop.
