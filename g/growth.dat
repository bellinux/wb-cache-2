5|$|Ampelosaurus {{seems to}} {{have grown in a}} way similar to more basal sauropods. After a certain point in its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone <b>growth</b> and a decrease in <b>growth</b> rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of <b>growth</b> after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast <b>growth.</b> <b>Growth</b> marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack of <b>growth</b> marks is suggestive of fast and continuous <b>growth</b> in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast <b>growth.</b> Ampelosaurus does not show <b>growth</b> marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced <b>growth</b> rate and high level of bone <b>growth</b> seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence of <b>growth</b> marks.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial <b>growth</b> follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows <b>growth,</b> the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of <b>growth</b> is the lag phase, a period of slow <b>growth</b> when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast <b>growth.</b> The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid <b>growth</b> are produced. The second phase of <b>growth</b> is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential <b>growth.</b> The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the <b>growth</b> rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting <b>growth.</b> The third phase of <b>growth</b> is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid <b>growth</b> to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

5|$|<b>Growth</b> {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average <b>growth</b> rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the <b>growth</b> rate of alligators. <b>Growth</b> in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate <b>growth,</b> meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical {{relationships in the}} spiral <b>growth</b> patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral <b>growth</b> patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} <b>growth</b> and life history of tyrannosaurids.

Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous <b>growth</b> spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid <b>growth</b> phase ended with sexual maturity, <b>growth</b> slowed down considerably in adult animals.

50|$|Based {{entirely on}} the level of prices, with the {{criteria}} of wines to be from the Left Bank (including Pessac-Leognan) and be produced in quantities of more than 2,000 cases, and not taking into account any second wines, the Liv-ex classification lists 60 estates, one fewer than that of 1855. The tiers were sectioned by the First <b>Growths</b> in the range of £2,000 a case and above, the Second <b>Growths</b> from £500 to £2,000, the Third <b>Growths</b> from £300 to £500, the Fourth <b>Growths</b> from £250 to £300 and the Fifth <b>Growths</b> from £200 to £250.

Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, Daspletosaurus showed a faster <b>growth</b> rate during the rapid <b>growth</b> period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum <b>growth</b> rate in Daspletosaurus was 180kilograms (400lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of 1800kilograms (2tons) in adults. Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for Daspletosaurus; this would change {{the magnitude of the}} <b>growth</b> rate but not the overall pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{village has}} {{experienced}} significant population <b>growth,</b> {{with it and}} neighboring communities undergoing more rapid <b>growth</b> than Westchester County overall.

5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of <b>growth.</b> He analyses <b>growth</b> curves for man, noting rapid <b>growth</b> before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, <b>growth</b> is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree <b>growth</b> varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
50|$|The only visible sign of {{cutaneous}} fibroma in {{white-tailed deer}} are fleshy wart-like <b>growths</b> on the skin, which are likely caused by biting insects. These <b>growths</b> {{can vary from}} individual <b>growths</b> to clusters of warts. These warts can also vary in size from small to very large. Because these <b>growths</b> are only attached to the skin, not to the underlying muscle and bone, they actually have no physical effects on the deer itself. These tumors or warts may however impair the ability to see, eat, or run if they are large enough to inhibit normal behavior. Deer with these <b>growths</b> can still be in perfect health and will show no symptoms of ill health.|$|R
50|$|Gallbladder polyps are <b>growths</b> or lesions {{resembling}} <b>growths</b> (polypoid lesions) in {{the wall}} of the gallbladder.

40|$|Small benign papillomas {{were found}} {{several years ago}} on the tongue of a {{domestic}} rabbit with induced vitamin A deficiency (1), and investigation disclosed that similar <b>growths</b> are frequent on the oral mucous membranes of "normal " domestic rabbits. These naturally occurring <b>growths</b> have proved due to a filtrable virus, hitherto unrecognized, with which the lesions can be reproduced both in the domestic rabbit and in several species of wild hares (2). The natural and experimental <b>growths</b> are described in the present report, along with some of the properties of the virus responsible for them. Observations and experiments are also recorded which throw light on the transmission of the virus under natural conditions and upon certain factors that condition its effectiveness.

40|$|Endometriosis (ENDO) is a {{disorder}} in which vascularized <b>growths</b> of endometrial tissue occur outside the uterus. Its symptoms include reduced fertility and severe pelvic pain. Mechanisms that maintain the ectopic <b>growths</b> and evoke symptoms are poorly understood. One factor not yet considered {{is that the}} ectopic <b>growths</b> develop their own innervation. Here, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>growths</b> develop both an autonomic and a sensory innervation. We used a rat model of surgically induced ENDO whose <b>growths</b> mimic those in women. Furthermore, similar to women with ENDO, such rats exhibit reduced fertility and increased pelvic nociception. The ENDO was induced by autotransplanting, on mesenteric cascade arteries, small pieces of uterus that formed vascularized cysts. The cysts and healthy uterus were harvested from proestrous rats and immunostained using the pan-neuronal marker PGP 9. 5 and specific markers for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (sensory C and Aδ fibers), substance P (SP) (sensory C and Aδ fibers) and vesicular monoamine transporter (sympathetic fibers). Cysts (like the uterus) were robustly innervated, with many PGP 9. 5 -stained neurites accompanying blood vessels and extending into nearby luminal epithelial layers. CGRP-, SP-, and vesicular monoamine transporter-immunostained neurites also were observed, with CGRP and SP neurites extending the furthest into the cyst lining. These results demonstrate that ectopic endometrial <b>growths</b> develop an autonomic and sensory innervation. This innervation could contribute not only to symptoms associated with ENDO but also to maintenance of the ectopic <b>growths...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner {{proposed}} {{a formula for}} population <b>growth</b> which represented hyperbolic <b>growth</b> with an infinite population in 2025. The hyperbolic <b>growth</b> of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic <b>growth</b> and technological development. This feedback {{can be described as}} follows: technological advance → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic <b>growth</b> → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating <b>growth</b> of the carrying capacity → faster population <b>growth</b> → accelerating <b>growth</b> of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence, the faster <b>growth</b> of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on. The transition from hyperbolic <b>growth</b> to slower rates of <b>growth</b> is related to the demographic transition.|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{the fish}} {{experiences}} {{a period of}} rapid <b>growth,</b> often in summer, and one of slower <b>growth,</b> normally in winter.
