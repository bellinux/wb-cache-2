40|$|A {{vertical}} dropped-weight {{impact test}} machine has a dropped-weight barrel vertically supported on {{upper and lower}} support brackets. The dropped-weight barrel is chambered to receive a dropped-weight assembly having a latch pin at its upper end, a damping unit in the middle, and a tup at its lower end. The tup is adapted for gathering data during impact testing. The latch pin releasably engages a latch pin <b>coupling</b> <b>assembly.</b> The latch pin <b>coupling</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is attached to a}} winch via a halyard for raising and lowering the dropped-weight assembly. The lower end of the dropped-weight barrel is provided with a bounce-back arresting mechanism which is activated by the descending passage of the dropped-weight assembly. After striking the specimen, the dropped-weight assembly rebounds vertically and is caught by the bounce-back arresting mechanism. The damping unit of the dropped-weight assembly serves to dissipate energy from the rebounding dropped-weight assembly and prevents the dropped-weight assembly from rebounding from the self-arresting mechanism...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 33 - 48 The {{successful}} {{application of}} synchronous motors requires special design consideration {{to account for}} their speed-dependent characteristics, such as the large oscillating torque levels that occur during startup. This paper focuses on the torsional design and analysis process associated with revamping a 7000 hp synchronous motor-driven compressor train with an 8000 hp synchronous motor driver. Torsional analyses indicated that the replacement motor?s startup torque would produce unacceptable levels of torsional vibration. An accurate overtorque protection slip clutch was integrated into the low-speed <b>coupling</b> <b>assembly</b> to limit startup peak torque to about three times the normal operating torques. The paper details multiple issues associated with revamping the compressor drive train, including {{the selection of the}} replacement driver and low-speed <b>coupling</b> <b>assembly,</b> torsional vibration analysis, and the mechanical operation of the controlled slip clutch mechanism. The paper also presents the acquired torsional field measurements that were used to confirm the clutch?s operation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{dynamics}} of externally driven open quantum systems. Using the path integral methods we found an analytical expression for time-dependent density matrix of two externally <b>driven</b> <b>coupled</b> quantum oscillators interacting with different baths of oscillators. It is shown that at the zeroing of external forces the density matrix becomes identical to the previously obtained one for freely developing coupled oscillators. Mean values of observables are computed by using the Hermitian part of the matrix. All elements of the covariance matrix composed by coordinates and momenta of two <b>driven</b> <b>coupled</b> oscillators are calculated. The time-dependent mean values, dispersions and covariances of coordinates of coupled oscillators at given external forces are numerically studied. It is shown that the larger the coupling constant the larger is the disturbances of the second oscillator due to external action on the first oscillator. Coupled dynamics of forced oscillators at relatively large coupling constant is demonstrated at different thermodynamic conditions. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) <b>drive</b> sleeve, (b) <b>coupling</b> sleeve, (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves. The mode of failure in the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves. Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves, however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves, it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between <b>drive</b> and <b>coupling</b> sleeves...|$|R
