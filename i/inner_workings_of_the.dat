5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. Falling out of favour with Bormann meant that access to Hitler was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to control access to Hitler, this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise the <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Reich.|$|E

5|$|During {{the earlier}} {{years of his}} {{presidency}} at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new hardware was being announced, in order {{to spend more time}} programming. However, his attitude towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo's public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo's employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September2006, stemmed from Iwata's background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of the <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|E

According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury.

Inspired by models widely used across the gaming industry, the proposed framework named A. G.

These are all linked to each other by the game's own rules and goals to form a cohesive unit that can help in exposing <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> any game. <b>The</b> model is then elaborated further into a regular grammar {{to provide a more}} formal and rigorous justification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed framework and overall approach...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design and}} implementation of a uniform graphical user interface for image matching algorithms or packages. The program is called "Automated Image Matching" or AIM for short. The reasons for the decision to develop this program are described. Furthermore an introduction into image modalities and image matching in general is given. A design with user recommendations and requirements is given. The implementation is discussed in detail and a comparison is made between the actual implemented features and the design requirements. As appendices the user and technical manuals are also included. The user manual describes the way the program should be used and the technical manual describes the implementation in detail, sometimes even to the code level. The user manual is meant for actual users and the technical manual is mainly meant for people who wish to continue development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program or {{who want to know}} more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> AIM. <b>The</b> implementation described here supports two matching packages, Automated Image Registration (AIR) by Roger P.
