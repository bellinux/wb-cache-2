50|$|Typically {{used for}} {{production}} boats {{because of its}} ability to reuse a female mold as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of balsa, foam or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mold, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mold, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand (<b>hand-lay-up</b> method). Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mold by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multiude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} the experimental mechanical characterisation {{of a natural}} flax fibre reinforced epoxy polymer composite. A commercial plain woven quasi-unidirectional flax fabric with spun-twisted yarns is employed in particular, as well as unidirectional composite panels manufactured with three techniques: <b>hand-lay-up,</b> vacuum bagging and resin infusion. The stiffness and strength behaviours are investigated under both monotonic and low-cycle fatigue loadings. The analysed material has, in particular, shown a typical bilinear behaviour under pure traction, with a knee yield point occurring at a rather low stress value, after which the material tensile stiffness is significantly reduced. In the present work, such a mechanism is investigated by a phenomenological approach, performing periodical loading/unloading cycles, and repeating tensile tests on previously “yielded” samples to assess the evolution of stiffness behaviour. Infrared thermography is also employed to measure the temperature of specimens during monotonic and cyclic loading.

Hence, the present work aims to explore {{the possibility of using}} this natural fibre to reinforce polyester and thus opens a new way to implement locally available inexpensive fibres and produce a new candidate tribo-material for bearing applications. Sugarcane fibre/polyester (SCRP) and glass fibre/polyester (GRP) composites (with chopped fibres of 1, 5, 10 mm length randomly distributed and unidirectional mat fibres) were prepared using compression mould and <b>hand-lay-up</b> techniques. Friction coefficients and wear rates of SCRP and GRP composites were determined under dry sliding contact conditions in parallel and anti-parallel orientations and subjected to different operating parameters such as load, speed and test duration. Results of friction and wear proved that SCRP composite is a promising composite which can be a competitive to GRP composite. In the case of chopped sugarcane/polyester (C-SCRP) composite, very smooth patches of polymer film (protective layer) due to plastic deformation shielded the surface of C-SCRP composite pin from damage by the metallic asperities and thereby contributed to the higher wear resistance. Furthermore, this layer provided enhancement to the bonding of SCFs fibre with matrix. In contrast C-GRP composite produced broken hard particles of GF at the interface which acted as a third body and restrained the formation of such protective layer.

The composites of pine wood dust particles of 150 micron size have been prepared by using <b>hand-lay-up</b> technique. The experimental {{results show that the}} incorporation of pine wood dust results in reduction of thermal conductivity of epoxy resin and there by improves its thermal insulation capability. From the experiments it is also observed that the composite with 35. 9 % volume fraction of pine wood dust exhibited lowest thermal conductivity i. e 0. 246 W/m- 0 K on comparison to 6. 5 %, 11. 3 % and 26. 8 % volume fractions.

40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{performance}} of a new class of glass micro-sphere based coatings and glass micro-sphere filled polymer composites with emphasis on the general trends observed in their properties and erosion wear behavior. A wealth of property data has been generated by conducting various tests under controlled laboratory conditions and the analysis of the test results is presented in the thesis. The quality of coating in terms of mechanical, micro-structural and functional characteristics depends on a large number of variables that include both materials as well as operational parameters. While the composition of coating material and the substrate {{play an important role in}} determining the coating quality, the influence of plasma torch input power is also equally important; this is reflected in the research findings of the present investigation. This work suggests that glass micro-spheres are coatable and deposition of such coatings on metallic substrates using plasma spraying route is possible. The variations of different coating characteristics such as coating adhesion strength,deposition efficiency, coating thickness and micro-hardness with the plasma torch input power are evident in the illustrations presented in this thesis. These coatings possess desirable characteristics such as good adhesion strength, hardness etc. Pre-mixing of micro-sized Al 2 O 3 or TiO 2 particles improves the coatability of glass micro-spheres. Such coatings also exhibit improved interfacial adhesion strength. The strength is greatly affected by the plasma torch input power. Glass micro-sphere possesses ample reinforcing potential to be used as a functional filler in both thermoset and thermoplastic polymers.

The burner rig is a low cost device which enables a 100 mm square specimen {{to be subjected to}} a near uniform heat flux over its surface. The small-scale tests were conducted to measure the thermal conductivities of woven roven (WR) glass fiber mats with a weight of 0. 13 kg and 11. 8 mm thickness at high temperatures up to 800 °C. An empirical equation was derived for calculating the variation in thermal conductivity of the dry glass fiber mats. A series of fire resistance tests on composite laminates was carried out using a small scale furnace. During the tests the samples were that prepared and laminated using <b>hand-lay-up</b> techniques were exposed to fire conditions defined by a furnace temperature versus time curve. Excellent fire resistance under hydrocarbon curve test conditions was demonstrated for several matrix materials (i. e. isophthalic polyester, orthophthalic polyester, vinyl ester). This information was important for the marine sector and companies such as Devonport group (DML) and Vosper Thorneycroft (VT) to determine if materials could perform to the A 60 requirements. The A 60 requirements for fire resisting structural are refer to the subject the material to 60 minutes fire testing under the SOLAS temperature/time regime. This then press the material for CFRP pipe repair and metal vessels in petroleum and transportation industries. The experimental results from tests using the small scale furnace were compared with predictions of thermal responses of composite panels in fires using an existing theoretical model. The ID FD model is capable of modelling the thermal response behaviour of polyester/WR and vinyl ester/WR laminates subject to fire for small scale heat sources.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis broadly consists of four parts: the first part has provided the {{detailed description of the}} materials used and experiments conducted during the research. The second part presents the characteristics of the epoxy composi tes reinforced with short palmyra fibers (SPF) in regard to their physical and mechanical properties like density, void fraction, tensile, flexural strength and micro-structural features. The third part of this thesis reports on the sliding wear performance of these epoxy-SPF composites under different test conditions. An empirical correlation has been proposed for estimating the specific wear rate. The last part of the thesis reports on the thermal and acoustic behavior of the epoxy-SPF composite samples under this study. The effects of increasing the SPF content on the thermal conductivity of the samples are studied. Further, its impact on the sound absorbing characteristics has also been discussed in detail in this part. Usually a new composite material’s performance is often determined by its response under various mechanical, physical, tribological and thermal conditions as it gets very much essential for selecting materials of appropriate composition for application in a particular area. Hence, in the current investigation, an abundance of property information has been provided for a set of epoxy-SPF composites by processing them through <b>hand-lay-up</b> technique and by carrying out various physical, mechanical, tribological, acoustic and thermal tests on them under controlled laboratory conditions. It is observed that by reinforcing short palmyra fibers into the neat epoxy resin, its effects, as desired are achieved in the form of enhanced mechanical, physical, tribological, thermal and acoustic properties. When the concentration of SPF in the neat epoxy is increased, the specific wear rate decreased gradually {{and at the same time}} a reduction in the effective thermal conductivity is also observed as palmyra fiber is insulative in nature. This is accompanied by increase in both tensile and flexural strength. Further, the sound absorption coefficient also increased by a huge margin as the SPF concentration in the neat epoxy increased. The effects of SPF content on the coefficient of thermal expansion and glass transition temperature of the composites are also found to be significant. With a moderate strength, decreased wear rate, high coefficient of sound absorption and lowered thermal conductivity, these epoxy-SPF composites can be successfully used for applications such as building insulation material, food containers, interior of automobiles, interior wall of halls where sound absorption in required, thermos flasks, packaging industries, rollers of conveyor belts, brake pads, etc...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of industrial {{products in the}} fields of traffic technology, mechanical engineering, etc. requires higher efficiency of materials and structures. Thus, lightweight design has become very important, mainly for reducing the effects of accelerated mass. New materials like high-performance fiber composites not only find application in aerospace technology, but are also gaining importance in terrestrial areas. Considering the excellent properties of weight, Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) offer a variety of advantages in comparison with usual materials like steel, titan, or aluminum. On the other hand there are problems concerning the vibrational sensitivity due to low mass, tendency to buckling, and susceptibility to damage. A promising way to solve these problems is the integration of multifunctional materials such as piezoelectrics, Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), etc. Arising deformations, accelerations, or other physical measurements can be detected by sensors, technically processed, and eliminated with suitable real-time controlled actuators. To handle multifunctional material in different applications statements regarding the compatibility, the degree of efficiency and the overall electromechanical behavior of the material are important. Composite materials offer the unique chance to integrate multifunctional elements during the manufacturing process. The multifunctional elements {{become a part of the}} material itself. Besides the load-carrying function the integration of sensors and actuators within the composites forms a material which is able to detect and specifically influence its own loads, vibrations, or deformations. Because of some excellent properties (low energy consumption in quasi static applications, high efficiency, fast response, etc.) piezoelectric materials are in the center of interest. Usually thin monolithic piezoceramic wafers are used as structural actuators for active composites. To improve the mechanical and electrical performance it is often advantageous to pre-encapsulate the piezoceramic (e. g. in a polymer matrix). With this additional step the piezoceramic can be provided with a mechanical pre-compression, electrical insulation and mechanical stabilization. More recently active composites with piezoceramic fibers came into focus. These fibers (Æ 10 - 30 µm) are processed in form of patches with uniaxially aligned piezoceramic fibers embedded in a polymer matrix excited by interdigitated surface electrodes. With the use of the longitudinal piezoelectric effect and their excellent suitability for integration in curved structures piezoceramic fibers offer a number of advantages. Unfortunately these fibers are not yet available on a large scale. As there has been extensive work in the field of integration of thin lead zirconate-titanate piezo-ceramic (PZT) wafers (50 x 30 x 0. 2 mm) into CFRP at the Institute of Structural Mechanics, DLR-Braunschweig, this will be focused on in the following. Provided with uniformly electroded surfaces these wafers operating in the lateral, d 31, mode. Fig. 1 shows the principle design of some active composites. In Fig. 1 a the ceramic wafer is embedded between thin non-conductive fiber material (e. g. glass- or polyester fiber) which serve asinsulation. The load carrying CFRP-layers above and below the ceramic are used to electrically contact the piezoceramic, therefore the insulation layers are required to avoid short circuits. As the usual disturbing wires are not needed, the manufacture of the active composite has become easier and there is no additional weakening of the structure. In case of a break the piezoceramic will still work, as the broken pieces stay in the electrical field where they can be controlled. The tube in fig 1. b has the same lay-up with piezoceramic elements in each side of the tube. This structure is able to compensate deformations under thermal loads. In structures with arbitrary distributed ceramics carbon fiber bundles are used as a structural conformable way to contact the piezoceramic. Fig 1. c shows a beam structure with two piezo-ceramics. Each electrode in the active beam is contacted separately. In this way it can be used as strain actuator as well as a bimorph. Fig. 2 shows the operating diagram of the beam structure for both cases. Significant differences between mechanical and thermal properties of the ceramic plates as well as the extreme brittleness of the piezoceramic material demand sophisticated manufacturing techniques. Several manufacturing techniques have been used at the DLR including <b>hand-lay-up</b> and filament winding technique. Very good experience has been made with a sophisticated RTM technology, the so-called DP-RTM (Differential Pressure  Resin Transfer Moulding). This guarantees an extreme high quality and reproducibility of the components. The fiber material is laid out in dry state which facilitates the positioning of the electric cables and ceramics. The DP-RTM procedure becomes especially interesting as it is not necessary to provide massive moulds since the clamping forces in the autoclave are created by the differential pressure. Thus, a simple sheet plate can serve as sub mould while a vacuum foil is applied for the upper mould. Fiber volume content and fluid rate can directly be controlled by adjusting differential pressure during the stages of injection. In order to minimize the weight of the active fiber composite a high fiber volume content is required. This can be achieved by increasing the differential pressure. Simultaneously, the increasing mechanical load on the ceramics has to be considered since it might result in mechanical damage of the brittle actuators. The different process parameters like autoclave pressure, autoclave temperature and differential pressure have been optimized during several test procedures. The new materials and material systems that can be used as multifunctional actuators and sensors with new real-time control concepts and adaptive signal processing, have helped to establish a new class of structures called adaptive structures. The results of recent investigations indicate that these concepts contain very promising potentials for future structural and acoustic purposes. With the research progress and the realization of functional demonstrators as described above by some examples, the intention is now to make this technology available for common industrial applications. To achieve this aim an inter-disciplinary development process (fig. 3) has been established. LEITPROJEKT ADAPTRONIK is the title of a German national model project that will be conducted under the auspices of the Braunschweig-based Institute of Structural Mechanics. A consortium of seven major industry partners comprising five branches and seven medium and small-sized companies as well as further research partners was established as a center for the development of technologies within the model project. Besides many other research topics, the integration and development of piezoceramic plates and new piezoceramic fibers are of major importance within this project...|$|E
