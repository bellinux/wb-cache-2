40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>safety</b> {{design is}} {{important}} to eliminate the loss of property and lives during fire events. Gypsum plasterboard is widely used as a <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>material</b> in the building industry all over the world. It contains gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) and Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) and most importantly free and chemically bound water in its crystal structure. The dehydration of the gypsum and the decomposition of Calcium Carbonate absorb heat, which gives the gypsum plasterboard fire resistant qualities. Currently plasterboard manufacturers use additives such as vermiculite to overcome shrinkage of gypsum core and glass fibre to bridge shrinkage cracks and enhance the integrity of board during calcination and after the loss of paper facings in fires. Past research has also attempted to reduce the thermal conductivity of plasterboards using fillers. However, no research has been undertaken to enhance the specific heat of plasterboard and the points of dehydration using chemical additives and fillers. Hence detailed experimental studies of powdered samples of plasterboard mixed with chemical additives and fillers in varying proportions were conducted. These tests showed the enhancement of specific heat of plasterboard. Numerical models were also developed to investigate the thermal performance of enhanced plasterboards under standard fire conditions. The {{results showed that the}} use of these enhanced plasterboards in steel wall systems can significantly improve their fire performance.

Gypsum plasterboard {{is widely used}} as a <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> <b>material</b> in the building industry. It contains gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) and most importantly free and chemically bound water in its crystal structure. The dehydration of the gypsum and the decomposition of Calcium Carbonate absorb heat, which gives the gypsum plasterboard fire resistant qualities. Recently a new composite panel system was developed, where a thin insulation layer was used externally between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF walls. In this research, finite element thermal models of both the traditional LSF wall panels with cavity insulation and the new LSF composite wall panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic design fire conditions. Suitable thermal properties of gypsum plaster-board, insulation materials and steel were used. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with fire test results. This paper presents {{the details of the}} developed finite element models of non-load bearing LSF wall panels and the thermal analysis results. It has shown that finite element models can be used to simulate the thermal behaviour of LSF walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards.

With the increase in big fires, accidental or non-accidental, people are worrying about the fire behaviour of combustibles. The flammability of textile and clothing materials is a great concern. Appropriate tests should be developed to assess textile and clothing materials to ensure they are safe in a fire. In fact, textile products should satisfy some <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> criteria depending on their uses. There are specified flammability requirements on selected products, though whether these are good enough for assessing modern textile materials should be watched. Typical textile materials with and without fire retardants protection were selected for assessing the fire behaviour with a cone calorimeter. High radiative heat flux up to 70 kWm‒ 2 was applied to assess those selected textile materials.
