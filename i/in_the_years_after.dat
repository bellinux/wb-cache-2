40|$|This paper {{examines}} the direct {{private equity investment}} strategies across sovereign wealth funds {{and their relationship to}} the funds' organizational structures. SWFs seem to engage in a form of trend chasing, since {{they are more likely to}} invest at home when domestic equity prices are higher, and invest abroad when foreign prices are higher. Funds see the industry P/E ratios of their home investments drop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> investment, while they have a positive change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> their investments abroad. SWFs where politicians are involved have a much greater likelihood of investing at home than those where external managers are involved. At the same time, SWFs with external managers tend to invest in lower P/E industries, which see an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> P/E ratios <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> investment. By way of contrast, funds with politicians involved invest in higher P/E industries, which have a negative valuation change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> investment. ...|$|R

5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years of neglect. Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E

5|$|Athens was {{prevented}} from sending more effective aid by events on Euboea in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought {{to unite the}} cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning {{the end of the}} hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. In 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae. The whole Athenian strategy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>after</b> 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea.|$|E
