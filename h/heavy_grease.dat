50|$|Teddy Boy is a {{style of}} haircut. It was popular with mods in England during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Typically the hair was cut {{relatively}} long in comparison to regular styles of that period. It was typically brushed back and <b>heavy</b> <b>grease</b> used.|$|E
50|$|The pin is {{threaded}} and one {{leg of the}} shackle is tapped. The pin may be captive, which means it is mated to the shackle, usually with a wire. The threads may gall if overtightened or have been corroding in salty air, so a liberal coating of lanolin or a <b>heavy</b> <b>grease</b> {{is not out of}} place on any and all threads. A shackle key or metal marlinspike are useful tools for loosening a tight nut.|$|E
50|$|A solvent style parts washer {{is filled}} with several gallons of solvent that is stored in a {{settling}} pan {{at the bottom of}} the washer. A small flame-tight electric liquid pump is immersed in the solvent and skims clean solvent from near the top of the settling tank, and pumps it at low pressure through a stiff flexible nozzle onto a metal grating above the liquid where the metal components rest. Dirt and dissolved <b>heavy</b> <b>greases</b> fall into the bottom and settle to the bottom of the tank.|$|R
50|$|Caster flutter can be {{controlled}} by adding dampers or increasing the friction of the swivel joints. This {{can be accomplished by}} adding washers to the swivel joint. The friction increases as the weight {{on the front of the}} chair increases. Anytime the caster begins to flutter, it slows the chair and shifts weight to the front wheels. There are several online anti-flutter kits for retrofitting wheelchair casters in this manner. Other methods of reducing caster flutter include increasing swivel lead, using <b>heavier</b> <b>grease,</b> reducing the mass of the wheel, or increasing friction with the ground by changing materials.|$|R

50|$|Kossam can be {{the general}} term for both fresh milk miradam and yoghurt known as pendidan in Fulfulde. It is central to Fulbe {{identity}} and revered as a drink or {{in one of its}} various processed forms, such as yoghurt and cheese. Kettugol and lébol are derived from milk fat, are used in light cooking and hair weaving. It is common to see Fulani women hawking milk products in characteristic beautifully decorated calabashes balanced on their heads. Other meals include a <b>heavy</b> <b>grease</b> (nyiiri) made of flour from such grains as millet, sorghum, or corn which is eaten in combination with soup (takai, haako) made from tomatoes, onions, spices, peppers, and other vegetables.|$|E

His voice deepened and he projected the image of a middle-aged tattooed truck driver with a beer belly and a cigar. In reality, Tracht was 6 foot 2 and 120 pounds. He used the radio as an alter ego; a guy with a swaggering bravado. At WENE, he was asked to do remote broadcasts from a sponsor's business and listeners were disappointed to see that he looked like a wimp. [...] In later years, Tracht took up bodybuilding to improve his physique.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} a high {{percentage}} of diseases such as typhoid, cholera, etc, produced by lack of hygiene in restaurant kitchens. This problem occurs because of a bad use of detergent to clean them. For this reason we decided to design a specialized product for the cleaning of industrial kitchens which is focus for those restaurants that are found with the need to provide a service and meals with an excellent hygienic preparation. Thinking not just of the population but also in that restaurant’s owners can buy a product that ensures effective in removing food debris, and also runs the risk of bacteria, the formula that we provide in our product proves effective through its agents, penetrating solvents that facilitate removal of <b>heavy</b> <b>grease</b> and burnt residue that accumulate on the inside and outside of the kitchen leaving the alkali compounds act to solubilize grease and dirt, this product will be marketed by the name of CLEAN SI...|$|E
50|$|Several miles south, on Quitchupah Creek, several {{families}} {{were trying to}} homestead on land that was more barren than Muddy Creek. In the 1870s, Brigham Young called on several families from Sanpete County to settle on Muddy Creek. Most of the first homes on Muddy Creek were called a dugout. It was a room dug {{in the side of}} a hill or the bank of a wash. The front was very crude, sometimes the only door being a blanket hung over the opening, or a rough wooden door, hung with leather hinges. The windows were small openings made in the front wall and covered with <b>heavy</b> <b>greased</b> paper or white canvas. Each had a fireplace in one end, which served for heat, cooking and light. The heat from the fire made the dugout unbearably hot in summer, so then the cooking was done on an open fire outside. The roof of the dugout was made of poles, covered with willows and dirt. These roofs served well in dry weather, as they were warm and kept out the wind. However, they leaked badly in stormy weather. Another great inconvenience of these roofs was {{the fact that they were}} a home for snakes, rats, mice and spiders. The floors were usually dirt or sometimes rock.|$|R
50|$|Light duty {{hard surface}} {{cleaners}} {{are not intended}} to handle <b>heavy</b> dirt and <b>grease.</b> Because these products are expected to clean without rinsing and result in a streak-free shine, they contain no salts. Typical window cleaning items consist of alcohols, either ethanol or isopropanol, and surfactants for dissolving grease. Other components include small amounts of ammonia as well as dyes and perfumes.|$|R
50|$|Cosolvent {{systems are}} used for <b>heavy</b> oils, waxes, <b>greases,</b> waxes and fingerprints, and can remove heavier soils than {{processes}} that use pure or azeotropic solvents. Cosolvent systems are flexible in that different proportions of substances in the zeotropic mixture {{can be used to}} satisfy different cleaning purposes. For example, increasing the proportion of solvating agent to rinsing agent in the mixture increases the solvency, and thus is used for removing heavier soils.|$|R
30|$|Soft {{measures}} against railway trespass included {{new approaches to}} education, innovative collaboration between institutions and agencies, soft approaches to physical barriers, and training railway staff to dissuade certain groups of trespassers. First, the results pointed towards the need to raise risk awareness in less conventional locations situated close to the tracks, to educate urban planners and community representatives, and to combine education campaigns with punitive measures. Second, {{there was a need}} for a better joint work within communities, between IMs and RUs on one hand, and urban planners, local authorities, municipalities, etc. on the other, and the main recommendation was that railway companies should seek collaboration partners. Third, it was suggested {{that one of the most}} popular physical measures (i.e. fencing) may in fact be used as a symbolic barrier, indicating the boundary of an area with restricted admission, or that smearing the bars of fences with <b>heavy</b> <b>grease</b> could potentially reinforce the deterrent effect on behaviour. Last but not least, it was shown that in some countries like Spain or Turkey there was a need to train the railway staff to detect and warn trespassers, and to communicate with third parties in difficult situations.|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section G of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This test method describes the procedure used for determining the flexural strength or modulus of rupture of Rapid Strength Concrete (RSC) by the use of a simple beam with third point loading. Rapid Strength Concrete is used on projects where short construction windows (6 to 55 hours) require rapid curing (typically 3 to 24 hours). This test method is typically used to fabricate and test samples at the jobsite to meet trafficopening criterion. B. APPARATUS 1.

40|$|Processes {{currently}} {{used throughout the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to remove corrosion and coatings from structures, ground service equipment and small components results in waste streams consisting of toxic chemicals, spent media blast materials, and waste water. When chemicals are used in these processes they are typically high in volatile organic compounds (VOC) and are considered hazardous air pollutants (HAP). When blast media is used, the volume of hazardous waste generated is increased significantly. Many of the coatings historically used within NASA contain toxic metals such as hexavalent chromium, and lead. These materials are highly regulated and restrictions on worker exposure continue to increase. Most recently the EPA reduced the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium. The new standard lowers OSHA's PEL for hexavalent chromium from 52 to 5 micrograms of Cr(V 1) per cubic meter of air as an 8 -hour time-weighted average. Hexavalent chromium {{is found in the}} pretreatment and primer coatings used within the Shuttle Program. In response to the need to continue to protect assets within the agency and the growing concern over these new regulations, NASA is researching different ways to continue the required maintenance of both facility and flight equipment in a safe, efficient and environmentally preferable manner. The use of laser energy to remove prepare surfaces for a variety of processes, such as corrosion and coating removal, weld preparation and non destructive evaluation is a relatively new technology that has shown itself to be environmentally preferable and in many cases less labor intensive than {{currently used}} removal methods. The development of a Portable Laser Coating Removal System (PLCRS) started as the goal of a Joint Group on Pollution Prevention (JG-PP) project, led by the Air Force, where several types of lasers in several configurations were thoroughly evaluated. Following this project, NASA decided to evaluate the best performers on processes and coatings specific to the agency. Laser systems used during this project were all of a similar design, most of which had integrated vacuum systems in order to collect materials removed from substrate surfaces during operation. Due {{to the fact that the}} technology lends itself to a bide variety of processes, several site demonstrations were organized in order to allow for greater evaluation of the laser systems across NASA. The project consisted of an introductory demonstration and a more in-depth evaluation at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Additionally, field demonstrations occurred at Glenn Research Center and Kennedy Space Center. During these demonstrations several NASA specific applications were evaluated, including the removal of coatings within Orbiter tile cavities and Teflon from Space Shuttle Main Engine gaskets, removal of <b>heavy</b> <b>grease</b> from Solid Rocket Booster components and the removal of coatings on weld lines for Shuttle and general ground service equipment for non destructive evaluation (NDE). In addition, several general industry applications such as corrosion removal, structural coating removal, weld-line preparation and surface cleaning were evaluated. This included removal of coatings and corrosion from surfaces containing lead-based coatings and applications similar to launch-structure maintenance and Crawler maintenance. During the project lifecycle, an attempt was made to answer process specific concerns and questions as they arose. Some of these initially unexpected questions concerned the effects lasers might have on substrates used on flight equipment including strength, surface re-melting, substrate temperature and corrosion resistance effects. Additionally a concern was PPE required for operating such a system including eye, breathing and hearing protection. Most of these questions although not initially planned, were fully explored as a part of this project. Generally the results from tesng were very positive. Corrosion was effectively removed from steel, but less successfully from aluminum alloys. Coatings were able to be removed, with varying results, generally dark, matte and thin coatings were easier to remove. Steel and aluminum panels were able to be cleaned for welding, with no known deleterious effects and weld-lines were able to have coatings removed in critical areas for NDE while saving time as compared to other methods...|$|E

His usual attire was a long-tailed vintage tuxedo with his hair parted down the middle and slicked straight down the sides, with <b>heavy</b> mascara and <b>grease</b> paint. His skewed gaze, which Bennick perfected by turning his one artificial eye outward, only contributed to the atmosphere. He also twisted around some words and names to reflect the horror atmosphere—he frequently called the horror films [...] "horrible old movies", and the city that WTOG's studios were based in [...] "St. Creaturesburg".|$|R
50|$|The 1st {{downhill}} time-trial race {{took place}} in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due {{to the need to}} repack the hub brake after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or coaster brake that worked by pedalling backwards. The mechanism operated with a conical brake shoe being wound on a thread in a metal hub. To prevent the brake from seizing it was kept filled with <b>grease.</b> <b>Heavy</b> use during the descent would cause the brake to over heat, softening the grease and causing it to drain from the hub, requiring frequent repacking. Ten riders descended 1300 ft of Repack road in about 5 minutes.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, non-Newtonian fluids {{are found in}} many {{industrial}} and engineering processes, such as food mixing, flow of blood, plasma, mercury amalgams, and lubrications with <b>heavy</b> oils and <b>greases.</b> In view of these applications, many studies are focused on non-Newtonian fluid. Govardhan et al. (2015) initiated the magnetohydrodynamics flow of an incompressible micropolar fluid over a stretching sheet for unsteady case. Hayat et al. (2010) have initiated the effect of thermal radiation on a two-dimensional stagnation-point flow and heat transfer of an incompressible magneto-hydrodynamic Carreau fluid towards a shrinking surface with convective boundary condition. In modern days, all such interesting applications have motivated scientists and researchers to look for more avenues {{in the field of}} non-Newtonian flow (Rudraswamy et al. 2017 a, 2017 b; Kumar et al. 2017 c, 2017 e).|$|R
30|$|Petroleum {{industry}} {{started its}} {{operations in the}} year 1867 and is considered as the oldest Indian industry. India {{is one of the}} most flourishing oil markets in the world and, in the past few decades, has witnessed the expansion of top national companies producing a variety of chemicals beneficial to mankind in almost all sectors. Petrochemicals industry is a crucial member of the Indian economy since it caters to the needs of major industries like power, telecom, cables, plastics, textiles, etc. However, the wastes generated during manufacturing of raw materials and end products are of concern as they pose hazard to environment and living beings. The Hazardous Waste (management and handling) Rule (1989) has listed petrochemical industry as hazardous group of industries. Complex hazardous compounds are present in the effluent generated by petrochemical industries such as organic compounds, high and low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), <b>heavy</b> metals, oil, <b>grease</b> etc. which tend to persist in environment for longer period.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent decades}} {{much has been}} done to remedy the creek's condition. Patches of remnant native flora still remain along the creek, and through weed control and {{ecological}} burning their quality has been improved. Much native vegetation has been replanted by the Merri Creek Management Committee and the volunteer group Friends of Merri Creek. In recent years, Melbourne Water has been involved in a willow control program to improve water flows and allow for the revegetation of sites with indigenous plant species. At times of low flow, water is sustained in the Creek through treated outfall from the Cragieburn sewage treatment plant, http://www.mcmc.org.au/2004-05.MCMC%20Annual%20Report.pdf. Water quality was thought to have been insufficient to allow repopulation by Platypus. This is thought to be because toxicants in sediments in the Creek have reduced macroinvertebrate productivity to the point where there is insufficient food to feed a population of platypus. The toxicants are mainly <b>heavy</b> metals and <b>greases</b> which originated in industrial areas in the catchment. However the first sighting in decades occurred between Thornbury and Coburg in Sept 2010.|$|R
40|$|Infrared (IR) {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} analytical tool in the chemical fingerprinting of materials. The technique is rapid, reproducible and usually non-invasive. With the appropriate accessories, the technique {{can be used to}} examine samples in either a solid, liquid or gas phase. Solid samples of varying sizes and shapes may be used, and with the addition of microscopic IR (microspectroscopy) capabilities, minute materials such as single fibers and threads may be examined. With the addition of appropriate software, microspectroscopy can be used for automated discrete point or compositional surface area mapping, with the latter providing a means to record changes in the chemical composition of a material surface over a defined area. Both aqueous and non-aqueous free-flowing solutions can be analyzed using appropriate IR techniques, as can viscous liquids such as <b>heavy</b> oils and <b>greases.</b> Due to the ability to characterize gaseous samples, IR spectroscopy can also be coupled with thermal processes such as thermogravimetric (TG) analyses to provide both thermal and chemical data in a single run. In this configuration, solids (or liquids) heated in a TG analyzer undergo decomposition, with the evolving gases directed into the IR spectrometer. Thus, information is provided on the thermal properties of a material and the order in which its chemical constituents are broken down during incremental heating. Specific examples of these varied applications will be cited, with data interpretation and method limitations further discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{car wash}} {{business}} has developed rapidly {{in recent years}} due to the increased number of cars, thus, it can cause serious environmental problems considering its potential source of pollution. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the wastewater from car washing companies in the city of Campina Grande, in Paraiba state, and to analyze the environmental impacts generated. A survey was conducted from November 2009 to July 2010. The first step we present a survey of car wash businesses in the city, and identified 20 licensed companies in which we evaluated the number of vehicles washed per week, the existence of a system of pre-treatment of wastewater generated and infrastructure that would allow the realization of the collection of samples of the effluent, the second step was carried out chemical and physical characterization of wastewater from five 20 companies surveyed in the previous step, and third stage were measured pollution loads of wastewater from washing of vehicles in the city, from the results obtained in previous steps. The characterization parameters were analyzed: oil and <b>grease,</b> COD, <b>heavy</b> metals, TS, TSS, turbidity, TKN, total P, pH and color. The results demonstrated that the wastewater from the car wash establishments shows high concentrations of organic matter, oils and <b>grease,</b> <b>heavy</b> metals and solids, and as such did not conform with the specific environmental legislation. Evaluation of pollutant loads demonstrated that if releases without proper treatment, it can cause serious environmental problems. It is therefore essential that these establishments are properly monitored...|$|R
