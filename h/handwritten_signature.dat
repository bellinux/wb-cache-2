In November 2006, Janis Karpinski, who had been in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's El País newspaper that she had seen a letter signed by Rumsfeld, which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation.

Neither the Pentagon nor U.S. Army spokespeople in Iraq commented on the accusation. In 2006, a criminal complaint was filed in a German Court against Donald Rumsfeld by eight former soldiers and intelligence operatives, including Karpinski and former army counterintelligence special agent David DeBatto. Among other things, the complaint stated that Rumsfeld both knew of and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques that he knew to be illegal under international law.|$|E

Various features of signature such as height, length, slant, Hu’s moments etc are extracted and used for training of the NN. The objective of online signature verification is to decide, whether a signature originates from a given signer. This recognition and verification process is based on the instant signature image obtained from the genuine signer and a few images of the original signatures which are already part reference database. The process of Devnagari signature verification can be divided it into sub-processes as pre-processing, feature extraction, feature matching, feature comparison and classification.

40|$|Abstract—Handwritten {{signatures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} so-cially acceptable and traditionally used person identification and authentication metric. Although a number of authentication systems based on <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures</b> have been proposed, a little attention is paid towards employing signatures for person identification. In this work, we address both the identification and verification problems related to analysis of dynamic <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures.</b> In this way, the need to present username before biometric verification can be eliminated in current signature based biometric authentication systems. A compressed sensing approach is used for user identification and to reject a query signature that does not belong to any user in the database. Once a person is identified, an automatic alignment of query signature with the reference template is carried out such that the correlations between two signature instances are maximized. An elastic distance matching algorithm is then run over the presented data which declares the query signature as either genuine or forged based on the dissimilarity with the reference signature. Our results show that dynamic signatures can be accurately used for person identification along with the traditional verification methods.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{numerous}} algorithms for automating the verification of <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures</b> that have been proposed over the years, {{there are still many}} <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures</b> that can cause a system to underperform significantly.

This paper introduces a technique to estimate the complexity of a signature image based on knowledge acquired from a human experiment, where 'complexity' is viewed from a different perspective.

40|$|Abstract: One {{important}} subject {{associated with}} personal authentication capabilities is {{the analysis of}} <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures.</b> Among the many known techniques, algorithms based on linguistic formalisms are also possible. However, such techniques require a number of algorithms for intelligent image analysis to be applied, allowing {{the development of new}} solutions in the field of personal authentication and building modern security systems based on the advanced recognition of such patterns. The article presents the approach based on the usage of syntactic methods for the static analysis of <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures.</b> The graph linguistic formalisms applied, such as the IE graph and ETPL(k) grammar, are characterised by considerable descriptive strength and a polynomial membership problem of the syntactic analysis. For the purposes of representing the analysed <b>handwritten</b> <b>signatures,</b> new hierarchical (two-layer) HIE graph structures based on IE graphs have been defined. The two-layer graph description makes it possible to take into consideration both local and global features of the signature. The usage of attributed graphs enables the storage of additional semantic information describing the properties of individual signature strokes. The verification and recognition of a signature consists in analysing the affiliation of its graph description to the language describing the specimen database. Initial assessments display a precision of the method at a average level of under 75 %...|$|R

Although the verification process can be thought to as a monolith component, it is recommended to divide it into loosely coupled phases (like preprocessing, feature extraction, feature matching, feature comparison and classification) allowing us to gain a better control over the precision of different components. This paper focuses on classification, the last phase in the process, covering some of the most important general approaches in the field.

50|$|Digital {{signatures}} employ asymmetric cryptography.

Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret; further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid.
