2500|$|Subsequent {{addition}} of three 5-carbon IPP units {{to a single}} 5-carbon DMAPP unit generates the 20-carbon central precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Bicyclization of GGPP by the class II <b>diterpene</b> synthase, ent-clerodienyl diphosphate synthase (...) , produces a Iabdanyl diphosphate carbocation, which is subsequently rearranged through a sequence of 1,2-hydride and methyl shifts to form the ent-clerodienyl diphosphate intermediate. [...] catalyzes the first committed reaction in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A by producing its characteristic clerodane scaffold. A series of oxygenation, acylation and methylation reactions is then required to complete the biosynthesis of salvinorin A.|$|E
2500|$|SalvinorinA {{was first}} {{described}} and named in 1982 by Alfredo Ortega and colleagues in Mexico. They used {{a combination of}} spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to determine the chemical structure of the compound, which was shown to have a bicyclic <b>diterpene</b> structure. Around the same time, Leander Julián Valdés III [...] independently isolated the molecule {{as part of his}} PhD research, published in 1983. Valdés named the chemical divinorin, and also isolated an analog that he named divinorinB. The naming was subsequently corrected to salvinorinA and B after the work was published in 1984.

40|$|We {{examined}} the antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus of three <b>diterpenes,</b> namely, geranylgeraniol, teprenone, and phytol, {{by using a}} broth dilution with shaking method to identify the effects of <b>diterpenes</b> with long aliphatic carbon chains. We also performed time-kill assays and measured the leakage of K+ ions from bacterial cells {{in response to these}} <b>diterpenes.</b> The <b>diterpenes</b> used inhibited the growth of S. aureus at concentrations of 0. 15 μg/ml, as determined by damage to the cell membranes, and had clear bactericidal activity. However, the inhibitory effects of the <b>diterpenes</b> decreased when the concentration of each was raised above a certain level. The <b>diterpenes</b> tested in this study appeared to have both growth-inhibitory and growth-accelerating effects, and the net effect of each depended on its concentration...|$|R

40|$|Terpenoids {{constitute}} {{a large family}} of natural steroids that are widely distributed in plants and insects. We investigated {{the effects of a}} series of <b>diterpenes</b> structurally related to acanthoic acid in macrophage functions. We found that <b>diterpenes</b> with different substitutions at the C 4 position in ring A are potent activators of liver X receptors (LXR and LXR) in both macro-phage cell lines from human and mouse origin and primary murine macrophages. Activation of LXR by these <b>diterpenes</b> was evaluated in transient transfection assays and gene ex-pression analysis of known LXR-target genes, including the cholesterol transporters ABCA 1 and ABCG 1, the sterol regula-tory element-binding protein 1 c, and the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (Sp). Moreover, active <b>diterpenes</b> greatly stim-ulated cholesterol efflux frommacrophages. It is interesting that these <b>diterpenes</b> antagonize inflammatory gene expression mainly through LXR-dependent mechanisms, indicating that these compounds can activate both LXR activation and repres-sion functions. Stimulation of macrophages with acanthoic acid <b>diterpenes</b> induced LXR-target gene expression and choles-terol efflux to similar levels observed with synthetic agonist...|$|R
