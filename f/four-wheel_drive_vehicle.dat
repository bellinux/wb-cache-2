Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police.

The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at [...] One study reported that around a third of visitors and two thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness; visitors traveling up the volcano's flanks are advised to stop for at least half an hour and preferably longer at the visitor center to acclimate to the higher elevation. It is strongly recommended to use a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>vehicle</b> to drive {{all the way to}} the top. Brakes often overheat on the way down and there is no fuel available on Mauna Kea. A free Star Gazing Program is held at the VIS every night from 6-10 pm. Between 5,000 and 6,000 people visit the summit of Mauna Kea each year, and to help ensure safety, and protect the integrity of the mountain, a ranger program was implemented in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|The first Russian {{produced}} four-wheel-drive vehicle, also in {{part for}} civilian use, was the GAZ-61, developed in the Soviet Union in 1938.

Elements of the chassis were used in military vehicles such as the GAZ-64, GAZ-67, GAZ-69, and also the properly civilian GAZ-M-72 (based on the rear-wheel drive GAZ-20 [...] "Victory" [...] and built from 1955-1958). Soviet civilian life did not allow the proliferation of civilian products such as the Jeep in North America, but through the 1960s the technology of Soviet 4×4 vehicles stayed on par with British, German, and American models, even exceeding it in some aspects, and for military purposes just as actively developed, produced and used.|$|E
