2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Cézanne solved this [...] "spatial conundrum" [...] in the final three {{versions}} of The Card Players, by eliminating spectators and other [...] "unnecessary detail" [...] while displaying only the [...] "absolute essentials": two players immersed in their game.

The man on the left is smoking a pipe, wearing a tophat with a downcast brim, in darker, more formal clothing, seated upright; the man to the right is pipeless, in a shorter hat with upcast brim, lighter, more loosely fit clothing, and <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> table.

In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants as well as the center of the painting's [...] "symmetrical balance".|$|E

5000|$|... "A Family" [...] is a 1951 oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Irish artist Louis le Brocquy. It depicts a woman half-laying on a table and gazing out at the viewer accompanied by a cat in the foreground, a man sitting <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> in <b>the</b> background, and a child holding {{a bouquet of flowers}} on one side, gazing at the woman. The painting's stark grey color palette and its portrayal of dejection within the family unit attracted strong criticism from some contemporaries in post-war Ireland, while others praised the artist's willingness to address the problems of the time in the work. It is currently on display in The National Gallery of Ireland.|$|R

5000|$|A Ryan PT-22 {{painted with}} North Korean {{markings}} {{was used for}} Charlie's plane. The plane used was owned by Don Burkett, who kept the plane in a hangar at Long Beach Airport. The production team painted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> plane's orange and white starburst pattern with special paint to resemble the North Korean markings. Burkett himself actually flew the plane from the rear seat, as the pilot who was assigned to do the flying had never flown a plane of this type before (Burkett can be seen <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> in <b>the</b> back seat during some shots). Enough film was taken during the one day of flying {{they were able to}} piece together two episodes featuring the plane and its inept pilot. An article in the October 1972 edition of Private Pilot magazine featured Burkett's experience doing the show. The magazine's cover has a picture of what the plane looked like when it wasn't [...] "in costume".|$|R
50|$|The red howlers live {{in groups}} with {{one to three}} males, and two to seven females. Males living in {{bachelor}} groups attempt {{to gain control of}} the female group by fighting the lead male. The male red howler wakes up {{early in the morning and}} wakes the forest up with their loud howls that can be heard up to 2 miles. They howl again at night, before they go to sleep, and the calls are answered by males from other red howler groups, to let them know their location so that their territories do not overlap. Red howlers do not like rain, so they howl in protest to <b>the</b> rain while <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> in <b>the</b> trees. They stay high up in the trees away from jaguars and throw sticks and branches at them. When a troop is invading, males come to take <b>over</b> <b>the</b> female group from the current male or males; they kill all the infants and mate with the females to produce their own offspring. The females try to protect their infants, but being smaller, they usually fail to do so.|$|R

In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants as well as the center of the painting's [...] "symmetrical balance".Of the three versions, perhaps the best known and most often reproduced is in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. It is also the smallest at 47.5 x 57 cm (17 3/4 x 22 1/2 in). The Orsay painting was described by art historian Meyer Schapiro as [...] "the most monumental and also the most refined" [...] of the versions, with the shapes being simpler but more varied in their relationships. It is the most sparsely painted, and generally considered the last of the Card Players series. There is a shift of axis to the scene, in which the player to the left is more completely in the picture, chair included, with the appearance of being nearer to us. His partner to the right is cut off from the scene at his back, and the table is displayed at an angle to the plane. Critics have described a [...] "deception of restraint" [...] in Cézanne's use of color; graduated area of thinly applied, [...] "priming" [...] color used for solid forms and their appearance of structure is met with lilac and green used to [...] "liven" [...] the canvas, as well as the bright, deep color used on the lower half for the tablecloth. This version of the series was also part of a high-profile theft of eight Cézanne paintings from a traveling show at Aix in August 1961. The most valuable of the stolen works, The Card Players, was released as a four-color postage stamp by the French government in recognition of the loss. All of the paintings were recovered after a paid ransom several months later.|$|E

5000|$|King Ghidorah, (which {{was based}} on Yamata no Orochi) was played by Shoichi Hirose (who had {{previously}} played King Kong in King Kong vs Godzilla). Hirose spent hours <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> inside <b>the</b> costume, holding onto a crossbar for support. A team of wire work puppeteers manipulated the necks, tails and wings. As many as seven men were in <b>the</b> rafters <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sound stage working the wires. Sadamasa Arikawa (who assisted Eiji Tsuburaya with the special effects), stated [...] "There were times when all three necks got tangled up or the plastic wires would reflect the studio lights, or the wires would get caught in Ghidorah's scales. It was an agonizing operation!" [...] Haruo Nakajima once again played Godzilla and the same suit from Mothra vs Godzilla was reused here with a slightly altered face. Masaki Shinohara played Rodan, and a new Rodan costume was constructed. The new suit had a different appearance for the face, with a muscular neck and triangular wings. Small models of the monsters were also used for far away shots or flying shots of Rodan and King Ghidorah.|$|R
500|$|The dead {{rise from}} their graves around Michael's feet; some emerge to walk towards Heaven, others towards Hell. They are tiny {{compared}} to Christ and the saints. Lorne Campbell notes that these panels display a deeply pessimistic view of humanity, with the damned far outnumbering the saved, especially compared to Stefan Lochner's Cologne panel, where the saved crowd {{the entrance to}} Heaven. The dead undergo a gradual transformation as they move from panel to panel. The souls rising at Michael's feet show little expression, becoming more animated as they move to either side; horror and desperation become especially visible {{on the faces of}} the damned as they move towards Hell. On the left, the saved all have, according to Jacobs, [...] "the same beatific expressions", but their postures gradually change from facing Christ and Michael to looking towards Heaven's gate, notably with the couple below Mary– the man turns the woman's gaze away from Michael, towards Heaven. This contrasts with another couple on the opposite panel who face Hell; <b>the</b> woman is <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> as <b>the</b> man raises his hand in vain to beseech God for mercy.|$|R

50|$|Now {{licensed}} doctors, West and {{the narrator}} go into practice {{together in the}} small New England town of Bolton, purchasing a house near the local cemetery to {{have easy access to}} corpses. Still intent upon successfully reanimating a human being, they claim the body of a black boxing champion who died of a head wound in an illegal back-alley street fight. Gamblers betting on the fight arrange for West to dispose of the body, as it clears them of any crime. West and the narrator hurriedly take the body back to the lab and inject it with another new serum. When nothing happens, they take the corpse out to a meadow and bury it. Several days later, there are reports around town of a missing child. The child's mother dies during a fit of hysteria, and the father tries to kill West in a fit of rage because West couldn't save her. That night, West and the narrator are startled by an aggressive pounding on their back door. Opening the door, West and the narrator {{come face to face with}} the boxer's corpse, covered in mildew and dirt and <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> at <b>the</b> back entrance. Hanging from his mouth is the arm of the missing child. Almost instantly, West empties an entire revolver into the creature.|$|R

6000|$|Two {{pictures}} {{come into}} my memory. I have {{climbed to the top}} of a tree by the edge of the playing field, and am looking at my school-fellows and am as proud of myself as a March cock when it crows to its first sunrise. I am saying to myself, [...] "if when I grow up I am as clever among grown-up men as I am among these boys, I shall be a famous man." [...] I remind myself how they think all the same things and cover the school walls at election times with the opinions their fathers find in the newspapers. I remind myself that I am an artist's son and must take some work as the whole end of life and not think as the others do of becoming well off and living pleasantly. The other picture is of a hotel sitting-room in the Strand, where a man is <b>hunched</b> up <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fire. He is a cousin who has speculated with another cousin's money and has fled from Ireland in danger of arrest. My father has brought us to spend the evening with him, to distract him from the remorse my father knows that he must be suffering.|$|R
60|$|Faster, faster, faster! That old resistless weight {{began to}} press Madeline back; the old incessant bellow of wind filled her ears. Link Stevens <b>hunched</b> low <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wheel. His eyes were hidden under leather helmet and goggles, but {{the lower part}} of his face was unprotected. He resembled a demon, so dark and stone-hard and strangely {{grinning}} was he. All at once Madeline realized how matchless, how wonderful a driver was this cowboy. She divined that weakening could not have been possible to Link Stevens. He was a cowboy, and he really was riding that car, making it answer to his will, as it had been born in him to master a horse. He had never driven to suit himself, had never reached an all-satisfying speed until now. Beyond that his motive was to save Stewart--to make Madeline happy. Life was nothing to him. That fact gave him the superhuman nerve to face the peril of this ride. Because of his disregard of self he was able to operate the machine, to choose the power, the speed, the guidance, the going with the best judgment and highest efficiency possible. Madeline knew he would get her to Mezquital in time to save Stewart or he would kill her in the attempt.|$|R

50|$|Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) {{and his new}} bride, Jane (Rachael Taylor), leave New York City for Tokyo, Japan, where Ben has {{a job as a}} photographer. While {{travelling}} by car in {{the wilderness}} of the countryside, Jane accidentally hits a girl {{standing in the middle of}} the road and ends up running over her. They could not find a body or even a trace of blood and decide to leave, thinking the victim was alright and had left. They later start to find mysterious lights in their photos, which are later identified as spirit photography by Ben's assistant, Seiko Nakamura (Maya Hazen). Jane begins to have eerie dreams and visions as if they are trying to tell her something and senses a haunting presence stalking them. Ben begins to complain of severe shoulder pain and his friends begin to comment he's looking bent and <b>hunched</b> <b>over,</b> although <b>the</b> doctor could not determine what was the actual physical cause of it. Seiko takes Jane to her ex-boyfriend, Ritsuo (James Kyson Lee), whose career is to investigate paranormal activities, and he tells them that the lights in the photos are spirits as well as manifestations of intense emotions that are trying to be communicated. At a subway station, Jane spots the ghostly presence of the girl she hit and ran over, causing her to believe that she killed the girl. Later, Ben also has a similarly-terrifying encounter. They go to a medium, Murase, to find out what spiritual activity is really happening to them. However, after Murase clearly appears to have stumbled upon something, Ben refuses to translate what Murase says and storms out, claiming that he is a fraud.|$|R

30|$|Participant 3 (without EtherApe) The least {{experienced}} of {{the four}} participants, he preferred ASDM overview display <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Big Brother status display. He was methodical. In the first phase, he gathered available information before deciding on the course of restarting the ordering system. The deliberate approach was slow. While the participants 1 and 2 took under two minutes to note and correct the problem, it took him at least two minutes before taking corrective action. Four minutes passed before he realized {{the advent of the}} DoS attack and it took another three minutes before he decided to take any action. Participant 4 (with Etherape) He was the most experienced of all the participants. While not part of his daily job function, he has served as a network operator in a part time job. During the exercise he was leaning back in his chair watching the EtherApe visualization or <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> staring at <b>the</b> ASDM overview display. His response was rapid and in most cases remediated problems in under thirty seconds. Not once did we need to announce the occurrence of an event. He noted the DoS attack immediately from both the EtherApe and ASDM displays. He performed a packet trace and identified the source as the payment processor and that the attacking system was a critical component in processing payment transactions. He recognized that making changes to the firewall may cause harm later on; he would prefer contacting the partner first.|$|R
