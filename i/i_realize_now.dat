"I {{think that}} the Towson, Maryland area that I am {{familiar}} with differs {{from other parts of}} Maryland because of the proximity to one of the largest slave plantations in the country.

Every African American school age child in Baltimore County had to attend school at some point at Carver in East Towson. ...<b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> that as a youngster the older African Americans avoided talking about slavery or the nearby Ridgely Plantation because they themselves were not too far removed from slavery itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elements of {{the history}} of Star Wars are {{commonly}} disputed, as George Lucas' statements about it have changed over time. One of the claims is that he intended to make the film a Space Western. Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138—that he first had an idea for a space fantasy film, though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then. In the 2010 coffee table book Star Wars: Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle produced by DK Publishing and Lucasfilm, George Lucas is said to have made his film as a direct contrast to THX 1138. He felt that the bleak tone of the film led to it being poorly received, and therefore chose to make Star Wars a more optimistic film. This is what led to the fun and adventurous tone of the space opera. Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young. In 1979, he said, [...] "I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials... Of course <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> how crude and badly done they were... loving them that much when they were so awful, I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well." ...|$|E

60|$|I had paddled to {{the southwestern}} point, which Goork said he {{believed}} to be the least frequented portion of the island, as he had never seen boats put off from there.

60|$|Mrs Sheppey {{proved to}} be a harassed and muddling woman, and she came to a harassed home. My father's affairs had gone from bad to worse. He was gloomy and morose. A hunted look {{sometimes}} gleamed in his eyes, and the spectacled nose seemed to grow the smaller the more solemn its surroundings were. He spent most of the day in his dressing-gown now, had quarrelled with Dr Grose, and dismissed Mrs Ballard. The rooms were dirty and neglected. Pollie would maunder about with a broom, or stand idly staring out of the window. She was in love. At least, so <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now.</b> At the time I thought she was merely lumpish and stupid.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> {{that she}} was desperately capricious, of a cat-like cruelty by nature, and so evasive and elusive that {{frequently}} I could not distinguish her soft, furry pads from her claws. But whatever her mood, or her treatment of me, or her lapses {{into a kind of}} commonness to which I deliberately shut my eyes, her beauty remained. Whomsoever we love becomes unique in that love, and I suppose we are responsible for what we give as well as for what we accept. The very memory of her beauty, when I was alone, haunted me as intensely as if she were present. Yet in her actual company, it made her in a sense unreal. So, often, it was only the ghost of her with whom I sat and talked. How sharply it would have incensed her to know it. When she came to me in my sleep, she was both paradise and seraph, and never fiddle entranced a Paganini as did her liquid lapsing voice my small fastidious ear. Yet, however much she loved to watch herself in looking-glass or in her mind, and to observe her effects on others, she was not vain.|$|E
5000|$|She {{returned}} for a round-table called Strategies for Trauma Healing and Resilience {{in the summer of}} 2005 and then enrolled as a residential, full-time master's degree student in [...] "conflict transformation and peacebuilding" [...] at EMU's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding in 2006-07:At graduate school, I could feel my mind expand, my comprehension deepen. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> could put a formal name, [...] "strategic peacebuilding," [...] to what I'd done instinctively in Liberia.... Many of the other students at EMU had lived through conflict, and there was relief in being among them.... In Harrisonburg, a small old city in the Shenandoah Valley, far from Liberia and its sorrows and people who expected something from me, I didn't have to be strong. Every now and then - for instance, when I saw a mother with her children - I would burst into tears. No one at EMU thought that was strange. I met an old man who'd lost his entire family in the Rwandan genocide.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not right}} to give the cat the [...] "Pain-Killer"; <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> would not repeat it in these days.

It was a most detestable medicine, Perry Davis's Pain-Killer. Mr. Pavey's negro man, who was a person of good judgment and considerable curiosity, wanted to sample it, and I let him. It was his opinion that it was made of hell-fire.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1999, at a {{press conference}} in New York City to discuss The Phantom Menace, Lucas {{described}} the [...] "nine year commitment" [...] required to make a Star Wars trilogy. In 2002, he said: [...] "Basically what I said as a joke was, 'Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in their 70s, we'll come back and do another version.' The thing <b>I</b> didn't <b>realize</b> then, and that <b>I</b> do <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> very clearly, is that not only would they be in their 70s, but I would be in my 70s too." [...] In 2007, Lucas described making the films at that age as [...] "an idea that seemed amusing at the time, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that 'off-the-cuff' comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements.|$|R
60|$|We FELT then, {{what we did}} not {{understand}} till later years, that our grown-up relatives did not altogether admire or approve of Uncle Blair. He belonged to a different world from theirs. They had never known him very intimately or understood him. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> that Uncle Blair {{was a bit of}} a Bohemian--a respectable sort of tramp. Had he been a poor man he might have been a more successful artist. But he had a small fortune of his own and, lacking the spur of necessity, or of disquieting ambition, he remained little more than a clever amateur. Once in a while he painted a picture which showed what he could do; but for the rest, he was satisfied to wander over the world, light-hearted and content. We knew that the Story Girl was thought to resemble him strongly in appearance and temperament, but she had far more fire and intensity and strength of will--her inheritance from King and Ward. She would never be satisfied as a dabbler; whatever her future career should be, into it she would throw all her powers of mind and heart and soul.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} timber {{close to the}} base of the cliffs, and so I was forced to enter the wood some two hundred yards distant. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> how foolhardy was my act in such a land as Caspak, teeming with danger and with death; but there is a certain amount of fool in every man; and {{whatever}} proportion of it I own must have been in the ascendant that day, for the truth of the matter is that I went down into those woods absolutely defenseless; and I paid the price, as people usually do for their indiscretions. As I searched around in the brush for likely pieces of firewood, my head bowed and my eyes upon the ground, I suddenly felt a great weight hurl itself upon me. I struggled to my knees and seized my assailant, a huge, naked man--naked except for a breechcloth of snakeskin, the head hanging down to the knees. The fellow was armed with a stone-shod spear, a stone knife and a hatchet. In his black hair were several gay-colored feathers. As we struggled to and fro, I was slowly gaining advantage of him, when a score of his fellows came running up and overpowered me.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} more to tell, when I say that I met with Abel Hunt.

Then it was I forgot myself, allowing my temper to get the best of me, and instead of speaking him fairly because of the circumstances, I threatened he should be flogged by one of my uncle's negroes in the slave quarters, for daring to thus accost me. It stands to reason that <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>now</b> how foolish was this course, for I might have put him off, or answered his question after my own fashion, and later, when there were not so many king's lovers around, I could have had him punished. But, instead, I lost control of myself, as I have said, and I believe my actions pleased the scoundrel. He taunted me with being a rebel, and otherwise strove to set yet further flame to my anger, until forgetting all else, having lost to mind the danger in which you lads would be placed, I struck at the fellow, knocking him down, much to my satisfaction.|$|E
