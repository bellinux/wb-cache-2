Throughout the early 1940s, Choibalsan and party leaders, with help from the Soviets, launched a campaign to depict him as a national hero and savior of the nation, the Mongolian Stalin to Sükhbaatar’s Lenin. Several historical films about the revolution were produced portraying Choibalsan as the leading hero or working side by side with Sükhbaatar. Official histories of the Revolution were also rewritten to give Choibalsan a more central and heroic role. The university and the main <b>industrial</b> <b>combine</b> in Ulaanbaatar were named after him, as were the town and province of his birth.|$|E

50|$|During the Soviet era, the Kuznetsk Basin {{was second}} only to Ukraine's Donets Basin in terms of {{regional}} coal production. Iron smelting began there as early as 1697 and coal was discovered in 1721, {{although it was not}} systematically mined until 1851. The late 19th century industrialisation of Russia prompted a rapid growth in the area's industries, which was further boosted by the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Under Joseph Stalin's First Five-Year Plan, the Ural-Kuznetsk <b>industrial</b> <b>combine</b> was formed in the early 1930s.

50|$|After the Russian Revolution the new atheist {{government}} {{sought to}} eradicate religion, {{and the local}} Soviet closed the monastery in September 1922. The Glinskaya Icon of the Nativity of the Theotokos was transported to a nearby village, where it vanished without a trace. Many of the monks were killed or imprisoned {{and many of its}} buildings, including seven of its eight churches, were demolished; the remaining church was converted into a club. The monastery property was in turn a playground, cooperative farm, and <b>industrial</b> <b>combine).</b> With the beginning of the Second World War, and the occupation of the area by German troops, the site was abandoned, and twelve monks, led by the exiled Archimandrite Nektary, returned to the site. The revived monastery remained open from 1942 to 1961, during which the monastery experienced a spiritual revival. However, life at the monastery was difficult: there was no electricity or plumbing, and often the monks had to subsist on beets because they had no bread. Yet many pilgrims came to pray and work to rebuild the monastery. After nineteen years, the monastery was closed in 1961 by the Soviet government as a result of Nikita Khrushchev’s renewed persecution of Christianity.|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} the human {{impact on the}} subarctic environment of the joint border area of Norway, Finland and Russia. The aim is to present the current state and recent changes {{that have taken place}} in the region. The main threat to the environment is the Pechenganikel mining and metallurgical <b>industrial</b> <b>combine</b> in the towns of Nikel and Zapolyarny in the Kola Peninsula. Emissions from this complex include high levels of heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and sulfur dioxide. Pollution, along with climate change, water level regulation and other anthropogenic effects, has affected the aquatic ecosystems in the joint border area. The main heavy metals in the area are copper and nickel, the highest concentrations of which are measured near the combine. Direct discharge of sewage into the river continues and airborne heavy metal particles are also deposited to areas farther away. Climate changeinduced increase in temperature and precipitation in the Kola Peninsula is evident. Water level regulation with seven hydropower plants in the Pasvik River have changed it into a series of lakes and lake-like reservoirs. This report discusses modelling, which was enabled to estimate the effect of climate change on Lake Inarijärvi and the Pasvik River hydrology, water level fluctuation and ecology and to follow the sulfur dioxide emissions emitted from the Pechenganikel. Effects of pollution on the nature and concentrations of the main pollutants were studied and climate change in the border area and its effects on the ecology were estimated. Also the effects of water level regulation on the ecological status of the aquatic ecosystems were addressed...|$|E
