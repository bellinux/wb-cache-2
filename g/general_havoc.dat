60|$|Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried {{his mouth}} open and poured down the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then {{delivered}} a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making <b>general</b> <b>havoc.</b> Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, {{in a frenzy of}} enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.|$|E
60|$|In the {{battered}} walls, the shattered roofs, the destruction everywhere visible, {{he saw how}} the terrors of the siege had increased after he had left; and {{in view of the}} <b>general</b> <b>havoc</b> that met his view Dick was astonished that any one should have survived the long-continued bombardment. In some respects the change had been favorable. The accession of strength after the arrival of General Havelock's force had enabled great and beneficial alteration {{to be made in the}} internal arrangements, and the extension of the lines held had also aided in improving the sanitary condition. But the change in the appearance of the place was trifling in comparison with that in the faces of the defenders. These were, it is true, still pinched and thin, for the supply of food had been reduced to a minimum, and the rations had been lowered almost to starvation point. But in place of the expression of deep anxiety or of stern determination then marked on every face, all now looked joyous and glad, for the end to the terrible trials had arrived.|$|E

He became a subordinate officer to Ma Liang, he Commanded the 102nd Detachment, South-western Nationalist Underground Army. Ma Yuanxiang and Ma Liang (<b>general)</b> wreaked <b>havoc</b> on the Communist forces during the Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950-1958). In 1953, Mao Zedong was compelled to take radical action against them. He was then killed by communist forces in battle in 1953.|$|R

The readers of Alexander Pushkin's original poem, upon which this opera is based, will note that Gvidon is supposed to go on three separate trips to Saltan's kingdom, each of which requires a transformation into a different insect.|$|R
5000|$|Pack rats are nest builders. They use plant {{material}} such as branches, twigs, sticks, and other available debris. Getting into everything from attics to car engines, stealing their ‘treasures’, damaging electrical wiring, and creating <b>general</b> noisy <b>havoc</b> can easily {{cause them to}} become a nuisance.A peculiar characteristic is that if they find something they want, they will drop what they are currently carrying, for example a piece of cactus, and [...] "trade" [...] it for the new item. They are particularly fond of shiny objects. These two traits have inspired an anecdote about a person finding their dime replaced by two nickels. They can also be quite vocal and boisterous.|$|R

50|$|The Habsburg forces, {{fully engaged}} in the lengthy War of Spanish Succession, {{did not have the}} {{additional}} military power to engage the nobles, but the Hungarian leadership had neither the financial resources nor the military ones, to defeat the Habsburg forces in Hungary. Throughout 1703 - 1706, the former Habsburg <b>general</b> wrought <b>havoc</b> in Moravia and Bohemia. The ongoing insurrection, in which Sándor Károlyi played a significant part, led to the deposition of the Habsburg king in Hungary in 1707. However, after victories at Blenheim and Turin, the Habsburgs were able to devote more resources against recalcitrant Hungarians. The uprising took a dramatic turn at the Battle of Trencsén, on 4 August 1708. Rákóczi was knocked off his horse; his troops thought he had been killed, and fled. Rákóczi fled to Poland.|$|R
60|$|The {{troops were}} {{quartered}} {{in the larger}} buildings of New Brandenburg; the officers were billeted upon the burghers. The position of the country people and {{the inhabitants of the}} towns of Germany during this long and desolating war was terrible; no matter which side won, they suffered. There were in those days no commissariat wagons bringing up stores from depots and magazines to the armies. The troops lived entirely upon the country through which they marched. In exceptional cases, when the military chest happened to be well filled, the provisions acquired might be paid for, but as a rule armies upon the march lived by foraging. The cavalry swept in the flocks and herds from the country round. Flour, forage, and everything else required was seized wherever found, and the unhappy peasants and villagers thought themselves lucky if they escaped with the loss of all they possessed, without violence, insult, and ill treatment. The slightest resistance to the exactions of the lawless foragers excited their fury, and indiscriminate slaughter took place. The march of an army could be followed by burned villages, demolished houses, crops destroyed, and <b>general</b> ruin, <b>havoc,</b> and desolation.|$|R
50|$|Dark Specter {{is played}} by T.J. Rotolo and voiced by Christopher Cho.. Dark Specter is a {{gigantic}} entity, as the Dark Fortress is smaller than his hand. He is portrayed as the ultimate evil; the other villains are terrified of him. He {{is known as the}} Grand Monarch of Evil. As the Grand Monarch, Dark Specter forms an alliance of villains consisting of Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, Goldar, Squatt, Baboo, Finster, Master Vile, the Machine Empire, Divatox, Rygog, Porto, Elgar, <b>General</b> <b>Havoc,</b> Ecliptor, Darkonda, the Psycho Rangers, and Astronema.|$|E
5000|$|<b>General</b> <b>Havoc</b> {{is the son}} of Mama D, {{the brother}} of the space pirate Divatox, and an unnamed third sibling (possibly Dimitria, who {{is on the side of}} good), as well as the uncle of Elgar. He showed up with his Space Base he had been {{constructing}} for her after a long period of time (Divatox somewhat wittingly comments it was [...] "about 100 years"). Havoc proved far more competent in his battles with the Rangers than Divatox, not only by defeating the Rangers with his custom-made battle robot, the Metallosaurus, but also by stealing the Turbo Megazord and abducting the Phantom Ranger.|$|E
5000|$|Cornershop are a British indie {{rock band}} {{best known for}} their 1998 UK number-one single [...] "Brimful of Asha". The band were formed in 1991 by Wolverhampton-born Tjinder Singh (singer, songwriter, and guitar), his brother Avtar Singh (bass guitar, vocals), David Chambers (drums) and Ben Ayres (guitar, keyboards, and tamboura), the first three having {{previously}} been members of Preston-based band <b>General</b> <b>Havoc,</b> who released one single (the [...] "Fast Jaspal EP") in 1991. The band name originated from a stereotype referring to British Asians often owning corner shops. Their music is a fusion of Indian music, Britpop, alternative and electronic dance music.|$|E
50|$|In 86 BC, after Sulla's {{victory in}} Orchomenos, he {{initially}} {{spent some time}} re-establishing Roman authority. His legate soon arrived with the fleet {{he was sent to}} gather, and Sulla was ready to recapture lost Greek islands before crossing into Asia Minor. The second Roman army under the command of Flaccus meanwhile moved through Macedonia and into Asia Minor. After the capture of Philippi, remaining Mithridatic forces crossed the Hellespont {{to get away from the}} Romans. The Romans under Fimbria were encouraged to loot and create <b>general</b> <b>havoc</b> as they went, creating problems between Flaccus and Fimbria. Flaccus was a fairly strict disciplinarian and the behaviour of his lieutenant led to discord between the two.|$|E
50|$|Tjinder Singh {{formed the}} <b>General</b> <b>Havoc</b> whilst {{a student at}} Lancashire Polytechnic in Preston, in 1987. He {{relocated}} to Leicester, where his brother and sister lived, and formed Cornershop in 1991 along with his brother Avtar, and Chambers and Ayres, {{while working as a}} barman at Leicester's Royal Mail pub, also a popular local music venue. The band played their first gig at Leicester's O'Jays venue.In the early 1990s, when popular singer Morrissey was being vilified by the UK music press after accusations of racism, the band were invited to comment and the Melody Maker ran a story featuring the band burning a picture of the singer outside the offices of EMI.|$|E
50|$|Elgar was the dimwitted {{nephew of}} space pirate Divatox and <b>General</b> <b>Havoc,</b> and the {{grandson}} of Mama D. Elgar's parents were never revealed, but {{the existence of a}} fourth unnamed sibling is paramount due to the fact he is the nephew of Divatox, her brother, and presumably Dimitria, although he seems to be a creature of a species {{different from the rest of}} his family. He assisted Divatox in her fight against the Turbo Rangers in any way he could. He was later reassigned by Dark Specter to serve Astronema (to her chagrin, as she didn't want him around) in battling the Space Rangers. Months later, when Dark Specter initiated the takeover of the universe, Elgar was destroyed by Zordon's energy wave.|$|E
50|$|In Power Rangers in Space, {{she later}} joined Dark Specter's {{alliance}} of villains and {{was part of}} the invasion force that conquered most of the universe when she fought the Alien Rangers on Gratha. Divatox expresses jealousy and resentment towards Astronema's taking over of the responsibility of destroying the Space Rangers while she and her forces were selected by Dark Specter to constantly move Zordon about from world to world to prevent any of the various Rangers from finding him. Divatox was trying to run away from Zordon's energy wave, but she was hit by it and turned good and was last seen with long, flowing dark brown hair, and wearing a white dress identical to Dimitria's. She joyfully commented on how gorgeous she looked and how she survived. Her brother, <b>General</b> <b>Havoc,</b> and her nephew, Elgar have been destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The man then meets {{up with a}} {{scientist}} (played by Czech actor Petr Janiš), who then shows him his idea [...] - [...] monkeys playing music [...] - [...] {{with the help of}} several props. The protagonist seems unconvinced by the presentation. He is then led into another room and sat behind a protective screen, with a view of a chamber containing instruments and DJ'ing equipment. Some monkeys are brought into the chamber and start to play the instruments [...] - [...] It's revealed that their faces are actually those of humans (among them are the superimposed faces of band members Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe). After playing for a while, the monkeys suddenly start tearing up the equipment and causing <b>general</b> <b>havoc,</b> a behaviour which inexplicably carries over into the scientist in a nearby room as well. They then attack the main character, who promptly flees.|$|E
5000|$|When Roy {{arrives at}} the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, {{supervisor}} Donelli (Jesse White) places him in training as a janitor. Roy accepts the disappointment and unsuccessfully tries to explain things to his family back home, who {{believe that he is}} an astronaut. Meanwhile, he is befriended by veteran astronaut Major Fred Gifford (Leslie Nielsen). One day, Roy is alarmed to discover that his father and his friends, Plank (Frank McGrath) and Rush (Paul Hartman) are paying him a surprise visit at work. Anxious to please his domineering father, he dons a space suit and pretends to be an astronaut. Arbuckle, a World War I veteran, tells his friends, [...] "he is proud Roy is now serving his nation." [...] After wreaking <b>general</b> <b>havoc</b> on the simulators and other hardware, Roy is exposed as a janitor by Donelli and summarily fired in the presence of his father.|$|E
5000|$|Mama D is a space pirate who is {{the mother}} of Divatox, <b>General</b> <b>Havoc,</b> and an {{unidentified}} fourth child (the unnamed parent of Elgar), and is grandmother of Elgar. She, in a holographic transmission, considered Divatox the worst of their clan during Divatox's sleep. When asked for motherly advice from Divatox in her sleep, Mama D told her that the Power Rangers would fall if Divatox could [...] "remove the leader" [...] (in this case, Tommy). When Divatox's Piranhatrons captured Tommy, Divatox had him hanging from the ceiling as Mama D arrived and suggested she torture Tommy with the Vortex of Eternal Doom and Sorrow (to which she had banished the patriarch of the pirate clan), and threaten to drop him inside it. However, T.J. Johnson rescued Tommy while the others fought and defeated Flamite. While in her bed later that night, Divatox is told by Mama D that Tommy survived and that Divatox always messes up in her family of Space Pirates.|$|E
50|$|She is the {{daughter}} of Mama D, aunt of Elgar, and sister of <b>General</b> <b>Havoc.</b> It is also implied that she is the twin sister of Dimitria. She apparently had at least one other sibling, as Elgar referred to Havoc as his uncle. She is an acquaintance of Rita Repulsa, too; once she even talked to her over the phone. She wears contact lenses, and can fire blasts of energy from her eyes. In turbo a power rangers movie divatox was starting to talk but a fly flew by and interrupted her. She turned and stared at the fly as it flew by. Divatox tried to continue but the fly flew by again but this time it landed on her leg. She looked down at the fly. She shot out her long sticky tongue and caught the fly on the tip. She pulled it back into her mouth and chewed the fly. She swallowed it and started talking again as it slid down her wet throat and into her stomach.|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis that}} {{broke out in}} mid- 2007 {{was caused by the}} fact that the CDO market had grown to a size {{sufficient}} to wreak <b>general</b> <b>havoc</b> when it suddenly collapsed. Several authors have argued that economic inequality was important to the growth of this market. This paper attempts to strengthen this argument by concentrating attention on global wealth concentration. After summarising recent evidence on the negative impact of investor demand on US bond yields in the pre-crisis period, new evidence regarding the specific contribution of high net worth individuals to this negative impact is presented. The paper then goes on to show how, after having helped to caused a yield problem in the major US debt markets, high net worth individuals (via hedge funds) continued to be a major source of the pressure on US banks to resolve this yield problem through the mass production of CDOs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose: Forest {{fires are}} a {{universal}} problem that both confronts and confounds many countries. Such fires not only destroy {{large amount of}} natural resources, but also destroys wildlife and their natural habitat, wreaks <b>general</b> <b>havoc</b> on ecosystems and creates environmental pollution. For all that, fire fighting is one of today’s most important matters for natural and environmental resource protection and preservation. Material and Methods: The growing concern regarding environmental devastation of this kind is the underlying reason {{for the development of}} modern fire-detection system. Forest-fire automatic detection is a complex problem that involves substantial amount of various sensorial information and data. Furthermore, the reliability of automatic detection systems is still a significant issue in the domain. This paper presents a scheme of an integrated system for early detection of forest fires. The system uses a telecommunication network to link several components for cooperative detection. The perception system is based on a network of sensorial stations and central stations. The sensorial stations collect data including infrared and visual images and meteorological information. The central stations exchange data to perform distributed analysis. An implementation of the system has been carried out at the Ruđer Bošković Institute, Centre for Informatics and Computing. The paper includes some experiments carried out in the Natural Park of island Mljet and Molat (Croatia) (1). Results: This paper proposes a new distributed intelligent system for reliable forest-fire detection based on the integration of information from several distributed sensors and sources of information...|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis that}} {{broke out in}} August 2007 {{was caused by the}} fact that the market for {{collateralised}} debt obligations (CDOs) had grown to a size sufficient to wreak <b>general</b> <b>havoc</b> when it suddenly collapsed. One of the unresolved questions arising out of the subprime crisis concerns the precise role played by economic inequality. Several authors have argued that income inequality was a root cause of the crisis, but this has remained to date a minority view. This dissertation attempts to show that not only income inequality but also wealth concentration needs to be taken into account to make economic inequality truly prominent in the subprime crisis debate. To fulfil this task, income inequality and wealth concentration trends are shown, and existing Marxian, post-Keynesian, and mainstream crisis theories are discussed. The major contributions of this dissertation are however (i) to provide empirical evidence about the negative impact of investor demand on US long-term bond yields in the pre-crisis period, which gives support to the hypothesis that the increasing global demand for safe assets led to a 'search for yield' by investors; (ii) to present estimates about the specific contribution of high net worth individuals to this negative impact; and (iii) to show that after having helped to cause a yield problem in the major US debt markets, high net worth individuals (via hedge funds) continued to be a major source of the pressure on US banks to resolve this yield problem through the mass production of CDOs.
