5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe.

International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E

For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.|$|E
