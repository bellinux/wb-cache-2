25|$|Against the new calendar, the {{argument}} is made that inasmuch {{as the use of}} the Julian calendar was implicit in the decision of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea (325), no authority less than an Ecumenical Council may change this decision. However, the fact is that that Council made no decision or decree at all concerning the Julian calendar. Its silence constituted an implicit acceptance not of the Julian calendar, but of the civil calendar, which happened to be, at that time, the Julian calendar (the <b>explicit</b> <b>decision</b> of Nicaea being concerned, rather, with the date of Easter). By virtue of this, defenders of the new calendar argue that no decision by an Ecumenical Council was or is necessary today in order to revise (not abandon) the Julian calendar; and further, that by making the revision, the Church stays with the spirit of Nicaea I by keeping with the civil calendar in all its essentials—while conversely, failure to keep with the civil calendar could be seen as a departure from the spirit of Nicaea I in this respect. Lastly, it is argued that since the adoption of the new calendar evidently involves no change in or departure from the theological or the ethical teachings of Orthodox Christianity, but rather amounts to a merely disciplinary or administrative change—a clock correction of sorts—the authority to enact that change falls within the competency of contemporary, local episcopal authority. Implicit acceptance of this line of reasoning, or something very close to it, underlies the decision to adopt the new calendar by those Orthodox churches which have done so.|$|E

In another 2003 decision, the Administrative Court of Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity. In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate.|$|E

The Gen 75 Committee differed from other Gen committees in that its deliberations were not reported to the full Cabinet, and were shrouded in secrecy even at that level. The entire subject of nuclear weapons was kept off the full Cabinet agenda, and Cabinet ministers not attending the meetings may not have even known of its existence.|$|E
40|$|Patients and clinicians do {{not often}} agree {{on whether a}} {{decision}} has been made about cancer care. This could be explained by factors related to communication quality and/or the type of decision being made. We used a self-developed coding scheme to code a random sample of 128 encounters in which patients and clinicians either agreed (n= 64) or disagreed (n= 64) that a cancer care decision was made and tested for associations between concordance and key communication behaviours. We also identified and characterized cancer care decisions by topic and level of patient involvement and looked for trends. We identified 378 cancer care decisions across 128 encounters. <b>Explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> were most commonly made about topics wherein decision control could be easily delegated to a clear and present expert (eg either the patient or the clinician). Related to this, level of patient involvement varied significantly by <b>decision</b> topic. <b>Explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> were rarely made in an observable way about social, non-clinical or self-management related topics, although patients and clinicians both reported having made a cancer care decision in encounters where no decisions were observed. We found no association between communication behaviours and concordance in our sample. What counts as a "decision" in cancer care may be constructed within disparate social roles that leave many agendas unaddressed and decisions unmade. Changing the content of conversations to encourage <b>explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> about self-management and life context-related topics may have greater value in enabling shared understanding than promoting communication behaviours among already high-performing communicator...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a formal dialogue game for adjudication dialogues. Existing AI & law models of legal dialogues and argumentation-theoretic models of persuasion are extended with a neutral third party, {{to give a}} more realistic account of the adjudicator's role in legal procedures. The main feature of the model is a division into an argumentation phase, where the adversaries plea their case and the adjudicator has a largely mediating role, and a decision phase, where the adjudicator decides the dispute {{on the basis of}} the claims, arguments and evidence put forward in the argumentation phase. The model allows for <b>explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> on admissibility of evidence and burden of proof by the adjudicator in the argumentation phase. Adjudication is modelled as putting forward arguments, in particular undercutting and priority arguments, in the decision phase. The model reconciles logical aspects of burden of proof induced by the defeasible nature of arguments with dialogical aspects of burden of proof as something that can be allocated by <b>explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> on legal grounds. ...|$|R

50|$|A key thought {{area that}} {{separates}} the development of cultural economics from traditional economics is a difference in how individuals arrive at their decisions. While a traditional economist will view decision making as having both implicit and explicit consequences, a cultural economist would argue that an individual will not only arrive at their decision based on these implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> but based on trajectories. These trajectories consist of regularities, which have been built up throughout the years and guide individuals in their decision-making process.|$|R

Although some scattered researches about strategy determining have been conducted in Iran, the purpose of them is to recognize the future of IT and determine a framework for strategy determining. This paper examines the situation of Iran in IT. First, according to the techniques of the strategy formulation, the most important internal and external factors have been identified, then using matrix strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, the organizational strategies have been developed. Fuzzy ANP Methods were used for quantitative analysis. The results were calculated using the Expert Choice Software. Statistical community of this study will be including the {{experts in the field}} collected among 400 experts. According to the results, the best strategy for implementation ST Strategy. Therefore, some strategies should be considered such as: <b>Explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> to expand or change of research program, selecting an independent organization as trustee of futures studies projects, <b>explicit</b> <b>decisions</b> to expand or change of research program, definition and implementation of future studies for appropriate infrastructure...|$|R

In molecular studies, a primary problem is in producing a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) between the genes or amino acid sequences of interest. Progressive sequence alignment methods produce a phylogenetic tree by necessity because they incorporate new sequences into the calculated alignment in order of genetic distance.|$|R

5000|$|Using the {{relationship}} with the user as the criterion, Haettenschwiler differentiates passive, active, and cooperative DSS. A passive DSS is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out <b>explicit</b> <b>decision</b> suggestions or solutions. An active DSS can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A cooperative DSS allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.|$|E
50|$|The {{presentation}} of clarifying {{information is not}} always immediately accessible. In these situations, adults seem to delay interpretation and seek clarifying information when appropriate. Even more difficult than acknowledging that an ambiguous situation has arisen, is children’s understanding in what actions {{they need to take}} for clarification. There are 2 different types of delay in interpreting ambiguous information: one that is intentional and one that is instinctual. The <b>explicit</b> <b>decision</b> to delay interpretation and seek further information is a difficult one as it involves being aware that the current information is not sufficient, and knowing how to acquire appropriate information necessary for clarification. Children are typically not successful in this process until the age of 7. However, when this <b>explicit</b> <b>decision</b> to delay is simplified, children aged 5 and up showed some ability in successfully choosing to delay their response. While the ability for intentionally delaying interpretation seems to be difficult, the ability to delay interpretation instinctively seems to be easier for young children. In one example, children were asked to stamp the correct snowman once they knew which one it was. Their knowledge of the correct snowman was based on a researcher slowly revealing the target snowman. The children’s cards contained snowmen that differed by some feature visible on the 2nd half of the snowman only and therefore the children were required to wait until the 2nd half of the snowman was revealed in order to accurately assess which snowman was the correct one. In this scenario focusing on instinct, children as young as 5 were able to accurately delay interpretation. Therefore, while it is difficult for children to explicitly demonstrate their awareness of an ambiguous situation and how to resolve it, they are implicitly able to handle situations in which delaying interpretation may be beneficial.|$|E

In the present study, we attempted to re-examine the vowel-size relationship in two experiments using speeded classification tasks. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that participants associated the vowels with a bigger/smaller image even when they were not motivated to pronounce the vowels during the task. The results of Experiment 2 indicate that the proprioception of the absolute size of the mouth may not contribute to the vowel-size relationship.

At {{the beginning of the}} muraling project in 1976, Baca began work alongside 80 young people who had been referred to the program by the criminal justice department. For Baca, this marling project was about more than just painting a mural, but rather about investing in the community in ways that had not been done before. Baca took the lead on the project by interviewing people about their lives, family histories, ancestry, and stories they remembered hearing from their older relatives, as well as consulting history experts. From this, she was able to create the design for the mural. Some of the events portrayed in the mural constituted the first time they had ever been displayed in public, including but not limited to the Dust Bowl Journey, Japanese American internment during World War II, Zoot Suit Riots, and the Freedom Bus Rides.|$|E
