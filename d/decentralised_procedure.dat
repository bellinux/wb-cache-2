40|$|The {{regulatory}} system for medicinal products includes {{the existence of}} a legislative framework and a medicines agency as the regulatory body. The legislative framework for medicinal products has been amended several times so as to align it with the EU acquis communautaire, where medicinal products represent one of the best regulated and aligned areas. For the purpose of regulating the Croatian medicines market, the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices was established in 2003 to implement the procedure of granting marketing authorisation for medicinal products, to supervise the adverse reactions of medicinal products, to conduct laboratory tests of the quality of medicines and vaccines sampled from the market, to issue licences for the manufacture and distribution of medicinal products, to monitor medicine consumption, and to inform about medicines and promote their rational use. Medical devices are regulated under a special act, and the Agency conducts entries into the register in that field and carries out vigilance over medical devices. In this way, products intended for health care on the Croatian market are of the appropriate quality, safety and efficacy, and are under the constant supervision of the competent body that assesses their risk-to-benefit ratio. Upon accession of the Republic of Croatia to full membership in the European Union, the Agency will be included in the European authorisation procedures for medicines, such as the centralised procedure in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and above all, the mutual recognition procedure and <b>decentralised</b> <b>procedure</b> in which the role of the agencies of EU Member States is greater.

40|$|Patients {{may benefit}} from new uses for old drugs. Competent {{authorities}} such as the European Medicines Agency evaluate the quality, efficacy and safety of a medicinal product for the use in a well-defined therapeutic indication. Innovations may continue upon the approval, for example through the licensing of new therapeutic indications or dosage forms, which {{is also known as}} post-innovation innovation. The development of new therapeutic indications for existing drugs, could allow for a quicker and cheaper drug development by the utilisation of existing knowledge. The aim of the present thesis was to provide insight in the performance of the drug regulatory system for medicines in the post-innovation phase of their life cycle. Special interest {{has been paid to the}} period after the approval of the first generic product version of a drug: the post-generic phase. That occasion may significantly affect the intellectual property prospects of a drug and may limit the opportunities to make a return on investments for further innovations. First, we showed through two studies that in the European Union’s <b>Decentralised</b> <b>Procedure</b> and the Mutual Recognition procedure, which are frequently used to obtain approval for generic medicinal products, licensing failure occurred in about 1 out of 10 licensing procedures. The reasons for licensing failure varied widely and were both of a drug quality and clinical nature. It was also concluded that increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via both procedures. Subsequently, we studied to what extent the drug regulatory system allowed for innovation during the post-innovation phase of the drug life cycle. We showed that extensions of the indication of already licensed medicinal products were mainly authorised a few years before approval of the first generic product version and ceased thereafter. On the contrary we found that old drugs were licensed as new medicinal products approved for new therapeutic indications or other innovations. A case study indicated that the viability of the business case for the development of such medicines may depend on a specific window of opportunity within a therapeutic area and the possibility to establish a period of relative exclusivity. We also demonstrated that after approval of a first generic product version the number of clinical trials with those drugs decreased but a considerable amount of clinical research still remained. Our analysis of the EU legislation and case-law of the European Court of Justice showed that the need for prior market approval has consistently been considered to be the general rule of the EU legislation on medicinal products; also for post-innovation innovation. However, we observed a clinical need for unlicensed pharmacy preparations and off-label use, while there are even more potential new uses. These observations in combination with society’s struggle with the need to license new uses of existing drugs and the lack of adequate incentives to do so, suggests that the drug regulatory system is under pressure. Regulatory reform is needed to enhance post-innovation innovation and use every drug to its full potential...|$|E

Furthermore we stipulate that biocidal active substances which are nano particles are treated as separate active substances with own identities.

The import of articles treated with biocidal active substances into the European market should only be allowed, if the active substance is approved for their biocidal use within the EU. Finally we suggest to implement an obligation to report the market shares or consumption rates of biocidal active substances and products.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the outcomes of marketing authorisation applications via the mutual recognition and <b>decentralised</b> <b>procedures</b> (MRP/DCP) and assess determinants of licensing failure during CMDh referral procedures. METHODS: All MRP/DCP procedures to the Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures-human (CMDh) during the period from January 2006 to December 2013 were analysed. Reasons for starting referral procedures were scored. In addition, a survey under pharmaceutical companies was performed to estimate the frequency of licensing failure prior to CMDh referrals. RESULTS: During the study period, 10392 MRP/DCP procedures were finalized. Three hundred seventy-seven (3. 6 %) resulted in a referral procedure, of which 70 (19 %) resulted in licensing failure, defined as refusal or withdrawal of the application. The frequency of CMDh referrals decreased from 14. 5 % in 2006 to 1. 6 % in 2013. Of all referrals, 272 (72 %) were resolved through consensus within the CMDh, the remaining 105 (28 %) were resolved at the level of the CHMP. Most referrals were started because of objections raised about the clinical development program. Study design issues and objections about the demonstration of equivalence were most likely to result in licensing failure. An estimated 11 % of all MRP/DCP procedures resulted in licensing failure prior to CMDh referral. CONCLUSION: Whereas the absolute number of MRP/DCP procedures resulting in a referral has reduced substantially over the past years, no specific time trend could be observed regarding the frequency of referrals resulting in licensing failure. Increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via the MRP/DCP...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{approaches}} {{for the nearest}} neighbor search problem {{is to build a}} network which nodes correspond to the given set of indexed objects. In this case the search of the closest object can be thought as a search of a node in a network. A procedure in a network is called decentralized if it uses only local information about visited nodes and its neighbors. Networks, which structure allows efficient performing the nearest neighbour search by a <b>decentralised</b> search <b>procedure</b> started from any node, are of particular interest especially for pure distributed systems. Several algorithms that construct such networks have been proposed in literature. However, the following questions arise: "Are there network models in which decentralised search can be performed faster?"; "What are the optimal networks for the decentralised search?"; "What are their properties?". In this paper we partially give answers to these questions. We propose a mathematical programming model for the problem of determining an optimal network structure for decentralized nearest neighbor search. We have found an exact solution for a regular lattice of size 4 x 4 and heuristic solutions for sizes from 5 x 5 to 7 x 7. As a distance function we use L 1, L 2 and L_inf metrics. We hope that our results and the proposed model will initiate study of optimal network structures for decentralised nearest neighbour search...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{comparatively}} {{explore how}} the politicisation {{of criminal justice}} would appear in several new democracies with the institutional combination of presidentialism and a civil-law prosecution system, {{by focusing on the}} strategic interaction between an incumbent president and prosecutors, in South Korea and Russia, in the new institutionalist perspective. Civil-law prosecutors could damage particular politicians’ moral foundations with specific timing and extent, manipulating criminal proceedings through their broad power within the centralised criminal procedure. This is why they must be cautiously checked by any other body of government, contrary to their common-law counterparts who exercise a limited power due to the <b>decentralised</b> criminal <b>procedure.</b> Fortunately, in most civil-law countries, prosecutors are accountable to democratic bodies, in spite of the global tendency of judicial independence. Also in practice, civil-law prosecutors have not often been involved in the politicisation of criminal justice, despite their extensive influence over criminal procedure, in the continental European countries wherein the tradition of parliamentary supremacy is strong. By contrast, in new democracies with the institutional combination between a civil-law prosecution system and presidentialism, prosecutors have often taken partisan behaviour in favour of or against an incumbent president. For instance, two South Korean Presidents, Young-sam Kim and Dae-jung Kim, and Russian President Boris Yel’tsin, had exploited civil-law prosecutors for the politicisation of criminal justice, but were faced with their defection immediately before their retirement. Unusually, only Vladimir Putin could avoid this unfortunate fate, even at the last phase of his tenure, among the South Korean and Russian Presidents after democratisation. According to this study, high-ranking prosecutors generally pursued their own career advancement, and consequently the prosecution service was loyal to an incumbent president during most of his tenure, but betray him in his last phase, during South Korean President Young-sam Kim’s and Dae-jung Kim’s periods, and in Russian President Yel’tsin’s period. Only in the Russian President Putin period in the two countries after democratisation, prosecutors unusually continued to serve the president even when he left the presidency. This could be because they had no incentive to betray the outgoing president in order to further their career development under the next presidency, given that Putin would undoubtedly maintain a strong political influence over their careers, even after his retirement, according to this research. On the other hand, South Korean President Moo-hyun Roh frequently came into conflict with prosecutors, and had his close allies investigated or even indicted by them, during his entire period, while repeatedly attempting major reform against the civil-law prosecution service, which President Young-sam Kim and Dae-jung Kim had abandoned, {{in order to maintain the}} alliance with the power apparatus. According to this study, prosecutors made their organisational resistance based on their far-reaching power over criminal procedure, against President Moo-hyun Roh, for protecting their great prerogative, and therefore he failed in the reform. By contrast, Russian President Putin was exceptionally successful in large-scale reform against civil-law prosecutors, which not only President Yel’tsin but Putin himself in his first term had also suspended, by establishing the new ‘investigative committee’ in June 2007. According to this research, this outcome was possible because the prosecutors could no longer enjoy the political opportunity structure enabling them to effectively defeat the president’s reform against their collective interests, and consequently President Putin could circumvent their organisational resistance, in the absence of political competition under his electoral authoritarian regime. This study provides three important academic implications. Firstly, under the institutional combination of presidentialism and a civil-law prosecution system, prosecutors are not likely to preserve political neutrality, but to display a partisan behaviour either in favour of or against an incumbent government. That is, the institutional factor of combination of a civil-law prosecution system and presidentialism tends to induce the prosecution service, as a judicial body, to behave differently from the expectations of both the democrats and the liberals. Secondly, the variation of political competition can seldom influence judicial officers, who are responsible to the other branches of government, to behave independently of politicians, but can influence them, especially the top rankers, to betray an incumbent government in the last phase of its tenure on specific institutional and political conditions. Thirdly, and most importantly, the variation of political competition can influence judicial officers to take collective action for protecting their collective interests. In particular, if the judicial officers could exercise far-reaching power over criminal procedure, as civil-law prosecutors, their organisational resistance against an incumbent government which pushes for reform encroaching on their collective interests, such as prerogative powers, would be threatening enough to make the incumbent abandon the reform plan. ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{recruitment}} of health workers in remotely located areas has recently become a crucial policy concern of many countries. There {{is currently a}} universal consensus that increasing access to health workers in such underserved areas will not only help countries address the imbalanced distribution of health workers but also improve the population’s health outcomes based on the values, principles and approaches of primary health care which place emphasis on universal access to quality health care services. To date, there is no comprehensive measure that will suit country specific estimation {{of the nature and}} magnitude of the problem of unequal distribution of health workers. There is some evidence emerging in many low-income countries on what determines health workers’ practice location choices. The importance of financial and non-financial interventions in attracting health workers to work in underserved remote areas of many countries has been extensively documented. However, there is lack of evidence on the effectiveness of financial and non-financial interventions that countries can implement to increase the share of health workers in underserved areas and thus reverse the growing trend of unequal distribution of health workers. There is also a huge body of literature on health sector reforms and particularly decentralisation but very {{little is known about the}} implications of these reforms for recruitment and distribution of health workers in remotely located areas. In the light of these aspects, the present PhD research aimed to accomplish three objectives. The first was to describe the nature and magnitude of the problem, suggest and apply additional needs indicators in order to provide more sensible indicators of health care needs for the comprehensive measurement of the magnitude of distributional inequalities of health workforce in a resource limited setting (Paper I). The second objective was to describe and assess the organization of the recruitment processes (decentralised vs centralised) in relation to their implications for distribution and retention of health workers in remotely located health facilities of Tanzania (Paper II). The final objective was to analyse how strongly financial and nonfinancial incentives (housing and education) might affect health workers willingness to work in remote areas of Tanzania, and how strongly the level of financial incentives needed to attract health workers to work in remote areas is affected by health workers characteristics such as geographic origin, their intrinsic motivation and other personal characteristics (Paper III). The details of methodology regarding sampling, data collection and analysis are described in the respective papers attached in this thesis. In Paper I the main finding indicates that there exist huge inequalities in the distribution of health workers between urban and rural districts of Tanzania. Inequalities are perceptible both when the conventional per capita norm is used and when under five mortality is used as an additional indicator of need. There are also skill- mix inequalities indicating that districts with fewer health workers per capita do also tend to have a fewer number of highly trained health workers such as doctors and specialists. Inequalities are also perceptible across urban and rural districts. Distributional inequalities tend to be more pronounced when under-five deaths are used as an indicator of health care needs. Conversely, if health care needs are measured by HIV prevalence, the distributional inequalities tend to decline. In Paper II it was shown that {{recruitment of}} health workers under a decentralised arrangement is characterised by complex and bureaucratic procedures, severe delays and sometimes failure to recruit the required health workers. This may further aggravate the existing inequalities in the distribution of health workers. The paper further indicates that recruitment of highly trained health workers in remote areas might not only be difficult but also expensive. In addition, decentralised recruitment was perceived to be more effective in recruiting and retaining lower cadre health workers from within the districts than the centralised recruitment arrangement. Conversely, centralised recruitment was perceived to be more effective (than <b>decentralised</b> recruitment <b>procedures)</b> in both recruiting highly skilled workers and balancing their distribution across remote and urban districts but not as effective in ensuring their retention. Results from Paper III indicate that, without any interventions, 19 % of nurses were willing to work in remote places. With provision of free housing, this share increased by 15 percentage points, while better education opportunities increased the share by 28 percentage points from the baseline. In order for a salary top up to have the same effect as provision of free housing, the top up needed to be between 80 % and 100 % of the base salary. Similarly, for salary top ups to have the same effect as provision of better education opportunities the top up needed to be between 120 % and 140 %. Nurses who have a very remote origin (i. e. his/her origin being more remote than the remoteness of the expected working place) had on average a 55 % (p< 0. 005) lower reservation wage than others. This finding might suggest two things. Firstly, students with a strong remote background are more willing to work in remote areas than others. Secondly, students need to be picked from really remote places (more remote than the place that policy makers may want to send them) in order for this variable to have an impact on the reservation wage. Those classified with high intrinsic motivation had on average a 30 % (p< 0. 000) lower reservation wage than others. Having children was not significantly associated with the reservation wage, while having dependants other than children was associated with an 18 % (p< 0. 06) increase in the reservation wage. The data presented in this thesis permits a number of conclusions. Firstly, relying solely on the conventional ways (using the per capita norm) of measuring imbalances tends to lead one into missing out a lot of relevant information for a comprehensive and a sensible estimate of the magnitude of the inequalities in the distribution of health workers. Population levels, although still useful as an indicator of health care needs in measuring distributional imbalances, is flawed for it makes the inherent assumption that disease burdens and thus health care needs are uniformly distributed. This is not the case in many settings (Paper I). Secondly, since the recruitment systems (decentralised or centralised) have been shown to be a crucial factor that can hinder or facilitate the recruitment of health workers in underserved remote areas, combining the strengths of each system seem to add to the efforts of increasing recruitment of health workers in remotely located health facilities (Paper II). Finally, the thesis concludes that nurses’ practice- location decisions in Tanzania are partly shaped by the effects of financial and nonfinancial incentives. Specific educational interventions are more effective in attracting nurses to remote areas than housing. Substantial top ups are needed in order for the salary factor to have the same effect as alternative interventions. In order for remote recruitment to be effective in reducing the need for incentives to attract nurses to remote areas, health workers need to be recruited from places that are more remote than the places supposed to be their work stations...|$|R
