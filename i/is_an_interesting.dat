Beta Aurigae <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1822 as Agaricus indigo by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz, the species was later {{transferred to the}} genus Lactarius in 1838 by the Swede Elias Magnus Fries. German botanist Otto Kuntze called it Lactifluus indigo in his 1891 treatise Revisio Generum Plantarum, but the suggested name change was not adopted by others. Hesler and Smith in their 1960 study of North American species of Lactarius defined L.indigo as the type species of subsection Caerulei, a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky, blue cap. In 1979, they revised their opinions on the organization of subdivisions in the genus Lactarius, and instead placed L.indigo in subgenus Lactarius based on the color of latex, and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air. As they explained:The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> phenomenon deserving further study. The climax is reached in L.indigo which is blue throughout. L.chelidonium and its variety chelidonioides, L.paradoxus, and L. hemicyaneus may be considered as mileposts {{along the road to}} L.indigo.|$|E

5|$|The tall flint {{tower of}} StMichael's at Ocklynge {{is one of}} Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built {{on the site of}} the mission hall where the {{nonsense}} writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his holidays in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely proportioned building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. The Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red brick walls. Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings, including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road. The copyrights of many well-known hymns used in the English-speaking world are handled by Kingway's Thankyou Music of Eastbourne. There is a tradition of Judaism in Eastbourne, and a Jewish rest home. The Islamic community uses a small mosque that was formerly the Seeboard social club.|$|E

25|$|Many human tumors {{occur because}} of dysregulation of mTOR signaling, and can confer higher {{susceptibility}} to inhibitors of mTOR. Deregulations of multiple {{elements of the}} mTOR pathway, like PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1, and eIF4E overexpression have been related to many types of cancers. Therefore, mTOR <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> therapeutic target for treating multiple cancers, both the mTOR inhibitors themselves or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways.|$|E

25|$|The {{conjugate}} base of oxalic acid is the hydrogenoxalate anion, and its {{conjugate base}} (oxalate) is a competitive inhibitor of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. LDH catalyses {{the conversion of}} pyruvate to lactic acid (end product of the fermentation (anaerobic) process) oxidising the coenzyme NADH to NAD+ and H+ concurrently. Restoring NAD+ levels {{is essential to the}} continuation of anaerobic energy metabolism through glycolysis. As cancer cells preferentially use anaerobic metabolism (see Warburg effect) inhibition of LDH has been shown to inhibit tumor formation and growth, thus <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> potential course of cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{wind tunnel}} used by German {{scientists}} at Peenemünde {{prior to and}} during WWII <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> example of the difficulties associated with extending the useful range of large wind tunnels. It used some large natural caves which were increased in size by excavation and then sealed to store large volumes of air which could then be routed through the wind tunnels. This innovative approach allowed lab research in high-speed regimes and greatly accelerated the rate of advance of Germany's aeronautical engineering efforts. By {{the end of the}} war, Germany had at least three different supersonic wind tunnels, with one capable of Mach 4.4 (heated) airflows.|$|E
