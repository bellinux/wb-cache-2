During <b>her</b> <b>interview,</b> Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as clothing was at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{programme}} {{included three}} interviews, each lasting around 15 minutes. It was customary {{for the first}} two guests to remain after their own chats to observe and occasionally participate in those that followed. Such contributions were usually made respectfully, and when invited, though this policy backfired on occasion. In addition, some Hollywood stars were honoured in receiving a solo spot, Russell Crowe being one example. On occasion, an episode featured a single guest for its entire duration if the subject was deemed to be sufficiently deserving. This was the case in 2005 when Madonna appeared as part of her Hung Up Promo Tour; besides <b>her</b> <b>interview</b> she performed two songs.|$|E

25|$|Alex Youngs's {{passion for}} music began {{at a very}} early age and was nurtured by her family. Her Grandmother would {{regularly}} bring her and her brother, to attend concerts at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center that inspired her to pursue her career. This diverse range of music she was exposed to at an early age profoundly influences her work. Alex Young's artistry combines dancing, singing and acting and is incorporated into all of her performances. Her love of jazz, bossa nova, and the blues is clear in much of her Pop styling. Young's music is a fusion between pop and dance with some shades of funk, according to <b>her</b> <b>interview</b> with Cosmogirl. During her PBS interview with Emmy Award-winning television news anchor, and Star-Ledger columnist Steve Adubato on OneonOne she stated that when she was young, she used to listen to different styles of music like jazz standards, classical and bossa nova. The artists who have inspired her music are Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, June London, Frank Sinatra, Prince and Britney Spears.|$|E
25|$|After McCain {{announced}} Palin as {{his running}} mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers, {{as some of the}} media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her. Among the reasons that the news organizations criticized the restrictions was Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews. <b>Her</b> <b>interview</b> five days later with Fox News's Sean Hannity focuses on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview. However, Palin's performance in her third interview, with Katie Couric of CBS News, was widely criticized. Palin's responses to several of Couric's questions were considered embarrassing, most notably failing to name any newspapers she read. The fallout from the interview prompted a decline in her poll numbers, concern among Republicans that she was becoming a political liability, and calls from some conservative commentators for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket. Other conservatives remain ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism. Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.|$|E

2500|$|Chung's {{interviews}} were largely gentle, but often they were punctuated by a rapid-fire barrage of sharp questions. Despite this, <b>her</b> <b>interviews</b> were still {{widely recognized as}} being decidedly softer than those of other interviewers, such as Barbara Walters or Mike Wallace. Consequently, <b>her</b> <b>interviews</b> were often used as a public relations move by those looking to overcome scandal or controversy. Some of <b>her</b> more famous <b>interview</b> subjects include Claus von Bülow and U.S. Representative Gary Condit, whom Chung interviewed first after the Chandra Levy disappearance. Chung was the first journalist to interview basketball legend Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson after he went public about being HIV-positive.|$|R
