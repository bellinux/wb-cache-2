25|$|Sertraline is {{associated}} with a significantly higher incidence of diarrhea than other SSRIs, especially at higher doses. Agonists of the σ1 receptor such as <b>igmesine</b> have been found to inhibit intestinal secretion and bacteria-induced secretory diarrhea in animal studies, and <b>igmesine</b> showed preliminary evidence of efficacy for the treatment of diarrhea in a small clinical trial. Sertraline is the only SSRI that acts as an antagonist of the σ1 receptor, so this action could in theory be responsible for its higher relative incidence of diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Igmesine</b> (JO-1,784) is a sigma {{receptor}} agonist (IC50 = 39 nM (rat brain)). It has neuroprotective and antidepressant-like effects in animal studies, {{as well as}} nootropic effects in models of age-related cognitive decline. In two phase II clinical trials, <b>igmesine</b> {{was found to be}} effective in the treatment of depression and was as active as the comparator fluoxetine. However, in a large phase III clinical trial, <b>igmesine</b> failed to show significant effectiveness for depression. The drug has not been developed further.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Cholera toxin, and Escherichia coli {{heat labile}} (LT) and heat stable (STa) enterotoxins induce small {{intestinal}} secretion {{in part by}} activating enteric nerves. <b>Igmesine</b> is a novel sigma receptor ligand that inhibits neurally mediated secretion.  AIMS—To assess the antisecretory potential of <b>igmesine</b> in cholera toxin, LT, and STa induced water and electrolyte secretion using an in vivo rat model of jejunal perfusion.  METHODS—After pretreatment with <b>igmesine,</b> 0. 03 - 10 mg/kg intravenously, jejunal segments of anaesthetised, adult male Wistar rats were incubated with cholera toxin (25  µg), LT (25  µg), or saline. Jejunal perfusion with a plasma electrolyte solution containing a non-absorbable marker was undertaken. In some cases 200  µg/l STa {{was added to the}} perfusate. After equilibration, net water and electrolyte movement was determined. In additional experiments rats received <b>igmesine,</b> intravenously or intrajejunally, after exposure to cholera toxin.  RESULTS—Cholera toxin induced net water secretion was inhibited by 1  mg/kg <b>igmesine</b> (median − 120 versus − 31 µl/min/g, p< 0. 001). LT and STa induced secretion were also inhibited by 1  mg/kg <b>igmesine</b> (− 90 versus − 56, p< 0. 03; and − 76 versus − 29, p< 0. 01, respectively). <b>Igmesine</b> reduced established cholera toxin induced secretion.  CONCLUSION—The sigma ligand, <b>igmesine,</b> inhibits neurally mediated enterotoxigenic secretion. Its ability to inhibit established secretion makes it an agent with therapeutic potential.    Keywords: igmesine; cholera toxin; Escherichia coli enterotoxin; jejunal secretio...|$|E
40|$|Stress during {{pregnancy}} results in complex neurochemical and behavioral alterations throughout the offspring lifetime. We here examined {{the impact of}} prenatal stress (PS) on memory functions in male and female offspring and report the efficacy of a selective sigma 1 (σ 1) receptor agonist, <b>igmesine,</b> in alleviating the observed deficits. Dams received an unpredictable 90 -min duration restraint stress from gestational day E 17 to E 20. Learning was examined in offspring between day P 24 and P 36 using spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, delayed alternation in the T-maze, water-maze learning and passive avoidance. Both male and female PS rats showed impairments of spontaneous and delayed alternation performances. Acquisition of a fixed platform position in the water-maze was unchanged in PS rats, but the probe test revealed a diminution {{of time spent in}} the training quadrant. Acquisition of a daily changing platform position demonstrated impaired working memory for male and female PS rats. Finally, passive avoidance deficits were observed. Pretreatment with the selective σ 1 agonist <b>igmesine</b> (1 – 10 mg kg− 1 i. p.) reversed the PS-induced learning deficits in offspring rats for each test. The σ 1 antagonist BD 1063 failed to affect performances alone but blocked the <b>igmesine</b> effect, confirming the involvement of the σ 1 receptor. PS thus induces delayed memory deficits, affecting spatial and nonspatial, short- and long-term memories in juvenile male and female offspring rats. Activation of the σ 1 neuromodulatory receptor allows a significant recovery of the memory functions in PS rats...|$|E
