25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those <b>guys.</b> <b>I</b> don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

50|$|The Montlhéry noble {{house was}} related to the Montmorency family; Thibaud, the founder of the Montlhéry dynasty, was the brother of Bouchard II, the {{progenitor}} of the Montmorency house. Thibaud ruled from 970 to 1031 and was succeeded by his son <b>Guy</b> <b>I,</b> who ruled until 1095. <b>Guy</b> <b>I's</b> children married into other local noble families: his daughter Melisende married Hugh, count of Rethel, and another daughter Elizabeth married Joscelin of Courtenay. Through these marriages and subsequent Montlhéry participation on the First Crusade, <b>Guy</b> <b>I</b> was the ancestor of the ruling dynasties of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Edessa. Another daughter, Alice, married into the Le Puiset family, and a son, Guy, became count of Rochefort. <b>Guy</b> <b>I</b> was succeeded by Milo I, followed by Milo's sons Guy II and Milo II. In 1118, after many disputes with the rebellious lords, Louis VI of France ordered the castle to be dismantled and turned the town into a royal residence. Louis VI had himself been married to a granddaughter of <b>Guy</b> <b>I,</b> Lucienne of Rochefort, from 1104 to 1107.|$|R

500|$|Aubrey was [...] "6-foot 2-inch with an {{incandescent}} smile" [...] with [...] "unrevealing polar blue eyes," [...] said The New York Times Magazine in 1964. The {{next year}} Life Magazine {{described him as}} [...] "youthful, handsome, brainy, with an incandescent smile, a quiet, somewhat salty wit and, when he cared to turn it on, considerable charm. He was always fastidiously turned out, from his Jerry the Barber haircut to his CBS-eye cuff links." [...] One producer said, [...] "Aubrey {{is one of the}} most insatiably curious <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> know." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Back to the Shack" [...] {{deals with}} the theme of nostalgia and a wish to return [...] "to [...] 1994 roots". Dave Lewis stated the song serves as a {{thematic}} continuation of two previous Weezer songs, [...] "In the Garage" [...] and [...] "Memories". It also deals with Weezer's relationship with their fans and serves as [...] "basically an apology {{for the past two}} decades and a promise to embrace their nerdy roots." [...] The song's opening lines—"I'm sorry <b>guys,</b> <b>I</b> didn't realize that I needed you so much"—in particular reinforce this theme. The song has been categorized under alternative rock and power pop.|$|E

I worked with someone who used five separate computers, five separate anonymous identities...to refute any facts from the internet about the Church of Scientology." [...] She acknowledged that she set up multiple identities for use in this purpose online, [...] "I {{was in charge of}} setting up phony accounts on the Internet that were designed to shut down free speech by blocking out opponents' sites or trick-routing people to pro-Scientology sites when they were looking for opposing information." ...|$|E

500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{rested on}} December 29—the day {{following}} their final regular-season game. They began preparations {{for their first}} post-season game on Tuesday, December 30 through Thursday, January 1, before three days of weekend rest. Roethlisberger did not practice until Monday, January 5—Tomlin stated of the injury, [...] "We will proceed slowly with him because we have that luxury. But we feel comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through. Multiple Steelers stated that they would watch the games of the Wild Card round. Some including James Farrior and Ryan Clark watched as fans; however, Chris Hoke said, [...] "I will be watching the <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> am going against... That is how I watch it." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{month to}} recover from his wounds, Kizirian rejoined his unit, which was {{assigned}} to Sugar Loaf Hill. The Marines battled over one ridge after another toward NaHa, the capital city. On three separate occasions Kizirian was tossed in the air by Japanese artillery and mortar fire while he provided covering fire for {{other members of his}} unit, who were retreating down a slope. Kizirian's company moved to a burial ground where Japanese soldiers were hiding in holes dug in the nearby hillsides. During the operation, someone yelled, [...] "Two over your head!" [...] Kizirian responded by killing both of the enemy combatants with his carbine. [...] Kizirian would later recall, [...] "I must have shot four clips into those <b>guys,</b> <b>I</b> got them before they got me." [...] Moments later, an enemy rushed towards Kizirian with a sword. Kizirian managed to kill the enemy with a pistol and took the sword.|$|E

500|$|Pat Buchanan, the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, {{a political science professor at}} the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those <b>guys.</b> <b>I</b> think they're so divisive." ...|$|E
500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical <b>guys.</b> <b>I</b> love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 1974. The budget was $1.5 million. Pre-production lasted one week, including casting. Grittier sequences were {{shot on the}} streets of New York City, while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros.' sound stages in Los Angeles. According to Bakshi, [...] "What I would do is dress guys up, live-action guys. Very strange dudes! The weirdest <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> could find. Having them talk to animated characters in front of candy stores, discussing girlfriends and such. It was very surrealistic." [...] Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences, with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals. Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro. Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation, with Bakshi setting up the premise of the scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue. During the [...] "rumble" [...] sequence, the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing, dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system.|$|E

500|$|After {{serving his}} {{suspension}} {{of the rest of}} the , Ron Artest returned to the Pacers at the beginning of the [...] After playing 16 games he demanded to be traded, and the Pacers put him on the injured list. The Pacers' Walsh said that Artest's demands were [...] "the last straw", and many Pacers players who had fought in the brawl to help their teammate felt betrayed. Jackson later said, [...] "I put my career on the line for him, going into the stands and fighting ... I lost $3 million [...] there was no 'thank you' or nothing." [...] After more than a month of inactivity, Indiana traded Artest to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojaković. Artest faced Ben Wallace for the first time after the fight in November 2006, and finally made his return to Detroit in January 2007. During the Kings' 91–74 loss to the Pistons, Artest was booed constantly, but there were no unusual incidents. After a year's stop with the Houston Rockets in the 2008–09 season, Artest signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning his first NBA championship in , Artest apologized to Jackson and other Pacers for being [...] "so young and egotistical", stating [...] "sometimes I feel like a coward when I see those guys. I'm on the Lakers, but I had a chance to win with you <b>guys.</b> <b>I</b> feel almost like a coward." [...] On September 16, 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.|$|E

50|$|The Dampierre family {{played an}} {{important}} role during the Middle Ages. They were Count of Flanders and later also Count of Nevers, Rethel, Artois and Franche-Comté. The senior line of the House died out with Margaret III. She was succeeded in Flanders, Artois, Nevers and Franche-Comté by her eldest son John the Fearless and in Rethel by her younger son Anthony, which marked the start of the House of Valois-Burgundy. The junior line, springing from a younger son of <b>Guy</b> <b>I</b> reigning in Namur, ended in 1429.
