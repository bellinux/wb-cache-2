5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his {{apartment}} – ostensibly for his computer – but left without it. A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui {{on the number}} of the person who called her last regarding Gui. A taxi driver answered, saying that four men had left the telephone in the taxi, and that they had wanted to go to Poipet, a border town in Cambodia. Gui was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. The Thai authorities have no record of Gui leaving the country. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol. The Guardian observed that the Thai government had done little to advance the case, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands.|$|E
5|$|Gui Minhai (桂民海, age 51) is a Swedish {{national}} {{and one of}} the three shareholders of Mighty Current. He was taken away from his home in Pattaya, Thailand by an unknown man on 17 October 2015. Gui had written some 200 books during his ten years as author/publisher. He kept his movements to himself and his communications routed, and his work projects would also be shrouded in secrecy. Gui has not set foot inside the PRC for a long period – he never attended to his father when he was ill, and did not return upon his death. It is known that his home in Thailand was later searched by four Chinese men, who attempted to seize Gui's computer. A manager from the estate where Gui lived, in an effort to contact Gui, dialled the number that last called her regarding Gui, to be told by a taxi driver that the four men, who had left the telephone in the taxi, wanted to go to a border town in Cambodia. He was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol, but the Guardian, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands, observed that the Thais had done little to advance the case. The Thai authorities have no record of him leaving the country.|$|E

5|$|James F. Reed {{made it out}} of the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> and {{recovering}} at Sutter's Fort, {{but each}} day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Frémont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company, in return for which Reed promised that he would join Frémont's forces and fight in the Mexican-American War. Reed was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party. The Harlan-Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter's Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season. The party of roughly 30horses and a dozen men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western side of the mountain, along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a pioneer couple, immigrants who had been separated from their company and were near starvation.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Star {{reported}} in November 2011 that SIS helped capture Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him {{along with his}} friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding {{out in the desert}} for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, to say <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe.</b> It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location. SIS agents using the £25million top-secret equipment closed in on him before calling in the Libyan snatch squad to apprehend him.|$|E

Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E

25|$|After his {{childhood}} in Troy, New York, and Rutland, Vermont, Jackson enlisted in October 1862 as a 19-year-old private in Company K of the 12th Vermont Infantry of the Union Army Jackson {{spent much of his}} free time sketching drawings of his friends and various scenes of Army camp life that he sent home to his family as his way of letting them know <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe.</b> He served in the American Civil War for nine months including one major battle, the Battle of Gettysburg. Jackson spent most of his tour on garrison duty and helped guard a supply train during the engagement. His regiment mustered out on July 14, 1863. Jackson then returned to Rutland, where he worked as an artistic painter in post-Civil War American society. Having broken his engagement to Miss Carolina Eastman, he left Vermont for the American West.|$|E
25|$|The murders {{sent the}} town of Texarkana {{into a state of}} panic {{throughout}} the summer. At dusk, city inhabitants heavily armed themselves and locked themselves indoors while police patrolled streets and neighborhoods. Although many businesses lost customers at night, stores sold out of guns, ammunition, locks, and many other protective devices. Several rumors began to spread, including that the killer was caught, or that a third and even fourth double-homicide had been committed. Most of the town hid in fear inside their houses or hotels, sometimes even leaving town. Some youths took matters in their own hands by trying to bait the Phantom so they could kill him. After three months of no more Phantom attacks, the Texas Rangers slowly and quietly left town to keep the Phantom from believing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> to strike again. The murders were reported nationally and internationally by several publications.|$|E

500|$|Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series {{against the}} NL-champion Boston Braves. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau {{appeared}} to have picked off the Braves' Phil Masi as he attempted to steal a base, but umpire Bill Stewart ruled <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe.</b> Masi scored the only run of the game on a Braves single. Despite surrendering just two hits on 85 pitches for the game, Feller and the Indians lost 1–0. Later, photographs showed that Boudreau had tagged Masi out by two feet. Feller said, [...] "Stewart was the only guy in the park {{who thought he was}} safe." [...] Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set an attendance record; the 86,288 fans in Cleveland was the then-largest attendance at a baseball game. The Braves put up three runs {{in the top of the}} first inning. The Indians came back to tie the game, but by the seventh inning the Braves regained the lead for good and Feller was removed from the game. He finished having allowed eight hits and seven earned runs. Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series championship. After the Indians returned to Cleveland and were given a victory parade, Feller said, [...] "This is as good as being President." ...|$|E

The next day he went head to head with more Zeros, damaging two before being forced to ditch on a reef with a smoking engine; once down he scrambled out of the cockpit and danced on the wing to let his comrades know <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>safe.</b> Jackson shot down his third victim on 17April. He achieved his fourth victory against another Zero on 24April, to become the highest Australian scorer in the Battle of Port Moresby. On 28April, John Jackson was shot down and killed while leading the interception of a Japanese raid; Les took over command of No.75 Squadron the next day. On 30April, the squadron was recalled to Australia to refit and regroup; Jackson flew one of its last remaining serviceable aircraft to Cairns, Queensland, on 9May.|$|E
