5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> the episode for several scenes {{in which the}} action is viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators were short on time, so {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|Mr Carkdale (John Grillo), {{the head}} of English, very rarely utters {{anything}} but expletives. Struggling to find a rationale for his character, Grillo paced {{up and down a}} rehearsal room carrying a brown briefcase, which <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> all of his own teachers carrying around, and shouting profanities.|$|E
5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{that very}} minute <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> something. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>he</b> had stopped {{collecting}} eggs. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>he</b> had resolved never to take another bird's egg.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> {{well that}} time--the look, the accent, the words, the effect they {{produced}} on him, his very surroundings. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> the narrow slanting {{deck of the}} brig, the silent sleeping coast, the smooth black surface of the sea with a great bar of gold laid on it by the rising moon. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> it all, and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> his feelings of mad exultation {{at the thought of}} that fortune thrown into his hands. He was no fool then, and he was no fool now. Circumstances had been against him; the fortune was gone, but hope remained.|$|R
60|$|The Baroness {{suddenly}} {{dropped her}} veil, {{but not before}} Wrayson had seen a sudden change in her face. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> suddenly that Heneage {{was no stranger to}} her, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> the embarrassment of their meeting at the Alhambra.|$|R
5|$|After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes {{and kills}} Henry. Glass uses Henry's corpse {{on his horse}} as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a {{riverbank}} where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream {{into the hands of}} the Arikara. The chief kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass. Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when they}} gather to congratulate {{the bride and}} groom, the friends joke {{that they should be}} able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss him like that first. Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could have {{happened}} had he apologized for being childish.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
60|$|Hunterleys {{was struck}} by the thought. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> several chance remarks of his wife. <b>He</b> <b>remembered,</b> too, the {{coincidence}} of his recent visits to the villa having prevented him in each case from acceding to some request of Violet's.|$|R
60|$|Then {{his head}} came through slowly with a {{surprised}} expression upon his face. <b>He</b> <b>remembered.</b> <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> the {{thing as a}} bald discovery, and without a touch of emotion. With all the achromatic clearness, the unromantic colourlessness of the early morning....|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas did know. We may {{say that}} he had known for some minutes past. He had {{perceived}} what was coming, and various recollections had floated across his mind. <b>He</b> especially <b>remembered</b> that £50 for the poor old women which Mr. Trigger only a week since had recommended that he should give,--and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> also that <b>he</b> had given it. He recollected the sum which he had already paid for his election expenses, as to which Mr. Trigger had been very careful to get the money before this new proposition was made. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> Mr. Pabsby and his cheque for £20. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> his broken arm, and that fortnight of labour and infinite vexation in the borough. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> all his hopes, and his girls' triumph. But <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> also that <b>he</b> had told himself a dozen times since his return that he wished that he might rid himself altogether of Percycross and the seat in Parliament. Now a proposition that would have this effect was made to him.|$|R
5|$|The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} by Alex Garner retells Raiden's {{role in the}} series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with Solidus is explored when <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> his past; when about to be killed by Solidus, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|The story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge {{had been}} closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and that the {{pressure}} to find somewhere to live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge {{and set up a}} squatters' town there. The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world's media. The town grew in a piecemeal fashion, built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations. At {{the end of the story}} Skinner has a dream in which <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> being at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge (Skinner is the first onto the bridge) and scaled the towers.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} his bar was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins to recall {{the events of that}} day. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> {{all about}} George Lechmere now. He had the {{reputation}} of being the best judge of cattle in the neighbourhood, and a thoroughly steady fellow, but he could see no resemblance in the shrunk and wasted face to that <b>he</b> <b>remembered.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aloysius de Sequeira couldn't {{recall the}} first {{thickening}} of Mathilde's long slender neck {{in the early}} years of their marriage, but <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> pouring his urgent breath and coconut flower toddy down her throat in the evenings when the constellations fizzed in the sky and his own white stars sparkled in Mathilde's dark bay; <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> her calling him her Wish; and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> that tide of their merging waters that rocked them, sometimes to sleep, sometimes towards the world beyond [...] ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{recovered}} himself--and <b>he</b> <b>remembered.</b> <b>He</b> addressed her steadily, yet {{with a growing}} coldness in his tone.|$|R
5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
5|$|Ruby {{starts to}} have {{feelings}} for Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis), Xavier is jealous and they drift apart. She tries to dump {{him but he}} is knocked unconscious and forgets what she told him. After a while <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> and their relationship ends. While seeing Geoff, Ruby starts to feel unwell and is diagnosed with diabetes. She later organises a rally to stop a number of refugees being deported, but the event is fire bombed by racists. After this event Geoff blames Ruby and leaves her and Summer Bay. She briefly reunites with Xavier but Mink Carpenter (Matylda Buczko) ruins it. Ruby later enlists Liam to become her music tutor. They form a strong friendship but Ruby starts to have feeling for him. Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) tells Liam, he agrees to keep tutoring her and tells her where they stand. Although Liam tells her {{they will not be}} together, she lets her feelings develop into love for Liam and tries to kiss him. He tells her again that it is wrong and decides to put some space between them. Ruby kisses Casey, but she later reveals she really wants to be with Romeo. She has sex with Romeo, but is devastated when he rejects her. She tells Charlie that she wants to hurt Romeo like he hurt her and tells Indigo about their one-night stand. Ruby then begins a relationship with Casey. She is devastated when Charlie dies, after being shot. Ruby blames Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) for her mother's death and she pushes Casey away and their relationship ends.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remembered,</b> further, that <b>he</b> {{had often}} cut that little visit short, {{conveying}} the impression to her, even while he clasped her, of how busy he was. And <b>he</b> <b>remembered,</b> more than once, the certain little wistful shadow {{on her face}} as she slipped away.|$|R
6000|$|... "But others knew it. Colonel Starbottle {{must have}} known his name? And yet"--as <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>he</b> stammered--"he refused to tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{heard the}} explanation! Bill's cayuse forgot he wasn't in his proper place. When <b>he</b> <b>remembered,</b> <b>he</b> {{tried to get}} there." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
25|$|When Ramesh {{finds out}} Devaraja was {{actually}} trying to kill the criminals who defiled his sister, he is full of remorse. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> when Devaraja warned {{him that he would}} regret knowing the truth.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hemphill <b>remembered</b> Lieutenant Asher, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> {{going to}} his house, but <b>he</b> did not <b>remember</b> seeing there a little girl.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> this as <b>he</b> went to pay {{his daily}} call on Old Mr. Toad in the Smiling Pool and listen to his sweet song. He hadn't seen any little Toads this year, but <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> his {{experiences}} with them in other years, and he meant to ask about them.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> it. <b>He</b> also <b>remembered</b> {{that his}} father's house still existed, {{though it was}} tenantless, his father and Miss Martha having gone up to see friends at the Mountain.|$|R
25|$|The last {{mention of}} Gastria before 1453 {{comes from a}} Russian pilgrim, who visited the City during {{the second quarter of}} the fifteenth century. <b>He</b> <b>remembers</b> a nunnery placed near the Golden Gate, where the relics of Saint Euphemia and Saint Eudokia were venerated. This {{building}} could well be identified with Gastria.|$|E
25|$|After Torque defeats the creature, <b>he</b> <b>remembers</b> the murders, {{realizing that}} {{he was the one who}} killed his family; he smashed his wife's head in, drowned his {{youngest}} son, and threw his eldest son from the window. When the coast guard arrives, Torque transforms into his monster state and kills him, before running back into the woods of Carnate.|$|E
25|$|Ichihachi is an {{entertainer}} at a geisha house and professes {{his devotion to}} Ume, one of the geisha.

6000|$|... "Why do you ask?" [...] inquired Rinkitink, uneasy at the {{question}} because <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>he</b> {{had not seen the}} little Prince of Pingaree that morning.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> the spelling, and was {{a little}} downcast.|$|R
