But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for a bit of cover and as it happened I did stall him and he didn't score that one. I was the player he made a fool of if anybody needs to remember." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> round for {{an empty}} table, {{when a man}} jumped up and came towards me, {{registering}} joy as if I had been his long-lost sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] {{said the}} Kid gently, [...] "I reckon not. I {{never saw it}} before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at it. Not {{thinking}} of selling it, are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hullo!' bawled Blockhead-Hans, 'here <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> what <b>I</b> {{found on}} the road!'--and he showed them a dead crow which he had picked up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will <b>be</b> ready presently. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> {{round to}} decide on what to take. Be seated, please, while I look over this pile of sketches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We are not ill met, then,' {{said the}} man who <b>was</b> driving, 'for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{the kind of man}} who can do that, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> out for such an apprentice. Get up behind with you,' he said to the boy, and off the horse went with them {{straight}} up into the air.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> {{around to}} see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on {{to be in a}} hell of a hurry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] stammered the captain, [...] "I know I did, but I hadnâ€™t. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> ahead a bit, {{that was}} all. I {{went to the}} bureau just now to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said. [...] "I've an idea. I'm taking Miss Strong and {{a friend}} to the 'Gaiety.' We want a fourth, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> round for a man. Come with us." ...|$|E
5000|$|A double stress {{fracture}} {{in his back}} kept Griffiths out {{for a couple of}} months, but he was offered a six-month contract extension by new manager Paul Jewell. [...] "Obviously <b>I</b> <b>am</b> delighted," [...] he said in the Suffolk Free Press. [...] "It was the best outcome I could have hoped for. It is the worst injury I have had and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> forward to getting fit as soon as possible and pushing on from there.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ship touched at Plymouth, and I thought I {{might as}} well get out there as {{anywhere}} else. Well, there is too much noise and bustle at Plymouth. <b>I</b> haven't <b>been</b> used to it, and so now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for a little place to suit me. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> up to Tavistock, and then some one said that Carnesford was a pretty village. I said I would look at Carnesford, and so you see here I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{something}} that one will appreciate more and more fully every time one sees it [...] . One cannot see it too often [...] . I could have sat and watched it for hours [...] . Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> forward to to- morrow evening, when I can see it again. [...] . <b>I</b> knew it <b>was</b> going to <b>be</b> good, but <b>I</b> had no idea--" [...] so chimed the chorus, between mouthfuls of quail and bites of asparagus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I am, very," [...] said Lydia. [...] "It was a {{book that}} I began on the ship. It's a novel." [...] She hesitated. [...] "I wasn't reading it; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} come to see me," [...] he said, in a tone as nearly matter-of-fact as he could make it. [...] "I am delighted! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> forward to a lonely and a {{particularly}} dull evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good of you, I am sure," [...] John repeated. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> through the {{telephone}} directory to see if I could come across {{the name of a}} tailor I used to have some things from." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom {{reviewed}} the nails {{of his left}} hand, then those of his right hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only in name apparently," [...] said Clym {{with rising}} excitement. [...] "I believe she means to elope tonight with Wildeve. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> going to <b>look</b> to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 July 2008, Sanderson and Arsenal {{teammate}} Anita Asante joined Chelsea Ladies. Upon signing Sanderson said, [...] "I {{always said}} I would never play {{for anyone else}} other than Chelsea. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> at Arsenal for 11 years {{and it is a}} big change for me to have to leave the team, but both Anita and I wanted a new challenge. Sometimes you have to try new things and challenge yourself personally and <b>I</b> know that <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking forward to doing here. So now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> forward to what's ahead. Hopefully Anita and I will come in and help Chelsea win things." [...] Arsenal manager Vic Akers publicly criticised the players for the manner of their departure: [...] "You think you've the respect of players, and then they do that. It's a sorry state of affairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--this instant <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> {{at those}} notepapers, {{wondering}} which I should choose if I really had good taste. But it's very puzzling--isn't it?--when one {{comes from the}} country. Now that saffron with the rough edges is very--artistic. Don't you think so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Odd idea! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> {{at those}} sad old patched boots there on your feet, and {{thinking}} to myself what leaky fire-buckets they would be to pass up a ladder on a burning building. It would hardly be fair now to swop my new boots for those old fire-buckets, would it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, Sir! No, indeed!" [...] exclaimed Peter. [...] "I don't mean {{anything}} of the kind. I--I--well, if you please, Sir, I don't see you at all, so how can I be staring at you? I'm sure {{from the sound of}} your voice that you must be somebody very important. Please excuse me for seeming to stare. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for you, that is all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't {{mean to say}} you've {{noticed that}} already? You've got an eye like a hawk, Wilson. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> taking a <b>look</b> round, {{if you really want}} to know.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> at {{the view}} from my window--and I notice one thing which has struck me. The mist this morning is the {{thickest}} mist I have yet seen here.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{there are}} many points of {{difference}} between civilised people and savages, {{and we think it}} right to point this out very clearly, good reader, because the man at whom you and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>just</b> now <b>is</b> a savage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for you." [...] He did not move, {{and after}} a moment I began to walk round the top of the amphitheatre toward him. When I came near him I saw that he had a clean-shaven face, and he wore a soft hat that seemed large for his {{close-cropped}} head; he had on a sack coat buttoned to the throat, and of one dark color with his loose trousers. I knew him now, but I did not know what terms to put my recognition in, and I faltered. [...] "What do you want with me?" [...] I asked, as if I did not know him.|$|E
6000|$|... --It's {{in the blood}}, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are {{washed in}} the blood of the sun. Coincidence I just {{happened}} to be in the Kildare street museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, {{with many}} proofs of an afternoon's {{shopping}} {{in her hands}} and arms, appears {{at the door of the}} ladies' room, opening from the public hall, and studies the interior with a searching gaze, which develops a few suburban shoppers scattered over the settees, with their bags and packages, and two or three old ladies in the rocking-chairs. The Chorewoman is going about with a Saturday afternoon pail and mop, and profiting by the disoccupation of the place in the hour between the departures of two great expresses, to wipe up the floor. She passes near the door where Mrs. Roberts is standing, and Mrs. Roberts appeals to her in the anxiety which her failure to detect the object of her search has awakened: [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for my husband. He was to meet me here at ten minutes past three; but there don't seem to be any gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I 'aven't got {{a ticket}} yet. But I shall get one all right, {{and have a}} go in at reading. I've often wanted to. Rather. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 'aving a <b>look</b> at this Indicator. First-class idea. Tells you {{all you want to}} know." ...|$|R
6000|$|While thus watching, {{the door}} of the dining-room (the only down stairs room in order) opened suddenly, and the Captain came forth. [...] "Oh, Miss Fosbrook," [...] he said, [...] "please come in here: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> coming to <b>look</b> for you. My brother--Miss Fosbrook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The London {{press has}} not had very full accounts. <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what <b>I</b> gather, to <b>be</b> one of those simple cases which are so {{extremely}} difficult." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Garnett, to {{the maid}} {{hovering}} in the doorway: [...] "Yes, I must have left it here, for I never missed it till I went to pay my fare in the motor-bus, {{and tried to think}} whether I had the exact dime, and if I hadn't whether the conductor would change a five-dollar bill or not, and then it rushed into my mind that I had left my purse somewhere, and I knew I hadn't been anywhere else." [...] She runs from the mantel to the writing-desk in the corner, and then to the sofa, where, peering under the tea-table, she finds her purse on the shelf. [...] "Oh, here it is, Nora, just where I put it when we began to talk, and I must have gone out and left it. I--" [...] She starts with a little shriek, in encountering Ashley. [...] "Oh, Mr. Ashley! What a fright you gave me! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for my purse that I missed when I went to pay my fare in the motor-bus, and was wondering whether I had the exact dime, or the conductor could change a five-dollar bill, and--" [...] She discovers, or affects to discover, something strange in his manner. [...] "What--what is the matter, Mr. Ashley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sunday, 30th January.--A Caffilah, {{travelling}} from Tajoorah to Shoa, passed by. The people kindly {{offered to}} take my letters. Mahomed ibn Boraitoo, {{one of the principal}} people in the Caffilah, presented me with a fine sheep and a quantity of milk, which I was glad to accept. There had been a long-standing quarrel between him and our Ras el Caffilah. When the latter heard that I accepted the present he became very angry, and said to my servant, Adam, 'Very well, your master chooses to take things from other people; why did he not ask me if he wanted sheep? We shall see!' Adam interrupted him by saying, 'Be not angry; my master did not ask for the sheep, it was brought to him as a present; it has been slaughtered, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for you to distribute it among the people of the Caffilah.' This appeased him; and Adam added, 'If my master hears your words he will be angry, for he wishes to be friends with all people.' I mention the above merely to show how very little excites these savages to anger. The man who gave me the sheep, hearing that I wished to go to Tajoorah, {{offered to take}} me there in four days. I told him I would first consult the Ras el Caffilah, who declared it would not be safe for me to proceed from this alone, but that from Dakwaylaka (three marches in advance) he himself would accompany me in. The Ras then presented me with a sheep.|$|E
5000|$|The song satirised the vacuous {{elite of}} mid-1970s Melbourne's Toorak society: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> around {{at people who}} were putting on airs... It's pretension. It's everywhere, {{probably}} even more now. There's a complete culture surrounding it now, magazines devoted to it. It was a much simpler time, 1975. James Reyne ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If! I {{will take}} care of that; give {{yourself}} no uneasiness. All <b>I</b> want <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a <b>look</b> at her, to see what the imp is like that has been able to make all this noise, then you and the halter may have her. How many men has she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} my best," [...] Weiss answered. [...] "It strikes me she's just fool enough {{to stick to}} what she's been told, and she's too scared of her uncle to do more or less. She {{practically}} turned me {{out of his room}} this morning, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> having a <b>look</b> round." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> {{over the}} [...] "Collier's bonny Dochter", {{and if the}} {{enclosed}} rhapsody which I composed the day, on a charming Ayrshire girl, Miss Baillie, as she passed through this place to England, will suit your taste better than the [...] "Collier Lassie", fall on and welcome.|$|R
