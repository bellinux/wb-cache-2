We have previously shown that the v-cyclin of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 is an oncogene that binds and activates cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and is required for efficient reactivation from latency. To determine the contribution of v-cyclin-mediated cell cycle regulation to the viral life cycle, recombinant viruses in which specific point mutations (<b>E</b> <b>133</b> V or K 104 E) were introduced into the v-cyclin open reading frame were generated, resulting in the disruption of CDK binding and activation. While in vitro growth of these mutant viruses was unaffected, lytic replication in the lungs following low-dose intranasal inoculation was attenuated for both mutants deficient in CDK binding as well as virus in which the entire v-cyclin open reading frame was disrupted by the insertion of a translation termination codon. This replication defect was not apparent in spleens of mice following intraperitoneal inoculation, suggesting a cell type- and/or route-specific dependence on v-cyclin-CDK interactions during the acute phase of virus infection. Notably, although a v-cyclin-null virus was highly attenuated for reactivation from latency, the <b>E</b> <b>133</b> V v-cyclin CDK-binding mutant exhibited only a modest defect in virus reactivation from splenocytes, and neither the <b>E</b> <b>133</b> V nor K 104 E v-cyclin mutants were compromised in reactivation from peritoneal exudate cells.

40|$|The global {{regulator}} Lrp plays {{a central}} role as both a repressor and an activator in Pap phase variation. Unlike most {{other members of the}} Lrp regulon such as ilvIH, activation of papBA transcription requires the coregulator PapI and is methylation dependent. We developed a two-color genetic screen to identify Lrp mutations that inhibit Pap phase variation but still activate ilvIH transcription, reasoning that such mutations might identify PapI binding or methylation-responsive domains. Amino acid substitutions in Lrp at position 126, 133, or 134 greatly reduced the rate of Pap switching from phase off to phase on but had much smaller effects on ilvIH transcription. In vitro analyses indicated that the T 134 A and <b>E</b> <b>133</b> G Lrp variants maintained affinities for pap and ilvIH DNAs similar to those of wild-type Lrp. In addition, both mutant Lrp’s were as responsive to PapI as wild-type Lrp, evidenced by an increase in affinity for pap Lrp binding sites 4, 5, and 6. Thus, in vitro analyses did not reveal the step(s) in Pap phase variation where these Lrp mutants were inhibited. In vivo analyses showed that both the T 134 A and <b>E</b> <b>133</b> G Lrp mutants activated transcription of a phase-on-locked pap derivative containing a mutation in Lrp binding site 3. Further studies indicated that the T 134 A Lrp mutant was blocked in a step in Pap phase variation that does not involve PapI.

To do so, we infected MDCK {{cells in the}} presence of EM 4 C 04 and generated 11 escape mutants, displaying 7 distinct amino acid substitutions in the HA. Six substitutions greatly reduced MAb binding (K 123 N, D 131 <b>E,</b> K <b>133</b> T, G 134 S, K 157 N, and G 158 <b>E).</b> Residues 131, <b>133,</b> and 134 are contiguous with residues 157 and 158 in the globular domain structure and contribute to a novel pH 1 N 1 antibody epitope. One mutation near the receptor binding site, S 186 P, increased the binding affinity of the HA to the receptor. 186 P and 131 E are present in the highly virulent 1918 virus HA and were recently identified as virulence determinants in a mouse-passaged pH 1 N 1 virus. We found that pH 1 N 1 escape variants expressing these substitutions enhanced replication and lethality in mice compared to wild-type 2009 pH 1 N 1 virus. The increased virulence of these viruses was associated with an increased affinity for α 2, 3 sialic acid receptors. Our study demonstrates that antibody pressure by an hMAb targeting a novel epitope in the Sa region of 2009 pH 1 N 1 HA is able to inadvertently drive the development of a more virulent virus with altered receptor binding properties. This broadens our understanding of antigenic drift...|$|R
