2500|$|Bourdieu {{also played}} a crucial role in the popularisation of {{correspondence}} analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. [...] "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field," [...] Bourdieu said, in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.|$|E

Valtorta's explanation that the illegality {{of a night}} trial made it necessary to hold a legal {{one in the morning}} was propounded by others since at least the time of André Marie Jean Jacques Dupin (1783-1865).

[...] The re-dedication events included the unveiling of two bronze plaques: one in honor of Louis Marshall and the other in honor of his son, ESF alumnus, Bob Marshall.|$|E
