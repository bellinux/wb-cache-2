25|$|Updike <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> {{effortless}} motion—between {{third and}} first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, {{from the actual}} to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.|$|E

25|$|Other major {{bluegrass}} mandolinists who {{emerged in}} the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds (of Jim and Jesse) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers, who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> clarity and sparkling single-note runs. Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore, Doyle Lawson, and the multi-genre Sam Bush, who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes, rock, reggae, and jazz. Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing. John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences, especially {{on the east coast}} and in the Washington, D.C. area.|$|E

25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, {{could not have}} been more welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America a decade ago to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision that she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E

Deol then starred in Yamla Pagla Deewana which was released on 14 January 2011. He later starred in the film Thank You opposite Sonam Kapoor. His character is a businessman who is not sincere with his wife. In 2012, he appeared in heist film Players. The film {{proved to be a}} failure at the box office.

500|$|According to the New York Post critic, Elisabeth Vincentelli, {{the show}} {{improved}} with its transfer from Off-Broadway to Broadway, especially Weaver's performance, which Vincentelli deemed the weakest. Weaver portrayed {{a movie star}} who was [...] "overindulgent, self-centered, and unaware she’s on the decline." [...] Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post suggested Durang, with whom Weaver graduated from the Yale School of Drama in 1974, may have written the role for her. Both Hyde Pierce and Nielsen exhibited mastery of their monologues, according to Vincentelli: [...] " [...] Hyde Pierce <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> the slow burn, while Nielsen’s wild-eyed Sonia often looks as if her train of thought has a loose caboose." [...] Vincentelli also noted that Weaver's character had [...] "turned her life into a performance." ...|$|E

Interested in computer programming, Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time. He graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. Before graduating, Seropian was living with his father, sleeping on his couch, and debating whether {{to get a job}} or create his own video game company.

500|$|Time {{magazine}} called the film [...] "fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed" [...] and commented {{extensively on the}} film's humour, saying [...] "Director Young <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> the form he ridicules, and in almost every episode he hands the audience shocks as well as yocks. But the yocks are more memorable. They result from slight but sly infractions of the thriller formula. A Russian agent, for instance, does not simply escape through a window; no, he escapes through a window in a brick wall painted with a colossal poster portrait of Anita Ekberg, and as he crawls out of the window, {{he seems to be}} crawling out of Anita's mouth. Or again, Bond does not simply train a telescope on the Russian consulate and hope he can read somebody's lips; no, he makes his way laboriously into a gallery beneath the joint, runs a submarine periscope up through the walls, and there, at close range, inspects two important Soviet secrets: the heroine's legs." ...|$|E
500|$|All of Angelou's autobiographies {{conform to}} the genre's {{standard}} structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. [...] Although Angelou referred to her books as autobiographies in 1983 interview with African-American literature critic Claudia Tate, she acknowledged that there are fictional aspects to all her books, with the tendency to [...] "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". [...] When speaking of her unique use of the genre, Angelou acknowledges that she follows the slave narrative tradition of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] McPherson states that Angelou <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> this autobiographical form, especially the [...] "confrontation of the Black self within a society that threatens to destroy it", but departs from it in Traveling Shoes by taking the action to Africa. [...] Lupton, referring to the journey motif in the book, insists that its narrative {{point of view is}} [...] "again sustained through the first-person autobiographer in motion".|$|E

500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> <b>of</b> romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if you were the one being wooed. I wanted to like it more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E
