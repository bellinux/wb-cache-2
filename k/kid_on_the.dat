Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against the Kid, and the Kid {{accepted}} the challenge.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} sixth season opened, the {{producers}} attempted {{to add a}} child character to the show. Tess Holland, as played by Alisan Porter (who had starred on ABC's short-lived Chicken Soup the previous fall), was introduced as the troublemaking-but-immensely-cute little girl who lived upstairs from Larry and Balki. Tess appeared in the season's second episode, [...] "New <b>Kid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Block", when Balki agrees to babysit her, causing an uproar {{both at home and}} at the Chronicle. While Porter was supposed to be on full-time, and even credited in the opening title sequence of the episode, she was suddenly dropped, never to be seen again. The experiment of adding a child to the cast was partially influenced by the network as well, since ABC's TGIF lineup was wishing to incorporate the child-and-preteen demographic into its audience. While the content of Perfect Strangers could often appeal to the family as a whole, it had never had children in the regular cast. A similar infusion happened a few months later on sister show Going Places, which had also started with a more adult tone.|$|E

2500|$|When not {{contributing}} to others' scripts, O'Brien managed to craft what {{are regarded as}} some of the series' most memorable and finest episodes: [...] "Marge vs. the Monorail" [...] and [...] "Homer Goes to College". Generally, critics, fans and even those who worked on the show agree that its sensibilities changed following [...] "Marge vs. the Monorail." [...] The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift {{in the direction of the}} surreal. Along with those episodes, he has sole writing credits on [...] "New <b>Kid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Block" [...] and [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV", on which he wrote the episode wraparounds.

He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us."
