5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a radio call sign, Hichens {{could not think of}} anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained with him {{for the rest of his}} time with the coastal forces.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1870s South Australia's defence was solely {{dependent}} on the volunteer military, and a few artillery pieces purchased during earlier war scares. British troops had been withdrawn from the Australian colonies in 1870, leaving the state dependent on its own military resources. In {{a report to the}} government in 1866, Colonel Freeling and Major Peter Scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force. In 1876 the South Australian government, along with those from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland requested from the War Office that Major General Sir William Jervois, a noted coastal fortification expert, be appointed to advise on defence needs. He arrived in Sydney in mid-1877 with then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley. The 1877 report, delivered after he became South Australian Governor, called for three batteries, at Largs Bay, Semaphore and Glenelg, connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements, naval elements and mobile forces. He determined that South Australia's most probable defence risk was an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force, and this formed the basis of the final fortification design. His report called for Military Road to be extended to Marino, an electro-contact torpedo station be established on Torrens Island and that a <b>gun</b> <b>boat</b> be provided. In November 1878 the government passed the Military Forces Act, which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve. Two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in 1878 and a permanent artillery unit in 1882.|$|E

5000|$|On 17 September 1855 at Genitichi, Crimea, Lieutenant Day of HMS Recruit was put ashore from a {{rowing boat}} to reconnoitre the bridge, {{batteries}} and enemy <b>gun</b> <b>boats</b> on the Arabat Spit. He went alone and after covering {{four or five}} miles of swampy ground, sometimes up to his thighs in water, he got to within 200 yards of the enemy position, where {{he found that the}} <b>gun</b> <b>boats</b> appeared to be under-manned and lightly defended. He returned to his ship convinced that a surprise attack was possible, but had to abandon this plan when he returned on 19 September and found the enemy on the alert and the <b>gun</b> <b>boats</b> fully manned.|$|R
25|$|HM Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> 2007 was a Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> {{operated}} by Royal Navy Coastal Forces during the Second World War. She was initially built {{as one of}} eight gun boats ordered by the Turkish Navy, but which went on to see service in the North Sea as fast blockade runners. She was initially classed as the merchant vessel Gay Corsair, crewed by men of the merchant navy and sailing under the red ensign. She became HM Motor Gunboat 507 after being acquired by the Royal Navy, and finally HM Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> 2007. She was wrecked under this name in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing craft}} enjoyed {{a number of}} {{navigating}} advantages, mostly planned, but one great windfall {{was provided by the}} Germans. The flotilla formed two columns behind their navigational guide, MGB 312, and set off for the coast. Also escorting the flotilla was Steam <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> (SGB) 9, ready to provide close support. Both these gun boats possessed far more sophisticated navigational instruments than the LCA.|$|E
25|$|Union and Confederate {{forces in}} {{southern}} Texas had been observing an unofficial truce, but Union Colonel Theodore H. Barrett ordered {{an attack on}} a Confederate camp near Fort Brown for unknown reasons; anecdotes suggest he wanted to see combat before the war ended. The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle became a Confederate victory. Union forces were surprised by Confederate artillery, said to have been supplied by the French Army occupying the nearby Mexican town of Matamoros. Rumors also persist that Confederates were assisted by a steam-powered French <b>gun</b> <b>boat</b> patrolling the Rio Grande.|$|E

25|$|Gay Viking was a {{blockade}} runner of the British Merchant Navy. Originally under construction as a Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat,</b> Gay Viking {{was one of}} eight vessels that were ordered by the Turkish Navy, but were requisitioned by the Royal Navy to serve with Coastal Forces during the Second World War. Originally intended to be HMMGB 506, the vessel was instead completed as {{a blockade}} runner for the Merchant Navy and named Gay Viking. She operated out of Hull on two separate operations to the Scandinavian countries. She {{was one of the}} more successful of her group, but was lost in a collision while returning from one of these operations. Reports indicate that she may have been salvaged after this and gone on to sail for a considerable number of years as a civilian vessel.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February Lark {{was still}} in company with the two guarda costas when they {{encountered}} two gunboats and an armed schooner escorting a Spanish convoy of several small market boats. Lark was able to drive the vessels of the convoy ashore, but the escorts took refuge under the guns of a 4-gun battery in a creek in Bahia Cispata, Colombia. Lark silenced the battery. Nicholas then took his entire crew, less the 20 men he left to guard the two guarda costas, {{and put them in}} boats with the aim of capturing the gunboats and the armed schooner. The Spanish gunboats rowed towards the British boats but then retreated as the British drew nearer. Nicholas and three of his men then were wounded while they were capturing the rearmost vessel, a <b>gun</b> <b>boat</b> with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. Later, Lark had three more men wounded in the continuing action. Nicholas then attempted to pursue the remaining Spanish vessels up a creek but while {{he was trying to do}} so, the pilot ran Postillon and Carmen ashore. This forced Nicholas to order their prize crews to burn them, which they did. Postillion blew up and Carmen was solidly aflame when the British last saw her.|$|E
500|$|Before the Second World War, Hichens was a keen sportsman who rowed for Magdalen College, Oxford, and {{competed in}} the Double sculls at the Henley Regatta. He also competed in International Fourteen sailing events and three times participated in the Fastnet race. On land he raced in hill {{climbing}} events in Somerset and also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans race three times. During the Second World War, he rose in rank to become [...] a lieutenant commander and commanded the 6th Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> Flotilla and [...] later the 8th Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> Flotilla.|$|E
5000|$|The rocket <b>boats,</b> <b>gun</b> <b>boats,</b> {{and mortar}} boats engaged the enemy’s fleet moored inside the harbour. “It was by their fire {{that all the}} ships in the port, with the {{exception}} of the outer frigate, were in flames which extended rapidly over the whole arsenal, storehouses and <b>gun</b> <b>boats,</b> exhibiting a spectacle of awful grandeur”. [...] The following day the Dey capitulated and accepted all the surrender terms.|$|R

500|$|When {{they reached}} the open sea the smaller calibre guns were out of range and stopped firing but the heavier {{artillery}} continued to engage them. The boats were about [...] off-shore when the last German salvo straddled them and killed Savage, who was still at his gun. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his exploits. His citation recognised both Savage and the bravery of [...] "the many unnamed crews of the Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat,</b> Motor Torpedo Boat and Motor Launches who continued {{to carry out their}} duties in exposed positions, in the face of close range enemy fire." ...|$|E
500|$|Other naval units {{involved}} {{were two}} Hunt class destroyers, HMS [...] and , which would accompany the force {{to and from}} the French coast and remain out at sea during the raid. A Motor <b>Gun</b> <b>Boat</b> (MGB 314) was the headquarters ship for the raid, with Commander Ryder and the commanding officer of the Commandos on board. A Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB 74), commanded by Sub-Lieutenant Michael Wynn, had two objectives: If the outer Normandie dock gates were open, she had to torpedo the inner dock gates. If the gates were closed she would instead torpedo the gates at the old entrance into the St Nazaire basin.|$|E
500|$|Nine Spanish gun boats {{attacked}} Aigle in Vigo Bay on 28 September 1805. For an hour she had {{to endure}} their fire before the wind got up and the previously becalmed Aigle was able to launch a counter-offensive; capturing one <b>gun</b> <b>boat</b> and driving the others away. Two Chasse-marées were taken by the crew of Aigle, in a cutting-out expedition on 15 October 1807 [...] and while cruising with the 32-gun [...] and 74-gun Gibraltar in December, she assisted with the capture of a Spanish schooner, Bueno Vista. A few days later the same three ships took a French Lugger and had more success {{in the first quarter}} of the following year, when four more Chasse-marées were seized and a former British brig, Margaret was recaptured.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ships of}} the {{formation}} were soon given orders to go {{on their own to}} the closest available harbor. The <b>gun</b> <b>boat</b> Klas Horn headed for the Swedish coast, the <b>gun</b> <b>boat</b> Hämeenmaa headed for Vaasa and the torpedo boat S1 barely made it to Mäntyluoto outside Pori. She had only a few pieces of coal left when arriving there. S2 also tried to go to Pori, but the engines and the pumps could not function fully and the leaking worsened. It also seemed like rescue was too far away. Land was in sight and the radio operator of S2 was in contact with the radio station in Vaasa almost until the moment of disaster. The last message from the ship arrived at 1.23 pm, barely two minutes before she sank. The answer from the radio operator on S2 on the call from Vaasa was short: [...] "I can not work now".|$|E
2500|$|After aiding in {{the siege}} against New Bern, the {{combined}} damage from battle and routine wear left the Hunchback crippled. [...] The ship steamed to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs.
