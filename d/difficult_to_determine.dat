5|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether Luke 22:43-44 Christ's agony at Gethsemane was {{originally}} {{in the text}} of Codex C; the leaves that contained the surrounding verses are not extant. Mark 15:28 is not included.|$|E
5|$|Although P. rebeli {{is found}} across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{exactly where they}} inhabit because of their {{similarity}} with P. alcon. In Western Europe they {{are thought to be}} concentrated in the Alps and in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, much {{research}} {{focused on the}} abundances of iron-group elements in the Sun. Although significant research was done, until 1978 it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{precisely}} <b>determine</b> {{what causes}} large ultramafic – mafic intrusives to be emplaced within the crust, {{but there are}} two main hypotheses: plume magmatism and rift upwelling.|$|R
5|$|Other predators {{attack the}} adults {{while they are}} {{foraging}} or traveling to satellite nests. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the number of adults that are killed away from the nest because they are difficult to track. However, {{it has been observed}} that the queen's flight to the satellite nest isn't dangerous and does not reduce its survivability.|$|E
5|$|While health {{insurance}} premium costs have moderated, {{some of this}} is because of insurance policies that have a higher deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums that shift costs from insurers to patients. In addition, many employees are choosing to combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the impact of the ACA <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> precisely.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> and may change with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{was first}} {{subdivided}} into {{counties in the}} Middle Ages. Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimirović's rule. The exact number and borders of these early counties are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority.|$|E
5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While it is often <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement {{near the top of}} the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, and it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{impressions}} {{were made}} at implant level because it allows for {{the selection of the}} most proper abutments and is helpful in situations where angulation of the abutments is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be <b>determined</b> intraorally [19, 22].|$|R
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine,</b> since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|In 31, Sejanus {{held the}} consulship with Tiberius , and began his play for power in earnest. Precisely what {{happened}} is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine,</b> but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} Princeps, or as a possible regent. Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine,</b> Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how far {{previous}} reigns {{had broken}} Roman Catholic devotion, with its {{belief in the}} saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those that drew public financial support—had been shaken. Benefactions to the church did not return significantly. Trust in clergy who had changed their minds and were now willing to leave their new wives—as {{they were required to}} do—was bound to have weakened.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the extent}} to which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most {{prominent}} use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E

But when condensed and compacted, it forms disulfur dioxide, which is relatively toxic and corrosive. This compound is also highly flammable (similar flammability to methane) and when burned produces sulfur dioxide, a poisonous gas.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{languages}} delimit words expressly. Mandarin Chinese {{is a very}} analytic language (with few inflectional affixes), {{making it}} unnecessary to delimit words orthographically. However, {{there are a great}} number of multiple-morpheme compounds in Mandarin, as well as a variety of bound morphemes that make it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> clearly <b>determine</b> what constitutes a word.|$|R
5|$|It is fair {{to assume}} that the average Joe/Jane is neither a college {{graduate}} nor a high school drop-out. It is, however, <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether or not the average American has some college education as the population is split between those who did and did not attend college. Over the past half century the educational attainment of the US population has significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Joehana's œuvre {{consists}} of fourteen books, {{as well as}} numerous editorials and articles in the newspaper Soerapati. In their 1979 review of the author, Kartini et al. {{were able to find}} only six extant titles. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the original year of publication for these works, for although Joehana's books generally included a year of publication, the printing number was not recorded. As such, sources list works as having been published in different years; for instance, Tjarios Agan Permas is variously dated 1923, 1926, and 1928.|$|E
5|$|Settlement of Kent by {{continental}} peoples, primarily Jutes, {{was complete}} {{by the end}} of the sixth century. Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590, though the chronology of his reign is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> accurately. Æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler Bede as having overlordship, or imperium, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute, and Kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of Æthelberht's death in 616, with trade well-established with the European mainland.|$|E
