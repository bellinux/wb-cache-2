60|$|When nearly on {{the crest}} of the Portillo, we were enveloped in a <b>falling</b> <b>cloud</b> of minute frozen spicula. This was very unfortunate, as it {{continued}} the whole day, and quite intercepted our view. The pass takes its name of Portillo from a narrow cleft or doorway on the highest ridge, through which the road passes. From this point, on a clear day, those vast plains which uninterruptedly extend to the Atlantic Ocean can be seen. We descended to the upper limit of vegetation, and found good quarters for the night under the shelter of some large fragments of rock. We met here some passengers, who made anxious inquiries {{about the state of the}} road. Shortly after it was dark the clouds suddenly cleared away, and the effect was quite magical. The great mountains, bright with the full moon, seemed impending over us on all sides, as over a deep crevice: one morning, very early, I witnessed the same striking effect. As soon as the clouds were dispersed it froze severely; but as there was no wind, we slept very comfortably.|$|E

40|$|Much {{potentially}} useful energy is wasted {{because it is}} carried by effluent gases containing contaminants which cause rapid fouling of heat exchange surfaces, which {{might be used to}} recover this energy. A solution to this problem might lie in the use of a <b>falling</b> <b>cloud</b> of dense particles to extract the heat from the gas in combination with a fluidised-bed heat exchanger to transfer the heat from the particles to some other suitable medium.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} {{for the formation of}} the satellite systems which are likely to have been formed in situ, that is, not by capture of the satellite by the central planet.

That means that the values of the quantity log Gamma, where Gamma is the ratio of the mass of the central body to the orbital radius of the secondary body, are grouped into three bands which can be identified with the three bands into which are grouped the values of the ratio of the mass of a central body to the distance at which the kinetic energy of a freely <b>falling</b> <b>cloud</b> of atoms of a given kind equals the ionization energy.
