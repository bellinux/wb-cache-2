The investigations {{described in this}} paper are focused on determining fundamental properties that control particle size during pulping. While pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) with high elastic moduli tend to survive pulping with larger particles, <b>facestock</b> and adhesive surface properties also play critical roles. We investigated both the effect of wet-strength additives and sizing agents on screen removal efficiency and found that one can shift a recycling-benign adhesive to one that will probably cause a problem in a mill just by changing the <b>facestock</b> properties. A conclusion from this work {{is that all the}} components of a PSA label, laminate, <b>facestock,</b> primers, and adhesive, play a role in determining the behavior of adhesives during pulping and screening...|$|E
