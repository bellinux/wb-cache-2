2500|$|Bill Lawry won the toss {{and chose}} to bat {{on a good}} wicket, but became John Snow's 100th Test victim, caught by Alan Knott for 4 off an {{attempted}} hook. Keith Stackpole had been promoted from the middle order to open the innings as along with Lawry {{he was the only}} Australian who had any confidence against short-pitched bowling. He should have been run out for 18, Geoff Boycott throwing down the wicket at the bowler's end with Derek Underwood backing up. The batsman was given {{the benefit of the doubt}} by Lou Rowan, but the Australian newspapers carried photographs the next day showing that he had failed to ground his bat as he crossed the line. This formed a major point of controversy in the media and Rowan's decision was hyperbolically labelled [...] "one of the worst in cricket history". It probably cost England victory as Stackpole went on to make his highest Test score of 207, adding 151 with Ian Chappell (59) and 209 with Doug Walters (112). The new ball was taken in the afternoon, but had to be replaced after five overs due to complaints from Snow and Shuttleworth, though Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Bill O'Reilly and Jack Fingleton could find little wrong with it in the press box. Stackpole was told in the afternoon drinks break that he was nearing Bradman's record 187 against England at the Gabba and as a result dug himself in and failed to score for the last half hour of the day, leaving Australian 308/2. John Edrich met a spectator when fielding on the boundary who told him [...] "You're following in your cousin's footsteps you know. I was sitting here [...] and he spent all day chasing the ball along the same piece of grass. He didn't stop much either". A frustrated Snow forced a nervous Walters to dodge three bouncers in a row and was warned by the umpires for intimidation, not for the last time in the series. Stackpole crawled to 200 on the second day, hit Illingworth for six and gave what may have been a catch behind off Snow at 372/3. He was visibly wilting in the heat and gladly took the opportunity to walk with 207 against his name. Australia looked set to make a huge score, but soon after lunch Illingworth threw himself full length to take a spectacular catch at silly mid-on to dismiss Ian Redpath off Derek Underwood (3/101). Keith Dunstan noted that [...] "Underwood is inclined to wear a hole in the pitch by dropping the ball on the same spot...", but his first 236 balls had failed to take a wicket, now [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] took two wickets in four balls; dismissing Sheahan for a duck and Walters for 112 as 418/3 became 421/6. Snow (6/114) ran through the lower order – Jenner, Gleeson and Thomson all failed to score – and Australia were all out for 433. The loss of seven Australian wickets for 15 runs was their worst collapse since Alec Bedser took 14/99 and Australia fell from 237/3 to 249 all out at Trent Bridge in 1953.
