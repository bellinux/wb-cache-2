5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father {{suggested that he}} {{take a break and}} play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Her {{third term}} was from 3 May 2002 to 26 August 2003. More than 900 {{officers}} of IAS, IPS, and PCS cadres were shifted when Mayawati {{took over as}} the Chief Minister. This impacted the Chief Secretary, Secretaries, Commissioners, District Magistrates, and police officials. She suspended 12 IAS officers for laxity in carrying out development projects in their regions, including Divisional Commissioners and District Magistrates. Six IPS officers were suspended for failing to maintain law and order, while 24 officers were warned to improve. She started Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University and 511 acre Gautam Buddha University.

Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice.

Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was not supposed to be on the show that night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days. After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E
5|$|One day, while {{travelling}} {{around the}} city with his police officer-friend Balaji, Jagadish witnesses the explosion of a bus {{in which they had}} travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a sleeper agent, whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the Islamic terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper cell leader's brother and eleven other terrorists, including the previously captured sleeper agent.|$|E

However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying {{it would be better for}} her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

40|$|Coupling {{parameter}} estimation (CPE) that uses observations {{to estimate the}} parameters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> model through error covariance between variables residing in different media may increase the consistency of estimated parameters <b>in</b> <b>an</b> air-sea <b>coupled</b> system. However, it is very challenging to accurately evaluate the error covariance between such variables due to the different characteristic time scales at which flows vary in different media. With a simple Lorenz-atmosphere and slab ocean coupled system that characterizes the interaction of two-timescale media <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> “climate” system, this study explores feasibility of the CPE with four-dimensional variational analysis and ensemble Kalman filter within a perfect observing system simulation experiment framework. It is found that both algorithms can improve the representation of air-sea coupling processes through CPE compared to state estimation only. These simple model studies provide some insights when {{parameter estimation}} is implemented with <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> general circulation model for improving climate estimation and prediction initialization...|$|R
