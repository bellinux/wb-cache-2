5|$|Carly, an attorney, has <b>just</b> <b>started</b> a {{relationship}} with Mark, a man she had sex with eight weeks earlier. She is upset when Mark tells her {{he has to go}} out of town but decides to go over to his house to seduce him. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate, whom she'd originally assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, the two women befriend one another. Kate then discovers that he is seeing yet another woman, whom she at first believes to be Carly, but they both discover that Mark is seeing a third woman: Amber.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to move towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
5|$|The comic {{tells the}} story of Antimony Carver, a young girl who has <b>just</b> <b>started</b> {{attending}} a school at a strange and mysterious place called Gunnerkrigg Court, and the events that unfold around her as she becomes embroiled in political intrigues between Gunnerkrigg Court and the inhabitants of the Gillitie Wood, a forest outside the school. The comic's style and themes include elements from science, fantasy creatures, mythology from a variety of traditions, and alchemical symbols and theories; the literary style is heavily influenced by mystery fiction and manga.|$|E
5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} traditional Italian music began in about 1850, {{with a group}} of early philological ethnographers who studied the impact of music on a pan-Italian national identity. A unified Italian identity only <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to develop after the political integration of the peninsula in 1860. The focus at that time was on the lyrical and literary value of music, rather than the instrumentation; this focus remained until the early 1960s. Two folkloric journals helped to encourage the burgeoning field of study, the Rivista Italiana delle Tradizioni Popolari and Lares, founded in 1894 and 1912, respectively. The earliest major musical studies were on the Sardinian launeddas in 1913-1914 by Mario Giulio Fara; on Sicilian music, published in 1907 and 1921 by Alberto Favara; and studies of the music of Emilia Romagna in 1941 by Francesco Balilla Pratella.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{operation}} <b>just</b> <b>started</b> {{as a response}} {{on the death of}} five soldiers in the Philadelphi corridor on 12 May 2004; on 13 May, the Israeli government reportedly approved a plan to widen the Philadelphi Route by destroying “dozens or perhaps hundreds” of homes.|$|E
25|$|Cray {{set up a}} new company, SRC Computers, {{and started}} the design of his own massively {{parallel}} machine. The new design concentrated on communications and memory performance, the bottleneck that hampered many parallel designs. Design had <b>just</b> <b>started</b> when Cray died suddenly {{as a result of a}} car accident. SRC Computers carried on development and specialized in reconfigurable computing.|$|E
25|$|In July 1898 Wemyss was {{divorced}} by his wife, having had intimate relations in London with an actress. He married Lady Eva Cecilia Wellesley on 28 November 1899 and sailed to Egypt and South Africa on honeymoon. The Second Boer War had <b>just</b> <b>started,</b> and Wemyss became involved as an army officer and was absent while matters developed at home.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, the US Army <b>just</b> <b>started</b> {{to receive}} its first antitank gun, the 37 mm Gun M3. While it fitted {{the request of}} the Infantry for light, easy to manhandle {{anti-tank}} weapon, Artillery and Ordnance foresaw a need for a more powerful gun. This led to a number of expedient designs, such as adaptations of the 75 mm M1897 or towed variants of the 75 mm M3.|$|E
25|$|Daniel was suffocated {{and killed}} in his bedroom, {{and a copy of}} the Bible was left by his body. Daniel had {{internal}} injuries to the throat area, showing no bruises. Daniel's exact time of death is unknown. The reports determined Daniel was sedated with Xanax and likely unconscious when he was killed. Daniel's body had also <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to show signs of decomposition but was not as far along as his mother's body.|$|E
25|$|Hewett's {{interest}} in Frijoles Canyon was timely, for ethnologist Adolph Bandelier had <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to describe, through both scientific papers and his novel The Delight Makers (1890), prehistoric {{life on the}} Pajarito Plateau. Hewett came to know Bandelier and consider him his mentor in his own studies. By 1896 Hewett himself was conducting field work on the Plateau, although he continued to defer to Bandelier's expertise on the region for many years.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, {{engineers}} were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to use computer structural analysis {{on a large}} scale. SOM {{was at the center}} of these new developments, with undeniable contributions from Khan. Graham and Khan lobbied SOM partners to purchase a mainframe computer, a risky investment at a time, when new technologies were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to form. The partners agreed, and Khan began programming the system to calculate structural engineering equations, and later, to develop architectural drawings.|$|R

They told us that there was a steep hill at the beginning, and that it was customary for the gentlemen to walk up.|$|R

25|$|Ramtanu Lahiri was son of Ramakrishna Lahiri. They {{belonged to}} a deeply {{religious}} family attached to the dewans of the Nadia Raj. Some of them were also employed as dewans or occupied other high positions in the Raj. At that time, Krishnanagar was amongst the more enlightened towns of Bengal, and Kolkata had <b>just</b> <b>started</b> growing. His father, Ramakrishna Lahiri, was a person of limited means, earning a living {{in the service of}} the landed aristocracy and from some property he owned.|$|E
25|$|In October 1957, Paul {{took on a}} Ford Foundation {{fellowship}} at CERN in Geneva which Berta Karlik hat procured for him. At CERN, {{the first}} particle accelerator, the synchrocyclotron, had <b>just</b> <b>started</b> operation, and Paul {{got the chance to}} work on the first experiment that was carried out with this machine. It consisted of the search for the rare decay of the charged pion into an electron and a neutrino, which was indeed found to occur with a probability of 0.012% relative to the normal decay into muon and neutrino.|$|E
25|$|Theoretical and {{computational}} sciences {{are highly}} developed in Iran. Despite the limitations in funds, facilities, and international collaborations, Iranian {{scientists have been}} very productive in several experimental fields such as pharmacology, pharmaceutical chemistry, and organic and polymer chemistry. Iranian biophysicists, especially molecular biophysicists, have gained international reputations since the 1990s. High field nuclear magnetic resonance facility, microcalorimetry, circular dichroism, and instruments for single protein channel studies have been provided in Iran {{during the past two}} decades. Tissue engineering and research on biomaterials have <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to emerge in biophysics departments.|$|E
