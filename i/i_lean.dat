500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemptionâ€”what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
2500|$|In the Notebook poems, Lowell {{included}} the poem [...] "In The Cage," [...] a sonnet {{that he had}} originally published in Lord Weary's Castle. He also included revised, sonnet versions of the poems [...] "Caligula" [...] and [...] "Night-Sweat" [...] (originally published in For the Union Dead) and of [...] "1958" [...] and [...] "To Theodore Roethke: 1908-1963" [...] (originally published in Near the Ocean). In his [...] "Afterthought" [...] {{at the end of}} Notebook 1967-1968, Lowell explained the premise and timeline of the book: This is not my diary, my confession, not a puritan's too literal pornographic honesty, glad to share private embarrassment, and triumph. The time is a summer, an autumn, a winter, a spring, another summer; here the poem ends, except for turned-back bits of fall and winter 1968 ... My plot rolls with the seasons. The separate poems and sections are opportunist and inspired by impulse. Accident threw up subjects, and the plot swallowed them--famished for human chances. <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> heavily to the rational, but am devoted to surrealism. In this same [...] "Afterthought" [...] section, Lowell acknowledges some of his source materials for the poems, writing, [...] "I have taken from many books, used the throwaway conversational inspirations of my friends, and much more that I idly spoke to myself." [...] Some of the sources and authors he cites include Jesse Glenn Gray's The Warriors, Simone Weil's Half a Century Gone, Herbert Marcuse, Aijaz Ahmad, R. P. Blackmur, Plutarch, Stonewall Jackson, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.|$|E

60|$|As {{he passed}} <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{from the window}} and threw a rosebud at him.|$|R
6000|$|The dancing, tremulous {{light was}} in her eyes. Mine, I knew, were {{speaking}} beyond the will of my speech. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> toward her. Without volition <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> toward her, as a tree is swayed by the wind. Ah, we were very close together in that moment. But she shook her head, as one might shake off sleep or a dream, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lean</b> my head upon my arm, My heart's {{too full}} to think; Like {{the roar of}} seas, upon my heart Doth the morning stillness sink.|$|E
6000|$|To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies <b>I</b> <b>lean,</b> [...] On {{his right}} cheek I put the family kiss, [...] And {{in my soul}} I swear I never will deny him.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{forward in}} the cab {{to look at the}} {{placards}} of the afternoon papers.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> over Joe, and, {{with the}} aid of my {{forefinger}} read him the whole letter.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> forward, {{whispering}} {{into the}} ear of the Black One, and he nodded heavily.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Laramie," [...] went on Duane, [...] "in {{some parts}} of Texas it's policy to be close-mouthed. Policy and health-preserving! Between ourselves, I {{want you to know}} <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> on your side of the fence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Michael Moon {{looked at}} his long lean forefinger, and seemed to {{consider}} and reconsider this argument. [...] "Yes," [...] he said at last; [...] "but how can <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> on this gate if you keep on opening it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to say that I differ from you; <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> to my first notion still--that Mr.--Mr. Manston is most {{desirable}} in tone and bearing, and even specifically; I think he would suit me best in the long-run.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{back in my}} non-rotary {{revolving}} {{chair and}} nodded gently, like a mandarin, at my paste-pot.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the look}} in her face, and my heart ached for her. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> forward in my chair.|$|R
60|$|After the day's uproar, the tranquillity of {{the scene}} was soothing, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> over the side to enjoy it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{gathering}} clouds around I view, And {{days are}} dark {{and friends are}} few, On him <b>I</b> <b>lean,</b> who, not in vain, Experienced every human pain: He sees my griefs, allays my fears, And counts and treasures up my tears.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Agonies {{are one of}} my {{changes of}} garments, [...] I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the [...] wounded person, [...] My hurts turn livid upon me as <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> on a cane and observe.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the collision," [...] {{said the}} Tin Woodman regretfully. [...] "I knew {{something}} was wrong with me, and now I can see that my side is dented in so that <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> over toward the left. It was the Soldier's fault; he shouldn't have been so careless." ...|$|E
6000|$|The breath sighed itself away. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{my cheek}} against the unanswering hand, and chafed it with mine. Where now? Where now? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> back in {{my chair}} with my mind at ease {{for the first time}} since the receipt of my son's letter.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{over and}} spoke to it. I asked it if my heart would ever know love. It said it thought so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{intonation}} is awful," [...] {{said the}} Actor. [...] "But listen. In my interpretation I use no words at all. I merely carry the skull quietly in my hand, very slowly, across the stage. There <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> against a pillar at the side, with the skull {{in the palm}} of my hand, and look at it in silence." ...|$|E
60|$|I stood {{leaning over}} the gaff of the {{mainsail}} and thinking--yes, thinking, dear reader, of my mother. I {{hope that you will}} think none the less of me for that. Whenever things look dark, <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> up against something and think of mother. If they get positively black, I stand on one leg and think of father. After that I can face anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jim, that's between ourselves," [...] I went on. [...] "I'm no fool. And much as I blab when I'm hunky, it's all air. Maybe you've {{noticed that}} about me. In {{some parts of}} Texas it's policy to be close-mouthed. Policy and healthy. Between ourselves, as friends, I {{want you to know}} <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> some on Steele's side of the fence." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain West's head drooped {{until his}} chin rested on his breast, and so low did he mutter that <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> to hear.|$|R

6000|$|Her {{question}} {{came with}} the simplicity of a child. She laughed softly with pleasure when <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> over the table and whispered to her,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Abdal. Love, like a lethargy, has seized my will. I'm not myself, since {{from her}} sight I went; <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> my trunk that way, and there stand bent.

6000|$|... "Ah! That's {{the work}} that I'm fond of," [...] said the captain, with enthusiasm. [...] "Of course I don't {{mean to say that}} the soul of a sailor is of more value than that of any other man, but <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> to sailors naturally, havin' been among 'em the greater part of my life. I've done a little myself in the way of preachin' to 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|This is a full-grown lily's face, [...] She {{speaks to}} the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets, [...] Come here she blushingly cries, Come nigh to me limber-hipp'd man, [...] Stand at my side till <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> as high as I can upon you, [...] Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me, [...] Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my breast and shoulders.|$|E
