25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement</b> liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.|$|E

50|$|Toothed belts {{are made}} of a {{flexible}} polymer over a <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Originally this was rubber over a natural textile, but developments in material science have had a substantial effect in increasing the lifetime of these belts.

They can also be reheated and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These composites are ideal for applications such as lightweight, rigid, deployable structures; rapid manufacturing; and dynamic reinforcement.|$|E

The proposed optimization framework contains modules for estimation of the weight, manufacturing cost, nondestructive inspection cost, and structural performance; the latter is enhanced by a kinematic draping model that allows the fiber angles to be simulated more realistically. The case study includes five material systems: aircraft-grade aluminum, two types of resin-transfer molded noncrimp <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> and two types of M 21 /T 800 prepreg.

50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable leather hose to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen hose. Its wrapped construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel delivery hoses used to service airliners.|$|E
50|$|New {{technology}} has been developed to wind rubber and reinforcement layers on the (cylindrical or bellows-shaped) mandrel automatically using industrial robots instead of manual wrapping. This is fast and accurate and provides repeatable high quality. Another aspect of using industrial robots {{for the production of}} rubber expansion joints is the possibility to apply an individual reinforcement layer instead of using pre-woven fabric. The <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is pre-woven and cut at the preferred bias angle. With individual reinforcement it is possible to add more or less fiber material at different sections of the product by changing the fiber angles over the length of the product.|$|E
50|$|The {{catastrophic failure}} mode {{is caused by}} {{delamination}} between the belt and its <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Although this {{may be caused by}} age and wear, it is often accelerated by mistreatment of the belt, often during initial installation. Overloading the belt by bending it to a narrow radius is a common cause of damage, either by bending out of the belt's designed axis, twisting, levering it into place with tools, bending in the correct axis but to too small a radius, or even knotting a belt in storage. Another cause, particularly with natural rubber belts, is contamination by oil, especially to the edges where the reinforcing fabric is exposed and can cause a wick effect.|$|E
40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites (CFRC) {{have been}} used in aeronautical industry in the manufacture of different aircraft components that must attend tight mechanical requirements. This paper shows a study involving mechanical (flexural, shear, tensile and compressive tests) and morphological characterizations of four different laminates based on 2 epoxy resin systems (8552 and F 584) and 2 carbon fiber <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcements</b> (Plain Weave (PW) and Eight Harness Satin (8 HS)). All laminates were obtained by handing lay-up of prepregs plies (0 °/ 90 °) and consolidation in an autoclave following an appropriate curing cycle with vacuum and pressure. The results show that the F 584 -epoxy matrix laminates present better mechanical properties in the tensile and compressive tests than 8552 composites. It is also observed that PW laminates for both matrices show better flexural and interlaminar shear properties...|$|R

50|$|In an {{industrial}} setting, olefin creates carpets; ropes, geo-textiles {{that are in}} contact with the soil, filter <b>fabrics,</b> bagging, concrete <b>reinforcement,</b> and heat-sealable paper (e.g. tea- and coffee-bags).|$|R
5000|$|In this process, the wax and {{the textile}} are both {{replaced}} by the metal during the casting process, whereby the <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement</b> allows for a thinner model, and thus reduces the amount of metal expended in the mould. Evidence {{of this process is}} seen by the textile relief on the reverse side of objects and is sometimes referred to as [...] "lost-wax, lost textile". This textile relief is visible on gold ornaments from burial mounds in southern Siberia of the ancient horse riding tribes, such as the distinctive group of openwork gold plaques housed in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg. The technique may have its origins in the Far East, as indicated by the few Han examples, and the bronze buckle and gold plaques found at the cemetery at Xigou. Such a technique may also have been used to manufacture some Viking Age oval brooches, indicated by numerous examples with fabric imprints such as those of Castletown (Scotland).|$|E
50|$|The mil <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcement</b> can {{be applied}} on the rubber {{products}} with different processes. For straight hoses the most used processes are braiding, spiralling, knitting and wrapping. The first three processes have in common that multiple strands of fibres are applied to the product simultaneously on a predetermined pattern in an automated process. The fourth process comprises manual or semi-automated wrapping of rubber sheets reinforced with fabric plies. For the reinforcement of complex shaped rubber products like bellows most manufacturers use these fabric reinforced rubber sheets. These sheets are made by calendering of rubber onto pre-woven fabric plies. The products are manufactured by wrapping (mostly manually) these sheets around a mandrel until enough rubber and reinforcement is applied. However, the disadvantage of using these sheets {{is that it is}} impossible to control the positioning of the individual fibres of the fabric when applied on complex shapes. Therefore, no geodesic paths can be achieved and therefore also no isotensoid loading is possible. To obtain isotensoide loading on a complex shape, the shape must have an isotensoideal profile and geodesic positioning of the fibre structure is required. This can be achieved by using automated winding processes like filament winding or spiralling.|$|E

As <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcements</b> show repeating undulations of warp and fill yarn, simple mixtures law cannot be applied. As a consequence, the mesoscopic scale, lying between the microscopic and the macroscopic one, {{has to be taken}} into account to mechanically characterize a fabric reinforced composite. The aim of this work is to evaluate the stiffness of a fabric reinforced composite in warp and fill direction. In particular a numerical FE model, assuming elliptical sections and sinusoidal shape of the yarns, has been implemented and experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the proposed model.

The residual strength of carbon based geo-polymer composite increased with increase of the processing temperature after 600 °C.

40|$|Aerospace {{structural}} components {{made from}} polymer matrix composites (PMCs) offer numerous advantages. Their high stiffness and high strength combined with low densities enable lower fuel consumption coupled with higher payloads. As a result, PMCs provide an important economic advantage over typical metallic airframes. Textile reinforcements for PMCs {{are made by}} assembling reinforcement fibres, typically carbon. Then, the textile reinforcements are typically cut into smaller pieces, stacked, draped and assembled into a dry assembly called a preform, the shape of which generally approaches that of the PMC part to be made. This manufacturing process is labour intensive and expensive. Novel thick, net-shape, drapable, high vf textile reinforcements used toward manufacturing aerospace PMCs are being developed at the University of Ottawa. The technology enables the manufacturing of flat, drapable multilayered near net-shape preforms. The bending and in-plane shear behaviours of such novel thick reinforcement textiles was investigated to understand and define the behaviour of such thick <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcements</b> when formed into required shapes. A bending apparatus was developed for investigating the bending behaviour of these novel thick <b>reinforcement</b> <b>fabrics</b> and an articulated frame shear rig was used for investigating the in-plane shear behaviour.

Variables such as processing time (IL interaction time) and fabric weaves were found to influence the mechanical properties of the LCs.

40|$|Abstract. At {{the present}} there exist two {{different}} types of riot helmet shells, a thermoplastic and a composite shell. The composite shell is believed to be superior in impact performance, but more expensive and complicated in manufacturing partially {{due to the fact that}} the textile reinforcement material has to be cut into pattern pieces before they can be applied to the helmet shaped mould. However, the discontinuation of fibres is likely to reduce the level of protection and shorten the lifetime of a helmet. The aim of this research is to develop a helmet shell consisting of a single-piece of fabric without creating wrinkles and without the necessity of cutting the fabric. For this purpose, a new type of woven fabric has been developed and an apparatus has been set up to drape the fabric to a helmet shell. The helmet shell was manufactured using a single piece of Kevlar woven fabric. In parallel the finite element method is applied to investigate the shock absorption behaviour of the helmet shell made from both multi-piece and single-piece <b>fabric</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> The results show clearly the advantage of the single-piece helmet shell over its existing multi-piece counterpart...|$|R
