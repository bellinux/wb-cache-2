500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I {{just thought it was}} funny to write a song that said today is the greatest <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out." [...] They played the song live {{for the first time on}} September 20, 1993 on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E

However, his stablemaster told him, [...] "From this day on, you should spend every <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> yokozuna life by thinking about the day you retire". At first, he struggled somewhat against heavier wrestlers, but he raised his weight to around 130kg and he became a wrestler able to use more orthodox methods.

2500|$|The track [...] "Where Are You" [...] {{went through}} many changes and {{arrangements}} after being written including {{an entirely different}} chorus. The song was known as [...] "The Best <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life" [...] and [...] "Where Are You (Best Day)" [...] on advance copies of Healthy. [...] "Apology" [...] also morphed throughout recording. [...] "The song 'Apology' for example was from the first demo sessions. We tried that song a year later completely differently ... way more up-tempo and it just didn't feel right. It didn't serve the song and what Raine was saying {{and how he was}} singing dictated how we were playing. I love all the songs on the record, but that was a very magical, musical moment because it was so organic the way that happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billboard critics commented {{at the end}} of the year, [...] "twenty years ago, a {{conscious}} rap record wouldn't have penetrated the mainstream in the way Kendrick Lamar did with To Pimp A Butterfly. His sense of timing is impeccable. In the midst of rampant cases of police brutality and racial tension across America, he spews raw, aggressive bars while possibly cutting a rug," [...] while Pitchfork editors noted it [...] "forced critics to think deeply about music. It's an album by the greatest rapper of his generation." [...] Producer Tony Visconti stated David Bowie's album Blackstar (2016) was influenced by Lamar's work, [...] "we were listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar [...] we loved the fact Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn't do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that's exactly what we wanted to do." [...] Visconti also stated this about Lamar while talking about [...] "rule-breakers" [...] in music. “His album ‘To Pimp A Butterfly’ broke every rule in the book and he had a number one album glued to the top of the charts. You’d think certain labels would learn form that. But they take somebody who is out there and say, ‘That’s what people want.’ No, people want that for one week. You don’t want the same song every single <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life.”Lamar won five Grammys at the 58th ceremony, including Best Rap Album for To Pimp a Butterfly. Other nominations included Album of the Year and Song of the Year. At the ceremony, Lamar performed a medley of [...] "The Blacker the Berry" [...] and [...] "Alright". It was ranked by Rolling Stone and Billboard as the best moment of the night, with the latter writing [...] "It was easily one of the best live TV performances in history." ...|$|E
