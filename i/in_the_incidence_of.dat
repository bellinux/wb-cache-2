5|$|There is some {{geographic}} variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> AML. In adults, {{the highest}} rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than {{in other parts of}} Asia. These differences may be due to population genetics, environmental factors, or a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|As per the 2001 census, Coimbatore had a {{population}} of 930,882 within the municipal corporation limits. The population of the urban agglomeration as per 2011 census is 2,136,916 with males constituting 50.08% {{of the population and}} females 49.92%. Coimbatore has an average literacy rate of 89.23%, higher than the national average of 74.04%. Male literacy is 93.17% and female literacy is 85.3% with 8.9% of the population under six years of age. The sex ratio was 964 females per 1000 males. In 2005, the crime rate in the city was 265.9 per 100,000 people, accounting for 1.2% of all crimes reported in major cities in India. It ranked 21st among 35 major cities in India <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> crimes. In 2011, the population density in the city was 10,052 per km2 (26,035 per mi2). Around 8% of the city's population lives in slums.|$|E
5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

40|$|For {{different}} reasons cancers of the Prostate, Testis and Penis are important diseases for men. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> for prostate and testicular cancers are more commonly seen in developed countries, while penile cancer occurs more frequently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developing countries. <b>In</b> Mumbai <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> prostatic and testicular cancers is low whereas penile cancer is high {{when compared with}} international reports. <b>In</b> Mumbai. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> prostatic cancer increases only {{after the age of}} 50. <b>The</b> age specific <b>incidence</b> rates for testicular cancers are bimodal whereas <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> Penile cancer increases exponentially with age, after <b>the</b> age 30. <b>In</b> Mumbai. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> Prostate cancer was six times higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Parsis as compared to other communities. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testis is lowest in Hindus and cancer of penis is not seen <b>in</b> Muslims. <b>The</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer was highest among Gujrathis and there was an absence of penile cancer in Urdu speaking men. <b>In</b> Bombay <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> cancers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostate, testis and penis seem to be associated with marital status. <b>The</b> association between <b>incidence</b> and education level of the patients was only found in men having cancer of the testis.

25|$|However, {{before that}} point, {{criticism}} of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized anecdotal reports of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to 1970s anti-DPT movements.

A dramatic increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> pertussis followed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that common diseases arise in part through the action of combinations of variants that are individually rare. Most of the disease-associated alleles discovered to date have been rare, and rare variants {{are more likely than}} common variants to be differentially distributed among groups distinguished by ancestry. However, groups could harbor different, though perhaps overlapping, sets of rare variants, which would reduce contrasts between groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> the disease.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} allergy {{can be placed}} in two general categories, namely host and {{environmental}} factors.

Four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes.|$|E

25|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} the most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease and {{is the most}} common form of dementia in the elderly.

25|$|Around a 5% {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and {{patent ductus arteriosus}} in offspring {{has been}} found to be correlated with advanced paternal age.

Offspring born to fathers under the age of 20 show increased risk of being affected by patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and the tetralogy of Fallot. It is hypothesized that this may be due to environmental exposures or lifestyle choices.|$|E
