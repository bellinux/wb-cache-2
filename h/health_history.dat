Kaine also invited former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to join the panel to [...] "review Cho's mental <b>health</b> <b>history</b> and how police responded to the tragedy."

The report concluded that the school's mental health systems [...] "failed for lack of resources, incorrect interpretation of privacy laws, and passivity." [...] The report called Virginia's mental health laws [...] "flawed" [...] and its mental health services [...] "inadequate". The report also confirmed that Cho was able to purchase two guns in violation of federal law because of Virginia's inadequate background check requirements.|$|E

Ballo's uncle Heljar Ballo explained that Kaja Ballo's family decided to come forward with information to the media about her suicide, due to a motivation to publicize information relating to the circumstances of her death. Heljar Ballo told Aftenposten that the family [...] "had confidence" [...] in the investigation by local law enforcement in France. He thought there was a connection between her death and Scientology. Kaja Ballo's father retained an attorney to investigate his daughter's death. In April 2008, Ballo's family was considering taking legal action against Scientology. Kaja Ballo was interred on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, and approximately 500 people were present at the funeral ceremony.|$|E

It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine poststructural concerns about the body, biopolitics, and governmentality by foeusing on the constitution of three categories of meaning- namely the femi-nine, the home, and nature-in three Australian public <b>health</b> <b>histories.</b> The paper asserts that many communication devieas-metaphor, me-tonymy, statement, text, and discourse- serve to codate and reie these catqpries in highly problematic ways.

Whistler was seldom without his sketchbook and was popular with his classmates for his caricatures.

He was admitted to the highly selective institution in July 1851 on the strength of his family name, despite his extreme nearsightedness and poor <b>health</b> <b>history.</b> However, during his three years there, his grades were barely satisfactory, and he was a sorry sight at drill and dress, known as [...] "Curly" [...] for his hair length which exceeded regulations. Whistler bucked authority, spouted sarcastic comments, and racked up demerits. Colonel Robert E Lee was the West Point Superintendent and, after considerable indulgence toward Whistler, {{he had no choice but}} to dismiss the young cadet. Whistler's major accomplishment at West Point was learning drawing and map making from American artist Robert W. Weir.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{reactions}} to a bipolar disorder diagnosis of research {{participants in a}} small, qualitative study consisted of astonishment, dread of being mad, and extremely negative associations. All had prior mental health diagnoses, including episodes of severe depression (all but one) and alcoholism (one). All participants reported mental <b>health</b> <b>histories</b> prediagnosis and most had spent years contending with mental health labels, medications, symptoms, and hospitalizations. In addition, most participants were highly educated health professionals, quite familiar with the behaviors that the medical system considered to comprise bipolar disorder. Their negative associations to the initial bipolar disorder diagnosis, therefore, appeared inconsistent with their mental <b>health</b> <b>histories</b> and professional knowledge. This article contextualizes these initial reactions of shock and distress and proposes interpretations of these findings from societal and psychodynamic group relations perspectives. The participants’ initial negative reactions are conceptualized as involving the terror of being transported from the group of normal people into the group of mad or crazy people, i. e., people with mental illnesses, who may constitute a societal denigrated other...|$|R

40|$|The Center for Minority Health (CMH) {{within the}} University of Pittsburgh has {{the mission to}} {{eliminate}} racial health disparities by 2010. One community-based intervention focuses on family <b>health</b> <b>histories.</b> Family <b>health</b> <b>histories,</b> or pedigrees, {{have been shown to}} be effective tools for identifying individuals at risk for common diseases who may benefit from increased screening or other risk reduction behaviors. Genetic counseling graduate students provide individuals with information pertaining to the importance of family history information in reducing the risk of chronic disease. Students travel to various locations in the African American community where they collect individuals' family <b>health</b> <b>histories.</b> Individuals who participate have the opportunity to enroll in the Minority Research Recruitment Database from which they can be contacted regarding research for which they may qualify. This is the Center's effort to increase minority recruitment. This has public health relevance given that minorities are often under-represented in research and it is thought that increasing minority recruitment will aid in elimination of racial health disparities. This study was developed to characterize individuals who elected to enroll in the database and compare them to those who declined enrollment. Factors for comparison include demographics, recruitment variables, opinions regarding research, health care, personal <b>health,</b> and family <b>history.</b> Factors were assessed for 126 participants of which approximately 80 % enrolled in the database and 20 % declined. Analysis revealed that those more likely to participate in the database were female, without health insurance, more likely to respond to monetary incentives, more likely to talk to their physician about concerns for developing a disease, and less likely to have previously refused participation in a clinical trial. These results indicate that women are more likely than men to seek health information that pertains to their family history, incentives act as a motivation for individuals to enroll in this database, and issues of distrust may still act as a barrier to research participation for African Americans...|$|R
