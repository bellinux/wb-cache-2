5|$|Following {{his return}} from New Zealand in 1946, Newall was raised to the peerage as Baron Newall, of Clifton upon Dunsmoor, in the county of Warwick. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords rarely, making five speeches between 1946 and 1948 and one in 1959, mostly {{addressing}} defence issues. Newall died at his home at Welbeck Street in London on 30 November 1963, at which time his son Francis inherited his title.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} Gui's disappearance, {{there is a}} general {{consensus}} among commentators that the five booksellers were abducted by Chinese authorities. As of October 2016, Gui has spent a year in detention, while the other four men were released in early March 2016. One colleague, Lam Wing-kee, gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland law enforcement in Ningbo and subsequently Shaoguan. Their other colleagues have remained low profile and refused comment.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again, <b>in</b> the low, even tone {{demanded by}} circumstances.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause. Then <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again, <b>in</b> a {{far less}} {{elaborate}} manner.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> up <b>in</b> {{an almost}} natural voice. His {{reflections}} {{had come to}} an end.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily {{visits to}} an ailing Henry Clay. Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge {{garnered}} nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House. Days later, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> opposition to increasing a subsidy to the Collins Line for carrying trans-Atlantic mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships. In wartime, {{the government could}} commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion {{that they would be}} useless in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{played an}} active role in the 2008 {{government}} conflict with the agricultural sector, when Cristina Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports that raised custom taxes to soybean exports to 44%. At that time, he became president of the Justicialist Party and publicly supported his wife in the conflict; Kirchner accused the agricultural sector of attempting a coup d'état. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> support of a bill to set the taxes by law at a demonstration at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Many senators who had supported the government rejected the proposal, and the voting was tied 36–36. Vice-President Julio Cobos, president of the Chamber of Senators, cast the decisive vote in opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an audience}} of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E
60|$|Ned put spurs to {{his horse}} as <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> and <b>in</b> another moment {{was out of}} sight.|$|R
50|$|According to Hansard, <b>he</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> Parliament {{during the}} time he was MP for Dudley.|$|R

5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered the front-runner for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E
5|$|William ceased his active {{service in}} the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain {{declared}} war on France in 1793, he was anxious to serve his country and expected a command, but was not given a ship, perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later perhaps because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favour of the war, expecting a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he {{was appointed to the}} honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to any actual fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> an {{interview}} on The Meaning of Life about being sexually abused by priests during his childhood.|$|E
60|$|The look which {{accompanied}} that reply stung the Scotchman's {{pride to}} the quick. When <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> next, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> seated <b>in</b> his former {{place at the}} table.|$|R
60|$|Womble {{stopped a}} moment to steady his voice and control himself. Then <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> slowly, <b>in</b> a low, tense voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop him!" [...] he screamed. [...] "Stop him! If {{you love}} life, let him not leave this room," [...] and as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>he</b> leaped <b>in</b> pursuit of his jeddak.|$|R
25|$|At Lincoln's request, he {{undertook}} {{a mission to}} the Border States and to the Midwest to rouse the spirit of Unionism; <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> Virginia, Ohio and Illinois.|$|E
25|$|That Obama's {{comments}} in San Francisco made wide media play {{but not the}} ones <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> Silicon Valley became a source of speculation about the media and its political coverage.|$|E
25|$|All formal speech {{concerning}} the Emperor {{was in the}} plural, as was his own speech; Haile Selassie, for instance, referred to himself in the first-person plural at all times, even in casual conversation and when speaking in French (however {{this was not the}} case when <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> English, in which he was not fully fluent).|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> {{regularly}} <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the church's general conferences, but {{was only}} rarely assigned to visit local stakes of the church.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{purposely}} <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> a loud voice, so {{that many}} heard him. At once a murmur arose on all sides.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke,</b> too, <b>in</b> a quick, crisp, rather high voice, {{pinching}} his consonants a little, sharpening his vowels, {{like a true}} Welshman.|$|R
25|$|Becoming a {{journalist}} after leaving {{politics in the}} eighties, Øgrim had a technology column in the Norwegian edition of PC World. He {{was known for his}} distinct writing style, where he rejected standard written Norwegian and, instead, wrote as <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>in</b> a working class dialect. He also wrote science fiction novels under the pseudonym Eirik Austey.|$|E
25|$|He {{was elected}} to the Central Committee of the LSSP and then onto its Political Bureau (Politburo), a {{position}} he never lost until he left the party. In 1956 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> Parliament condemning the Soviet invasion of Hungary. In 1960, Yugoslavia opened an embassy in Colombo, and he advised the new ambassador unofficially on how to operate in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|Elected, like Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Collot d'Herbois, {{a deputy}} of Paris to the National Convention, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favour of the {{immediate}} abolition of the Bourbon monarchy, {{and the next day}} demanded that all acts be dated from the Year I of the French Republic (a measure adopted {{a little over a year}} later in the form of the French Revolutionary Calendar).|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had time}} to move away <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again <b>in</b> a changed tone of obstinacy and puffing nervously at his pipe.|$|R
25|$|His native {{language}} was Polish though <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> Ukrainian <b>in</b> public. Subsequently, Malevich even wrote {{a series of}} articles about art in Ukrainian.|$|R

25|$|Daines {{spoke in}} a censure debate in December 1945, arguing that workers had shown unity {{during the war and}} would show it in peace if they had a social motive instead of a profit motive. He often contributed to debates on {{insurance}} issues, using his experience as an agent. In July 1946 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> a debate on the introduction of bread rationing, claiming that the Master Bakers' Association was only opposing out of concern for their own profits.|$|E
25|$|As an MP, {{he was a}} loyal {{supporter}} of Palmerston and favoured {{the introduction of a}} ballot for parliamentary elections and the abolition of church taxes to support the state church. His radicalism went beyond the mainstream. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> public in support of democracy and against Napoleon III, and spent part of 1859 at the camp of Giuseppe Garibaldi. His reputation suffered by his alleged bribery of voters in his campaign on behalf of John Jervis in the Horsham constituency in 1847.|$|E
25|$|While Kollár {{is likely}} to have used František as his middle name when <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> his native Slovak, he used the Latin Franciscus (also Adamo Francisco) or the German Franz as his middle name in all of his works, which were {{published}} only in the two languages. The version František did not begin to appear as his middle name in Slovak and Czech publications until later in the 20th century. Hungarian texts use Ferenc. English texts have traditionally used Franz; the more modern practice is František.|$|E
