40|$|Abstract This article {{puts the}} {{procedure}} of the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) in a completely new and previously unexplored light. Rejecting the predominant view of ICTY procedure as a hybrid between the adversarial system of the U. S. and the inquisitorial system of civil law jurisdictions, this article shows that ICTY procedure is best described through a third procedural model that does not fit in {{either of the two}} traditional systems. This third procedural model is close to the managerial judging system that has been adopted in U. S. civil procedure. The article then explores some of the implications that the discovery of managerial judging in ICTY has for both international and <b>domestic</b> <b>procedures.</b> At the international level, the article not only provides the first full-fledged model to explain ICTY procedure and its evolution over time, but also questions the widespread assumption of international policy-makers and scholars that every international criminal procedure has to be either adversarial, inquisitorial, or somewhere along a straight line between what are presumed to be the only two possible systems. At the national level, the article explains why three systems that were initially adversarial have moved in two different directions when faced with similar time pressures: U. S. criminal procedure basically has remained close to the adversarial system, while ICTY criminal procedure and U. S. civil procedure have moved toward managerial judging. By explaining these different trajectories, the article not only highlights features of U. S. <b>domestic</b> <b>procedures</b> and explains their recent evolution, but also integrates ICTY criminal procedure and U. S. criminal and civil procedures into wider debates about international criminal procedure, managerial judging, and the globalization of law...|$|R

40|$|International {{insolvency}} has aroused a {{great deal}} of interest in recent years, owing to the spectacular rise in cases of the collapse of banks and multinational companies situated in a variety of jurisdictions.

This often has the effect of allowing the company to attempt to consolidate its economic future through the judicious use of those rescue regimes available in domestic law.

40|$|This Article draws a {{distinction}} between two types of exercise of universal criminal jurisdiction {{with a view to}} demonstrating that one of them is deeply detrimental to domestic IHL enforcement mechanisms, and especially zeroes in on contemporary unilateral exercises of universal criminal jurisdiction, arguing that their unilateral character deprives <b>domestic</b> enforcement <b>procedures</b> of their legitimacy and efficacy. It begins by distinguishing between unilateral and multilateral uses of criminal universal jurisdiction. It then explains why unilateral exercises of universal jurisdiction and the absence of conventional basis do not, per se, stir any problems of legality. Its last part shows that unilateral exercises of universal jurisdiction, while not generating any problem of legality, fuel problems of legitimacy because of the discourse that generally accompanies such proceedings as well as the impossibility to relate such exercises to the consent of the State of nationality of the accused or that where the crime was committed. On this occasion, it is shown that the perceived illegitimacy of unilateral exercises of jurisdiction can prove harmful to the legitimacy and efficacy of <b>domestic</b> IHL enforcement <b>procedures</b> as a whole...|$|R
