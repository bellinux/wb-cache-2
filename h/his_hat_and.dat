5|$|At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took {{advantage}} of the airport security by stuffing a pistol deep into <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> then placing his hat on a table adjacent to the scanner.

5|$|A set of Lambert's clothes, {{together}} with his armchair, walking stick, riding crop and prayer book, are on permanent display at the Newarke Houses Museum in Leicester. Stamford Museum exhibited a tailor's dummy, dressed with Daniel Lambert's clothes {{as if they are}} being made up for him, plus <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> a portrait. The Daniel Lambert pub in Ludgate Hill no longer exists, and the memorabilia formerly displayed there are now on permanent display at the George Hotel in Stamford.

5|$|In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French {{and their}} Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced {{forces and the}} general was mortally wounded. After {{suffering}} devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray. Washington rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, he demonstrated bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had two horses shot from underneath him, while <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> coat were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.|$|E
5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a bright green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. <b>His</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|After {{the winter}} campaign, Schérer placed the {{divisions}} in the positions where they would start the 1796 campaign. From right to left, they were Masséna with two divisions on the coast, Augereau on the Bormida River, Sérurier on the Tanaro, Macquard at the Col de Tende and Garnier on the far left. On 27 March 1796 Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy. At this date Sérurier was 53 years old with 40 years of military service. He applied to retire on a pension due to his age, health and wounds, but after meeting Bonaparte he decided to stay. Masséna later wrote that Bonaparte did not impress his generals at first. Then the new commander put on <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> sharply questioned them; the generals went away believing {{that they had a}} true leader at last. Bonaparte's plan was to mass over 20,000 men under Masséna and Augereau near Carcare where the Austrian and Sardinian armies linked. Sérurier's division would join the others near Ceva as they moved west. His 9,448-strong division consisted of the 39th, 69th and 85th Line Infantry Demi-brigades.|$|E

5|$|To {{the right}} of Sapieha are {{reformer}} Stanisław Staszic (26) and, with his hand around Staszic, Andrzej Zamoyski (27), author of the Zamoyski Codex, an earlier attempt to reform the state. To the left of Staszic, the head of bishop of Smoleńsk, Tymoteusz Gorzeński (28), is visible in the crowd. Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski, with an outstretched hand, is Kazimierz Konopka (29), Kołłątaj's secretary {{and one of the}} Polish Jacobins; Konopka has a French blue-white-red flower in <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> a czekan, an ax- and hammer-like weapon, in his hand. Above them is an unnamed Eastern Orthodox priest (30); the figure on his right (31) is either Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski, pioneer of agricultural reforms, or Józef Stępkowski, a less progressive figure. This line of figures ends with Antoni Tyzenhauz (32), Lithuanian official and reformer. To {{the right of}} Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant (33). His passive attitude is seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms.|$|E

25|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the method of Fortunato's murder comes from the fear of live burial. During the time period of this short story some coffins were given methods of alerting the outside {{in the event of}} live entombment. Items such as bells tied to the limbs of a corpse to signal the outside were not uncommon. This theme is evident in Fortunato's costume of a jester with bells upon <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> his situation of live entombment within the catacombs.|$|E
25|$|As {{depicted}} in the pulps, The Shadow wore a wide-brimmed black hat and a black, crimson-lined cloak with an upturned collar over a standard black business suit. In the 1940s comic books, the later comic book series, and the 1994 film starring Alec Baldwin, he wore either the black hat or a wide-brimmed, black fedora and a crimson scarf just below his nose and across his mouth and chin. Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double-breasted trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen {{in some of the}} later comics series, The Shadow would also wear <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.|$|E
25|$|In July 1766, the Chevalier de La Barre, {{accused of}} having, a year earlier, failed {{to give a}} due salute to a {{religious}} procession for Corpus Christi by refusing to remove <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> singing ungodly songs. However, the story is more complex and revolves around a mutilated cross. He was executed on the Place du Grand-Marché for blasphemy. Subject to the issue, his legs were crushed. The right hand and the determined language, his decapitated corpse was finally delivered to the flames with the Dictionnaire philosophique of Voltaire on the same place. Today, a paving stone, engraved with his name and the date of his execution, is visible on the place of execution (Place Max-Lejeune), near the town hall. The martyrdom of the Chevalier de La Barre served as Voltaire's banner in his fight against religious fanaticism.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, Joseph Smith founded the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{based in part}} on what was said to be information obtained miraculously from the reflections of seer stones. Smith had at least three separate stones, including his favorite, a brown stone he found during excavation of a neighbor's well. He initially used these stones in various treasure-digging quests in the early 1820s, placing the stone in the bottom of <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> putting his face in the hat to read what he believed were the miraculous reflections from the stone. Smith also said that he had access to a separate set of spectacles composed of seer stones, which he called the Urim and Thummim. He said that, through these stones, he could translate the golden plates that are the stated source of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
25|$|After a {{pause in}} the fighting, Chamberlain's {{division}} commander, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin came forward and told Chamberlain that the Confederate position must be taken. Deploying men to {{both sides of the}} Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain's condition. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain went to the front of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain's surrender. Chamberlain had lost <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.|$|E

500|$|An unimpressed Alec sucks Presto's {{head into}} a {{ventilation}} pipe offstage, Presto (screaming painfully) removes the hat revealing his hair spiked {{and his face}} turned red. When Presto lunges at Alec through the hat, Alec directs Presto's hand into the podium's drawer and closes the drawer, painfully restraining the hand while he looks through Presto's sleeve for the carrot. Presto runs towards Alec, but instead is poked in both eyes by his own hand. Presto drops <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> when he grabs the wizard hat, he accidentally strips his slacks down to underwear, to Alec's amusement.|$|E
