50|$|In December 2010, American Airlines {{temporarily}} ceased offering fares through Orbitz following {{pressure from}} American to convince Orbitz {{to use its}} AA <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> electronic transaction system. AA tried to establish that <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers. American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules. The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{third-party}} {{client was}} called [...] "DClite", which never fully supported the file sharing {{aspects of the}} protocol. Hess released {{a new version of}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect,</b> requiring a simple encryption key to initiate a connection, locking out third-party clients. The encryption key was cracked, and the author of DClite released a new version of DClite compatible with the new software from NeoModus. Some time after, DClite was rewritten as Open <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> with the purpose of having an MDI user interface and using plug-ins for file sharing protocols (similar to MLDonkey). Open <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> also did not have complete support for the full file sharing aspects of the protocol, but a port to Java, however, did. Later on, other clients such as DCTC (<b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> Text Client) and DC++ became popular.|$|R
50|$|NeoModus <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} open-source versions of the client, such as Open <b>Direct</b> <b>Connect</b> and later DC++. DC++ itself has several specialized spin-off open-source versions as well, such as BCDC++ and StrongDC++, which are refined with features particular to user groups, such as filters, language packs, and search capabilities.|$|R
