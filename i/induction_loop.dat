25|$|The {{church has}} a Sunday school, a youth club and a choir. It has an organ and {{presents}} concerts. There is wheelchair access, and a hearing <b>induction</b> <b>loop.</b> There are large-print hymn books, toilets and baby-changing facilities, plus a car park.|$|E
25|$|The entire Northeast Corridor {{has just}} 11 grade crossings, all in southeastern New London County, Connecticut. The {{remaining}} grade crossings are along {{a part of}} the line that hugs the shore of Fishers Island Sound. Without these crossings many waterfront communities and businesses would be inaccessible from land. Except for three grade crossings near New London Union Station, all have four-quadrant gates with <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> sensors, which allow vehicles stopped on the tracks to be detected in time for an oncoming train to stop.|$|E
50|$|An <b>induction</b> or {{inductive}} <b>loop</b> is an electromagnetic communication or {{detection system}} {{which uses a}} moving magnet to induce an electric current in a nearby wire. <b>Induction</b> <b>loops</b> are used for transmission and reception of communication signals, or for detection of metal objects in metal detectors or vehicle presence indicators. A common modern use for <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> is to provide hearing assistance to hearing-aid users.|$|R

50|$|Audio <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> create {{fairly high}} {{magnetic}} field levels. Other equipment must be designed and installed to work properly within this field.|$|R
25|$|Assistive {{listening}} devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type {{of technology}} allows people with hearing difficulties {{to focus on}} a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions, making places like auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in. The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (<b>Induction</b> <b>Loop)</b> transmission, or other transmission methods. The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume.|$|E
2500|$|Telecoils or T-coils (from [...] "Telephone Coils") {{are small}} devices {{installed}} in hearing aids or cochlear implants. An Audio <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> generates an electromagnetic field {{that can be}} detected by T-coils, allowing audio sources to be directly connected to a hearing aid. The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise. They {{can be used with}} telephones, FM systems (with neck loops), and <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> systems (also called [...] "hearing loops") that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs. In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the U.S.A., telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common. Audio induction loops, telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common also in Slovenia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (telecoil) mode {{is usually}} {{more effective than}} the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often automatically switched off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode. [...] Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used. [...] A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. [...] Another method is to use a [...] "neckloop" [...] (which is like a portable, around-the-neck <b>induction</b> <b>loop),</b> and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.|$|E

50|$|A second system {{monitors}} other vehicle parameters. <b>Induction</b> <b>loops</b> and piezoelectric sensors {{are used}} to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The track {{consists}} of concrete pathways with magnetic <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> for providing system data. Due to Morgantown's snowy winter climate, the concrete pathways feature embedded piping containing a glycol solution used to melt snow and ice.

5000|$|An audio <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{inside of}} a hearing aid might have one or more loops {{sometimes}} with a phase shift between them near {{the area in which}} a hearing aid user would be present. Many different configurations can be used depending on the application. [...] Such an <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> receiver is classically a very small iron-cored inductor (telecoil), although rediffusion demonstrated a prototype Hall-Effect system in its PLL FM system.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic sensing {{can only}} be applied to detect huge masses of iron such as ships. It is used in mines and torpedoes. Fuzes of this type can be {{defeated}} by degaussing, using non-metal hulls for ships (especially minesweepers) or by magnetic <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> fitted to aircraft or towed buoys.|$|R
50|$|In early 1979, the student-run Cambridge University Broadcasting Society {{founded a}} radio station which was granted {{permission}} to install <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> around the Cambridge colleges of Churchill and later New Hall, allowing residents to listen to Cambridge University Radio (as it was then known) over a short-range, mono, mediumwave broadcast. The station subsequently became CUR945.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{as complex}} as the vehicle was the {{automated}} system to control the network in operation. For signalling, the system used dual redundant <b>induction</b> <b>loops,</b> {{one on each side}} of the LIM reaction plate. Magnets on the bottom of the vehicles relayed information about the vehicle location and speed, which was received at the central control station.|$|R

5|$|The {{station was}} {{refurbished}} (as of 2015) and work began on 2 January 2007. Additional CCTV cameras and Help Points were installed, {{bringing the total}} to 77 cameras in the station and nine Help Points, the latter upgraded with new <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> to better aid hearing-impaired passengers. In addition, new communications equipment was introduced and damaged signs were replaced with new ones.|$|R
50|$|The simple form of AFIL is {{a single}} wire around a room, driven from a power {{amplifier}} as a loudspeaker would be driven. The coupling of magnetic fields is described mathematically by Faraday's law of induction. A summary of the theory necessary for AFILs is included in British Standard BS 7594, which is {{a guide to the}} design and installation of <b>induction</b> <b>loops.</b>|$|R
50|$|Monaural sound {{has been}} {{replaced}} by stereo sound in most entertainment applications. However, it remains the standard for radiotelephone communications, telephone networks, and audio <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> for use with hearing aids. A few FM radio stations, particularly talk radio shows, choose to broadcast in monaural, as a monaural signal has a slight advantage in signal strength and bandwidth over a stereophonic signal of the same power.|$|R

50|$|On 30 January 1999, W963 rebranded {{itself as}} RaW and on 30 September 1999, the station began {{broadcasting}} on 1251 kHz AM, discarding the then obsolete <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|Several ramp meters began {{operation}} in 2008 and 2009 in metro Atlanta. [...] Some {{of the first}} corridors to be metered were I-285, I-85 in Gwinnett County, I-75 in Cobb County, and I-575. Unlike early systems which used <b>induction</b> <b>loops,</b> the new meters will employ video detection cameras to sense the density of traffic and allow an optimized rate of vehicles to proceed onto the freeway.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the station {{was ready to go}} on air, the central Student Union {{building}} had been built above Square 3, as had the first two towers. As a mark of the importance that the university attached to the station at the time, installation of cables for <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> was already planned {{in the construction of the}} residential tower blocks (they were laid along a duct that runs between the towers).|$|R
50|$|BS 7594 (published by the BSI {{and widely}} used in Britain) is a {{non-mandatory}} guideline for the design and installation of <b>induction</b> <b>loops.</b> It has a comprehensive guide to theory, as well as guidance for those considering the installation of AFILs in buildings for which they may be responsible. It also contains some valuable guidance relating to other equipment within the loop area. The calibration of field strength measuring devices is also included.|$|R
50|$|The church {{underwent}} a major restoration in 2009 including {{the provision of}} a lift, toilets for disabled people, new kitchen facilities and hearing <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{at a cost of}} ¬£154,000.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{system was}} installed in the Lawns (a hall of residence at Hull University) as a third year project by engineering students. By 1983 the system was fully operational. To cut costs, the students used Coca-Cola bottles as insulation. As a result, by 1993, the loop induction system was no longer functional. In 1994, the engineering team carried out a comprehensive survey {{of the system and}} were able to partially restore it to several of the Lawns halls, as well as fitting a new transmitter to Ferens Hall. The <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system was abandoned in 1997 after the award of the LPAM licence.|$|E
5000|$|The radio station, {{then known}} as [...] "URH" [...] (which stood for [...] "University Radio Hull"), began in 1979. It {{originally}} broadcast on an <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system around Hull University's residence halls and through speakers within the University Union.|$|E
50|$|The college's student {{accommodation}} {{consists of}} the original Buxton house (Main House) which contains the married couples' accommodation (the Wainery), plus the former stables and coach house, along with a custom-built accommodation block (Oak House, built in 1971, housing 70 students). The Academic Block was also built in 1971 and contains two large lecture halls as well as tutors' offices. The lecture halls are fitted with <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> for the hard of hearing.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{traffic in}} ever {{congested}} urban cities {{can be managed}} by traffic control systems which monitor and forecast the traffic status and optimises the control strategy according to traffic flow. Such systems use input from inductive loop detectors which are costly to install and maintain. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a novice software based solution called Virtual <b>Induction</b> <b>Loops</b> using a smartphone application and a central server. We also identify how current urban traffic control systems can benefit from such a dynamic solution...|$|R
25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth audio frequency <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|R
