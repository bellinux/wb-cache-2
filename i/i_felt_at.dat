500|$|Reid {{started his}} career with the Nottingham Forest youth academy, after joining from Cherry Orchard. Reid said [...] "I chose Forest years ago because they made me feel wanted, because they had more time for me as a young kid than <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> Arsenal or United". He turned {{professional}} in August 1999, making made his debut on 29 November 2000 against Sheffield United. In the 2001–02 season Reid failed to score a goal, although he played in 31 games.|$|E
500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The way <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the Grand Prix {{was down to}} the fact that I know what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form of}} his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he would not be surprised if they performed well in this tournament.|$|E
500|$|Rehman {{signed a}} two-year deal with Bradford City on 19 June, saying of the move, [...] "My gut feeling {{told me to}} sign for Bradford and I've {{absolutely}} no regrets. From day one <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> home here. I'm {{fortunate enough to have}} played in all the divisions and I see this as the next step of my journey." [...] The Bradford manager, Stuart McCall also revealed that Rehman had taken a large pay cut by joining the club, adding, [...] "Zesh is certainly not signing for Bradford for money—he wants to be a success here, and it will be great to have him on board." [...] He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Barnet on 19 September 2009.|$|E

500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, girl, you got me froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> another moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You definitely want to put something out that's like that. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My head {{is clear}} enough," [...] the colonel replied, [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> stunned, <b>at</b> first. Did you never hear of my having lost my child?" ...|$|R
500|$|Pitt {{lost its}} only game to the Cleveland Naval Reserves. On the Naval team was former Tech star Judy Harlan. Harlan stated: [...] "I intercepted a pass and {{returned}} it to midfield in the fourth quarter. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>at</b> least had evened {{up some of the}} losses we had at Tech." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wanrong wore a mask in {{accordance}} with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: [...] "I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into my field of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> all curious about what she looked like." [...] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red [...] the color of love and sex in China [...] and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages. Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives {{to sleep in the}} Dragon Bed by themselves. About Puyi's failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:It was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters [...] this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: It would have been an appalling breach of protocol. But the fact remains that a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung's [...] unusual, sensual beauty. The inference is, of course, that Pu Yi was either impotent, extraordinarily immature sexually, or already aware of his homosexual tendencies.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E

6000|$|... "And yet <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> {{home there}} these twenty years. Your husband used always {{to take you}} to the Earl of Wessex, did he not?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{left the}} room, feeling much as <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the station at Marseilles. I was not {{satisfied}} with him. I thought his conduct very strange.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Isabel I {{wanted to}} see. Didn't I leave a card? No; I don't think <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so--almost <b>at</b> home, that I didn't {{think of a}} card." ...|$|R
60|$|My face, I suppose, {{betrayed the}} astonishment <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> this. She {{coloured}} {{up for a}} moment, and then proceeded to explain herself.|$|E
6000|$|PRAED [revolted] What a monstrous, wicked, rascally system! I knew it! <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> {{once that}} it meant {{destroying}} all that makes womanhood beautiful! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{expression}} {{upon his}} face, {{combined with the}} relief <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> seeing him again safe and sound, {{was too much for}} my overwrought nerves.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> another pull <b>at</b> my coat-tails. Gooseberry had {{not done}} with me yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{about six}} months. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>at</b> the {{beginning}} of the year, but I didn't say anything to Washburn till a month later. I thought it might be only fancy." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> annoyed <b>at</b> Mariposilla's conduct. I {{could see no}} reason for the {{outburst}} of grief and felt myself an innocent agent in unsettling her happiness and disturbing her family.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> {{a loss to}} {{understand}} this, and showed it plainly, I suppose, in my face. My lady was so good as to explain herself.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a mere}} nothing. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> {{the time}} {{that a man who}} objects to a few taps on the face with a pickax is overcritical.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is where}} he is level-headed," [...] said Fred. [...] "My father said I was {{to call for a}} doctor the minute <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> all sick." ...|$|E
60|$|However, <b>I</b> soon <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> {{home when}} Ada came flying downstairs into the hall, {{and kissed me}} as warmly as she had done three months before when we parted at Miss Pilgrim's.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} bet on it, Lister, though I {{would pay the}} guinea with greater {{pleasure}} than <b>I</b> ever <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> winning one; but I hear that Marshall is a very quick shot." ...|$|R
5000|$|Judy Harlan, {{formerly}} of Georgia Tech, and Moon Ducote, {{formerly of}} Auburn starred for the Cleveland Naval Reserves. Ducote kicked the winning field goal. Warner declared him [...] "the greatest football player I ever saw". Harlan stated: [...] "I intercepted a pass {{and returned it}} to midfield in the fourth quarter. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> <b>at</b> least had evened {{up some of the}} losses we had at Tech." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> {{once that}} the dog's {{superior}} powers of divination {{might be of}} use, on such an errand as mine was. We set out together for Kylam.|$|E
60|$|Chenier {{grinned and}} shook his knife at me, while I tried to look the loathing which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the thought that a soldier of the Emperor could fall so low.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} astonishing, {{in view of}} how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> breakfast, but there's nothing left," [...] he sighed. [...] "In one way the admission's a little humiliating, but I almost feel myself again." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{were able}} to see our comrades move forward in an attempt to cross No Man's Land, only to be mown down like meadow grass. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sick <b>at</b> the sight of the carnage and {{remember}} weeping." ...|$|R
60|$|After some consideration, I put on {{the suit}} of ship's clothing. It fitted fairly well, and after I had given the {{trousers}} several hitches <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>at</b> home in them, and then I went on deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll think," [...] said Meta, sighing. [...] "If only <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>at</b> work, not {{to please}} myself, {{but to be}} of use. Ha!" [...] she cried, {{springing}} up, [...] "I do believe I see Dr. May coming!" ...|$|R
