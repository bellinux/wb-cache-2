5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{recognition}} came slow {{after his}} death. It was not before 1866 {{that a real}} breakthrough in the reception of his role <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> culture took place. In that year, Josip Jurčič and Josip Stritar published a new edition of Prešeren's collection of poems. In the preface, Stritar published an essay which is still {{considered one of the}} most influential essays <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> history. In it, he showed the aesthetic value of Prešeren's work by placing him in the wider European context. From then on, his reputation as the greatest poet <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> language was never endangered.|$|E

25|$|The first {{mentions}} of {{a common}} Slovene ethnic identity, transcending regional boundaries, date from the 16th century, when the Protestant Reformation spread throughout the Slovene Lands. During this period, the first books <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> were written by the Protestant preacher Primož Trubar and his followers, establishing the base {{for the development of}} standard Slovene. In {{the second half of the}} 16th century, numerous books were printed <b>in</b> <b>Slovene,</b> including an integral translation of the Bible by Jurij Dalmatin.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century and today, the new notion for Hungarian Slovenians is to {{conceive}} Prekmurje <b>Slovene</b> is <b>in</b> fact the <b>Slovene</b> language, but not dialect.

25|$|The Enlightenment in the Habsburg monarchy brought {{significant}} {{social and}} cultural progress to the Slovene people. It hastened economic development and facilitated {{the appearance of a}} middle class. Under the reign of Maria Theresa and Emperor Joseph II (1765–1790) many reforms were undertaken in the administration and society, including land reforms, the modernization of the Church and compulsory primary education <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> (1774). The start of cultural-linguistic activities by Slovene intellectuals of the time brought about a national revival and the birth of the Slovene nation in the modern sense of the word. Before the Napoleonic Wars, some secular literature <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> emerged. During the same period, the first history of the Slovene Lands as an ethnic unity was written by Anton Tomaž Linhart, while Jernej Kopitar compiled the first comprehensive grammar of Slovene.|$|E

25|$|Cankar's {{work and}} his {{personal}} world view influenced all three major literary trends <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> literature between 1918 and 1945: the expressionism of Catholic authors such as Ivan Pregelj, Stanko Majcen, and France Bevk, the social realism of the liberal left and Marxist authors (particularly Miško Kranjec, Prežihov Voranc, Ciril Kosmač, and Mile Klopčič) and the avantgardism of Srečko Kosovel. During the same period, Cankar's political ideas influenced the Slovene social-democratic ideologist Etbin Kristan, the Christian Democratic political theorist Andrej Gosar and the democratic thinkers Albin Prepeluh and Dragotin Lončar. Cankar's psychological introspections became {{a major source of}} Edvard Kocbek's and Anton Trstenjak's inquiry in the Slovene national character.|$|E

25|$|About 4,500 Jews lived <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> areas {{before the}} mass transportations to the {{concentration}} camps in 1941. Many {{of them were}} refugees from neighboring Austria, {{while the number of}} Slovenian Jews with Yugoslav citizenship was much lower. According to the 1931 census, the Jewish community in the Drava Banovina (the administrative unit corresponding to the Yugoslav part of Slovenia) had less than 1,000 members, mostly concentrated in the easternmost Slovenian region of Prekmurje. In the late 1930s, anti-Jewish legislation was adopted by the pro-German regime of the Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović, supported by also by the largest political party in Slovenia, the conservative Slovene People's Party. The party's leader, Dr. Anton Korošec had a strong antisemitic discourse, and was instrumental in the introduction of the numerus clausus in all Yugoslav universities in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Already as a child, France showed {{considerable}} talent, and so {{his parents}} decided to provide him with a good education. At the age of eight, {{he was sent to}} elementary schools in Grosuplje and Ribnica, run by the local Roman Catholic clergy. In 1812, he moved to the Carniolan provincial capital of Ljubljana, where he attended the State Gymnasium. Already at a very young age, he learned Latin, Ancient Greek, and German, which was then the language of education, administration, and high culture in most areas inhabited by Slovenes. In Ljubljana, Prešeren's talent was spotted by the poet Valentin Vodnik, who encouraged him to develop his literary skills <b>in</b> <b>Slovene.</b> As a high school student, he became friends with the future philologist Matija Čop, who would have an extremely important influence on the development of Prešeren's poetry.|$|E
25|$|Prešeren's legacy <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> {{culture is}} enormous. He is {{generally}} regarded as the national poet. In 1905, his monument was placed at the central square in Ljubljana, now called Prešeren Square. By the early 1920s, all his surviving work had been catalogued and numerous critical editions of his works had been published. Several scholars were already dealing exclusively with the analysis of his work and little was left unknown about his life. In 1945, the anniversary of his death, called Prešeren Day, was declared as the Slovene cultural holiday. In 1989, his Zdravljica was declared the national anthem of Slovenia, replacing the old Naprej, zastava slave. In 1992, his effigy was portrayed on the Slovene 1000 tolar banknote, and since 2007, his image is on the Slovene two-euro coin. The highest Slovene prize for artistic achievements, the Prešeren Award, is named after him.|$|E

25|$|Between 1809 and 1813, Slovenia {{was part}} of the Illyrian Provinces, an {{autonomous}} province of the Napoleonic French Empire, with Ljubljana as the capital. Although the French rule was short-lived, it significantly contributed to the rise of national consciousness and political awareness of Slovenes. After the fall of Napoleon, all Slovene Lands were once again included in the Austrian Empire. Gradually, a distinct Slovene national consciousness developed, and the quest for a political unification of all Slovenes became widespread. In the 1820s and 1840s, the interest <b>in</b> <b>Slovene</b> language and folklore grew enormously, with numerous philologists advancing the first steps towards a standardization of the language. Illyrian movement, Pan-Slavic and Austro-Slavic ideas gained importance. However, the intellectual circle around the philologist Matija Čop and the Romantic poet France Prešeren was influential in affirming the idea of Slovene linguistic and cultural individuality, refusing the idea of merging Slovenes into a wider Slavic nation.|$|E
