25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{some of the}} {{transition}} economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia experienced a sharp <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>income.</b> The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in large declines in GDP per capita, of about 30 to 35% between 1990 and the trough year of 1998 (when it was at its minimum). As a result, poverty rates also increased although in subsequent years as per capita incomes recovered the poverty rate dropped from 31.4% of the population to 19.6%.|$|E
25|$|The al-Aqsa Intifada {{triggered}} tight IDF closures of {{the border}} with Israel, as well as frequent curbs on traffic in Palestinian self-rule areas, severely disrupting trade and labor movements. In 2001, {{and even more so}} in early 2002, internal turmoil and Israeli military measures led to widespread business closures and a sharp drop in GDP. Civilian infrastructure, such as the Palestine airport, was destroyed by Israel. Another major factor was a <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> due to {{reduction in the number of}} Gazans permitted entry to work in Israel. After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the flow of a limited number of workers into Israel resumed, although Israel said it would reduce or end such permits due to the victory of Hamas in the 2006 parliamentary elections.|$|E

30|$|Pension reforms {{will also}} lead to growing inequalities. As noted above, only {{individuals}} who voluntarily buy individual pension contracts or who are covered by an occupational pension plan will have roughly the same income replacement that the pre- 2001 system offered. Given the increase in atypical employment and the tendency of low-income and atypical workers to not buy individual pension coverage, the retirement income gap between those in full-time, standard employment and those in atypical employment is likely to increase. In addition, Bridgen and Meyer (2014) find that even standard workers in key sectors will experience significant <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> <b>in</b> retirement (see also Hinrichs 2012).|$|R

25|$|The {{reduction}} in public expenditures, {{which was at}} the heart of the stabilization program, slowed the economy sharply in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Real gross national product declined 1.5 percent in 1979 and 1.3 percent in 1980. The manufacturing and services sectors felt much of the impact of this <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>income,</b> with the manufacturing sector operating at close to 50 percent of total capacity. As the external-payments constraint eased, the economy bounced back sharply. Between 1981 and 1985, real GNP grew 3 percent per year, led by growth in the manufacturing sector. With tight controls on workers' earnings and activities, the industrial sector began drawing on unused industrial capacity and raised output by an average rate of 9.1 percent per year between 1981 and 1985. The devaluation of the lira also helped make Turkey more economically competitive. As a result, exports of manufactures increased by an average rate of 45 percent per annum during this period.|$|E

40|$|The paper uses {{data from}} 5, 507 {{municipalities}} in Brazil {{to estimate the}} relationships between climate and income as well as climate and health, and then uses the estimated relationships to gauge the effects of past and future climate change on income levels and life expectancy {{in each of these}} municipalities.

The simulations thus suggest that climate change has contributed to an increase in inequality between Brazilian municipalities, as well as to an increase in poverty. The climate change projected for the next 50 years is estimated to have similar, but more pronounced effects, causing an overall reduction <b>in</b> <b>incomes</b> of about 12 percent, holding all other things constant. Again, the initially poorer municipalities in the already hot northern regions are likely to suffer more from additional warming than the initially richer and cooler municipalities in the south, indicating that projected future climate change would tend to contribute to increased poverty and <b>income</b> inequality <b>in</b> Brazil...|$|R

30|$|Our {{principal}} {{finding is}} that, while potential revenue exposure is greater in more progressive states, {{the most important}} source of interstate variation in revenue exposure in the Great Recession was not state tax structure, but differences {{in the importance of}} income concentration and capital gains income, as well as the state-specific severity of the recession. At the top end of the income distribution the interaction between sharp <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> and high tax burdens can produce large decreases in tax revenue. However, tax progressivity accounts for very little of the overall interstate variation in revenue volatility during the 2007 – 2009 recession. At present these conclusions apply only to the most recent recession. However, our methodology could be readily applied to previous recessions, to determine whether the results generalize to other business-cycle induced fluctuations in state tax revenues.|$|R
