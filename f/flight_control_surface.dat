5000|$|In October 1996, the NTSB {{issued a}} formal Safety Recommendation (A-96-120), which {{requested}} the FAA to require all airlines to provide simulator training for flight crews, which would {{enable them to}} recognize and recover from [...] "unusual attitudes and upset maneuvers, including upsets that occur while the aircraft is being controlled by automatic flight control systems, and unusual attitudes that result from flight control malfunctions and uncommanded <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> movements." ...|$|E
50|$|An aileron (French for 'little wing' or 'fin') is a hinged <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> usually forming {{part of the}} {{trailing}} edge of each wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in roll (or movement around the aircraft's longitudinal axis), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the lift vector. Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{fly-by-wire}} {{systems can}} respond flexibly to changing aerodynamic conditions, by tailoring <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> movements so that aircraft response to control inputs {{is appropriate to}} flight conditions. Electronic systems require less maintenance, whereas mechanical and hydraulic systems require lubrication, tension adjustments, leak checks, fluid changes, etc. Placing circuitry between pilot and aircraft can enhance safety. For example, the control system can try to prevent a stall, or it can stop the pilot from over stressing the airframe.|$|E

50|$|Maxaret, the world's first ABS braking system, {{was invented}} in Coventry by Dunlop in the early 1950s for aircraft; John Boyd Dunlop was a Scottish vet who had first {{produced}} the first pneumatic tyres in 1889. Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, grandson of Matthew Boulton, and born in the area, invented the aileron, an important <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> in 1868, decades before the first actual flight. Triumph Engineering was a famous motorbike firm in Meriden. About {{a quarter of all}} British WWI planes were built in Coventry. The Jensen Interceptor FF was the first production four-wheel-drive car in the world, designed by Major Tony Rolt, and built at their factory in West Bromwich.|$|E
50|$|On 24 September 1971, a Vickers VC10 1103 (registration: G-ASIX) {{was hit by}} {{clear air}} {{turbulence}} (CAT) en route from Santiago de Chile to Buenos Aires while operating the first sector of BCal's weekly Santiago-Gatwick schedule. While the aircraft was cruising above the Andes, it encountered CAT above the mountain peaks. This resulted in the aircraft being thrown up on to its side at a greater-than-90-degree angle, and then tossed, headlong, nose down, towards the up to 27,000 ft high peaks just a few thousand feet (several hundred metres) below. The severity of this incident injured an air hostess who {{was working in the}} rear galley and knocked out the powered control units (PCUs) of almost every <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> leaving the aircraft to plummet downwards at a speed approaching Mach 1. The crew managed a successful recovery and reset the aircraft's PCUs. Following the aircraft's safe landing at Buenos Aires, a thorough ground check was performed before the aircraft was allowed to resume its flight to Gatwick. A detailed inspection of the aircraft at Gatwick revealed a fracture in one of the tail fin support spars, necessitating a lengthy repair. On an airliner with wing-mounted engines under the same circumstances, the engine mounting pins would probably have snapped.|$|E
50|$|Whenever braking {{actions are}} issued they are informing pilots that the {{aircraft}} maximum crosswind limits {{may have to}} be reduced on that runway because of reduced surface friction (grip). This should alert pilots that they may experience lateral/directional control issues during the landing roll-out. In a crosswind the pilot tacks into wind to make allowances for the sideways force that is being applied to the aircraft. This sideways force occurs as the wind strikes the aircraft's vertical fin causing the aircraft to weathercock or weathervane. This manifests itself as an angular displacement of the fuselage relative to the runway centreline. This angular displacement is known as drift angle. Just before or upon initial ground contact the pilot must re-align the fuselage to zero the drift angle (i.e. correct it to parallel with the runway's centreline). This re-alignment is accomplished using the rudder <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> As the wheels make contact with the runway surface {{there are a lot of}} side forces and torsion placed on the tyres due to them countering the weathervane effect which continues to try to act upon the aircraft. A combination of the tyres inherent strength and the action of the runway surface friction with the tyres ensure that the pilot can continue to keep the aircraft aligned with the runway as the aircraft decelerates during the landing roll. If however the surface friction is diminished because of contamination then this may upset the balance of forces resulting in insufficient directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. To ensure this does not occur there is a pro-rata reduction in the aircraft's crosswinds limits, which in turn limits the sideways forces acting on the aircraft, thus ensuring sufficient directional control. This is the explanation for approach and landing; for takeoff the converse is true. The rudder applies a force to counter the crosswind forces as the aircraft accelerates down the runway. At the same time the tyres are accommodating these forces through sidewall torsion, and giving grip with the runway surface. As the aircraft transitions from a ground vehicle to a flying vehicle rudder input is stopped by the pilot and the aircraft will weathervane. The subsequent drift angle will allow the aircraft to fly on a straight course.|$|E

5000|$|On 2 April 2015, the BEA {{announced}} that a consensus had emerged that erratic and erroneous values of the EPR appeared for both engines two to three minutes after levelling off {{at an altitude of}} 31,000 ft. The EPR is the main parameter for engine power management, and is derived from pressure sensors at the engine inlets. The sensors had probably become clogged with ice in this case. Such icing is normally prevented by a hot-air system, which likely was not activated by the aircrew during climb and cruise, according to BEA [...] "analysis of the available data". The faulty EPR values caused the engine controllers to limit the thrust to much less than required to maintain sufficient airspeed for stability at the altitude that the autopilot tried to maintain by increasing the angle of attack until stall occurred. Twenty seconds after the initial stall, the plane suddenly rolled sharply left to almost full inversion as the autopilot disengaged, and pitched nose down to near vertical. The BEA notes that [...] "the recorded parameters indicate that there were no stall recovery manœuvres by the crew", while the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflections remained those that would normally intend nose-up and right-roll. The BEA noted two previous similar incidents involving MD-82 and MD-83 aircraft, where the aircrews were alert enough to notice the loss of airspeed and intervene before loss of control. The first one was Spirit Airlines Flight 970. The aircraft involved, registered as N823NK, was a MD-82 flying in mid day in June 2002 when it suffered a loss of thrust on both engines, in cruise at an altitude of 33,000 ft, that is about 10,000 m. The two pressure sensors, located on the engine nose bullets, were blocked by ice crystals, leading to incorrect indications and over-estimation of the EPR. The crew noticed the drop in speed and the precursor indications of a stall just before disengagement of the autopilot and putting the aeroplane into a descent. They had not activated the engine anti-ice systems. The second one involved was a MD-83 operated by Swiftair that occurred in June 2014. The crew was aware of the drop of their airspeed and successfully recovered.|$|E
