Experiments undertaken on a RadarSAT- 2 SAR scene collected over well-known <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> show that all the polSAR architectures allow correctly emphasizing <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> {{with respect to the}} surrounding sea. Full-pol and compact-pol SAR architectures allow detecting <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> without any adaptive thresholding, the latter is needed when dealing with dual-pol (co-co) SAR measurements. As a matter of fact, the key pitfall of pol-SAR, i. e. its limited swath, can be successfully overcame by compact-polarimetric architecture that, with respect to sea <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> observation, exhibits performance similar to full-polarimetric SAR...|$|R

40|$|A polarimetric {{model to}} relate the degree of polarization, DoP, to the sea surface {{scattering}} with and without <b>oil</b> <b>slicks,</b> under low-to-moderate wind conditions, is first proposed.

40|$|An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{measurements}} for discriminating between two <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> types observed {{on the sea}} surface: naturally-occurring oil seeps versus human-related oil spills—the use of satellite sensors for this task is poorly documented in scientific literature. A long-term RADARSAT dataset (2008 – 2012) is exploited to investigate <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> in Campeche Bay (Gulf of Mexico). Simple Classification Algorithms to distinguish the <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> type are designed based on standard multivariate data analysis techniques. Various attributes of geometry, shape, and dimension that describe the <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> Size Information are combined with SAR-derived backscatter coefficients—sigma-(σo), beta-(βo), and gamma-(γo) naught. The combination of several of these characteristics is capable of distinguishing the <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> type with ~ 70 % of overall accuracy, however, the sole and simple use of two specific <b>oil</b> <b>slick’s</b> Size Information (i. e., area and perimeter) is equally capable of distinguishing seeps from spills.

Horizontal salinity gradients of 4 % in one meter and convergence velocities {{of the order}} of 0. 1 m/sec were observed. Visibility improved from one meter to two meters as certain boundaries were crossed. Fronts near the mouth of the bay are associated with the tidal exchange with shelf water. By capturing and holding <b>oil</b> <b>slicks,</b> these frontal systems also significantly influence the movement and dispersion of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> in Delaware Bay.

40|$|Unambiguous {{detection}} of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> by remote sensing techniques has proven an elusive goal. This article presents new thermal infrared spectra of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> made from five different crude oil samples {{with a wide}} range of API gravities and compositions. After a brief outgassing phase, all <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> spectra are quite similar and little affected by thickness, extended exposure to air or sunlight, and even by emulsification with seawater (mousse formation). Thus, <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> provide a remarkably unvarying spectral signature as remote sensing targets in the thermal infrared compared to other regions of the spectrum. This spectral signature in the 8 - 14 micron atmospheric window is flat, with an average reflectance of 4 percent. Seawater, on the other hand, has a spectrum that varies in reflectance with wavelength in the 8 - 14 micron window from 0. 90 to 3. 65 percent. In addition, we show that sea foam displays a reflectance spectrum quite similar to that of seawater in the 8 - 14 micron region. This results in a relatively uniform spectral background, against which <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> can be detected, based on their different spectral signature...|$|R

An <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> floating on water was heated by a nichrome wire electrically in the experiment. The other experiment was done for ascertain whether the critical Marangoni number practically affects the flame spread rate over the <b>oil</b> <b>slick.</b> It was found that the critical Marangoni number for an <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> floating on water was fairly large, e. g. 7600 ± 730 for decane.

This sensitivity is verified against HP measurements obtained transforming actual L- and C-band quad-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data where both <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and weak-damping look-alikes are present.

40|$|Application of dispersants aims {{to enhance}} the natural {{dispersion}} process {{in order to reduce}} the size of the slick and the amount of oil at the surface. This study presents an approach for modeling the development of the surface <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> as a function of the wind speed, oil viscosity, and dispersant application. We modeled the <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> mass distribution across a transect through the slick over time taking into account the continuous entrainment of oil, resurfacing process of the different oil droplet size classes and horizontal transport. Outcomes show distinctively different <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> features, depending on how favorable conditions are for dispersion. A large comet-shaped slick is formed in the case of suboptimal dispersion. Optimal dispersion yields a small surface <b>oil</b> <b>slick,</b> with a large mass of oil suspended. The benefit of dispersants is limited to in conditions with suboptimal natural dispersion, with the exception of extremely unfavorable conditions in which the slick size would be increased. The <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> length, fraction of oil still floating, lifetime of the slick, and wind drift are highly influenced by wind speed and related mixing conditions, and to a lesser extent by oil properties. In the newly defined “Dispersibility Factor” (DF) the <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> properties and environmental conditions can be combined into one value that correlates with the simulation outcomes and therefore can be used as an indicator of favorability of natural dispersion and likelihood of added value of chemical dispersion...|$|R
