40|$|Propulsion for the Deep Space One (DS 1) spacecra is {{provided}} by a xenon ion engine. Xenon is stored in a supercritical state and is delivered as a low pressure gas to the thruster and two cathodes (called the main cathode and neutralizer) by a Xenon Feed System (XFS). This mission requires tight constraints on thruster performance, which in turn requires separate and very accurate throttling of the thruster and cathode flows; the DS 1 spacecraf {{is the first of}} its type to utilize a xenon ion engine that can be throttled. Flow is regulated separately to the thruster and cathodes to an accuracy of + 3 % using three calibrated Flow Control Devices (FCDs) which are each fed by a dedicated plenum tank. Bang-bang regulators are used to control the set pressures in the plena. The resulting XFS control algorithms are quite complex. The XFS is controlled by a <b>Digital</b> Control <b>Interface</b> <b>Unit</b> (DC 1 U) and the control algorithm for achieving steady state xenon flow is presented.
