5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and <b>James,</b> <b>said</b> that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere else in the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E

25|$|James {{made his}} Manchester City debut on 17 January 2004 in a 1–1 home draw with Blackburn Rovers. City won {{only four of}} the {{seventeen}} matches that James started, two of which came after James saved penalties against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leicester City. <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that exploring the field of sport psychology improved his skills as a goalkeeper, particularly saving penalty kicks.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World We Live In, and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E
500|$|Nicole and Geoff's {{relationship}} became strained. Nicole {{decided to}} plan a return trip to the island, believing it would solve their problems and bring them closer together. <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that Geoff loved the surprise, but found Nicole [...] "very sexy and tempting". She added that everything about Nicole forced Geoff to question his religious beliefs and he felt he [...] "needed to back away". Their trip soon turned disastrous when a man named Derrick Quaid (John Atkinson) stole their food and intimidated the couple. He admitted he were a murderer and tried to attack Geoff with a knife. <b>James</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "put himself in harms way" [...] to save Nicole.|$|E

500|$|James {{felt that}} the Ascension's title match was bland, but he liked that their {{characters}} had gone from cheesy to serious. <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that the women's match was fantastic and he [...] "loved the small touches", while praising Paige's new look, saying that it [...] "just exudes danger". For the main event, <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "this didn't feel like a ladder match. Dallas simply {{did not take the}} risks needed to show that he really wanted to retain his title". However, he was not disappointed because he did not [...] "expect too much from a Bo Dallas match". James felt that it was a problem to close the show with Dallas-Neville because [...] "the show could only go down" [...] from Cesaro-Zayn. Lastly, James had some technical issues viewing the live stream of the event, where the video paused during the Cesaro-Zayn match, and the feed cut out during Rusev's appearance, but returned before the main event match started.|$|E
500|$|In March2011, James {{confirmed}} {{that she had}} left Home and Away. She has already filmed her final scenes and Nicole will leave on-screen later in the year.

5000|$|<b>James</b> has <b>said</b> he {{believes}} taxes {{should be kept}} [...] "low, simple, broad, and predictable" [...] and that increases in government spending should be matched to inflation and population growth.

500|$|Wanderone had {{no known}} children. Singer Etta <b>James</b> <b>said</b> she {{believed}} that he was her biological father, having reportedly been told this by her mother, {{as well as by}} others who knew her mother and whom James described as [...] "people who were there and should know". However, there is no published evidence of such a relationship. James and Wanderone are only known to have met once, in 1987.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{the serial}} {{embarked}} on two lesbian storylines, {{one of which}} involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what Nicole was like when she first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. <b>James</b> <b>said</b> Nicole was [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that people were talking about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however <b>James</b> <b>said</b> Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E
500|$|Nicole {{became more}} irresponsible {{with the more}} she drank {{and was in the}} company of many men. Geoff arrived and saved her from danger, Lewis said there was a part of Geoff that still loved Nicole. However they did not start {{anything}} again, <b>James</b> <b>said</b> she understood why because of their complicated backstory. However Geoff continued to support Nicole as he realised that [...] "a lot of people she was closest to have deserted her". Nicole's unpredictable behaviour continued thereafter. All that Geoff could offer was to be there for her because ultimately [...] "Nicole {{is the only one that}} can save her from herself." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 1914 James {{wrote an}} article for The Times Literary Supplement {{surveying}} the younger generation of British novelists and comparing them with their eminent elder contemporaries. In the latter category James put Bennett, Joseph Conrad, John Galsworthy, Maurice Hewlett and HGWells. The four new authors on whom he focused were Walpole, Gilbert Cannan, Compton Mackenzie and D H Lawrence. It was a very lengthy article, {{to the extent that}} it had to be spread across two issues of the Supplement in March and April 1914. <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that agreeing to write it had been [...] "an insensate step", but from Walpole's point of view it was highly satisfactory: one of the greatest living authors had publicly ranked him among the finest young British novelists.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to instrumentation, Syro features several vocal tracks. Among them are edited [...] "unintelligible" [...] tracks of James, his wife Anastasia Rybina {{and his two}} sons, as well as both his mother and father, who appear on [...] "XMAS_EVET10". He recorded several additional [...] "poppy" [...] vocals of his parents—none of which were used on Syro—and stored [...] "entire sample packs of their voices" [...] during the process. On the album's overall sound, <b>James</b> <b>said</b> it's [...] " [...] pop album, or as poppy as it's going to get" [...] and [...] "pleasurable to listen to … maybe just the composition's changed, but there's no next-level beats on there". He attributed this change in style to the fact he no longer used computer-controlled percussion during Syros sessions.|$|E
500|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the contest focused on North Carolina's rejection by the Bowl Alliance, the Tar Heels' new coach, and questions about whether a lightly regarded and unranked Virginia Tech team could compete with a top-five North Carolina squad. This latter fact was reflected in the game's point spread. On December 9, shortly after the matchup was announced, spread bettors favored North Carolina to win by 12 points. Several sports commentators, including Lou Holtz and Craig <b>James,</b> <b>said</b> North Carolina deserved a more prestigious bowl game due to its high ranking. [...] "The Alliance has not served its purpose," [...] Holtz said in an interview. [...] "It's politics as usual." [...] The game was the 27th meeting between the two teams, continuing a matchup that first started in 1895. Despite that early beginning, the two teams hadn't played each other since 1946.|$|E

500|$|A {{recording}} by Tanya Donelly {{appeared on}} her 2006 album This Hungry Life {{and later on}} a CD accompanying Uncuts feature article on Harrison's career, in the August 2008 issue of the magazine. My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James opened his 2009 EP of Harrison compositions, Tribute To, with the song – a cover that Drowned in Sound praised as [...] "not only the standout moment, but {{also one of the}} most beautiful and arresting songs of the year". Having recorded the EP within days of Harrison's death in November 2001, <b>James</b> <b>said</b> he decided to release it eight years later partly as a result of attending the David Lynch Foundation's Transcendental Meditation awareness concert, [...] "Change Begins Within", where [...] "'s name came up a lot... his spirit was very big at that event." ...|$|E
500|$|Going {{into his}} senior season, Tyler, wearing a jersey number of 45, was the school's seventh leading rusher. Tyler {{was moved to}} halfback {{early in the season}} after the Huskies' third-string halfback was injured. Washington won 50–7 and 45–7 in games against Air Force and Northwestern; in the second game, Tyler scored from one, three, and six yards in the first quarter. After {{splitting}} their next two games, the back scored twice from nineyards to help the Huskies beat Oregon State 41–6. At this point, Tyler was third in the conference with 49points scored and fourth with 446yards rushing. Washington then beat Stanford 27–24; during the game, Tyler injured a tendon in his right knee, leading to him being used sparsely in the final four regular season games. After a 24–10 loss to Navy in which head coach Don <b>James</b> <b>said</b> Washington was [...] "embarrassed", the Huskies were 5–2 (2–1 in the Pacific-10 Conference) and still top contenders for a Rose Bowl appearance.|$|E
500|$|Another {{relationship}} Nicole pursued {{was with}} Aden Jefferies, her longtime closest friend. Aden {{had a strong}} fanbase from his previous relationship with Belle Taylor. This resulted in the audience being divided over their relationship. Nicole has also been featured in various other romantic storylines, such as a brief fling with Liam Murphy, <b>James</b> <b>said</b> that he was compatible with Nicole because he had [...] "the edge she was after". She also dated Trey Palmer and they became involved in sex tape storyline, many newspapers reported on the plot because it [...] "echoed" [...] co-star Lewis' real life sex tape scandal. Producer Welsh once stated he believed Nicole was destined to become [...] "full circle" [...] and Nicole began behaving erratic and wild once more, due to her failed romances {{and the death of}} her friend Belle. She also had an affair with an older male character, Sid Walker. James liked the fact Nicole had so many romances because she got to kiss many of her co-stars.|$|E
