40|$|The {{contents}} of 3674 mackerel stomacks sampled during 1981 and 1982 are analysed and presented. The samples {{were taken by}} five countries at 270 different stations {{as a part of}} The International Stomach Sampling Programme in the North Sea. The <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> were trawl, <b>hook</b> and line, gill net and purse seine. The most important prey items in percent wet weight were copepods, euphausiids and fish. The fish prey items were sandeel, Norway pout, herring, sprat, pearl side, cod, haddock, horse mackerel, pipe-fish, dragonet, weever and dab. An attempt was made to calculate the North Sea mackerel stock’s annual food consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{fish species}} {{assemblage}} in a Niger Delta mangrove creek, Nigeria, of 25 species from 16 families comprising {{a total of}} 1163 individuals were determined for the parameters of length-weight relationships, from November, 2004 to June, 2006. The fish samples were collected from three stations at flood tides. The fishing <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> were <b>hooks</b> and lines, and cast net. The estimated values of the exponent (b) ranged between 0. 97 (Epinephelus aeneus) and 5. 67 (Dasyatis margarita). The mean value of ‘b’ for all the species was 3. 16 (SD = 0. 093). Apart from b values of E. aeneus (0. 97), L. goreensis (2. 15), T. guineensis (4. 25) and D. margarita (5. 67) which were significantly different from 3, indicating allometric growth pattern, the other species had ‘b’ values {{not significantly different from}} 3, indicating isometric growth pattern. The regression coefficient (r) ranged from 0. 22 for E. aeneus to 0. 99 for T. lepturus. Except for E. aeneus, the r for the length-weight relationships of the fishes is high which indicate increase in length with increase in weight. Except for E. aeneus, L. agennes and D. margarita, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that there was highly significant regression (p< 0. 001; 0. 01; 0. 05) of weight on length for the fish species. This study adds more information to the existing data on the management and culture of fish species in Buguma Creek which has the first Brackish Water Experimental Fish Farm in Nigeria...|$|R
50|$|With {{regards to}} the type of fishing gears, the {{majority}} of the fisherman <b>uses</b> <b>hook</b> and the line type. The species caught using this type are frigate tunas, big eye scads, yellow fin tunas, pacific sailfish groupers, Spanish mackerels and slip mouth, round scads, maya-maya, flying fish, bumo and saray. Other types <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> are spear guns, gillnets and the casting net. The municipality of San Luis together with BFAR has provided payaos to fisherman association of coastal barangays to increase fish catch of fisherman.|$|R

50|$|Drag nets are {{commonly}} used in the lagoon. Other fishing <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> are bottles also called 'atukpaxe' which are mostly <b>used</b> by women, <b>hook</b> and line, acadja and traps. Although acadjas act as fish aggregating devices that provide shelter for fish thereby enhancing fish breeding in the lagoon, the use of mangroves and twigs, which are cut from neighboring vegetation, makes this method of fishing environmentally unfriendly. When the lagoon waters are low fish are caught using the hand.|$|R
