We demonstrate two main inherent limitations of the bilateral SDF approach to international risk-sharing.

Second, the deviations between the discount factors obtained in this way (the imprecision in the measurement of marginal utility growth) are larger for countries whose stock market <b>excess</b> return <b>shocks</b> are relatively less important.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} applicability of recently developed simulation-based econometric methods {{to the analysis of}} spatial price determination and integration of markets. As such a measure of market integration is developed within the context of well-known point-location competitive price equilibrium model. Two markets are said to be integrated to the extent that an <b>excess</b> demand <b>shock</b> arising in one region is transmitted to the other region. This model imposes the market efficiency (i. e., the law of one price) and explicitly accounts for the nonlinear relationship between prices and underlying variables. A critical distinction from most of the current literature is that market integration is defined and estimated as a degree rather than a binary outcome. Simulation-based estimation approach to spatial market integration can be outlined as follows: summarize the information contained in prices in an auxiliary (reduced) model and match the parameters of the auxiliary model obtained from observed data to the parameters of the same model obtained from simulated data. The particular estimation framework used is known as the indirect inference methodology. The auxiliary model is chosen as a finite order Gaussian vector auto-regression fo...|$|R

First, we present some conceptual discussion on the meaning of excess liquidity in countries with developed financial markets, where the monetary base plays only a relatively minor quantitative role. Moreover, we analyse the theoretical channels through which <b>shocks</b> to <b>excess</b> liquidity may be transmitted across borders. The co-movement between several measures of excess liquidity across a relatively large number of countries is significant, but the evidence of cross-country spill-over of excess liquidity on excess liquidity and nominal spending abroad is not very strong. Last, we estimate an SVAR model for an aggregate of the major industrialised countries and analyse the transmission of <b>shocks</b> to global <b>excess</b> liquidity to a number of domestic variables in the world’s two largest economies (the US and the euro area). Our overall conclusion is that global excess liquidity appears to be a useful measure of the monetary policy stance {{at the level of the}} world economy. Moreover, there is some evidence that global <b>excess</b> liquidity <b>shocks</b> have some spill-over on output, the price level and asset prices in the euro area, while the US appears to be more insulated from global shocksGlobal excess liquidity, monetary aggregates, international transmission of shocks, international economics. ...|$|R

The paper finds that the introduction of stock index options: (i) significantly reduces the impact of negative (and, to a lesser extent, positive) shocks on conditional volatility in five out of six countries, (ii) has no significant impact on relative unconditional volatility of stocks belonging to the optioned index in four out of six countries.

In this experimental model of systemic inflammation, we sought to investigate whether septic neutrophil activation, evaluated by the plasma levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated protein (NGAL), is modulated by the timing of hydrocortisone treatment. Methods Sixteen anesthetized pigs were allocated to one of four equally sized groups. Three of these groups received endotoxin at 203 ̆bcg 2 ̆ 00972 ̆ 009 kg 2 ̆ 2121 2 ̆ 00972 ̆ 009 h 2 ̆ 2121 for 60 h so as to induce endotoxemic shock.

Endotoxemic pigs not receiving hydrocortisone and non-endotoxemic pigs served as control groups. Physiologic variables, hematology, and biochemistry, including plasma NGAL, were measured repeatedly. Results Hydrocortisone treatment prior to endotoxemia attenuated some inflammatory, hematological, circulatory, and metabolic manifestations of shock (i. e., higher white blood cell count, higher mean arterial pressure, lower heart rate and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, higher left ventricular stroke work index, higher base <b>excess).</b> Endotoxemic <b>shock</b> increased plasma NGAL (p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001). In pigs given hydrocortisone before the endotoxin infusion, plasma NGAL was lower as compared to those given hydrocortisone at endotoxemic shock (p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 05). Plasma NGAL levels correlated inversely to neutrophil granulocyte counts (rho 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2120. 65) but not to urine output (rho 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2120. 10) {{at the end of the}} experiment.

Walt Disney, the brand of the conservative family values, takes under its umbrella David Lynch, the author who epitomizes transgression, bringing to the light the obscene underworld of perverted sex and violence that lurks beneath the respectable surface of our lives. Today, more and more, the cultural-economic apparatus itself, in order to reproduce itself in the market competition conditions, has not only to tolerate, but directly to incite stronger and stronger shocking effects and products. Suffice it to recall recent trends in visual arts: {{gone are the days when}} we had simple statues or enframed paintings - what we get now are expositions of frames themselves without paintings, expositions of dead cows and their excrements, videos of the inside of the human body (gastroscopy and colonoscopy), inclusion of smell into the exposition, etc. etc. (This tendency often leads to the comic confusion, when a work of art is mistaken for an everyday object or vice versa. Recently, in Potsdamer Platz, the largest construction site in Berlin, the coordinated movement of dozens of gigantic cranes was staged as an art performance - doubtlessly perceived by a lot of uninformed bypassers as part of an intense construction activity [...] . I myself made the opposite blunder during a trip to Berlin: I noticed at the sides and above all the main streets numerous large blue tube and pipes, as if the intricate cobweb of water, phone, electricity, etc., was no longer hidden beneath the earth, but displayed in public.

We construct a new credit spread index, employing an extensive micro-level data set of secondary market prices of outstanding senior unsecured bonds over the 1973 – 2009 period. Compared with the standard default-risk and other finan-cial indicators, our credit spread index is a robust predictor of future economic growth across a variety of economic indicators, sample periods, and forecast horizons. Using an empirical bond-pricing framework, we also decompose our credit spread index into a predictable component that captures the available firm-specific information on expected defaults and a residual component—the excess bond premium—which we argue reflects the price of default risk rather than the risk of default. Our results indicate that a sub-stantial portion of the predictive content of credit spreads for economic activity is due to the <b>excess</b> bond premium. <b>Shocks</b> to the <b>excess</b> bond premium that are orthogonal to {{the current state of the}} economy, the Treasury term structure, and stock returns are shown to cause significant declines in consumption, investment, and output as well as in equity prices.

We present a series of late-time spectra of SN 2005 ip and a first radio detection of this SN, plus late-time X-rays, all of which indicate that its CSM interaction is still strong a decade post-explosion. We also present and discuss new spectra of geriatric SNe with continued CSM interaction: SN 1988 Z, SN 1993 J, and SN 1998 S. From 3 - 10 yr post-explosion, SN 2005 ip's H-alpha luminosity and other observed characteristics were nearly identical {{to those of the}} radio-luminous SN 1988 Z, and much more luminous than SNe 1993 J and 1998 S. At 10 yr after explosion, SN 2005 ip showed a drop in Hα luminosity, followed by a quick resurgence over several months. We interpret this variability as ejecta crashing into a dense shell located at around 0. 05 pc from the star, which may be the same shell that caused the IR echo at earlier epochs. The extreme H-alpha luminosities in SN 2005 ip and SN 1988 Z are still dominated by the forward shock at 10 yr post-explosion, whereas SN 1993 J and SN 1998 S are dominated by the reverse shock at a similar age. Continuous strong CSM interaction in SNe 2005 ip and 1988 Z is indicative of enhanced mass loss for about 1 e 3 yr before core collapse, longer than Ne, O, or Si burning phases.

40|$|Magnetospheric {{accretion}} is {{an important}} process {{for a wide range}} of astrophysical systems, and may play a role in the formation of gas giant planets. Extending the formalism describing stellar magnetospheric accretion into the planetary regime, we demonstrate that magnetospheric processes may govern accretion onto young gas giants in the isolation phase of their development. Planets in the isolation phase have cleared out large gaps in their surrounding circumstellar disks, and settled into a quasi-static equilibrium with radii only modestly larger than their final sizes (i. e., r ∼ 1. 4 rfinal). Magnetospheric accretion is less likely to play a role in a young gas giant’s main accretion phase, when the planet’s envelope is predicted to be much larger than the planet’s Alfvén radius. For a fiducial 1 MJ gas giant planet with a remnant isolation phase accretion rate of M ̇ = 10 − 10 Myr− 1 = 10 − 7 MJyr− 1, the disk accretion will be truncated at ∼ 2. 7 rJ (with rJ is Jupiter’s radius) and drive the planet to rotate with a period of ∼ 7 hours. Thermal emission from planetary magnetospheric accretion will be difficult to observe; the most promising observational signatures may be non-thermal, such as gyrosynchrotron radiation that is clearly modulated at a period much shorter than the rotation period of the host star. Subject headings: accretion, accretion disks — planets —etc 1. introduction Magnetically controlled accretion (e. g.

FINDINGS: Neither of the co-primary outcomes was significantly reduced by allocation to metoprolol. For death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest, 2166 (9. 4 %) patients allocated metoprolol had at least one such event compared with 2261 (9. 9 %) allocated placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 90 - 1. 01; p= 0. 1). For death alone, there were 1774 (7. 7 %) deaths in the metoprolol group versus 1797 (7. 8 %) in the placebo group (OR 0. 99, 0. 92 - 1. 05; p= 0. 69). Allocation to metoprolol was associated with five fewer people having reinfarction (464 [2. 0 %] metoprolol vs 568 [2. 5 %] placebo; OR 0. 82, 0. 72 - 0. 92; p= 0. 001) and five fewer having ventricular fibrillation (581 [2. 5 %] vs 698 [3. 0 %]; OR 0. 83, 0. 75 - 0. 93; p= 0. 001) per 1000 treated. Overall, these reductions were counterbalanced by 11 more per 1000 developing cardiogenic shock (1141 [5. 0 %] vs 885 [3. 9 %]; OR 1. 30, 1. 19 - 1. 41; p< 0. 00001). This <b>excess</b> of cardiogenic <b>shock</b> was mainly during days 0 - 1 after admission, whereas the reductions in reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation emerged more gradually. Consequently, the overall effect on death, reinfarction, arrest, or shock was significantly adverse during days 0 - 1 and significantly beneficial thereafter. There was substantial net hazard in haemodynamically unstable patients, and moderate net benefit in those who were relatively stable (particularly after days 0 - 1). INTERPRETATION: The use of early beta-blocker therapy in acute MI reduces the risks of reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation, but increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, especially during the first day or so after admission. Consequently, it might generally be prudent to consider starting beta-blocker therapy in hospital only when the haemodynamic condition after MI has stabilised...|$|R
