One {{reason for that is}} that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing.|$|R

Aims: The measuring of selected indicators of physiological functions in the group of acrobatic rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancers</b> and the comparing their level {{of physical}} capacity with reference values and with level of physical capacity of the best acrobatic rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancers</b> of the world were the main purposes of this study [...] Methods and design: The study was designed as a qualitative research. 6 pairs (12 subjects) of acrobatic rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancer</b> category A were included in a study group by using a non-randomized selection. The UNIFITTEST (Jump far from the place, sit-up, chin-up, measuring subcutaneous fat), and other measure (handshake, vertical jump, heart rate) were done. Further quantitative data were collected by using questionnaires. Several statistical methods were used to process the data obtained. All results were compared with reference values. Results: According to our expectation the dancers of acrobatic rock and roll were better than average population in the most tests. Key words: acrobatic [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Although he {{was mainly}} known in North East England, he also toured. He {{appeared}} {{with a group}} of rock 'n' <b>roll</b> <b>dancers</b> in London, before becoming a vocalist and turning his patter between songs into a comedy act. He became a cabaret star appearing alongside the likes of Johnny Mathis, Roy Orbison and Louis Armstrong. He also became popular in Africa and the Middle East, appearing on bills with Ella Fitzgerald and José Feliciano.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to programs {{of works by}} several Dance Collective choreographers, the company assisted full-evening works by individual artistic directors. Kramer's first full-evening, site specific piece, Point of View, moved up the stairway and into the windowsills of the old ICA building in Boston. Her other full-evening works involved large interactive sets designed by Dutch designer, Pieter Smit. In Foreign Fling, she climbed a mountain of defunct TV's and electronics. In One False Move, she and Smit [...] "built" [...] a roller coaster of a path to a height of 12' above the stage, singing, speaking several languages, and moving all the while. In After Ever, the <b>dancers</b> climbed, <b>rolled,</b> and flung themselves onto and through a hand-knotted rope net (18'x22') which dropped into the Cyclorama, bisecting the circular performance space.|$|R

James, who saw Stringbeans perform around 1914, said of him:As he {{attacks the}} piano, Stringbean’s head starts to nod, his {{shoulders}} shake, {{and his body}} begins to quiver. Slowly, he sinks {{to the floor of}} the stage. Before he submerges, he is executing the Snake Hips…, shouting the blues and, as he hits the deck still playing the piano, performing a horizontal grind which would make today’s rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancers</b> seem like staid citizens.|$|R

Testing dyspraxia {{of children}} and adolescents dancing acrobatic rock'n'roll and {{of children and}} adolescents with specific abnormalities. Prague: Charles University, 2 nd Faculty of Medicine, Department of rehabilitation and sports medicine, 2015. 91 p. Supervisor MUDr. Josef Kraus, CSc. Abstract The theoretical part of this thesis briefly summarizes the findings of developmental dyspraxia and briefly characterizes different diseases encountered by tested subjects from a test sample of children with specific abnormalities, neurofibromatosis type 1 and Asperger's syndrome, and explores their relationship with developmental dyspraxia. The possibility of using dance therapy is also mentioned. The practical part is focused on evaluating the level of motor skills of children with specific abnormalities and children's rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancers</b> using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2. Another objective is to determine whether the level of motor skills correlates with the level of attention tested by the Test of attention d 2. The final goal is to assess the degree of physical activity of rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancers</b> using the accelerometer ActiGraph GT 3 X. We confirm the presence of motor difficulties of children with specific abnormalities, however we did not confirm [...] ...|$|R

The stops, the pauses, in that one are really fun. I {{appreciated}} the rhythmic hybrids, the gaps between the bass lines, the repetitive figures with space between them. James Taylor and I had dinner with Sting once at our mutual manager's place. He was quite effusive about us being his heroes. So I always {{think of him as}} our son." ...|$|R
50|$|Because of her pure {{classical}} technique, Lorrayne {{was cast}} in many major works in the Royal Ballet repertory, including The Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, Cinderella, and The Nutcracker. Besides frequent appearances {{on the stage of}} the Royal Opera House, she toured with the company around the world, to Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Australia. She was often partnered by the male stars of the company, including Anthony Dowell, Donald MacLeary, and Rudolf Nureyev. In 1980, she left the Royal Ballet to form her own company, Ballet Imperiale. A small troupe devoted to presenting works in the Russian classical style, Ballet Imperiale toured the English provinces, Wales, and Scotland. Lorrayne served as administrator, manager, artistic director, and principal <b>dancer</b> all <b>rolled</b> into one. Given the burdens of running the company, not to mention the expense, it is little wonder that the troupe was short-lived.|$|R
25|$|Dancers {{strive to}} exhibit ballon in large jumps {{as well as}} in small, quick jumps such as petite allegro steps. For example, ballon is a {{characteristic}} of pas de chat. The dancer starts from a plié (bent knees) and then, during the ascending phase of the step, lifts each knee in succession with hips turned out, so that for a moment both feet are in the air and the dancer appears to be suspended in air. To give the appearance of lightness when landing, the <b>dancer</b> pliés and <b>rolls</b> the foot from toe to heel.|$|R
5000|$|Roll Away with a Half Sashay : Two dancers {{facing in}} the same direction, holding hands. One <b>dancer</b> spins (the <b>roll</b> away) with a full turn (360°) towards {{and in front of}} the other dancer, who sidesteps (the half sashay) behind to {{exchange}} places. At the end of the figure, the dancers have changed places but are still facing {{in the same}} direction as initially. (Most commonly, this figure starts with the lady on the gent's left and the lady passes in front of the gent). Giving weight is of key importance in this figure.|$|R
5000|$|Iglesias {{showed no}} {{interest}} in school, and after flunking out at age 13 he tried different apprenticeships, including gardening school, but did not persevere. The only issue that held his interest was rock and roll. At age 17, José was a fixture of social ballrooms in the Mataderos and Flores neighborhoods, singing mostly rock and roll covers. He also gained local fame as a rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancer,</b> while {{most people in the}} suburbs were tango dancers. To highlight this contrast, his friends started calling him [...] "Tango" [...] or [...] "Tanguito" [...] (the diminutive of [...] "tango").|$|R
50|$|Csaba is one {{of three}} brothers, the others being Balázs and Tamás. At age 11 he became an acrobatic rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancer,</b> and later became lead singer of rock band touring several European countries. In 2000 he {{graduated}} from Veszprém Secondary School and enrolled in Veszprém's University of Pannonia (Pannon Egyetem university). He also had vocal training under the supervision of Judit Kővári. In 2001 he took part in a Hungarian production of Hair directed by Mészáros Árpád Zsolt. Vastag played the role of Aquarius in the musical theater piece. His first chart break came in 2008 when he reached #4 on the Hungarian Singles Chart.|$|R

The winner of the show was rock and <b>roll</b> <b>dancer</b> El Tekila even through getting buzzed in both the semi-final and the grand final the Spain public voted as the winner whilst Samuel Martí Pérez was runners up and dance group Progenyx finished in 3rd place. The series once again featured the [...] "golden buzzer" [...] which each judge and host can press once or twice this season to put an act straight through to the live semi-finals. The judges can also use the golden buzzer in a semi-final show if all the judges agree on an act they press it and the act goes straight through to the Grand Final.This series Risto Mejide joined the judging panel with last years judges Edurne, Eva Hache and Jorge Javier Vázquez. Santi Millán returned as host.|$|R
