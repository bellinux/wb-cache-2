25|$|Notwithstanding these {{technical}} and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive {{in light of}} the <b>falling</b> <b>costs</b> of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh. Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a spatially explicit model {{to examine how}} urban and suburban communities evolve differently with changes in local economic fundamentals such as rising income or <b>falling</b> commuting <b>costs</b> in the metropolitan area. The model {{highlights the importance of}} environmental amenities and the economy of scale in the provision of public services as determinants of urban spatial structure. Results suggest that urban sprawl, income segregation, and jurisdictional disparities are driven by the same economic conditions and thus tend to co-exist. Rising incomes or <b>falling</b> commuting <b>costs</b> for high-income households in a metropolitan area tend to increase land prices and public services in every community, while rising incomes or <b>falling</b> commuting <b>costs</b> for low-income households can have the opposite effects.

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the <b>falling</b> <b>cost</b> of genome sequencing and the accompanying rise in available genomic data, scientific interest in RiPPs has increased in the last few decades. Because the chemical structures of RiPPs are more closely predictable from genomic data than are other natural products (e.g. alkaloids, terpenoids), their presence in sequenced organisms can, in theory, be identified rapidly. This makes RiPPs an attractive target of modern natural product discovery efforts.|$|R
