25|$|The {{quadrupole}} {{ion trap}} {{works on the}} same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two <b>endcap</b> electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, {{in which case the}} ions are often introduced through an aperture in an <b>endcap</b> electrode.|$|E
25|$|Ions {{may also}} be ejected by the {{resonance}} excitation method, whereby a supplemental oscillatory excitation voltage {{is applied to the}} <b>endcap</b> electrodes, and the trapping voltage amplitude and/or excitation voltage frequency is varied to bring ions into a resonance condition in order of their mass/charge ratio.|$|E
25|$|Cathode strip {{chambers}} (CSC) {{are used}} in the <b>endcap</b> disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.|$|E
40|$|Part 1. <b>Endcaps</b> can be visualized as linkers {{that link}} the 32 ̆ 7 and 52 ̆ 7 ends of DNA duplexes. A series of {{hydrophilic}} diamide <b>endcaps</b> has been synthesized and shown to stabilize very short DNA duplexes (4 base-pair) with Tm {{values in the}} range of 42 - 55 °C. <b>Endcapped</b> CpG oligonucleotides consisting of single-stranded, nicked double-stranded and covalently closed double-stranded forms were synthesized to investigate their immunostimulatory activities and to elucidate the mode of recognition of different forms of CpG oligonucleotides by the immune system. <b>Endcaps</b> were incorporated into both the 32 ̆ 7 and 52 ̆ 7 ends of self-complementary DNA duplexes (8 - 20 base-pair) to form nicked, DNA duplexes that were capped on both ends. Closed <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes were obtained by enzymatic ligation of the nicked DNA duplexes. Analysis of the ligation mixtures by HPLC and PAGE indicated that <b>endcapped</b> duplexes smaller than 11 base-pair were not ligated. In addition, the efficiency of ligation was dependent on the number of nucleotides flanking the 32 ̆ 7 - and 52 ̆ 7 ends of the nick. The nuclease stability of these <b>endcapped</b> CpG oligonucleotides was established to be at least 6 -fold more stable than unmodified oligonucleotides, with half-lives of 30 minutes for the <b>endcapped</b> single stranded DNA and 6 - 20 hours for the ligated and nicked <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes, respectively. <b>Endcapped</b> CpG oligonucleotides stimulated IL- 6 and IL- 12 secretion (in vitro) and were administered to tumor implanted mice. The nicked <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes and the <b>endcapped</b> single stranded DNA extended the life span of the mice beyond that of the untreated control mice. ^ Part II. Thiol terminated amine and guanidinium derivatives were synthesized on solid support and in solution. These compounds were conjugated to 5 nm and 10 nm gold nanoparticles. These amine and guanidinium functionalized gold nanoparticles were characterized by UV spectroscopy and electron microscopy and found to be stable for about 12 hours. The amine functionalized gold colloid was more stable than the guanidinium functionalized gold colloid. These functionalized gold colloids were found to adhere to the surface of cells (HepG 2 and HeLa) and were taken up by endocytosis. No nuclear localization of these gold conjugates was observed. ...|$|R
40|$|Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (5 ′-phosphorylated) {{of varying}} lengths were capped using a {{polyamide}} linker to form thermodynamically stable, <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes containing 8 – 14 bp. We have employed these <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes as tools {{to determine the}} DNA footprint of T 4 DNA ligase. By high-performance liquid chromatography and PAGE analysis of the ligation mixtures of the <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes, {{we have found that}} by varying the lengths and the position of the nick, we can determine the minimal DNA-binding site as well as the mode of binding (symmetrical or asymmetrical binding) by the enzyme. The results of the study revealed that a 11 bp <b>endcapped</b> duplex was the shortest duplex effectively ligated. Dependence of ligation efficiency on nick position demonstrates that T 4 DNA ligase bound asymmetrically to its DNA substrate. The use of a set of thermodynamically stable <b>endcapped</b> deoxyribonucleoside duplexes as a tool to elucidate the DNA footprint provides an efficient strategy for footprinting, which avoids ambiguities associated with chemical and biochemical footprinting methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{process of}} <b>endcapping</b> a {{polyimide}} system with an <b>endcapping</b> agent {{in order to}} achieve a controlled decrease in molecular weight and melt viscosity along with predictable fracture resistance of the molded products is disclosed.

40|$|The silanization/hydrosilation {{process was}} {{developed}} to overcome some of the drawbacks {{associated with the use}} of organosilane reagents for the synthesis of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) stationary phases. The first step is called silanization, in which silica or other oxides react with triethoxysilane (TES), resulting in the formation of a silica hydride surface. <b>Endcapping</b> the stationary phase using trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) eliminates the unreacted and accessible silanols on the silica hydride intermediate. This research employed the modification of bare silica to silica hydride via silanization. <b>Endcapping</b> after silanization eliminated accessible and unreacted silanols. <b>Endcapping</b> was confirmed by using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy.
