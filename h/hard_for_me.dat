25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E

I need to feed myself with them." [...] Terry was optimistic about the club's prospects for the future, saying, [...] "It {{is the start of}} something... we've got a great squad, with some great young players, and hungry and experienced players too. It's a great mix." [...] Although praising the atmosphere at Wembley, Terry ruled out returning to the England team, for whom he had not played since 2012. Despite losing, Pochettino expressed pride in his team's performance.|$|E

500|$|Banks was {{a lifelong}} Republican – {{and he also}} once stated that [...] "I'm not goin' {{anywhere}} I'm not wanted" [...] – prompting critics to claim that he was [...] "soft" [...] on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He lost the election and later said, [...] "People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official {{and no matter what}} I did I couldn't change my image...What I learned, was {{that it was going to}} be <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over." [...] Banks endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Dennis Hopper {{directed}} The Hot Spot, {{in which}} Connelly played Gloria Harper, a woman being blackmailed. The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised. Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today, [...] "Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up {{fast in the}} movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [...] in The Hot Spot. Not yet 20, Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue". During an interview with Shaeffer, Connelly commented on her first nude scene: [...] "The nudity was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and something I thought about...but it's not in a sleazy context". The same year, director Garry Marshall considered her {{for the role of}} Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman, but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part.|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's very <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do}} with my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E

500|$|Apple Records issued [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on 16 April 1971 in Britain (as Apple 33), {{and three}} days later in America (as Apple 1832). Apple's print {{advertisement}} for the release carried the simple tagline: [...] "A New Single". Among the interviews she gave to the UK music press, Ronnie Spector admitted to Symes that {{it took a long}} time to learn the song [...] "as it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to understand", but she added: [...] "I love the record. It's completely different for me; it's more of a music thing than vocal." [...] In America, Billboard magazine's reviewer described [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] as a [...] "powerful production ballad" [...] that had [...] "all the ingredients to break through big", while suggesting that Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton had contributed to the recording.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics try to {{illustrate}} Bond's psyche in Casino Royale, described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth, not the [...] "superconfident, seemingly invincible, winking kinda ladies' man superspy" [...] {{of the previous}} incarnations. Cornell {{tried to focus on}} the existential dilemmas and possible sacrifices of secret agents - [...] "There's an isolation in that; the stakes are very high. I've done a lot of living in my 42 years, and it wasn't <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to relate to that." [...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and how he will live it and what it will mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to writing}} [...] "Smells Like Nirvana", Yankovic's music career had {{suffered}} from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, UHF and the associated soundtrack. Yankovic called that [...] "the beginning of three years where {{it was kind of}} <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to recover". He started work on a new studio album around 1990. To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a Michael Jackson song, which had proven successful twice before with [...] "Eat It" [...] and [...] "Fat". He had composed a parody of Jackson's [...] "Black or White", titled [...] "Snack All Night", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that [...] "Snack All Night" [...] was not one of his better works. While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is better}} so," [...] Ronald said, as he {{finished}} the letter. [...] "It would only have made it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> if I had seen her again.

500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] finished thirteenth {{place in the}} ratings for the week of May 23–29, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.4. It was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Series creator Matt Groening listed it as his ninth favorite episode of The Simpsons and added [...] "I have a peculiar love of TV clownery". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode: [...] "The invention of the Simpsons' arch enemy as a lugubrious yet psychotic Englishman in dreadlocks succeeds wonderfully in this super-fast, super-funny episode that works by constantly reversing the audience's expectations." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "throughout the episode we found great material; it really seemed clear that the show was starting to turn into the piece we now know and love. It’s <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to relate any deficiencies" [...] and added that [...] "almost every Bob episode offers a lot of fun, and this episode started that trend in fine style." ...|$|E

According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for me to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E

500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. We may not be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E
