This increased separation is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely.In the moving bed technique of preparative chromatography the <b>feed</b> <b>entry</b> and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous, but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed, simulated moving bed technique was proposed. In the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed, the sample inlet and the analyte exit positions are moved continuously, giving the impression of a moving bed.True moving bed chromatography (TMBC) is only a theoretical concept. Its simulation, SMBC is achieved by the use of a multiplicity of columns in series and a complex valve arrangement, which provides for sample and solvent feed, and also analyte and waste takeoff at appropriate locations of any column, whereby it allows switching at regular intervals the sample entry in one direction, the solvent entry in the opposite direction, whilst changing the analyte and waste takeoff positions appropriately as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} using a dry, density-based {{separator}} to achieve efficient, near-face rock removal, {{commonly referred to as}} deshaling, was evaluated in several applications across the U. S [...] Varying amounts of high-density rock exist in most run-of-mine feed. In the central Appalachian coalfields, a rock content exceeding 50 % in the feed to a preparation plant is commonplace due to high amounts of out-of-seam dilution made necessary by extracting coal from thin seams. In the western U. S, an increase in out-of-seam dilution and environmental regulations associated with combustion emissions have resulted in a need to clean low rank coals and dry cleaning may be the only option. A 5 ton/hr mobile deshaling unit incorporating a density-based, air-table technology commercially known as the FGX Separator has been evaluated at mine sites located within the states of Utah, Wyoming, Texas, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The FGX technology utilizes table riffling principles with air as the medium. Air enters through the table and creates a fluidized bed of particles comprised of mostly fine, high density particles. The high density particle bed lifts the low-density coal particles {{to the top of the}} bed. The low-density coal moves toward the front of the table due to mass action and the downward slope of the table. The high-density particles settle through the fluidized particle bed and, upon making contact with the table, moves toward the back of the table with the assistance of table vibration. As a result, the low-density coal particles exit the front of the table closest to the feed whereas the high-density, high-ash content particles leave on the side and front of the table located at the farthest from the <b>feed</b> <b>entry.</b> At each test site, the run-of-mine feed was either directly fed to the FGX unit or pre-screened to remove the majority of the - 6 mm material. The surface moisture of the feed must be maintained below 9 %. Pre-screening is required when the surface moisture of the feed coal exceeds the maximum limit. However, the content of - 6 mm in the feed to the FGX separator should be maintained between 10 % and 20 % to ensure an adequate fluidized bed. A parametric evaluation was conducted using a 3 -level experimental design at each test site to identify the optimum separation performance and parameter values. The test data was used to develop empirical expressions that describe the response variables (i. e., mass yield and product ash content) as a function of the operating parameter values. From this process, it was established that table frequency and longitudinal slope are the most critical factors in controlling both mass yield and clean coal ash while the cross table slope was the least significant. Fan blower frequency is a critical parameter that controls mass yield. Although the splitter positions between product and middling streams and the middling and tailing streams were held constant during the tests, a separate evaluation indicated that performance is sensitive to splitter position within certain lengths of the table and insensitive in others. For a Utah bituminous coal, the FGX separator provided clean coal ash contents that ranged from a low of 8. 57 % to a high of 12. 48 % from a feed coal containing around 17 % ash. From the 29 tests involved in the statistically designed test program, the average clean coal ash content was 10. 76 % while the tailings ash content averaged around 72 %. One of the best separation performances achieved an ash reduction from 17. 36 % to 10. 67 % while recovering 85. 9 % of the total feed mass, which equated to an ash rejection value of around 47 %. The total sulfur content was typically decreased from 1. 61 % to 1. 49 %. These performances were quantified by blending the middlings stream with the clean coal product. At a second Utah site, coal sources from three different bituminous coal seams were treated by the FGX deshaling unit. Three parameter values were varied based on the results obtained from Site No. 1 to obtain the optimum results shown in Table E- 1. Approximately 9 tests were performed on each coal source. The average ash content reductions were: Glenwal (= 25. 6 % to 8. 6 %), Pinnacle (= 17. 3 % to 9. 0 %) and Westridge (= 20. 6 % to 7. 5 %). Under optimum conditions, nearly 70 % of the high-density rock was rejected while recovering approximately 100 % of the 1. 60 float material. In the Powder River Basin, a small portion of the extracted coal is mistakenly diluted with out-of-seam rock. Since coal cleaning is not currently practiced, the diluted coal containing 20 %- 30 % ash is left in the pit as fill material, thereby representing a lost resource. A FGX test program conducted on the high ash sub-bituminous coal revealed the ability to produce clean coal containing 7 %- 8 % ash on a dry basis (5 %- 6 % on an as-received basis) with 62 % recovery. The product grade meets typical end user contract specifications for PRB coal...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is the evaluation of economic indicators of beef cattle farming on a specific family farm in the time period from 2013 to 2015 in Bukovina u Čisté village, Semily District. The family focuses on a crop and livestock production. The farming takes place on 110 hectares of land, the fertile ground makes 54 ha. The livestock production concentrates on breeding cows without any milk production and the bulls fattening. The amount of cows was 23 pieces to 27 pieces in the period from 2013 to 2015. Because of the crossbreeding the cows following breeds are represented: Czech Pied cattle (20 %), Limousin (72 %) and Charolais (8 %). In the bulls fattening area were more breeds represented caused by the purchased bulls. Breeds represented: Limousin (32 %), Czech Pied cattle (42 %), Blonde d Aquitaine (1 %), Aberdeen Angus (23 %) and Holstein cattle (3 %). The processing and evaluation of economic results was prevented by factors affecting the economics of farming. In the reproduction part are the factors - the calving interval, the age structure of the cows and the scatter of births during the year. The bulls fattening part contains the research of the bulls breeds representation, age structure and carcass weight. The economic indicators consist of {{the evaluation of the}} costs, revenues, profit and the level of profitability. The breeding was evaluated in the conclusion of this dissertation and the suggestions for improvement was recommended. The calving interval of the cows in 2013 lasted on average of 408 days, in 2014 decreased by 9 % to 373 days, and in 2015 decreased by further 9 % up to 337 days. Heifers reached 3 years of age at birthing. The oldest cows were 11 years old. The biggest group of cows was at the age of 7 years with a  27 % share. The Breeders preference is the calving during the winter to spring time period. In 2013 the birthing period lasted from February to July, in 2014 from March, except June and August, until October and in 2015 from February to August. For the entire period was 76 % of births in the barn and 24 % of births on pasture. In the entire period 76 % of births happened in the barn and 24 % of births on pasture. The bulls fattening contained 42 % of own breeding and the next part consist of purchased bulls. The largest group of bulls are Czech Pied cattle constituting of 42 %. Limousin Bulls breeds and Aberdeen Angus breeds created 21 % and 79 % out of that are owned by the breeder. The best average of hot carcass weight (HCW) was 399 kg at Aberdeen Angus breed. The value of the carcass at Limousin bulls was 8 % lower and the bulls of the Czech Pied cattle was more than 20 % lower. The slaughter bulls were sold at an average age of 23 months and HCW 344 kg in 2013, in 2014 at the average age of 24 months and HCW 379 kg, in 2015 at the average age of 22 months and HCW 330 kg. The highest variability was recorded in the year 2015 with a value of 34, 63 % and the lowest in 2013 with 8, 80 %. During the time period the highest cost entry has not changed. Just the share was different. The <b>feed</b> <b>entry</b> share was at 61, 7 % in 2013, at 68, 89 % in 2014 and at 52, 30 % in 2015. 95, 7 % of the total cost was assigned to the own feeding. The expenses in 2013 were 912 919 CZK, in 2014 dropped to 845 368 CZK and in 2015 increased to 1 213 190 CZK. The cost of one feeding day per cattle in 2013 was 28, 10 CZK, in 2014 decreased to 26, 02 CZK and in 2015 increased to 37, 35 CZK. The revenues were affected by the sale of cattle for slaughter. In 2013 was sold 21 pieces of cattle for a total amount of 545 040 CZK, in 2014 was sold 32 pieces of bulls in the total value of 977 643 CZK and in 2015 36 pieces of bulls in the total amount of 867 885, 60 CZK. The sales of slaughter units in the total amount of revenue in 2013 did the share of 68, 61 %, in 2014 increased to 72, 25 % and in 2015 decreased to 59, 20 %. In 2015 was the receipt share from slaughter bulls of 30 % based on the sale of alive bulls to Austria. Total revenues in 2013 were 823 517 CZK, in 2014 increased by 39 % to 1 353 080 CZK and in 2015 increased by 7 % to 1 466 062 CZK. The Profit was calculated in 2013 as a loss in the value of 89 402 CZK. In the subsequent years there was a profit. In 2014 profit in the amount of 507 712 CZK and in 2015 the profit decreased to 252 872 CZK. The profit ratio in 2013 amounted to a negative value - 10 %, in 2014 increased to 60 % and in 2015 dropped to 21 %...|$|E

40|$|Children face several {{challenges}} {{when using}} information ac-cess systems. These include formulating queries, judging {{the relevance of}} documents, and focusing attention on in-terface cues, such as query suggestions, while typing queries [3]. It {{has also been shown}} that children want a personalised Web experience and prefer content presented to them that matches their long-term entertainment and education needs [2]. To this end, we have developed an interaction-based information filtering system to address these challenges. The system, a prototype developed within the PuppyIR project [1], is initialised by supplying a list of manually se-lected and vetted syndication feeds. We use sources such as the BBC and other reputable providers to overcome the problem of content moderation 1. Interaction with the sys-tem facilitates topic discovery over time; however, a default set of topics are defined to deal with the cold-start problem. Feeds are periodically fetched and split into individual <b>feed</b> <b>entries,</b> which are checked against existing content to ensure they are unique. Finally, documents are filtered for a topic using the Okapi BM 25 scoring function with the topic defi-nition acting as a query. Filtered documents are presented in reverse chronological order and the document-query score is used to create visual cues in the presentation of results. The system interface is shown in Figure 1. The set of default topics are shown above the set of discovered topics (1 a). In this example, the Science topic has been selected (1 b) and the list of documents titles filtered for this topic are presented to the child. The amount of space used in presenting a title indicates the relevance of a document, as shown by comparing a somewhat relevant document (2 a) and a strongly relevant document (2 b).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} prediction of the unequal admission performance of a double entry turbine based on the full admission turbine maps and a minimal number of unequal admission points. The double entry turbine has two separate inlet ports which feed a single turbine wheel: this arrangement can be beneficial in a turbocharger application; however the additional entry does add complexity in producing a complete turbine map which includes unequal admission behavior. When a double entry turbine is operated under full admission conditions, with both <b>entries</b> <b>feeding</b> the turbine equally, this will act effectively as a single entry device and the turbine performance can be represented by a standard turbine map. In reality a multiple entry turbine will spend the majority of time operating under varying degrees of unequal admission, with each <b>entry</b> <b>feeding</b> the turbine different amounts; the extent of this inequality can have a considerable impact on turbine performance. In order to produce a full map which extends from full admission through to the partial admission case (where one inlet has no flow) {{a large number of}} unequal admission data points are required. The paper starts by discussing previous attempts to describe the partial and unequal admission performance of a double entry turbine. The full unequal admission performance is then presented for a nozzled, double entry turbine. The impact of unequal admission on turbine performance is demonstrated. Under some conditions of operation, the turbine efficiency may be less than half that of the equivalent full admission case based on the average turbine velocity ratio. A method of using the steady, equal admission maps, with a limited number of unequal admission data points, to predict the full unequal admission behavior is presented. A good agreement is found when the map extension method is validated against the full unequal admission turbine performance measured on a test stand. In the prediction of efficiency a mean error of approximately 0. 39 % is found between the test stand data and the proposed extrapolation method, {{with a standard deviation of}} 2. 79 %.

40|$|Recent {{research}} by Castells has highlighted {{the important role}} of the Internet in creating the movements that have taken control of symbolic spaces in the city. He argues that hybrid spaces - linking urban space to the Internet - have created conditions of ‘relentless interaction’ that have fostered ‘instant communities of transformative practice’ (Castells 2012 : 11). This has coincided with a renewed interest in the city as a food producing area, and various programmes for the re-imagining of the cityscape, with suggestions ranging for vertical farms and engineering solutions through to community based brown field sites. In this paper we consider a range of social media engaged in this new contest: those networks creating, and eating from, short food chains in the Bristol city-region. Bristol is the site of a range of projects that are aiming to change the role of food in the cityscape either through changing the modalities of retailing, linking the city more directly to its peri-urban fringe, or increasing participation or shifting food production to more sustainable technologies. This is supported by a range of initiatives from local government, which is using its powers to foster better food outcomes through participative and deliberative interventions. Yet this is taking place against a backdrop of continued controversy, Bristol’s year of being ‘European Green Capital’ began with protestors being arrested as a garden site was cleared for a new bus route. These formal interventions are interwoven with networks of activists who are attempting to create change literally, and figuratively, ‘in the ground’ of the city. This paper examines the use of social media to co-ordinate, develop and nurture food projects in the Bristol city region, analysing Twitter <b>feeds,</b> blog <b>entries</b> and documents posted on the Internet to discern how citizenship is being constructed in these discussions. Many scholarly debates have focused on the transformative potential of citizen-consumers as portrayed in the media, but to date these have tended to focus on journalism rather than quotidian networks of social media {{and the way in which}} social change is created in these contexts...|$|R
40|$|Maize is one {{the most}} {{important}} staple foods in the world. However, numerous pests, such as fungal pathogens, e. g., Fusarium verticillioides, and insects, such as Sitophlilus zeamais, attack maize grains during storage. Many F. verticillioides strains produce fumonisins, one of {{the most important}} mycotoxin that causes toxic effects on human and animal health. This situation is aggravated by the insect fungal vector, Sitophlilus zeamais, which contributes to the dispersal of fungal spores, and through <b>feeding</b> damage, provide <b>entry</b> points for fungal infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro bioassays, the antifungal activity on F. verticillioides M 3125 and repellent effects against S. zeamais of ketone terpenes. In addition, we performed Quantitative structure–activity relationship (Q-SAR) studies between physico-chemical properties of ketone terpenes and the antifungal effect. Thymoquinone was the most active compound against F. verticillioides (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC: 0. 87) affecting the lag phase and the growth rate showing a total inhibition of growth at concentration higher than 2 mM (p < 0. 05). The Q-SAR model revealed that the antifungal activity of ketone compounds is related to the electronic descriptor, Pi energy. Thymoquinone showed a strong repellent effect (− 77. 8 ± 8. 5, p < 0. 001) against S. zeamais. These findings make an important contribution to the search for new compounds to control two stored pests of maize...|$|R
40|$|Brown band disease (BrB) is an {{increasingly}} prevalent coral {{disease in the}} Indo-Pacific, but although the macroscopic signs of BrB {{have been associated with}} the ciliate Philaster guamensis, many aspects of its ecology remain unknown, particularly how the disease is transmitted among coral colonies. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess biotic factors affecting BrB transmission, explicitly testing whether corallivorous species contribute to disease spread. Several fish species were observed feeding on diseased tissue in the field, but did not influence either the progression or transmission rates of BrB on coral colonies in situ. In aquarium-based experiments, the butterflyfish Chaetodon aureofasciatus neither aided nor hindered the transmission of BrB from infected to uninfected corals. In contrast, the coral-feeding gastropod Drupella sp. was a highly effective vector of BrB, infecting more than 40 % of experimental colonies. This study also demonstrated the importance of injury in facilitating BrB infection, supporting the hypothesis that the BrB pathogen invades compromised coral tissue. In conclusion, disturbances and corallivorous activities that injure live corals are likely to contribute to increased occurrence of BrB provided that <b>feeding</b> scars create <b>entry</b> wounds sufficiently extensive to facilitate infection. These findings increase the understanding of the ecology of BrB, enabling better predictions of the prevalence and severity of this disease, and informing strategies for managing the impact of BrB on coral reefs...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{objectives}} {{undertaken in}} this study were to investigate the biologies and potential economic importance of Pseudohylesinus tsugae Swaine and P. grandis Swaine in young coastal stands of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Rafn.) Sarg.). The life and seasonal histories of P. tsugae and P. grandis and the association of these two scolytids with the hemlock bark maggot (Cheilosia alaskensis Hunter) are presented. Both P. tsugae and P. grandis were found to have one generation a year with two broods. Both species had four larval instars. P. grandis overwintered either as a fourth instar larva or as a teneral adult. P. tsugae usually overwintered as a fourth instar larva. Within thinned stands of western hemlock P. tsugae preferred fresh stumps for breeding material, whereas P. grandis preferred fresh slash. The teneral adults of both P. tsugae and P. grandis fed in the inner-bark region of standing live host trees before initiating egg galleries in suitable breeding material. Within the thinned stands these <b>feeding</b> sites provided <b>entry</b> to the cambial region of the tree for the hemlock bark maggot. Both the number of maggot infestations and Pseudohylesinus spp. feeding sites within a stand increased after the stand was thinned. A potential method of control of both P. tsugae and P. grandis and the hemlock bark maggot was found...|$|R
40|$|The renal thiamin {{reabsorption}} process {{plays an}} important role in regulating thiamin body homeostasis and involves both thiamin transporters- 1 and - 2 (THTR 1 and THTR 2). Chronic alcohol use is associated with thiamin deficiency. Although a variety of factors contribute to the development of this deficiency, effects of chronic alcohol use on renal thiamin transport have not been thoroughly examined. We addressed this issue by examining the effect of chronic alcohol feeding of rats with liquid diet on physiological and molecular parameters of renal thiamin transport. Chronic alcohol feeding caused a significant inhibition in carrier-mediated thiamin transport across the renal brush-border membrane and was evident as early as 2 wk after initiation of alcohol feeding. Similarly, thiamin transport across the renal basolateral membrane was significantly inhibited by chronic alcohol feeding. The inhibition in renal thiamin transport was associated with a marked decrease in the level of expression of THTR 1 and - 2 proteins, mRNAs, and heterogeneous nuclear RNAs. Chronic alcohol feeding also caused a significant reduction in the level of expression of thiamin pyrophosphokinase but not that of the mitochondrial thiamin pyrophosphate transporter. These studies show that chronic alcohol <b>feeding</b> inhibits the <b>entry</b> and exit of thiamin in the polarized renal epithelial cells and that the effect is, at least in part, mediated at the transcriptional level. These findings also suggest that chronic alcohol feeding interferes with the normal homeostasis of thiamin in renal epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aplysia feeding is a {{model system}} for {{examining}} the neural mechanisms by which changes in motivational state control behavior. When food is intermittently present, Aplysia eat large meals controlled by a balance between food stimuli exciting feeding and gut stimuli inhibiting feeding. However, when food is continuously present animals {{are in a state}} in which feeding is relatively inhibited and animals eat little. We examined which stimuli provided by food and feeding initiate steady-state inhibition of feeding, and which stimuli maintain the inhibition. Results: Multiple stimuli were found to control entry into the steady-state inhibition, and its maintenance. The major variable governing entry into the steady-state is fill of the gut with bulk provided by food, but this stimulus cannot alone cause entry into the steady-state. Food odor and nutritional stimuli such as increased hemolymph glucose and L-arginine concentrations also contribute to inhibition of <b>feeding</b> leading to <b>entry</b> into the steady-state. Although food odor can alone cause some inhibition of feeding, it does not amplify the effect of gut fill. By contrast, neither increased hemolymph glucose nor L-arginine alone inhibits feeding in hungry animals, but both amplify the inhibitory effects of food odor, and increased glucose also amplifies the effect of gut fill. The major variable maintaining the steady-state is the continued presence of food odor, which can alone maintain the steady-state for 48 – 72 hrs. Neither increased glucose nor L-arginine can alone preserve the steady-state, although they partially preserve it. Glucose and arginine partially extend the effect of food odo...|$|R

40|$|Dieback disease {{caused by}} Fusarium and Lasiodiplodia species {{is a major}} threat to cocoa {{production}} in Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa. Current recommendations involve insecticide application to control mirid bugs whose <b>feeding</b> punctures provide <b>entry</b> points for these fungi. Little is known about the true identity of the causal pathogens of this disease. Earlier work implicated F. decemcellulare as the causal agent and more rarely L. theobromae (Cotterell, 1927; Crowdy, 1947). A total of 117 single spore fungal cultures was established from diseased cocoa stems imported from Ghana. On morphological grounds cultures could be designated as either Fusarium or Lasiodiplodia spp. The Fusarium cultures exhibited inter-isolate variability with respect to macroscopic appearance and macro-conidium morphology, suggesting the presence of more than a single species. The isolates were further characterised by PCR amplification and sequencing of the ITS region of rDNA and comparison with authentic reference cultures. Thirty-seven Fusarium isolates were identified to twenty F. chlamydosporum, nine F. solani and four isolates each of F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum. The thirty-six Lasiodiplodia isolates were identified to two species, twenty-seven L. pseudotheobromae and nine L. theobromae. In pathogenicity tests, F. chlamydosporum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. solani and L. pseudotheobromae, previously unknown as pathogens of either cocoa or any member of the Malvaceae, caused significant wilting and dieback in Amelonado seedlings similar to that observed in the field. All isolates exhibited optimal growth at 30 °C on PDA. Disease incidence in 29 and 15 cocoa germplasm lines in the laboratory and greenhouse, respectively, showed reproducible differences in their reaction to necrotic lesion and dieback infection. LCTEEN 37 /F {{was one of the most}} susceptible genotypes. CATIE 1000, T 85 / 799 and MXC 67 were the most tolerant and could be used in cocoa breeding programmes for resistance to dieback.

40|$|Milking is {{the task}} that needs most labour input in milk production. Time and motion studies are made to find work routine {{elements}} that can become more efficient. Several reports {{have shown that the}} farmers don't achieve the theoretical throughput. This paper has been initiated by Alfa Laval Agri AB to find the differences between achieved and calculated throughput and to investigate what throughput farmers reach in practise and find elements of the work routine that can be improved to achieve a higher throughput. Time and motion studies have been made on 17 farms, 12 with herringbone parlours and 5 with tandem parlours. The number of lactating cows varied from 29 to 133 cows. The milking session includes setup, milking and cleaning up. The following definitions of throughput are recommended and found in the literature. Time and motion studies usually measure the steady state throughput (TKS). This makes it possible to compare different parlours. TKS occurs when the parlour is in full operation. It {{does not take into account}} group changes, other interruptions and start and end effects. The throughput excluding setup and cleanup (PKX) includes group changes, interruptions and start and end effects. The start and end effects occur when stalls in the parlour are occupied or when all the clusters are idle. Group changes can also cause start and end effects. The throughput including setup and cleanup (PK) is the achieved throughput including all milking chores in the milking session. The milker's efficiency can be calculated from the including work routine elements during milking and is called milker's theoretical throughput (TKM). In this time and motion study PKX was 87 % of TKS in both tandem and herringbone parlours. PK is 68 % and 60 % of TKS in herringbone and tandem parlours, respectively. The following parlour throughputs were achieved at the farms: (table) The setup time varied from 1 to 7 minutes. The cleanup time varied from 11 to 50 minutes. Scraping and washing down in the milking parlour and collecting yard took average 10 seconds per square meter in herringbone and 12 seconds per square meter in tandem parlours. The work routine elements were <b>entry,</b> <b>feeding,</b> udder preparation, attach cluster, detach cluster, strip, post treat, exit and maintenance. Some time is also spent on other work routine elements and milker idle time. The times spent on the various work routine elements are shown in table 22 and 23 for herringbone and tandem parlours respectively. One farm had in-parlour feeding, and this remarkably reduced the time spent on herding, entry and exit of cows. Other farms with short time spent on entry and exit used a sheep dog (two farms), had a good overall layout or a parlour big enough to allow the milker to work at one side while the cows entered or exited at the other side. By starting udder preparation as soon as a few cows entered the parlour, the throughput can be increased. It is important to attach the clusters as soon as possible after the entrance. Some farmers started to post treat cows closest to the exit gate, then opened the exit gate and continued with the post treat. Entry and exit times were much lower in automatic tandem parlours than in manually operated tandem parlours. Udder preparation time is effected by the cleanliness of teats, but also the placing of the equipment used and the quality of work performed. The average attach time does not differ much between farms. Five farms did not have automatic cluster removers and these farms had rather small parlours. If the milker is stripping all cows or just one cow with problem now and then influence the stripping time spent per cow. The post treatment primarily includes teat dipping or teat spraying, and it was just three farms that didn't do this. The idle time is longer in smaller parlours because of too few clusters to keep the milker busy at all times. A continuous milking routine is commonly recommended to achieve a high throughput. Most milkers left the parlour too frequently to get a continuous milking routine. The most common cause for the milker to leave the parlour was to herd cows and this could take up to 50 seconds per cow. The average herding time was 25 seconds per cow. The milking time also affect the capacity. A slow milking cow can delay the working routine for all stalls on one side in herringbone parlours, A slow milking cow just delay the work routine for one stall in the tandem parlour. In this investigation it has not been possible to measure the individual milking time. In new parlours with milk recording it is possible to measure the milking time for individual cows. The advantage of this is that grouping based on milking time is possible...|$|R
