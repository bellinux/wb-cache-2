Its mainly corresponds to the "Brèches de Tarentaise" facies belt, once defined by R. BARBIER, South of the Isère valley. I. - STRATIGRAPHIC AND PALEOGEOGRAPHIC OUTLINE The Brèches de Tarentaise facies belt is an intermediate paleogeographic realm, between the delphino-helvetic (autochtonous or parautochtonous) realm and the Subbriançonnais ~) realm. According to the classical view, it has been stratigraphically characterized by two separate groups of rocks each of which corresponds to a quite different phase {{in the evolution of the}} sedimentary basin. The substratum includes aIl the formations from the crystalline basement up to the Lias. It generally exhibits a shallow water facies, with numerous gaps. The "série détritique" (<b>detrital</b> <b>formation)</b> or "Flysch de Tarentaise", is much thicker. Certain part of it only exhibits a flysch facies. It results from the early movements of the alpine orogeny. 1. - The substratum As the outcrops are rather widely scattered, the area studied does not lend itself to a detailed survey of lts various formations. Yet, some details are given on out the Permian which is chiefly represented here by facies close to the Briançonnais verrucano, instead of the violet shales (Schistes de la Bagnaz) which were regarded up to now as a typical fracture of the zone. The Pointe Rousse "gneisses" (vallon du Breuil. Italy) are seen as resulting from an acidic late hercynian volcanism or (of permotriassic age). Comparison with the Briançonnais formations of the Vanoise, permitted a more detailed study of the Triassic formations. The occurence of breccias, which can be attribuated to the Upper Triassic i 8 worth mentionning. There is no new truly significant datas on the stratigraphy of the Liassic formations. No evidence of the former existence of the Dogger or of the Malm has been found (a gap is likely, but no proved beyond aIl doubt). 2. - the Anteflysch group : The above-mentionned classical stratigraphic picture of the Brèches de Tarentaise facies belt must be somewhat changed, as a newly defined formation: the anteflysch group is to be inserted between the substratum and the <b>detrital</b> <b>formation.</b> This new formation chiefly consists of black shales, of calcschists, and of thin layers of microbreccias. On the Eastern margin of the zone (Versoyen formation) it includes abundant submarine volcanic outflows. One of the more important features of the present study is the proof which is given of a former connection between the Versoyen formation and the <b>detrital</b> <b>formation.</b> The age of the anteflysch group is not known with much accuracy; it probably ranges somwhere between the Lower cretaceous and the Midcretaceous. 3. - The Tarentaise <b>detrital</b> <b>formation</b> The three lithological subdivisions established as early as 1929 by H. SCHOELLER, 1929, have been kept unchanged. From top to bottom, on can observe: the flysch (Saint-Christophe beds) the black shales carrying green quartzites (Marmontains beds) the basal beds. A sedimentological investigation of the above mentionned layers has allowed, an approximative reconstitution of the evolution of the Sedimentary basin to be made: a) The basal layers are characterized by a graduaI change in the facies from the polygenic conglomerates in the SW to microbreccia limestones and thin bedded limestones to the NE. In the area studied the main source of detritus is located to the South West (Hautecour cordillera). The type of deposition (probably of shallow water origin) is very close by its sedimentological features to a molasse. b) The green quartzites-bearing black shales. :This is a very typical, usually rather thin, layer. From a sedimentological point of view, its features are variable, comprised between those of a flysch ant those of a molasse. Here, the main sources of detritus seem to be located to the North East. c) The flysch. Its thickness is less than was believed up to now (from 600 to 700 m). It chiefly consists of limestone layers interbedded with black or grey shales. In sorne parts of the basin, alld in the upper part now visible, there is a large increase in this formation of stratas thickness (trending towards a molassic facies ?). d) Age of the <b>detrital</b> <b>formation.</b> Rare discoveries of microfaunas in the anteflysch group and in the basal layer, give an Upper cretaceous age (probably Maestrichtian) for most of the detrital layer. At the moment there is no evidence that Tertiary sediments may be present in it. II. - STRUCTURAL INVESTIGATIONS The structural investigation bears upon three important points. First it provided the geometrical arguments for proving that the Versoyen formation was initially bound to the Tarentaise <b>detrital</b> <b>formation</b> of which it represents the basement. Then the structural investigation permitted a more accurate definition of the paleogeographical location of the Petit-Saint -Bernard tectonic unit. The latter, being squeezed between the Roignais -Versoyen and the Salin tectonic units, belongs to the Brèches de Tarentaise facies belt (up to now, some authors still believed that Petit Saint Bernard unit originated from the Piemont "Schistes lustrés" facies belt). Finally the structural study allowed to reinvestigate the mechanism of the "nappe structure" setting (by mean of a study of the internaI geometry of each tectonic unit). It is now necessary to restrict the extension of the Moutiers tectonic unit, North of Isère valley by defining a new unit, the Roignais Versoyen tectonic unit. Finally, going from the outer to the inner parts of the range, the sequence of the different tectonic units constituting the Brèches de Tarentaise facies belt seems to be as follows : Moûtiers t. u - Roignais Versoyen t. u - Petit Saint-Bernard t. u - (Pierre Avoi t. u) - Salins and "des Cols"t. u. For the time being, the Ferret Tectonic unit is linked with a transition zone between the Ultrahelvetic realm and the Brèches de Tarentaise facies belt. Its connections with latter cannot now be accurately defined. Many deformation stages have been outlined : a first stage related to a very progressive compression movement gave rise to the major folds and then ro the shearing of the major tectonic units (the metamorphism is of same age). The paroxysm probably occured at the time of the thrusting out of the Prealps units. A later compressional stage, directed E-W, is not equally intensive over the whole area investigated. Finally, there seems to have occured in a last stage a general translation of the several units towards the major tectonic units. There is however no direct evidence of such a movement. The time sequence of these different stages cannot be accurately determined on account of the lack of accurate age determinations for the different formations. III. - PALEOGEOGRAPHICAL CONCLUSIONS The Stratigraphical, Sedimentological and Structural analysis on the investigated area leads to the following conclusions : On a cross section of the investigated zone, the length of the Brèches de Tarentaise facies realm can be estimated to half the length of the "Briançonnais patform". It is only separated from the latter by the "through" corresponding to the "Subbriançonnais zone" (s. str.) which thins out to the E -N -E. - The geodynamical evolution of the Brèches de Tarentaise realm from the Triassic to the Lower cretaceous (not included) is very similar to that of the Briançonnais platform (positive tendancy). On account of this similarity, the term outer penninic platform is proposed to characrize this zone during the period considered. - The evolution of the Brèches de Tarentaise realm starts individualising from the beginning of the Cretaceous. As a matter of fact, after the emersion period from the Dogger to the Malm, there is a very clear subsidence reversal. At first, the latter was very slight (deposit of anteflysch group in conditions still very similar to those of a platform). The subsidence is however stronger from West ta East (Volcanism of the Versoyen formation). Then it gradually increases and brings out the deposition of the thick <b>detrital</b> <b>formation,</b> which are of Upper Cretaceous age. The sedimentological investigation of the latter formation shows that the rate of subsidence initially highly uneven at the different points of the sedimentary basin (occurence of ridges and cordilleras when basal layers were being deposed) was becoming more and more even with time. As a matter of fact the flysch facies which concludes the sedimentary evolution of the basin becomes very homogeneous on a wide area. The evolution of the realm during the Tertiary times is not known. Thus, the very concept of a Valaisian geosyncline must be sharply restricted in rime to the single Cretaceous period. La région étudiée s'étend de la vallée de l'Isère (Tarentaise) au niveau de Bourg-Saint-Maurice, en France, jusqu'à la frontière italo-suisse, entre la couverture sédimentaire oriental. e des massifs cristallins externes et le front briançonnais. Elle correspond pour l'essentiel à la zone des Brèches de Tarentaise définie par R. BARBIER au Sud de l'Isère. 1. - APERCU STRATIGRAPHIQUE ET PALEOGEOGRAPHIQUE La zone des Brèches de Tarentaise est un domaine paléogéographique intermédiaire entre la zone delphinohelvétique (autochtone ou parautochtone) et la zone subbriançonnaise (s. str.). Dans la conception classique, elle est caractérisée sur le plan stratigraphique par deux ensembles lithologiques distincts, qui correspondent à deux phases bien différentes dans l'évolution du bassin sédimentaire. Le substratum regroupe tous les termes depuis le socle cristallin jusqu'au Lias. Il présente des faciès généralement peu profonds, ainsi que de nombreuses lacunes. La série détritique ou "Flysch" de Tarentaise est beaucoup plus épaisse. Certains de ses termes seulement présentent le faciès flysch. Son apparition est la conséquence des premières manifestations de l'orogénie alpine. 1. - Le substratum La région étudiée se prête mal à un examen approfondi des terrains le constituant (dispersion des affleurements). Des précisions sont cependant apportées en ce qui concerne le Permien représenté surtout par des faciès proches du verrucano briançonnais au lieu des schistes violets (schistes de la Bagnaz) considérés jusque là comme caractéristiques de la zone. Les "gneiss" de la Pointe Rousse (vallon du Breuil, Italie) sont attribués à un volcanisme acide finihercynien (âge permo-triasique). La stratigraphie du Trias a pu être précisée par comparaison avec les séries briançonnaises de la Vanoise. A noter la présence de brèches du Trias supérieur. Aucune donnée nouvelle importante n'a pu être établie à propos du Lias en ce qui concerne la stratigraphie. Aucun indice d'une existence ancienne du Dogger et du Malm n'a été découvert (lacune probable mais non prouvée avec certitude). 2. - L'ensemble antéflysch : Le schéma stratigraphique classique de la zone des Brèches de Tarentaise, rappelé ci-dessus, doit être quelque peu modifié. Un nouveau terme vient en effet s'intercaler entre substratum et série détritique: l'ensemble antéflysch. Cette nouvelle formation est représentée surtout par des calcschistes, schistes noirs, et niveaux micro-bréchiques; elle voit apparaître d'abondantes émissions sous -marines (série du Versoyen) dans le secteur oriental. La démonstration de la liaison stratigraphique primaire de la série du Versoyen avec la série détritique (ou "Flysch de Tarentaise"), dont elle constitue le soubassement, est un point important du présent travail. L'âge de l'ensemble antéflysch n'est pas connu avec grande précision; il correspond sans doute au Crétacé inférieur et moyen. 3. - La série détritique de Tarentaise Les trois subdivisions lithologiques établies dès 1929 par H. SC HOELLER, ont été maintenues, De haut en bas on rencontre: Le flysch (couches de Saint-Christophe) Les schistes noirs à quartzites verts (couches des Marmontains) La formation basale, L'étude sédimentologique de ces trois ensembles a permis de reconstituer de façon approximative l 'histoire du bassin. a) La formation basale est caractérisée par une variation progressive du faciès depuis des conglomérats polygéniques au Sud Ouest, vers des calcaires microbréchoides et calcaires plaquettés au Nord Est. Dans le secteur étudié la zone d'alimentation principale se trouve au Sud Ouest (cordillère de Hautecour). Le type de dépôt (probablement en eau peu profonde) s'apparente par ses caractères sédimentologiques, à une molasse. b) Les schistes noirs à quartzites verts Formation très caractéristique en général peu puissante. Sur le plan sédimentologique ses caractères sont variables intermédiaires entre flysch et molasse. Les zones d'alimentation principales paraissent situées cette fois vers le Nord Est. c) Le flysch D'épaisseur moindre qu'il était admis jusque là (6 à 700 m) il s'agit surtout d'un flysch calcaire. En certains points du bassin et à la partie supérieure actuellement observable on note un accroissement considérable de l'épaisseur des strates (tendance vers un faciès molassique ?). d) Age de la série détritique De rares découvertes de microfaunes dans l'ensemble antéflysch et dans la formation basale, indiquent un âge crétacé supérieur (Maestrichtien probablement) pour la plus grande partie de la série détritique. Il n'existe pour l'instant aucun indice que le Tertiaire puisse y être représenté. II. - ETUDE STRUCTURALE L'étude structurale porte sur trois points principaux. Elle a fourni tout d'abord les arguments géométriques prouvant que la série du Versoyen était liée à la série détritique de Tarentaise dont elle représente le soubassement. Elle a permi ensuite de préciser la position paléogéographique de l'unité du Petit Saint-Bernard. Celle-ci étant pincée entre les unités du Roignais-Versoyen et de Salins appartient bien au domaine paléogéographique des Brèches de Tarentaise (et non au domaine piémontais comme cela était encore admis par certains auteurs). Elle a enfin permis de reconsidérer la question de mise en place des "nappes"(par l'étude de la géométrie interne des diverses unités). Il est apparu nécessaire de restreindre l'extension de l'unité de Moûtiers au Nord de l'Isère par la définition de l'unité nouvelle du Roignais-Versoyen sur des critères tout à la fois stratigraphiques et structuraux. Finalement la succession paléogéographique des diverses unités constituant le domaine des Brèches de Tarentaise parait être la suivante de l'extérieur vers l'intérieur de la chaîne : Unité de Moûtiers; Unité du Roignais-Versoyen; Unité du Petit Saint-Bernard (Unité. de la Pierre Avoi); Unité de Salins et Unité des Cols. L'Unité de Ferret est pour l'instant rattachée à une zone de transition entre l'ultrahelvétique et la zone des Brèches de Tarentaise. Ses rapports avec cette dernière ne peuvent être précisés. Plusieurs phases de déformation ont pu être mises en évidence: une première phase de compression très progressive a abouti au plissement puis au clivage des principales unités (le métamorphisme est contemporain de cet épisode). Le paroxysme a probablement correspondu à l'expulsion des Préalpes. Une phase de serrage tardive de direction est-ouest se fait inégalement sentir sur le domaine étudié. Enfin il apparaft, sans toutefois de preuves décisives, qu'un coulissage dans le sens des structures s'est opéré postérieurement au paroxysme. La chronologie de ces divers mouvements ne peut être établie directement par manque de datation précise des terrains. III. - CONCLUSIONS D'ORDRE PALEOGEOGRAPHIQUE L'analyse stratigraphique, sédimentologique, et structurale du domaine étudié, conduit aux conclusions suivantes: - Le domaine paléogéographique de la zone des Brèches de Tarentaise présente, sur la transversale étudiée, une extension qui peut être estimée à la moitié de celle de la zone briançonnaise. Il n'en est séparé que par le "sillon" des unités subbriançonnaises (s. str.) lequel va en s'amincissant vers l'Est Nord Est. - L'évolution géodynamique de la zone des Brèches de Tarentaise du Trias au Crétacé inférieur exclu, est très voisine de celle de la palte-forme briançonnaise (tendance positive persistante). Par raison de similitude le terme de plateforme pennique externe est proposé pour définir la zone en question pendant la période de temps considérée. - L'évolution de la zone des Brèches de Tarentaise devient spécifique à partir du Crétacé. En effet après la période d'émersion du Dogger Malm un renversement de subsidence très net s'opère. D'abord modéré (dépôt de l'ensemble antéflysch dans des conditions proches encore d'une plate-forme. La subsidence est toutefois plus active d'Ouest en Est; volcanisme du Versoyen), celle-ci prend peu à peu de l'importance et voi t le dépôt de l'épaisse série détritique terminale d'âge crétacé supérieur et un mode de dépôt particulier. L'étude sédimentologique de cette dernière a montré que la subsidence d'abord très inégale selon les points du bassin (existence de rides et de cordillères lors du dépôt de la formation basale) allaient en s'égalisant avec le temps. De fait le flysch avec lequel s'achève la série lithologique actuellement observable devient très homogène sur une vaste région. L'évolution du domaine au Tertiaire est inconnue. Ainsi la conception même d'un géosynclinal valaisan doit-elle être très limitée dans le temps au seul Crétacé...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Detrital zircons from pre-orogenic Upper Ordovician to Devonian low-grade {{metasedimentary}} rocks {{have been}} dated by laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–ICP-MS) to: (1) constrain the variations of zircon age populations within the autochthonous sequences of NW Iberia; (2) compare U–Pb detrital zircon ages with previous data; (3) test {{the hypothesis of}} the Armorica microplate as a peri-Gondwanan terrane separated from Gondwana.

40|$|International audiencePeperites in the Limagne graben (French Massif Central) {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{up to now}} as phreatomagmatic eruptions involving fragmentation of sedimentary rocks during magma-water interaction. We report about the possible magmatic origin of the carbonates involved in the peperites from Gergovie and Pileyre localities. In these two volcanic deposits, carbonates are manly dolomitic in composition, while the Limagne sediments are almost exclusively <b>detrital</b> <b>formations</b> or limestones. In the studied rocks, the carbonates {{can be found in}} different habits, but are sometimes closely associated with Cr-diopsides and Cr-spinels, minerals never found in the Limagne Miocene volcanic rocks and related to deep mantle processes. Dykes crosscutting the layered deposits are mainly composed of euhedral dolomite grains. Trace elements and Sr isotopes confirm that the carbonates are chemically different compared to the sedimentary rocks from the Limagne and therefore that the studied volcanic rocks are not a mixing between silicate magma and the local sediments. Based on our new petrological and geochemical data, we interpret these carbonates as evidence for the eruption of carbonatitic magmas associated with the silicate magmas found in the deposits. The high Sr isotopic ratios of these rocks imply the melting of an enriched metasomatised mantle for the source of the carbonates, as already advocated for many ultrapotassic or carbonatitic volcanic rocks in Europe. These results call for a reappraisal of the origin of the volcanism in the Limagne volcanic province and more generally of the carbonatitic volcanic provinces in Western Europe...|$|R
40|$|Array-sonic logs {{from four}} wells in the Medicine River field of Alberta are {{analyzed}} for relationships between Vp (compressional-wave velocity), Vs (shear-wave velocity), Vp/Vs, lithology, shaliness and porosity. Vp/Vs {{in conjunction with}} Vp effectively discriminates between sandstone, limestone and shale lithologies in the sampled intervals. Vp appears to increase linearly with Vs in sandstones, limestones, and mixtures of clastics and carbonates. The average Vp/Vs value of 1. 61 for sandstone agrees with the literature values of 1. 6 - 1. 7 obtained from core analysis. The average Vp/Vs value for the limestone is 1. 86 which fails between the literature values of 1. 8 for dolomite and 1. 9 for limestone. This is attributed to the slightly dolomitic nature of the limestone formation from which the data are taken. Mixed lithologies have Vp/Vs ratios which fall between values for their component lithologies. Vp/Vs {{has been found to}} vary in the Basal Quartz formation between two adjacent wells. A drop in Vp/Vs may be due to an increase in porosity, a decrease in shaliness, a change in pore fluid or some combination thereof. Both Vp and Vs decrease as porosity increases in the sandstones and in the Nordegg, Shunda, and <b>Detrital</b> <b>formations,</b> which are carbonate/clastic mixtures. With the exception of the Nordegg, Vp is more sensitive to porosity than Vs which results in an overall decrease in Vp/Vs with increasing porosity. This is the opposite trend to that which is reported by several other investigators. The Nordegg does not exhibit any Vp/Vs trend with changing porosity. In the limestone there are no trends for Vp, Vs or Vp/Vs with respect to porosity...|$|R
40|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} gem-producing countries in the world, including ruby and sapphires. Gem corundum deposits formed at different stages in the geological evolution of the island and in contrasting environments. Four main settings are identified: (1) Gem corundum formed in the Precambrian basement within the Neoproterozoic terranes of southern Madagascar, and in the volcano-sedimentary series of Beforona, north of Antananarivo. In the south, high-temperature (700 to 800 &# 176;C) and low-pressure (4 to 5 kbar) granulites contain deposits formed during the Pan-African orogenesis between 565 and 490 Ma. They accompany mafic and ultramafic complexes (ruby deposits of the Vohibory group), skarns at the contact between Anosyan granites and the Proterozoic Tranomaro group (sapphire deposits of the Tranomaro–Andranondambo district), and shear-zone corridors cross-cutting feldspathic gneisses, cordieritites and clinopyroxenites in the Tranomaro, Vohimena and Androyan metamorphic series (biotite schist deposits of Sahambano and Zazafotsy, cordieritites of Iankaroka and Ambatomena). The circulation of fluids, especially along discontinuities, allowed in-situ alkaline metasomatism, forming corundum host rocks related to desilicified granites, biotitites, “sakenites” and “corundumites”. (2) Gem corundum also occurs in the Triassic <b>detrital</b> <b>formations</b> of the Isalo group, as giant palaeoplacers in the Ilakaka–Sakaraha area. Here, sapphires and rubies may come from the metamorphic granulitic terranes of southern Madagascar. (3) Gem corundum deposits occur within the Neogene-Quaternary alkali basalts from Ankaratra (Antsirabe–Antanifotsy area) and in the Ambohitra Province (Nosy Be, Ambato and Ambondromifehy districts). Primary deposits are rare, except at Soamiakatra where ruby in gabbroic and clinopyroxenite xenoliths within alkali-basalts probably derive from mantle garnet peridotites. The blue-green-yellow sapphires typical of basaltic fields are always recovered in palaeoplacer (in karst formed upon Jurassic limestones from the Montagne d'Ambre, Antsiranana Province) and alluvial and soil placers (Ankaratra volcanic massif).

40|$|International audienceSince a {{few years}} a French-Belgian team of archeologists and geologists work on the {{characterization}} of ancient quern stones and millstones (mainly from the Antique period) linked with the identification of their stratigraphical and geographical provenances. This fruitful collaboration aims at reconstructing the ancient commercial roads and economic organization of territories during that period. In addition to the better-known volcanic rocks from the Eifel area, our study revealed the frequent occurrence of particular Devonian conglomerates and sandstones from the Ardenne area, as raw materials for the manufacturing of querns and millstones. The latter sandstones {{as well as the}} related antique millstone quarries, form an important and until now undervalued geological and cultural heritage in Belgium. Near the Ardenne border between France and Belgium, the earliest Devonian (Lochkovian) sediments deposited on the Caledonian substrate are conglomerates, which are interpreted as continental alluvial fans. The first marine sediments are littoral sandstones/quartzites or shales/slates. A sandstone formation, formally defined as the “Arkose d’Haybes” is closely linked to the former Lochkovian conglomerates (called also the “Poudingue de Fépin”). The outcrops of this particular formation around the reference localities of Haybes, Fépin and Hargnies (Ardennes, France), show a partly recrystallized, well-sorted grey to greenish sandstone (turbidite facies) with wine-red coloured joints. Another important area displaying old quarries in the same formation is located between Hirson (Aisne, France) and Macquenoise (Hainaut, Belgium) : here, a more homogenous grey coarse sandstone facies occurs, with a better consistency and small amounts of dark green tourmaline crystals. These <b>detrital</b> <b>formations</b> were locally quarried, not only for building stones but also for the production of querns and millstones. The huge Proto-historical and Roman millstone quarries in Lochkovian conglomerates and sandstones from Macquenoise are known since the 19 th century. Even if the lack of recent archeological excavations do not allow yet to precise the exact age of their quarrying, the dating of the various products derived from these quarries allow to consider the duration of the active extraction and how far the millstones from Macquenoise area were transported into the northern Gallo-Roman provinces...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of Suspended Sediments Dynamics (SSD) across spatial scales is {{relevant}} for several fields of hydrology, such as eco-hydrological processes, {{the operation of}} hydrotechnical facilities and research on varved lake sediments as geoarchives. Understanding the connectivity of sediment flux between source areas in a catchment and sink areas in lakes or reservoirs is of primary importance to these fields. Lacustrine sediments {{may serve as a}} valuable expansion of instrumental hydrological records for flood frequencies and magnitudes, but depositional processes and <b>detrital</b> layer <b>formation</b> in lakes are not yet fully understood. This study presents a novel buoy system designed to continuously measure suspended sediment concentration and relevant boundary conditions at a high spatial and temporal resolution in surface water bodies. The buoy sensors continuously record turbidity as an indirect measure of suspended sediment concentrations, water temperature and electrical conductivity at up to nine different water depths. Acoustic Doppler current meters and profilers measure current velocities along a vertical profile from the water surface to the lake bottom. Meteorological sensors capture the atmospheric boundary conditions as main drivers of lake dynamics. It is the high spatial resolution of multi-point turbidity measurements, the dual-sensor velocity measurements and the temporally synchronous recording of all sensors along the water column that sets the system apart from existing buoy systems. Buoy data collected during a 4 -month field campaign in Lake Mondsee demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the system in monitoring suspended sediment dynamics. Observations were related to stratification and mixing processes in the lake and increased turbidity close to a catchment outlet during flood events. The rugged buoy design assures continuous operation in terms of stability, energy management and sensor logging throughout the study period. We conclude that the buoy is a suitable tool for continuous monitoring of suspended sediment concentrations and general dynamics in fresh water bodies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{sedimentary}} structures and sedimentary petrography of the four lowermost formations of the Paleozoic as developed in the Northern part of the Province of León (Cantabrian Mountains, Spain). Three of the four <b>formations</b> have a <b>detrital</b> character, and one consists of dolomites and limestones. Mineralogically, the <b>detrital</b> <b>formations</b> are mature. Consequently the differences are small, but diagnostic. The source rocks will have been non-sedimentary. The Herreria Sandstone Formation is the oldest formation. Only its upper 200 metres are described here. This part consists of medium-grained quartzites with intercalations of shales, coarse quartzites, and conglomeratic beds. The detrital quartzes contain various kinds of inclusions and are often composite. Microcline, the common feldspar, is often kaolinized. Both minerals are secondarily enlarged. The source of the secondary quartz is duscussed; this quartz is held to have been supplied partially, and precipitated, form formational waters. The latter have the tendency to increase salinity, which lowers the silica solubility. The layers show predominantly a parallel lamination, but cross-lamination occurs as well. In {{two parts of the}} sequence the layers are wedge-shaped. The depositional environment is assumed to have been shallow, near the shore, with fluviatile influences. The Laucara Dolomite Formation can be subdivided into Dolomite s. l. and Griotte. The Lancara Dolomite s. l. contains dolomites, limestones, oolitic limestones, and breccias. The diagenetic process of grain growth transformed the original detrital texture of the limestones and dolomites. Dolomitization is assumed to have been postdepositional. Recrystallization due to mechanical stresses occurs as well. The oolitic limestones too are built up of various types of calcite in a textural sense. The time-relations between these types is discussed. These limestones contain authigenic quartzes, indicating high salinity of the environment. The Lancara Griotte consists of nodular limestones and shale layers with limestone nodules. The limestones are detrital in origin. The origin of the griotte is discussed: it is attributed to solutional processes. The depositional environment of the Lancara Dolomites s. l. is thought to be comparable to the recent Bahama Bank deposits. That of the Griotte is less distinct, but must have been shallow neritic. The red colour of the griotte may point to a warm, humid climate. The Oville Sandstone Formation is characterized by its clayey nature, high lime content, and the authigenic mineral glauconite. The micas show replacement by carbonates, a relatively unknown process. The origin and source of the glauconite is dealt with: cryptocrystalline aggregates are thought to have initially been clay, while the crystalline glauconites are altered micas. Of special interest are the slump structures. Since they are the result of a thixotropic behaviour of the sediments some rheological principles are briefly reviewed. It is also stated that internal slumping and convolute laminations are related in the sense that both are expressions of a false-body thixotropic state of the sediment. Such a state is to be expected within a certain range of moisture content: internal slumping occurs at the lowest values, convolute lamination at the highest values of the range. However, convolute lamination is observed more commonly in turbidity deposits because such deposits settle at higher rates than other sediments, consequently their moisture contents must have been higher. In this thin-bedded complex, parallel lamination dominates but small-scale cross-lamination is also present. Other sedimentary structures observed are load casts, pseudo-nodules and “Linsen” structures. The depositional environment is held to have been deltaic i. e. the formation represents a chain of deltas. The Barrios Quartzite Formation consists of quartzites with few shale beds and locally a conglomerate. The quartzes are limpid and do not contain inclusions. Composite grains are scarce. Feldspars are not kaolinized, only sericitized. The occurrence of the mica phengite is diagnostic. Most of the beds are wedge-shaped, which gives the formation a special appearance. Most beds have an slightly inclined lamination. Like the Oville deposits the Barrios sands are held to be deposits of a deltaic environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Cenozoic deformation of the Cordillera Oriental and of the contact zone with the Altiplano in southern Bolivia is well documented in the Tupiza, Nazareno and Estarca basins. The tectonic evolution started at about 29 Ma. The period between 29 and about 22 - 21 Ma is marked by developement of a pull-apart basin related to N-S trending left-lateral strike-slip faulting. During this period, initial deposition consisted of andesitic lavas and detrital sediments (breccias; matrix-supported red conglomerats; sands and silts [...] .) of the Catati and Tupiza Formation, deposited in alluvial fan and flood plain environments. From 21 to 20 Ma, the tectonic setting evolved to N-S oriented thrusts, which had a dextral component. This event caused the Tupiza basin to evolve into a full-ramp basin, and triggered the developement of two piggy-back basins : Nazareno and Estarca. Both basins record <b>detrital</b> deposition (Nazareno <b>Formation)</b> in an alluvial fan environment. At 10 - 9 Ma, deformation in this area stopped allowing peneplanation during which time the San Juan de Oro erosional surface was formed and the fluvial conglomerates of the Oploca Formation were deposited.

40|$|The clay-mineral {{composition}} of 142 samples of Upper Pennsylvania fluvial, deltaic, and marine clays and shales from north Texas {{was determined by}} X-ray diffraction. Deltaic lithotypes are of moderate illite, subordinate kaolinite, minor vermiculite and mixed layer composition. Nonmarine (red bed, coaly shales) lithotypes range from this composition to highly (+ 90 per cent) kaolinitic types, and generally lack vermiculite or chlorite. The marine shales contain a clay-mineral suite which {{is very similar to}} that of deltaic beds, but usually contain poorly- to well-crystallized chlorite. These variations are interpreted as results of two opposing mechanisms of clay-mineral genesis: degrada-tion and desilication of <b>detrital</b> clay-micas, and <b>formation</b> of kaolinite, in nonmarine milieux; and regrading of detrital vermiculite to better-crystalline chloritic minerals by magnesium adsorption in marine waters. The study reveals three pertinent points about clay-mineral environmental relation-ships: 1. The potential effects of nonmarine clay-mineral alteration processes are of much greater consequence than are those in marine environments.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Carbon preservation in the geological past {{has been an}} important process for global climate and the onset of glacial events. The majority of carbon preservation occurs in marine continental margin settings that consist of fine grained sediments like the Monterey Formation, California, USA. The mechanisms driving carbon preservation remain highly controversial and the Monterey Formation has served as a prominent test case used to determine these mechanisms. Organic-carbon rich deposits in this formation have been attributed to high organic productivity enhanced fluxes of organic matter (OM) to the sea floor and/or enhanced OM preservation through anoxia. In this study, the Monterey Formation was used as a natural experiment to focus on a new mechanism of carbon preservation, in the form of mineral surface area (MSA) as a control on total organic carbon (TOC). Mineral surface area was determined using the Ethylene Glycol Monoethyl Ether free surface procedure and TOC was derived from high temperature combustion. The relationship between the OM and the surface of the shale samples was viewed using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) with micron resolution. The major findings indicate a first-order relationship between MSA and TOC, where the mineral surface area adsorption of organic carbon offers an alternative mechanism and control for carbon preservation. This relation is held most strongly in bioturbated intervals as it is indicating oxygenated bottom waters and lower biological productivity intervals which are indicated by carbonate microfossils. Intervals with laminated siliceous sediment reflective of alternative oceanographic hypotheses (linking high productivity and anoxia with organic enrichment) showed lower carbon preservation. Ash beds derived from volcanic glass deposition in the water column showed high surface area from post alteration to bentonite but had low TOC indicating that the association with TOC and MSA occurred in the water column or early diagenetic environment. The MSA within the Monterey Formation is controlled by the abundance of detrital smectitic clays initially formed in hydrologic equilibrium within soils at the prevailing continental climate conditions. Organic matter enrichment in these (marine) continental margin sediments, is thus a function of continental climate. Carbon preservation in the Monterey Formation and similar black shales is not an oceanic mechanism as widely believed, but rather derived through continental controls. An implication of this conclusion is that climate influences <b>detrital</b> clay <b>formation</b> and carbon burial in marine sediments thereby providing a feedback to climate cooling through CO₂ drawdown during high carbon burial events.

Here, we report on alterations in P speciation in reducing modern Baltic Sea sediments that we deliberately exposed to atmospheric oxygen for a period of either one week or one year. During oxidation of the sediment, extensive changes occurred in all measured P reservoirs. Exchangeable P all but disappeared {{during the first week of}} exposure, likely reflecting adsorption of porewater PO 4 by Fe(III) (oxyhydr) oxides (i. e. ferric Fe-bound P <b>formation).</b> <b>Detrital</b> and organic P were also rapidly affected: decreases in both reservoirs were already observed after the first week of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. This was likely because of acidic dissolution of detrital apatite and oxidation of organic matter, respectively. These processes produced dissolved PO 4 that was then scavenged by Fe(III) (oxyhydr) oxides. Interestingly, P in authigenic calcium phosphates (i. e. apatite: authigenic Ca-P) remained unaffected after the first week of exposure, which we attributed to the shielding effect of microfossils in which authigenic Ca-P occurs in Baltic Sea sediments. This effect was transient; a marked decrease in the authigenic Ca-P pool was observed in the sediments after one year of exposure to oxygen. In summary, we show that handling and storage of wet sediments under oxic conditions can lead to rapid and extensive alteration of the original sediment P speciation...|$|R
40|$|U-Pb {{detrital}} zircon ages {{are reported}} from Puncoviscana Formation (late Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian) and Mesón Group (Late Cambrian) greywackes of northwest Argentina, to constrain provenance and depositional environment. The new data are combined with previously-published detrital zircon ages, {{to show that}} Puncoviscana Formation age patterns contain two broad groups: late Mesoproterozoic-early Neoproterozoic (1150 - 850. Ma) and late Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian (650 - 520. Ma); with their relative proportions varying inversely with youngest component age. The 1150 - 850. Ma age components are dominant in greywackes with oldest late Neoproterozoic components > 600. Ma. The former diminish considerably when late Neoproteozoic components become dominant and younger, to 520. Ma. A northernmost greywacke sample from Purmamarca, Jujuy, is distinctive: whilst its zircon age pattern partly resembles other Puncoviscana Formation samples, it contains no Cambrian-late Neoproterozoic ages, the youngest ages being early Neoproterozoic. This may reflect an early, Neoproterozoic, passive-margin depocentre for the Formation, or an older (early Neoproterozoic) succession within it, which may predate the Brasiliano orogeny in Brazil. The youngest age components, c. 520. Ma, in a greywacke from Rancagua (Cachi, Salta province), dominate an almost unimodal pattern suggestive of contemporary volcanic sources at a late Early Cambrian depocentre. Detrital zircon age patterns of the Mesón Group (Lizoite Formation) have major Cambrian-latest Neoproterozoic components resembling those of the Puncoviscana Formation, but its Mesoproterozoic component is diminished, {{and there are no}} significant age components of this age. Small youngest components at c. 500. Ma suggest a maximum Late Cambrian stratigraphic age.

The group, from bottom to top, consists of: (1) the Magdalena Migmatite protolith (metapsammites, metapelites, calsilicates, and marbles), which grades up into (2) the meta-psammitic Chazumba Formation; overthrust by (3) the Cosoltepec Formation (phyllites and quartzites with minor mafic meta-volcanic horizons). The group is unconformably overlain by the Pennsylvanian-Middle Permian Tecomate Formation, which IS overthrust by the similar to 288 Ma Totoltepec pluton and unconformably overlain by Middle Jurassic rocks. In contrast to previous inferences that the protoliths of the units (1) to (3) were early Paleozoic in age, detrital zircon LA-ICPMS ages combined with published data constrain depositional ages as follows: (i) Magdalena Migmatite protolith: post- 303 Ma-pre- 171 Ala (Permian-Earl.), Jurassic); (ii) Chazumba Formation: post- 239 Ma-pre- 174, Ma (Middle Triassic-Early Jurassic); and (iii) Cosoltepec Formation: post- 455 Ma-pre- 310 Ma (uppermost Ordovician-Mississippian).

40|$|The N–S Jacobina {{foreland}} basin is a Paleoproterozoic basin (2080 to 1900 Ma) of stacked <b>detrital</b> and schist <b>formations</b> developed along a sinistral wrench–overthrust {{fault of}} the Transamazonian orogeny. At least five successive stages are identified in the westward progradation of the basin, wherein bedding-parallel strike–slip thrusts and prograde metamorphism indicate progressive involvement in the Transamazonian collision. Shearing and associated metamorphic recrystallization indicate a high geothermal gradient and a gradual loading of the underthrust units, with those to the east being deeper seated than those to the west. Basic–ultrabasic dykes and granite stocks cross-cut the lithologies {{and contributed to the}} thermal evolution. Conglomerates and chaotic breccia layers found in several formations mark periods of tectonic instability accompanied by erosion of the earlier stages of basin development. Multistage hydrothermal activity is indicated by a widespread alteration with gold-bearing quartz lodes, conglomerates showing a sulphide–gold–Cr–mineral association, leaching of ultrabasic rocks, and emerald mineralization related to late-tectonic granite emplacement. The economic gold-bearing clastic sediments (conglomerates and minor quartzites deposited during the fourth unit/stage of basin development) have generally been interpreted according to the "modified paleoplacer" model. Such a model, which implies the existence of a gold preconcentration within the quartz–pebble conglomerates, is supported by the lithological controls, reworked pebbles (e. g. cataclastic quartz, quartz–pyrite mylonite and rare fuchsite-bearing rocks) that had been hydrothermally altered during an earlier hydrothermal stage, and lead isotopic compositions revealing an Archean inheritance that is partly preserved in galena inclusions. New basin-scale structural and metallogenic data obtained by the authors, suggest a basin model characterized by successive cycles of sedimentation–faulting/thrusting–erosion ("cannibalism" model) that favours both a "paleoplacer" model and a "mesothermal shear-zone-related epigenetic" model. Heterochronous shear zones, formed between 1988 and 1912 Ma during the development of the basin, acted as feeder zones for postsedimentary mesothermal quartz–tourmaline–muscovite/fuchsite lodes, which constitute a possible source of the reworked hydrothermally altered pebbles. These shear zones controlled (a) an acid leaching of the sediments and the subsequent development of Al-rich assemblages interpreted as advanced argillic alteration zones, and (b) a sulphidation process affecting detrital ilmenite and magnetite and responsible for the high concentration of gold within shear veins containing assemblages of Cr–Ni-bearing minerals (euhedral chromite, Cr–rutile, linnaeite, Cr–tourmaline and fuchsite) and euhedral pyrite that crystallized over andalusite. The conglomerates, with their pore and fissure permeability, acted as a "reservoir and trap" for the mineralizing fluids to give a "hydrothermal shear-reservoir" model...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the changes of {{sediment}} provenance with time, within and adjacent to selected reservoir intervals of the Aptian Ben Nevis Formation in the White Rose Field, Jeanne d'Arc basin. The field contains both oil and gas, and the reservoir rock is a very-fine- to fine-grained, generally well-sorted sandstone with variable thicknesses of up to 300 m. Average QFL ratios for Ben Nevis sandstones are Q₈₉F₃L₈, with the major lithic components being detrital carbonate grains and chert. Based on subcrop patterns and relative grain sizes, the Tithonian-Berriasian Hibernia Formation sandstones and the Barremian-Aptian Avalon Formation sandstones {{are thought to be}} possible sediment sources. [...] Tectonic discriminative diagrams as well as petrographic descriptions give evidence of a very small amount of feldspar and indicate that the Ben Nevis Formation is not a first cycle sediment; rather, abraded quartz overgrowths indicate that Ben Nevis Formation sandstones are polycyclic and were sourced from recycled sediments. In addition, the Chemical Index of alteration (CIA) diagram can be used to show that the original basement of igneous and/or metamorphic rocks that acted as sediment source for the Ben Nevis Formation must have been of granodiorite composition. [...] The Avalon Formation is petrographically and geochemically similar to the Ben Nevis Formation. Cuttings samples show a similar grain size and chemical composition to the Ben Nevis Formation, indicating that the Avalon Formation is a plausible source for the Ben Nevis Formation without requiring significant reworking or alteration. [...] Possible sources with a higher lithic component, such as the Hibernia Formation, imply geochemical alteration with only limited physical reworking of the rock, which removed a large portion of unstable lithic grains and increased the quartz content relative to feldspars and lithic grains, leading to the quartz-rich composition of the Ben Nevis Formation. This process is supported by trace element data and plots of SiO₂ against immobile elements, together with common exposures of Hibernia Formation below the Aptian unconformity. Together with erosion of the Upper Hibernia <b>Formation,</b> <b>detrital</b> carbonate grains may have been added from underlying A-marker and/or B-marker units. Based on weathering relationships inferred from CIA diagrams, the remaining (presently preserved) sections of Lower Hibernia Formation were ultimately sourced from a more mafic basement, which is not reflected in the composition of upper Hibernia, Avalon, and Ben Nevis Formation sandstones. [...] The Ben Nevis Formation is a relatively homogeneous sandstone with very subtle changes both petrographically and geochemically. Grouping of similar Zr concentrations within the Ben Nevis Formation has shown three correlatable units throughout the White Rose Field. Trends on CIA diagrams indicate an increasing amount of weathering moving from the south to north, perhaps due to lower topographic gradients in the north, causing longer residence times and hence increases in chemical weathering. P/K ratios are also lower in the north area, indicating a mature sediment source during early transgression in the north which became progressively less mature as transgression moved southward...|$|R

They form part of {{the basement of the}} Neuquén Basin and are mostly coeval with the Late Paleozoic accretionary prism complex of the Coastal Cordillera, south-central Chile. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of detrital zircon yielded a maximum depositional age of 374 Ma (Upper Devonian) for the Guaraco Norte Formation and 389 Ma for the Arroyo del Torreón <b>Formation.</b> <b>Detrital</b> magmatic zircon from the Guaraco Norte Formation are grouped into two main populations of Devonian and Ordovician (Famatinian) ages. In the Arroyo del Torreón Formation, zircon populations are also of Devonian and Ordovician (Famatinian), as well as of Late Neoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic ages. In both units, there is a conspicuous population of Devonian magmatic zircon grains (from 406 ± 4 Ma to 369 ± 5 Ma), indicative of active magmatism at that time range. The εHf values of this population range between - 2. 84 and - 0. 7, and the TDM-(Hf) are mostly Mesoproterozoic, suggesting that the primary sources of the Devonian magmatism contained small amounts of Mesoproterozoic recycled crustal components. The chemical composition of the Guaraco Norte Formation corresponds to recycled, mature polycyclic sediment of mature continental provenance, pointing to a passive margin with minor inputs from continental margin magmatic rocks. The chemical signature of the Huaraco Formation indicates that a magmatic arc was the main provenance for sediments of this unit, which is consistent with the occurrence of tuff-mostly in the Arroyo del Torreón Formation and very scarcely in the Huaraco Formation-with a volcanic-arc signature, jointly indicating the occurrence of a Carboniferous active arc magmatism during the deposition of the two units. The Guaraco Norte Formation is interpreted to represent passive margin deposits of mostly Lower Carboniferous age (younger than 374 Ma and older than 326 Ma) that precede the onset of the accretionary prism in Chile and extend into the earliest stage of the accretion, in a retrowedge position. The Arroyo del Torreón and Huaraco formations are considered to be retrowedge basin deposits to the early frontal accretionary prism (Eastern Series) of Chile. The presence of volcanism with arc signature in the units provides evidence of a Mississippian magmatic arc that can be correlated with limited exposures of the same age in the Frontal Cordillera (Argentina). The arc would have migrated to the West (Coastal Batholith) during Pennsylvanian-Permian times (coevally with the later basal accretionary prism/Western Series). The source of a conspicuous population of Devonian detrital zircon interpreted to be of magmatic origin in the studied units is discussed in various possible geotectonic scenarios, the preferred model being a magmatic arc developed in the Chilenia block, related to a west-dipping subduction beneath Chilenia before and shortly after its collision against Cuyania/Gondwana, at around 390 Ma and not linked to the independent, Devonian-Mississippian arc, developed to the south, in Patagonia. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Deeply buried {{sandstones}} in sedimentary basins {{typically have}} low porosity due to cementation and compaction. Formation of microcrystalline quartz {{has proven to}} be effective at preserving porosity in deeply buried sandstone petroleum reservoirs, typically cemented by syntaxial quartz cement. There remains much uncertainty about what controls the growth of microcrystalline quartz and how it prevents syntaxial quartz overgrowths. Here, the Cretaceous Heidelberg Formation, Germany, and the Oligocene Fontainebleau Formation, Paris Basin, France, provide a natural laboratory to study silica polymorphs and develop an understanding of their crystallography, paragenetic relationships, and growth mechanisms, leading to a new understanding of the growth mechanisms of porosity-preserving microcrystalline quartz. Data from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data illustrate that porosity-preserving microcrystalline quartz cement is misoriented with respect to the host grain upon which it grows. In contrast, ordinary quartz cement grows in the same orientation (epitaxially) as the host quartz sand grain, and typically fills pore spaces. EBSD and TEM observations reveal nanofilms of amorphous silica ( 50 - 100 nm in thickness) between the microcrystalline quartz and the host grain. The microcrystalline quartz is interpreted to be misoriented relative to the host grain, because the amorphous silica nanofilm prevents growth of epitaxial quartz cement. Instead, the microcrystalline quartz is similar to chalcedony with [11 - 20] perpendicular to the growth surface and c axes parallel with, but randomly distributed (rotated) on, the host quartz grain surface. Development of pore-filling quartz growing into the pore (in the fast-growing c-axis direction) is thus inhibited due to the amorphous silica nanofilm initially and, subsequently, the misoriented microcrystalline quartz that grew on the amorphous silica. High precision, in situ oxygen isotope analyses of Cretaceous Heidelberg <b>Formation</b> <b>detrital</b> grains and quartz cements show three varieties of authigenic silica growing on detrital quartz grains. Interpretation of these data show that quartz overgrowths grew from meteoric water at about 80 °C followed by concentric bands of silica cements. A thin layer of chalcedony was first deposited on both detrital quartz grains and quartz overgrowth cements followed by microcrystalline quartz; this cycle was then repeated. If it is assumed that the closely-related chalcedony and microcrystalline quartz grew from the same water, then isotope data suggest that chalcedony grew at approximately 34 °C while microcrystalline quartz grew at approximately 60 °C from meteoric water. To further understand the role of chalcedony in microcrystalline quartz growth, chalcedony in two agates from the Citronelle Formation in Louisiana and Lake Superior in Michigan, were studied This study concludes that the bands formed as a result of discrete influxes of siliceous fluid. Within these individual bands there is a sequence of minerals; chalcedony-A (with amorphous silica and nanocrystalline quartz)  chalcedony-MQ (with microcrystalline quartz)  quartz. This paragenetic sequence suggests a viable model for the growth of chalcedony in agates, which helps explain the growth of chalcedony and microcrystalline growth in sandstones. Now that we know what controls microcrystalline quartz growth and why it preserves porosity, {{it can be used to}} help identify, rank and appraise deeply buried petroleum accumulations...|$|R

This material and existing chronometric constraints is used to construct a new time–space plot for the Inlier and to compare Eastern Succession volcanosedimentary accumulations with temporally equivalent units in the Western Fold Belt. The accumulation of volcanosedimentary sequences in the Eastern Succession occurred in four main periods: namely 1890 – 1850 Ma, 1800 – 1750 Ma, 1710 – 1690 Ma, and 1680 – 1610 Ma. Temporally equivalent units can be identified in the Western Fold Belt. Periods of sedimentary accumulation were immediately preceded by bimodal igneous activity across the Inlier. The locus of bimodal volcanism migrates from west to east with time. Intracontinental rifting {{is the most likely}} tectonic setting for the sedimentary basins. The majority of the Soldiers Cap Group was deposited between ca. 1675 and 1650 Ma with the exception of units in the Boomarra Horst now known to belong to older sequences (deposited ca. 1775 – 1750 Ma), and the Llewellyn Creek Formation at Snake Creek which may be as old as ca. 1690 Ma. Upper amphibolite facies rock units in the southwest (e. g. the Gandry Dam Gneiss) are likely to be higher metamorphic grade, temporal equivalents of the Soldiers Cap Group. Five rock units previously assigned to the Cover Sequence 2 Mary Kathleen Group; namely, the Answer Slate, Kuridala Formation, Staveley Formation, Marimo Slate and Agate Downs Siltstone are now known to have been deposited between ca. 1675 and 1610 Ma. These units (bar the Kuridala Formation) have been removed from the Cover Sequence 2 Mary Kathleen Group and given the informal name ‘Young Australia Group’. The Kuridala Formation has been included in the Soldiers Cap Group. The rock units within the Young Australia Group are likely to be lateral facies equivalents of the younger units within the Soldiers Cap Group. Rock units within the Mount Albert Group (although undated) are considered likely to be temporal equivalents of the Soldiers Cap Group and the Young Australia Group. The Roxmere Quartzite is included here in the Young Australia Group that it tectonically overlays. The Ballara Quartzite and Mitakoodi Quartzite represent a single regionally extensive sequence deposited at ca. 1755 Ma. The Double Crossing Metamorphics (previously mapped as basement) are likely to correlate with the Argylla Formation and Mitakoodi Quartzite.
