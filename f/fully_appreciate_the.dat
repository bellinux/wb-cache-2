Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.|$|E

This accomplishment has been described as fully on a par with the works of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein before him. In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin- particles.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} stage, Utzon worked {{successfully}} {{with the rest}} of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.|$|E

25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading should treat reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. Another problem is {{that there has been a}} lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model and might not be able to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In the future we might see unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E
500|$|Moser {{published}} Cortinarius Fr. und nahe verwandte Gattungen in Südamerika in 1975, {{which was}} coauthored by Egon Horak. The work, {{along with his}} earlier monograph on [...] "Phlegmacium", proved to be some of Moser's most important, serving to encourage others to engage with Cortinarius in a meaningful way. Cortinarius Fr. und nahe verwandte Gattungen in Südamerika was a study of Cortinarius, Dermocybe and Stephanopus, a new genus first described in that work, in South America, and was dedicated to Singer. The work contained descriptions of 276 new species. Alexander H.

In an interview published prior to the Court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> effect of a strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, [...] "They have never been a 13-year-old girl." [...] In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Justice Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.|$|E

500|$|Palladio always {{designed}} his villas {{with reference}} to their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Capra, facades were frequently designed to be of equal value so that occupants could have fine views in all directions. Also, in such cases, porticos were built on all sides so that occupants could <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many American-style porches of today. Palladio sometimes used a loggia {{as an alternative to}} the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements. [...] Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a facade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi has as its focal point a loggia rather than a portico, plus loggias terminating each end of the main building.|$|E

Daniel Baum of The Jerusalem Post called it [...] "one of the funniest, most entertaining and best-programmed computer games I have ever seen", and lauded its animation.

Kevin Davis of Christian Music Review, giving the album an A+, opined that the album reminds him [...] "of a classic theme album like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles or Songs For Jane [...] by Maroon 5, both in musical diversity and with the challenging lyrics" [...] and [...] "truly establishes MercyMe as the premier artist in all of Christian music".|$|E

500|$|Much of Volubilis was {{excavated}} by the French {{during their}} rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1956, but the excavations {{at the site}} began decades earlier. From 1830, when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern, western and central Africa, archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism. The French army undertook scientific explorations {{as early as the}} 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time. By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover north-west Africa's pre-Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites. The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims. As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it, [...] "the Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign", which [...] "gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> Moroccan past and its beauty." [...] Emile Pauty of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Marocaines criticised the Muslims for taking the view that [...] "the passage of time is nothing" [...] and charged them with [...] "let their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 1982 book {{mentioned}} above (2nd ed. 2002), Ong sums {{up his own}} work over the previous three decades {{as well as the}} work of numerous other scholars.

But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the history of communication – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to pictograms, [...] to the phonetic alphabet, to typography, to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.|$|E
