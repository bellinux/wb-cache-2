Prescription opioid medication continues to be a controversial form of treatment, with practitioners and patients expressing dissatisfaction with chronic pain management. Questions remain regarding an evidence base for long-term prescribing of opioids for chronic pain, possible side-effects from long-term prescribing, greater oversight regarding opioid prescribing in chronic pain and increased rates of prescription opioid misuse. Examination of the literature from the patient, practitioner and societal/political perspective using Conflict Theory suggest there is conflict within the practitioner-patient relationship related to unequal power, and conflicts of interest regarding prescribing opioid medication for chronic pain. The significance and implications for nursing practice are discussed as well as recommendations for future research...|$|E

Multiple regression analyses were performed on a subset of data from a large prospective pain prevalence study. Three models were developed to predict perceived overall function, physical function and psychological function on a training sample (n = 252) and tested for reliability on a cross validation sample (n = 109). Independent variables measured at the in-hospital interview included sociodemographic, cognitive, physical and psychological variables. The dependent function variables were assessed at three week follow-up. Overall functional impairment at three weeks was best predicted by perceived overall function, pain quality, nonsurgical pain, and hospital stay of one to three months in the past year. Impairment of physical function was predicted by perceived physical function, pain quality, one-to-three month hospital stay during the past year, and pain duration of <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Impairment of psychological function was best predicted by perceived psychological function, pain quality, and nonsurgical pain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{levels of}} {{adherence}} to medications for HIV infection {{are essential for}} optimal clinical outcomes and to reduce viral transmission, but many patients do not achieve required levels. Clinician-delivered interventions can improve patients 2 ̆ 7 adherence, but usually require substantial effort by trained individuals {{and may not be}} widely available. Computer-delivered interventions can address this problem by reducing required staff time for delivery and by making the interventions widely available via the Internet. We previously developed a computer-delivered intervention designed to improve patients 2 ̆ 7 level of health literacy as a strategy to improve their HIV medication adherence. The intervention was shown to increase patients 2 ̆ 7 adherence, but it was not clear that the benefits resulting from the increase in adherence could justify the costs of developing and deploying the intervention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the relation of development and deployment costs to the effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS: Costs of intervention development were drawn from accounting reports for the grant under which its development was supported, adjusted for costs primarily resulting from the project 2 ̆ 7 s research purpose. Effectiveness of the intervention was drawn from results of the parent study. The relation of the intervention 2 ̆ 7 s effects to changes in health status, expressed as utilities, was also evaluated in order to assess the net cost of the intervention in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses evaluated ranges of possible intervention effectiveness and durations of its effects, and costs were evaluated over several deployment scenarios. RESULTS: The intervention 2 ̆ 7 s cost effectiveness depends largely on the number of persons using it and the duration of its effectiveness. Even with modest effects for a small number of patients the intervention was associated with net cost savings in some scenarios and for durations <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> and longer it was usually associated with a favorable cost per QALY. For intermediate and larger assumed effects and longer durations of intervention effectiveness, the intervention was associated with net cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-delivered adherence interventions may be a cost-effective strategy to improve adherence in persons treated for HIV.

40|$|Background Chronic {{kidney disease}} is a global public health problem of {{increasing}} prevalence. There are five stages of kidney disease, with Stage 5 indicating end stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or death will eventually occur. Over {{the last two decades}} there have been increasing numbers of people commencing dialysis. A majority of this increase has occurred in the population of people who are 65 years and over. With the older population {{it is difficult to determine}} at times whether dialysis will provide any benefit over non-dialysis management. The poor prognosis for the population over 65 years raises issues around management of ESKD in this population. It is therefore important to review any research that has been undertaken in this area which compares outcomes of the older ESKD population who have commenced dialysis with those who have received non-dialysis management. Objective The primary objective was to assess the effect of dialysis compared with non-dialysis management for the population of 65 years and over with ESKD. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review considered studies that included participants who were 65 years and older. These participants needed to have been diagnosed with ESKD for <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> and also be either receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]) or non-dialysis management. The settings for the studies included the home, self-care centre, satellite centre, hospital, hospice or nursing home. Types of intervention(s) /phenomena of interest This review considered studies where the intervention was RRT (HD or PD) for the participants with ESKD. There was no restriction on frequency of RRT or length of time the participant received RRT. The comparator was participants who were not undergoing RRT. Types of studies This review considered both experimental and epidemiological study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case control studies and analytical cross sectional studies. This review also considered descriptive epidemiological study designs including case series, individual case reports and descriptive cross sectional studies for inclusion.

40|$|TCR gene {{transfer}} can generate tumour antigen-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Following TCR {{gene transfer}}, transduced T cells usually display the same functional avidity as the parental clone {{from which the}} TCR was isolated. However, tumour-antigen specific T cells typically recognize over-expressed self-antigen and are often of low/moderate avidity. It is known that optimal recognition of target cells by CTL requires binding of the cognate peptide MHC class I complex (MHCI) by both TCR and the CD 8 co-receptor. Some CD 8 β chain mutations {{have been shown to}} increase CD 8 binding affinity with peptide/MHCI and enhance T cell effector function. Murine CD 8 β chain mutants were generated affecting MHC binding sites (L 58 R, S 53 L, S 54 V and L 58 R/I 25 A) or glycosylation sites (T 120 A, T 121 A, T 124 A, and T 120 A/T 121 A/T 124 A). The mutated CD 8 β molecules were introduced into murine splenocytes using retroviral vectors together with tumour antigen-specific TCRs. The CD 8 β mutants or control CD 8 β wild type (WT) chains were first introduced into CD 8 aa T cells obtained from CD 8 β knockout mice. All T cells were co-transduced to express the murine F 5 -TCR which recognizes the model tumour antigen, influenza A nucleoprotein (NP 366) presented by H 2 -Db. The L 58 R MHC binding CD 8 co-receptor mutant (L 58 R) demonstrated better IFN-γ and IL- 2 production in response to relevant peptide while the CD 8 glycosylation mutant (T 120 A/T 121 A/T 124 A) mutant demonstrated the opposite effect. The in vitro function of CD 4 + T cells transduced with F 5 -TCR showed that IL- 2 and IFN-γ production was enhanced with CD 8 co-receptor. In addition, introducing a L 58 R mutation in the CD 8 co-receptor could further increase this effect. The effects of the human CD 8 co-receptor with a homologous mutation (I 59 R) was also investigated in human CD 4 + T-cells with a CMV-specific TCR. In vivo studies showed that introducing the F 5 -TCR alone did not endow CD 4 + T cells with significant protection against injected lymphoma cells expressing NP 366. However adding CD 8 co-receptor to the CD 4 + T cells enhanced tumour protection. The genetically modified CD 4 + T cells persisted for <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> in surviving mice and when re-challenged with antigen the CD 4 + T cells with both F 5 - TCR and CD 8 co-receptor had greater proliferative capacity and had more central memory phenotype cells...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this case study and {{evidence-based}} analysis {{is to determine the}} efficacy of manual therapy (MT) versus exercise, including McKenzie therapy (MDT) /directional preference, in promoting functional outcomes and decreasing pain in adult patients with chronic low back pain. Background: Low back pain that has been present for <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> is considered to be chronic. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) varies in type and severity and has been described as bone pain, nerve pain or muscle pain. Each type of pain then carries its own set of descriptors. Chronic low back pain may originate from disease, injury, and stresses placed on different structures of the body. In the physical therapy setting, there are several methods to treating CLBP such as education, posture training, behavioral modifications, exercises, modalities, (biofeedback, electrical stimulation, laser therapy, traction, ultrasound, etc.), manual therapy and massage. The most efficacious physical therapy treatment for chronic low back pain is imperative to find to offset an increasing CLBP population leading to decreased function, loss of work and increased medical expenses. Case Description: A thirty-two-year-old male patient with a history of chronic low back pain of greater than seven years received physical therapy (PT) for two months prior to a right (R) sided L 5 -S 1 surgery. A right side laminectomy, foraminotomy, and discectomy at L 5 -S 1 level was performed in a minimally-invasive day surgery procedure. One month later he was referred back to physical therapy to increase motor control function and ultimately find ways to cope with his symptoms. Outcomes: The patient had several remarkable gains. These gains included increased range of motion (ROM) and strength of the hip, ankle and trunk musculature, improved balance and proprioceptive awareness, decreased pain, increased function in walking, sitting, bending, sleeping, working, lifting and recreational activities, improved knowledge of diagnosis, symptom management skills and overall improved well-being. Initial treatment consisted of transversus abdominus/core engagement, motor control exercises and education. Progression was assessed weekly and advanced based on ability to complete tasks with control and without symptom increase. Manual therapy was used accordingly to treat hypo mobility, pain and symptom management, sacroiliac (SI) dysfunction and decrease neural tension. Exercise was specific to the patient's impairments, initially with easier low resistance activities and progressing to advanced core strengthening and focusing on dynamic/functional movement. Discussion: A literature review of current research within the past 10 years suggests that both exercise (including McKenzie therapy and directional preference) and manual therapy are both valid options for treating CLBP. There is some evidence to support the use of manual therapy for immediate effects such as pain decrease secondary to an analgesic effect that it may convey. However, when in comparison there is little to no difference between the two. Although {{there are a variety of}} articles and systematic reviews that lead to exercise being slightly more beneficial in the intermediate and long-term outcome. Based on the research it is apparent that there is a varied heterogeneity among the studies and many studies and reviews do not give accurate or detailed accounts of the exercise/MT that is being used in order to reproduce the same results among clientele. Other articles imply that using both in combination for CLBP treatment is better than just one or the other. Ultimately, it will come down to therapist and patient preference, which is also based on efficiency, cost-effectiveness and safety of care, which should have the highest priority...|$|E
40|$|Description of the condition: Chronic pain is {{a common}} problem. When defined as pain of <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> duration, {{prevalence}} studies indicate that up to half the adult population suffer from chronic pain, and 10 to 20 % experience clinically significant chronic pain (Smith 2008). In Europe 19 % of adults experience chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity with serious negative implications for their social and working lives {{and many of these}} receive inadequate pain management (Breivik 2006). Chronic pain is a heterogenous phenomenon that results {{from a wide variety of}} pathologies including chronic tissue injury such as arthritis, peripheral nerve injury, central nervous system injury as well as a range of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia. It is likely that different mechanisms of pain production underpin these different causes of chronic pain (Ossipov 2006). Description of the intervention: Brain stimulation techniques have been used to address a variety of pathological pain conditions including fibromyalgia, chronic post-stroke pain and complex regional pain syndrome (Cruccu 2007; Fregni 2007; Gilula 2007) and clinical studies of both invasive and non-invasive techniques have produced preliminary data showing reductions in pain (Cruccu 2007; Fregni 2007; Lefaucheur 2008 b). Various types of brain stimulation, both invasive and non-invasive are currently in clinical use for the treatment of chronic pain (Cruccu 2007). Non invasive stimulation techniques require no surgical procedure and are therefore easier and safer to apply than invasive procedures. They include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES). rTMS involves stimulation of the cortex by a stimulating coil applied to the scalp. Electric currents are induced in the brain directly using rapidly changing magnetic fields (Fregni 2007). Trains of these stimuli are applied to the target region of the cortex to induce alterations in cortical excitability both locally and in remote cortical and subcortical brain regions (Leo 2007). A recent meta-analysis suggested that rTMS may be more effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions with a central compared to a peripheral nervous system origin (Leung 2009). tDCS and CES involve the safe and painless application of low intensity (commonly ≤ 2 mA) electrical current to the cerebral cortex of the brain (Fregni 2007; Gilula 2007). tDCS has been developed as a clinical tool for the modulation of brain activity in recent years and uses relatively large electrodes that are applied to the scalp over the targeted brain area to deliver a weak constant current (Lefaucheur 2008 a). Recent clinical studies have concluded that tDCS was more effective than sham stimulation at reducing pain in both fibromyalgia and spinal cord injury related pain (Fregni 2006 a; Fregni 2006 b). CES was initially developed in the USSR as a treatment for anxiety and depression in the 1950 s and its use later spread to Europe and the USA where it began to be considered and used as a treatment for pain (Kirsch 2000). The electrical current in CES is commonly pulsed and is applied via clip electrodes that are attached to the patients earlobes. A Cochrane review of non-invasive treatments for headaches (Bronfort 2004) identified limited evidence that CES is superior to placebo in reducing pain intensity after 6 to 10 weeks of treatment...|$|E
