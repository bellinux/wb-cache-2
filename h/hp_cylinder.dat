2500|$|Cross {{compound}} locomotives have {{a fundamental}} design issue, {{which is that}} if the <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> is stopped [...] "on center", the locomotive cannot start. [...] To resolve this, all practical cross compound locomotives have some form of starting valve, which allows admission of HP steam into the LP cylinder on starting. [...] In some cases this is manually operated by the locomotive driver, while in other cases it is automatic; in the latter case the valve {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "intercepting valve". [...] The primary difference between various forms of cross compound locomotives is in the design and operation of the intercepting valve.|$|E

It had a 4-foot-6-inch stroke and operated a 23-foot-diameter flywheel at [...] rpm and 26 ropes; the flywheel had 73 rope grooves and was 15 feet wide, probably the widest in any cotton mill. It had drop valves on horizontal <b>HP</b> <b>cylinders</b> and Corliss valves on vertical LP cylinders. Tail rod support guides were on <b>HP</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Air pumps were driven from LP crossheads. It was removed by Mr Jim Price in 1962.The later ring frames were electrically driven.|$|R

50|$|It was {{originally}} driven by 1000 hp twin tandem compound engine by Goodfellow and Matthews built in 1868. It had a 30-foot flywheel with 27 ropes, which operated at 55rpm. It had two 22"HP and two 42"LP cylinders with a 6-foot stroke. The air pumps were driven by lever from crossheads with guides between <b>HP</b> and LP <b>cylinders.</b> This had Corliss valves on all cylinders and was steamed at 80psi. The <b>HP</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{were to the}} front.|$|R
2500|$|A layout {{with more}} or less 120° crank setting (the final setting was to be empirically determined) with <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> placed on the {{left-hand}} side was fully developed by the Argentinian engineer L.D. Porta [...] for new-built modern steam locomotives all of which would have used multiple expansion, some following this 3-cylinder compound system. These included locomotives of the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement, {{one of which was}} intended for fast freight work in the US, this being a high-pressure triple-expansion machine. Strange as this layout may seem, it had a number of advantages {{from the point of view}} of equalising piston thrusts and arrangement of steam passages. It was claimed that with proper maintenance and operating procedures, such locomotives could compete with modern forms of traction. Other projects were for small 2-cylinder compounds: notably a locomotive for sugar plantations in Cuba, burning bagasse.|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{arrangement}} on {{a compound}} engine {{is that the}} steam is first expanded {{in one or two}} high-pressure (HP) cylinder(s), then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts into a larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinder, (or two, - or more), thus extending the cycle. Thus the cylinders can be said to work in [...] "series" [...] as opposed to the normal arrangement of a simple-expansion locomotive where they work in [...] "parallel", the steam being expanded just once in any one cylinder. In order to balance piston thrusts of a compound, the HP:LP cylinder volume ratio has to be carefully determined, usually by increasing the LP cylinder diameter and/or by lengthening the stroke. [...] In non-condensing engines, the HP:LP volume ratio is usually 1:2¼. [...] On geared locomotives, cylinder volumes can be kept more or less identical by increasing LP piston speed. [...] Strictly speaking compound only stands for double-expansion, but the term is loosely applied to any multiple-expansion engine. The instances where railway locomotives have employed triple-expansion with steam going from high-pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>cylinder,</b> to medium-pressure (MP) cylinder and finally to a low-pressure (LP) one are rare, but triple-expansion engines were very common in steamships in the late 19th/early 20th centuries.|$|E
50|$|Later {{compound}} mill engines {{with sophisticated}} valve gears often fitted the complex gear to the <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> whilst retaining a simpler traditional slide valve for the LP cylinder. Examples existed with four {{different sets of}} valves: drop valve HP inlets, Corliss HP exhausts and a LP slide valve with a Meyer expansion valve.|$|E
50|$|It was rebuilt in 1925(?) by Scott & Hodgson as a 1600 hp engine. This engine had slide valves on the LP {{which were}} {{now at the}} front. The <b>HP</b> <b>cylinders</b> had Corliss valves; they were steamed at 120psi, by four Lancashire boilers, An {{economiser}} was used. Marine type connecting rods and trunk guides were fitted.|$|R

50|$|Each of {{the four}} {{turbines}} is an English Electric Company multi-cylinder impulse reaction machine operating on a single re-heat cycle with terminal steam connections of 158.6 bar (2,300 lbf/in2), 566 degrees Celsius (1051 degrees Fahrenheit) and exhausting at a back pressure of 1.5 in Hg. Steam from the boiler passes through four strainers and two pairs of combines stop and emergency valves, each pair being associated with two throttle valves which regulate admission of steam to the <b>H.P.</b> <b>cylinder</b> inlet belt. The <b>H.P.</b> <b>cylinder</b> comprises eight stages in total. The steam expands through the first five stages towards the governor end and then re-versus its direction and flows between {{the inner and outer}} case to the last three stages. Reversing the steam flow within the <b>H.P.</b> <b>cylinder</b> helps to balance the thrust thus relieving the load on the single thrust bearing. From the <b>H.P.</b> <b>cylinder</b> the steam is fed to the boiler re-heater and returned to the I.P. cylinder through two strainers and two pairs of I.P. emergency valves, each pair of which is associated with a pair of interceptor valves which are attached to the cylinder. The I.P. section of the turbine is double flow with seven stages to each flow. The exhaust steam from the I.P. cylinder is passed to the three L.P. cylinders by cross-over pipes reducing cross sections, which distribute the flow of steam equally to each L.P. cylinder through which it expands to the condenser. Each cylinder is double flow with five stages to each flow. A special feature of the Cottam machines is the radial condenser in which the tube nests are disposed right round the turbine L.P. shafts in a common casing. This reduces the steam velocity in the exhaust space, which together with the reduced losses in the exhaust duct improves the efficiency of the condenser. The weight of the whole structure is some hundreds of tons less than earlier structures, and the foundation block is also greatly simplified, since only a rudimentary structure above basement floor level is necessary under the L.P. turbine.|$|E
50|$|A second design {{issue of}} cross {{compound}} locomotives is that, if {{the engine is}} worked on a short cutoff, the steam is fully expanded in the <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> and does no work in the LP cylinder, which causes unequal stresses in the engine.

50|$|It was {{usual for}} {{expansion}} valves to be fitted {{only to the}} HP (high-pressure) cylinder. Steam supplied to the following LP (low-pressure) cylinder has already been supplied to the engine, so there is little benefit to conserving it. Any early cut-off of the steam inlet to a LP cylinder may also represent throttling the exhaust of the preceding <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{and a reduction in}} the efficiency of that cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Steam under {{pressure}} is converted into mechanical energy more efficiently {{if it is}} used in a compound engine; in such an engine steam from a boiler is used in high-pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>cylinders</b> and then under reduced pressure in {{a second set of}} cylinders. The lower-pressure steam occupies a larger volume and the low-pressure (LP) cylinders are larger than the high-pressure cylinders.|$|R

50|$|A {{compound}} {{steam engine}} unit {{is a type}} of steam engine where steam is expanded in two or more stages.A typical arrangement for a compound engine is that the steam is first expanded in a high-pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>cylinder,</b> then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts directly into one or more larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinders.

50|$|Double-expansion (usually just {{known as}} 'compound') engines expand the steam in two stages, {{but this does}} not imply that all such engines have two {{cylinders}}. They may have four cylinders working as two LP-HP pairs, or the work of the large LP cylinder can be split across two smaller cylinders, with one <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> exhausting into either LP cylinder, giving a 3-cylinder layout where the cylinder and piston diameter of all three are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> exhaust {{passed through}} an LP feed heater, {{and then the}} tubes of an LP boiler; this was roughly {{equivalent}} to the LP boiler in the Schmidt system, but was heated by HP exhaust steam not combustion gases.

50|$|A {{method to}} lessen the {{magnitude}} of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high pressure compound engine in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler first expands in a high-pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>cylinder</b> and then enters one or more subsequent lower pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam occurs across multiple cylinders and, as there is less expansion in each cylinder, less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, making higher expansion ratios practical and increasing the efficiency of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Compound engines {{have either}} {{two or three}} cylinders, in which the steam is {{expanded}} in turn. The exhaust of the high-pressure or <b>HP</b> <b>cylinder</b> feeds the low-pressure or LP cylinder. Three cylinder engines also had an intermediate-pressure or IP cylinder, but these were less common than two cylinder engines.. In the tandem compound the cylinders are arranged end to end on a common axis (in this case, vertical) with both pistons mounted on the same rod and moving together. Each cylinder has independent valves and valve gear. The pipe connecting them may be enlarged to form a 'receiver', a reservoir for steam at the intermediate pressure. This improves the efficiency of compound engines.|$|E
