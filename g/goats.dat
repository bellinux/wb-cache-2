5|$|Sheep and <b>goats</b> {{are closely}} related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and <b>goats</b> include the beard of <b>goats</b> and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of <b>goats</b> are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled <b>goats</b> are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck <b>goats</b> acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using <b>goats,</b> which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. <b>Goats</b> which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. <b>Goats</b> compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze lifetime production data for two Slovenian locally adapted dairy breeds: Slovenian Saanen <b>goat</b> (334) and Slovenian Alpine <b>goat</b> (1105) and for the dairy type of Dreznica <b>goat</b> (141) which is the only Slovenian autochthonous <b>goat</b> breed. Dataset included records from 54 farms. Data for does born after 2002 have been obtained from the database of the National selection program for small ruminants, collected by the ICAR standards. The contribution of farm to phenotypic variance was estimated. Data was analyzed by MIXED procedure in SAS/STAT. The results showed significant effect of breed, farm and year of culling on all traits studied, except the effect of breed on completed lactations in lifetime and number of liveborn kids. The lifetime milk yield was higher in Slovenian Alpine <b>goat</b> compared to Slovenian Saanen <b>goat</b> by 413. 26 ± 172. 52 kg. The difference in lifetime protein yield between Slovenian Alpine <b>goat</b> and Slovenian Saanen <b>goat</b> amounted to 11. 76 ± 5. 21 kg. Dreznica <b>goat</b> did not differ in lifetime milk production and protein yield compared to both intensive <b>goat</b> breeds. Dreznica <b>goat</b> yielded about 25. 50 ± 5. 21 kg more fat in lifetime compared to Slovenian Saanen <b>goat.</b> However, compared to Slovenian Alpine <b>goat</b> the difference was not significant. Comparison of Slovenian Saanen <b>goat</b> and Slovenian Alpine <b>goat</b> revealed higher lifetime fat yield of Slovenian Alpine <b>goat</b> by 13. 28 ± 5. 21 kg.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California.

As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish <b>goats</b> from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US.
