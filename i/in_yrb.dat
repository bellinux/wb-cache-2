Results show that the average overall green (from rainfall) and blue (from irrigation) WFs of crops in the period 2001 – 2009 were 14 % and 37 % larger, respectively, than in the period 1961 – 1970. The annual nitrogen- and phosphorus-related grey WFs (water required to assimilate pollutants) of crop production grew by factors of 24 and 36, respectively. The green–blue WF per ton of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields, while the grey WF increased because of the growing application of fertilizers. The ratio of blue to green WF increased {{during the study period}} resulting from the expansion of irrigated agriculture.

This study assesses the WP for irrigated (WPI) and rainfed (WPR) crops in the Yellow River Basin (<b>YRB)</b> <b>in</b> China. WPI and WPR are calculated for major crops (corn, wheat, rice, and soybean) using experimental, statistical and empirically estimated data. The spatial variability of WPI and WRR is analyzed with regard to water and energy factors. Results show that although irrigated corn and soybean yields are significantly higher than rainfed yields in {{different regions of the}} YRB, WPI is slightly lower than WPR for these two crops. This {{can be explained by the}} seasonal coincidence of precipitation and solar energy patterns <b>in</b> the <b>YRB.</b> However, as expected, irrigation stabilizes crop production per unit of water consumption over space. WPI and WPR vary spatially from upstream to downstream <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> as a result of varying climate and water supply conditions. The water factor has stronger effects on both crop yield and WP than the energy factor in the upper and middle basin, whereas energy matters more in the lower basin. Moreover, WP in terms of crop yield is compared to that in terms of agricultural GDP and the results are not consistent. This paper contributes to the WP studies by a basin context, a comparison between WPI and WPR, a comparison of WP in terms of crop yield and economic value, and insights on the water and energy factors on WP.

To reduce {{the impact of these}} disasters, {{it is important to understand}} the variables affecting the hydrological state of the basin. In this study, we used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, flood potential index (FPI), precipitation data (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM 3 B 43), and other meteorological data to generate monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and to evaluate flood potential <b>in</b> the <b>YRB.</b> The results indicate that the basin contained increasing amounts of water from 2003 to 2014, with a slight increase of 3. 04 mm/year in the TWSA. The TWSA and TRMM data exhibit marked seasonal characteristics with summer peaks and winter dips. Estimates of terrestrial water storage based on GRACE, measured as FPI, are critical for understanding and predicting flooding. The 2010 flood (FPI ~ 0. 36) was identified as the most serious disaster during the study period, with discharge and precipitation values 37. 95 % and 19. 44 % higher, respectively, than multi-year average values for the same period. FPI can assess reliably hydrological extremes with high spatial and temporal resolution, but currently, it is not suitable for smaller and/or short-term flood events.

40|$|Flooding in the Yellow River basin (YRB) {{has changed}} {{significantly}} {{over the last}} few decades because of climate change and human activities. Determining how the flooding changed and identifying the main driving factors of flood change is crucial to flood risk assessment and water resources planning. However, few studies have been conducted, especially <b>in</b> the whole <b>YRB.</b> To fill this gap, we investigate the spatial and temporal change of the annual maximum flood (AMAXF) <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> using observed data from 32 key hydrological stations (including 15 mainstream stations and 17 tributary stations). The Mann-Kendall test combined with trend index method is used to evaluate the trend in precipitation and AMAXF. The trend results indicate the AMAXF over the whole basin is dominated by decreasing trends: 72 % of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends (at 0. 1 significance level) and 22 % of the stations show no significant decreasing trends in the AMAXF. Both flood trends and abrupt change time exhibit obvious regional differences: the flood decreases is more pronounced in the midstream basins than in the headwater of the basin; the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the early 1990 s for the upper reaches, and in the late 1990 s for the middle reaches. To investigate the causes of flood change, the trends of precipitation extremes are analyzed in relation to the trends of peak floods. The analysis reveals that the decreasing precipitation extremes only results in the AMAXF reduction in the upstream basin. The decreasing AMAXF in the midstream and downstream of the basin are mainly attributable to the impacts of human activities (mainly including dam construction and soil conservation practices). In general, anthropogenic impacts play an increasingly important role in the AMAXF changes <b>in</b> the <b>YRB.</b> According to the possible changes in forcing factors, the AMAXF over the whole basin is expected to further decrease in the near future. However, there are still large flood risks in the tributary basins due to the collapse of check dams caused by extreme storms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the spatial and temporal variability of daily minimum, mean and maximum temperature and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) during 1961 - 2010. Three variability patterns of daily minimum temperature and four variability patterns of daily mean and maximum temperatures were detected. Results indicate that the rugged topography causes more complex temperature variability in the mid YRB, and daily mean temperature shows more complex variability rather than daily minimum and maximum temperatures. Under the control of both topography and atmospheric circle, three temperature variables have mean values decreasing spatially with longitude, although the Sichuan Basin has larger mean values compared with the surrounding areas, and there are smaller variations in the Jinsha River Basin relative to other areas. The variations of three temperature variables became smaller over time. After the 1980 s, the three temperature variables show upward trends in most areas of YRB, except in the Jinsha River Basin where complex temperature trends appeared. In the five decades, both negative and positive magnitudes of DTR were detected, reflecting the different upward speeds of daily minimum and maximum temperatures in different areas of YRB. Rapid urbanization caused notably increasing temperature and DTR in the 2000 s at the Wuhan and Shanghai urban agglomerations. In summary, the Dongting and Poyang Lake basins and the Yangtze River Delta <b>in</b> <b>YRB</b> are more sensitive and susceptible to climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The ∆EVI (the UEs on vegetation, urban EVI minus rural EVI) decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) in 9, 7 and 5 out of 10 cities for annual, summer and winter, respectively. The annual daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity (SUHII; urban LST minus rural LST) increased significantly (p < 0. 05) in 10 and 4 out of 10 cities, respectively.

The correlation analyses indicated that the annual and summer daytime SUHII were significantly negatively correlated with ∆EVI in most cities. The decreasing ∆EVI may also contribute to the increasing nighttime SUHII. In addition, the significant negative correlations (r < − 0. 5, p < 0. 1) between inter-annual linear slope of ∆EVI and SUHII were observed, which suggested that the cities with higher decreasing rates of ∆EVI may show higher increasing rates of SUHII...|$|E
40|$|The Yellow River basin (YRB) is the breadbasket of China and the “cradle of Chinese civilization. ” The basin is {{characterized}} by severe water scarcity; the ratio of surface water withdrawal to water resources, at 64 percent in 2008, is {{among the highest in}} the world. Particular climatic conditions, the rapid socioeconomic development, and the absence of defined water rights have led to excessive water abstraction. During the last 50 years agricultural water use has increased by more than 250 percent, while water demand from industry and domestic use has grown even more steeply. Climate change is likely to add pressure to water resources by affecting the stream-flow in two regions of the YRB, which account for approximately three-fourths of total runoff in the basin. Using stream-flow data as input, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) water supply-and-demand model projects that climate change may result in annual water shortages of 9 km 3 by 2020. In extremely dry years this value may increase to 15 or even 26 km 3. Similarly, the International Food Policy Research Institute’s (IFPRI’s) IMPACT (International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade) model shows a decline in overall availability of water for irrigation <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> under climate change. The model also shows that large food-producing basins, such as the YRB, can strongly impact international food prices. We implement two scenarios of reduced irrigation water availability <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> (declines by 30 percent and 50 percent) under climate change, which reflect Chinese estimates of future dry-season water shortages <b>in</b> the <b>YRB.</b> By 2030, with climate change and irrigation water reduction of 30 percent, international wheat prices increase by 6 percent, maize prices by 4 percent, and rice prices by 3 percent. With a 50 percent irrigation water reduction, increases would be even higher: 9 percent for wheat, 10 percent for maize, and 6 percent for rice. Furthermore, calorie availability in developing countries declines by 1. 2 percent and 2. 2 percent under a 30 percent and 50 percent irrigation water reduction, respectively, by 2030. To preserve economic growth and food security in the basin and to reduce potentially adverse impacts on global food markets, managers will need to tackle inefficient water use. YRCC experts show that technological advances are important but insufficient to meet projected gaps in water supply. The focus will thus need to remain on measures to control water demand as well as on increased agricultural and crop water productivity. China has both the potential and the resources to make this happen. Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1 EPT...|$|R

40|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} (ET 0) {{is generally}} accepted {{to be an}} important element of the hydrological cycle, and changes in sensitivity coefficients of ET 0 to climate variables are of great significance for agricultural water use planning, irrigation system design and management, especially under the condition when climate change may have important influence on water-shortage regions, such as Yellow River basin (YRB), where warmer and drier conditions might augment water demand by crop. However, little reports have focused on the related issues in the upper, middle, and lower regions of YRB. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the variation of ET 0 and its response to climate variables in the upper, middle, and lower regions of YRB. Based on data for 109 meteorological stations in and around YRB from the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) in years of 1961 - 2012, ET 0 was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation recommended by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO- 56) and its sensitivity coefficient to climate variables (solar radiation, relative humidity, daily air temperature, and wind speed) was calculated. The results showed that the average daily ET 0 value in upper region was higher than in the middle and lower region of YRB and a significantly decreasing trend of ET 0 was detected with the magnitude of 0. 043 mm per decade in lower region. The diurnal variation curve of solar radiation, air temperature and their sensitivity coefficients was in a single apex type in the upper, middle and lower regions of YRB, and that the sensitivity coefficients of wind speed changed following a single trough type curve. However, the curves fluctuated largely for relative humidity, wind speed along with sensitivity coefficient for relative humidity and air temperature. Furthermore, the maximum value of sensitivity coefficient for relative humidity was found in December, similarly for air temperature and solar radiation in July and August, respectively. A decreasing trend was observed for solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and sensitivity coefficient of solar radiation and air temperature. But, an increasing trend was detected for air temperature, sensitivity coefficient of relative humidity and wind speed in recent 52 years. Relative humidity is considered to be the most sensitive variable, while solar radiation is recognized as primarily controlling variable for ET 0 in the whole year and recent 52 years. Moreover, the high value of sensitivity coefficients to solar radiation, relative humidity and air temperature was found in the southwest study area, while the high value of sensitivity coefficients to wind speed was in the north region. Therefore, the southwest region was recognized as the most sensitive region for response of ET 0 to climate change.

VIC was first calibrated using observations and then was driven by the precipitation and temperature projected by the RegCM 3 high-resolution regional climate model under the IPCC scenario A 2. Results show that, under the scenario A 2, the mean annual temperature of the basin could increase by 1. 6 °C, while mean annual precipitation could decrease by 2. 6 %. There could be an 11. 6 % reduction in annual runoff in the basin according to the VIC projection. However, there are marked regional variations in these climate change impacts. Reductions of 13. 6 %, 25. 7 %, and 24. 6 % could be expected in the regions of Hekouzhen to Longmen, Longmen to Sanmenxia, and Sanmenxia to Huayuankou, respectively. Our study suggests that the condition of water resources <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> could become more severe in the period from 2001 to 2030 under the scenario A 2...|$|R
40|$|The c-Jun-like {{transcriptional}} activator Gcn 4 p controls biosynthesis of translational precursors in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Protein stability {{is dependent on}} amino acid limitation and cis signals within Gcn 4 p which are recognized by cyclin-dependent protein kinases, including Pho 85 p. The Gcn 4 p population within unstarved yeast consists of a small relatively stable cytoplasmic fraction and a larger less stable nuclear fraction. Gcn 4 p contains two nuclear localization signals (NLS) which function independently of {{the presence or absence}} of amino acids. Expression of NLS-truncated Gcn 4 p results in an increased cytoplasmic fraction and an overall stabilization of the protein. The same effect is achieved for the entire Gcn 4 p <b>in</b> a <b>yrb</b> 1 yeast mutant strain impaired in the nuclear import machinery. In the presence of amino acids, controlled destabilization of Gcn 4 p is triggered by the phosphorylation activity of Pho 85 p. A pho 85 Δ mutation stabilizes Gcn 4 p without affecting nuclear import. Pho 85 p is localized within the nucleus in {{the presence or absence of}} amino acids. Therefore, there is a strict spatial separation of protein synthesis and degradation of Gcn 4 p in yeast. Control of protein stabilization which antagonizes Gcn 4 p function is restricted to the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{pressure}} of increasing water shortages {{and the need to}} sustain the development of irrigated agriculture, since the middle of the 1990 s, officials <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> have begun to push for the institutional reform of irrigation management. Based on a panel data set collected in 2001 and 2005 in the Yellow River Basin, the overall goal {{of this paper is to}} examine how the irrigation management reform has proceeded since the early 2000 s and what the impacts are of the incentive mechanisms on water use and crop yields. The results show that after the early 2000 s, irrigation management reform has accelerated. Different from contracting management, more Water User Associations (WUAs) chose not to establish incentive mechanisms. The econometric model results indicate that using incentive mechanisms to promote water savings is effective under the arrangement of contracting management and not effective under WUAs. However, if incentives are provided to the contracting managers, the wheat yield declines significantly. Our results imply that at the later stage of the reform, the cost of reducing water use by providing incentives to managers includes negative impacts on some crop yields. Therefore, how to design win-win supporting policies to ensure the healthy development of the irrigation management reform should be highly addressed by policy makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{composition}} of protein surfaces determines both affinity and specificity of protein-protein interactions. Matching of hydrophobic contacts and charged groups on both {{sites of the}} interface are crucial to ensure specificity. Here, we propose a highlighting scheme, YRB, which highlights both hydrophobicity and charges <b>in</b> protein structures. <b>YRB</b> highlighting visualises hydrophobicity by highlighting all carbon atoms that are not bound to nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The charged oxygens of glutamate and aspartate are highlighted red and the charged nitrogens of arginine and lysine are highlighted blue. For a set of representative examples, we demonstrate that YRB highlighting intuitively visualises segments on protein surfaces that contribute to specificity in protein-protein interfaces, including Hsp 90 /co-chaperone complexes, SNARE complex and a transmembrane domain.

40|$|We {{identified}} two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in the essential gene, YRB 1, which encodes the yeast homolog of Ran-binding-protein- 1 (RanBP 1), a known coregulator of the Ran GTPase cycle. Both mutations result in single amino acid substitutions of evolutionarily conserved residues (A 91 D and R 127 K, respectively) in the Ran-binding domain of Yrb 1. The altered proteins have reduced affinity for Ran (Gsp 1) in vivo. After shift to restrictive temperature, both mutants display impaired nuclear protein import and one also reduces poly(A) + RNA export, suggesting a primary defect in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Consistent with this conclusion, both yrb 1 ts mutations display deleterious genetic interactions with mutations {{in many other}} genes involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including SRP 1 (alpha-importin) and several beta-importin family members. These yrb 1 ts alleles were isolated by their ability to suppress {{two different types of}} mating-defective mutants (respectively, fus 1 Delta and ste 5 ts), indicating that reduction in nucleocytoplasmic transport enhances mating proficiency. Indeed, <b>in</b> both <b>yrb</b> 1 ts mutants, Ste 5 (scaffold protein for the pheromone response MAPK cascade) is mislocalized to the cytosol, {{even in the absence of}} pheromone. Also, both yrb 1 ts mutations suppress the mating defect of a null mutation in MSN 5, which encodes the receptor for pheromone-stimulated nuclear export of Ste 5. Our results suggest that reimport of Ste 5 into the nucleus is important in downregulating mating response...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the extent of}} connection between groundwater and surface water near a proposed infiltration pond site in Northern Kittitas Valley. The Yakima River Basin (<b>YRB)</b> is <b>in</b> a situation where all of the surface water rights have been issued. As a result, during low water years, junior water right holders do not get their full allotment of water. In order to address this issue, members of the City, County, State, and Federal Government, as well as representatives from the Yakama Nation, environmental groups, and irrigation districts <b>in</b> the <b>YRB</b> came together <b>in</b> order to formulate a solution, the Yakima River Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan. Part of that plan is groundwater storage. The first step is a pilot project where water is diverted during high flow to infiltration ponds around Kittitas Valley and Wapato. This research focuses on using geochemistry to understand surface water/groundwater interaction near a proposed infiltration pond site in eastern Kittitas Valley. To accomplish this, samples are taken from surface and ground water near the site and analyzed for cation, anion, and isotope geochemistry. Anion and cation data for this project is obtained using the Dionex DX 500 Ion Chromatograph in CWU 2 ̆ 7 s Chemistry Department. Stable isotope data for this project is obtained using the Geology Department 2 ̆ 7 s Thermo Finnegan Delta XP Mass Spectrometer.

40|$|SummaryProteins and ribonucleoproteins {{containing}} a nuclear export signal (NES) assemble with the exportin Xpo 1 p (yeast CRM 1) and Gsp 1 p-GTP (yeast Ran-GTP) in the nucleus and exit through the nuclear pore complex. <b>In</b> the cytoplasm, <b>Yrb</b> 1 p (yeast RanBP 1) displaces NES from Xpo 1 p. Efficient export of NES-cargoes requires Yrb 2 p (yeast RanBP 3), a primarily nuclear protein containing nucleoporin-like phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats and a low-affinity Gsp 1 p-binding domain (RanBD). Here, {{we show that}} Yrb 2 p strikingly accelerates the association of Gsp 1 p-GTP and NES to Xpo 1 p. We have solved the crystal structure of the Xpo 1 p-Yrb 2 p-Gsp 1 p-GTP complex, a key assembly intermediate that can bind cargo rapidly. Although the NES-binding cleft of Xpo 1 p is closed in this intermediate, our data suggest that preloading of Gsp 1 p-GTP onto Xpo 1 p by Yrb 2 p, conformational flexibility of Xpo 1 p, and the low affinity of RanBD enable active displacement of Yrb 2 p RanBD by NES to occur effectively. The structure also reveals the major binding sites for FG repeats on Xpo 1 p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{majority}} of environmental input-output studies {{focus on a}} single region or country. Linking environmental input-output models to the space can provide a better understanding on the spatial relationships of consumption and production activities and associated environmental issues. This PhD thesis employs the environmental input-output techniques using geo-demographic data bases to explore spatio-environmental issues in the developed country, UK, and the developing country, China. In this thesis, four case studies (Chapters 3, 4, 5 & 6) were carried out on natural resources extraction and environmental pollution using water consumption and CO 2 emissions as environmental issues. Chapter 3 assessed the UK production and consumption water footprints {{and found that the}} UK consumption water footprint was more than three times bigger than its production water footprints. About half of the UK consumption water footprints were imported from Non-OECD countries, many of which were water scarce. Chapter 4 focused on regional virtual water flows and water footprints in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. The results show that the production and consumption activities outside of the basin also contributed to the water stress <b>in</b> the <b>YRB,</b> particularly the water scarce lower reach. Chapter 5 applied input-output structural decomposition analysis (10 SDA) to identify the key driving forces for China's regional CO 2 emissions 2002 - 2007 and found that increases of final consumption such as urban household consumption, capital investment and export were the key driving forces for most of China's regions. Chapter 6 assessed the distributional effects of climate change taxation for the UK. The results showed that both CO 2 and GHG taxes tended to be regressive, while a GHG tax led to a more equal distribution of the tax burden across income and lifestyle groups. This research concluded that linking environmental input-output models to space could present the spatial relationships of different regions in terms of environmental issues and build up consumption based spatio- environmental inventory. Policy implications from the four case studies have also been discussed. viiEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The Yellow River, {{the second}} longest river in China, is facing {{increasing}} water scarcity due to rising water consumption of a fast growing economy and an increasingly urbanized population with water-intensive consumption patterns. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) {{is divided into}} three regions: the upper, middle and lower reaches; each with very different characteristics in terms of water resources, economic structure and household income and consumption patterns. Virtual water has been recognised as a potentially useful concept for redistributing water from water-rich to water-poor regions. In this study, we develop a Multi-Regional Input-Output model (MRIO) to assess the regional virtual water flows between the three reaches of the basin and the rest of China distinguishing green and blue water, as well as rural and urban household water footprints. Results show that all three reaches are net virtual water exporter, i. e. production and consumption activities outside the basin also put pressure on the water resources <b>in</b> the <b>YRB.</b> The results suggest a reduction of the export of virtual blue water that could instead be used for producing higher value added but lower water-intensive goods. In particular, the lower reach as the most water scarce region in the basin should increase the import of water intensive goods, such as irrigated crops and processed food products, from other more water abundant regions such as the South of China. Thus, trading virtual water can help sustain the economic growth of the regions within the basin thus easing the pressure from water shortage. In addition, there is a huge gap between urban and rural household water footprints in the basin. The average urban household's water footprint is more than double the water footprint of a rural household in the basin. This is due to the higher urban household consumption of water-intensive goods and services, such as processed food products, wearing apparel and footwear, hotel and catering services and electricity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Xpo 1 p (Crm 1 p) is {{the nuclear}} export {{receptor}} for proteins containing a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). Xpo 1 p, the NES-containing protein, and GTP-bound Ran form a {{complex in the}} nucleus that translocates across the nuclear pore. We have identified Yrb 1 p as the major Xpo 1 p-binding protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae extracts {{in the presence of}} GTP-bound Gsp 1 p (yeast Ran). Yrb 1 p is cytoplasmic at steady-state but shuttles continuously between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear import of Yrb 1 p is mediated by two separate nuclear targeting signals. Export from the nucleus requires Xpo 1 p, but Yrb 1 p does not contain a leucine-rich NES. Instead, the interaction of Yrb 1 p with Xpo 1 p is mediated by Gsp 1 p-GTP. This novel type of export complex requires the acidic C-terminus of Gsp 1 p, which is dispensable for the binding to importin b-like transport receptors. A similar complex with Xpo 1 p and Gsp 1 p-GTP can be formed by Yrb 2 p, a relative of Yrb 1 p predominantly located <b>in</b> the nucleus. <b>Yrb</b> 1 p also functions as a disassembly factor for NES/Xpo 1 p/Gsp 1 p-GTP complexes by displacing the NES protein from Xpo 1 p/Gsp 1 p.

40|$|Investigation of the {{variation}} in drought and regional response to climate change is widely accepted to be very important for ecological security and agricultural production, and can provide basis information for developing appropriate measures to reduce droughts over the Yellow River Basin (<b>YRB).</b> <b>In</b> this study, the relative humidity index (M) was calculated from a data set of daily climate variables in 102 meteorological stations over the Yellow River Basin and in sequence, its sensitivity coefficients to key meteorological variables were firstly investigated using a partial derivative method. The results witnessed that the drought degree was detected to be stronger in the upper region than the middle and lower region. Moderate, slight, moderate and extra severe drought were found in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively and extra severe drought was found in entire year. M was detected to increase from the northwest to the southeast region and the extra severe drought region was mainly located in Shaanxi, Shanxi, north Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. The meteorological stations whose relative humidity index increased were mainly located in the upper region, while in the southeast region of YRB. Accordingly, the M is proved to be positively sensitive to solar radiation (RS) and relative humidity (RH), while negatively sensitive to air temperature (T) and wind speed (WS). The M was most sensitive to RS and T for summer in upper and middle region respectively. Furthermore, the most sensitive variable turned to be RH for spring, autumn, winter and entire year in the whole basin. The declining of RH controlled a negative trend for M in spring and summer over the whole basin, while RS was primarily responsible for the change of M in autumn in upper and lower region respectively. However, the primarily controlling variable turned to be T, WS and WS for winter in upper, middle and lower region. As for the entire year, RS, RH and RH mainly governed M in upper, middle and lower basin respectively. Peer reviewe...|$|R
