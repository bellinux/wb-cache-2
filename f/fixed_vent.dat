40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out inside a 25 m 3 vented {{combustion}} test facility (CVE) with a <b>fixed</b> <b>vent</b> area sealed by a plastic sheet vent. Inside the CVE, a 0. 64 m 3 open vent box, called RED-CVE was placed. The vent of the RED-CVE was left open and three different vent area were tested. Two different mixing fans, one for each compartment, were used to establish homogeneous H 2 concentrations. This study examined H 2 concentrations in the range between 8. 5...|$|E
40|$|Tests of a partial-span {{model of}} a large bomber-type air 1 ane were {{conducted}} to determine the. aerodynamic characteristics of the wing equipped with full-span flaps and a retractable spoiler end aileron lateral control system. The arrangement consisted of (1) a double slotted flap extending over aproximate 1 y 86 percent of the wing semispan, (2) a 20 -percent constant-percentage-chord aileron extending from the outboard end of the flap to the wing tip, and (3) a retractable spoiler, located at the 65 -percent wing-chord station and extending from approximately 63 percent of the wing semispan to the wing tip. In addition, tests were made of a wing vent (of 1 and 2 percent of the wing chord located directly behind the spoiler), perforations in the spoiler, a blot or cut-out along the lower edge of the spoiler and spoilers of various spans. With full-span flaps deflected and with the 2 -percent vent open or closed the initial stalling of the wing occurred at the tips, but with the vents closed there probably would be no appreciable loss in lateral control until maximum lift was reached. The l-percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoi 1 er deflections, particularly at high angles of attack with flaps deflected. With flaps deflected the 2 -percent vent caused a large reduction in both the wing lift and rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at large angles of attack. However, at small angle of attack the 2 -percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoiler deflections. The simultaneous operation of the spoiler and vent (in contrast to a vent fixed in the wing) {{would result in a}} large increase in the effectiveness of the spoiler and would avoid any loss in wing lift as in a <b>fixed</b> <b>vent</b> arrangement. The tests of the spoiler modifications revealed that (1) the spoiler perforations reduced the rolling-moment and yawing-moment coefficients but caused the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients to become more positive; (2) the spoiler slot had no notable effect on the rolling-moment and yawing-moment characteristics but produced a positive increase in the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients at large spoiler deflections; (3) the effects produced by the individual modifications were additive when the various modifications were combined. In general, progressively decreasing the spoiler span by removing the segments from the inboard end of the spoiler caused a decrease in rolling effectiveness approximately proportional to the span of the segment...|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} {{versions}} of this ambulance: The early version had two round spinning ventilators {{on the roof and}} a spare wheel cover with a large hump. The late version had two square <b>fixed</b> <b>vents</b> on the roof and a spare-wheel cover with a much smaller and rounder hump (as the spare wheel was moved further into the body to stop drivers hitting the cover (and wheel) when passing other vehicles; hence the cut-out in the internal door was made larger).|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} additions {{associated with}} {{the conversion of the}} residence into a hospital in 1909, including a former operating theatre, staff quarters and kitchen, are largely confined {{to the rear of the}} residence. Of particular note is an attached hipped roof structure, which formerly contained an operating room and sterilizing room. The former operating room (now a guestroom) is still accessible from outside. This room has three lights in the roof, covered with corrugated iron. <b>Fixed</b> timber <b>vents</b> are located on the lower third of the room on two sides and closable timber vents are located on the upper level. There is an ornate ceiling rose of pressed metal.|$|R
50|$|The Rocks Guesthouse is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a late 19th-century middle-class North Queensland timber residence converted into a private hospital in the early 20th century: The core includes spacious, high-ceilinged rooms; a large bay window to the principal public room; and decorative elements such as fretwork ceiling vents. Its grounds retain an early brick and stone retaining wall and front garden stairs. At {{the rear of the}} original house the former operating room remains substantially intact and {{is important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type, including the need for adequate light and ventilation, demonstrated in the low <b>fixed</b> louvre <b>vents,</b> upper level movable louvres, overhead skylights and both internal and external entry.|$|R
50|$|In late 1909 Dr Humphrey {{converted}} the -1900 residence {{into a private}} hospital. Alterations included substantial additions. A corridor led to new rooms {{at the rear of}} the building, which included a kitchen, common bathroom and laundry, sterilizing room, operating room and servants' quarters. The operating room and sterilizing room were adjoining and were accessed from the house but the operating room was also accessible externally. This room had three ceiling window lights to allow natural light for operations, Inside, <b>fixed</b> timber <b>vents</b> were situated on the lower third of the room on two sides and closable timber vents were located on the upper level. The lower vents were needed to dissipate the heavy ether used in operations. The front entrance to the hospital was accessed from imposing rendered brick stairs.|$|R
40|$|Typical {{automotive}} airbag {{systems have}} a <b>fixed</b> area <b>vent</b> for exiting gasses. The US Army Cockpit Airbag System (CABS) is unvented {{to prolong the}} period during which the system can provide occupant protection during extended helicopter crash scenarios. In each application, system performance may be enhanced by providing a controlled vent area. This paper describes work conducted under a Phase I SBIR program sponsored by the NASA Langley Research Center. The work was focused on eventual inflatable restraint system applications in general aviation aircraft, and showed that appropriate vent control offers many enhancements. Two series of tests conducted during Phase I showed that inflatable restraint system size and weight can be reduced without degrading performance, injury potential in an out of position situation (OOPS) deployment can be reduced, and peak bag pressures can be reduced (at any temperature) during normal operation...|$|R

Summary Rotary compressor is composed of the piston, cylinder, blade, spring, eccentric shaft and top low bear etc. The inner hole of cylinder and the piston are both full round. There are suck and vent entrances on the cylinder. <b>Vent</b> valve is <b>fixed</b> on <b>vent</b> entrance. The eccentric shaft fixed in the cylinder coincides with the center of cylinder in rotary centerline. The piston is fixed on the eccentric shaft and its outer surface is tangent to the inner surface of cylinder, therefore it forms a crescent room between the inner surface of cylinder and the outer surface of piston. And both ends of the crescent room closed by the top and lower bears, so it is a closed work cavity. A radial groove is cut between suck and vent entrance. A blade is set in the groove and can move back and forth. A spring pushing on the back of blade, keeping the blade tightly contact on the outer surface of the piston. So the crescent room is divided into two parts: the par...|$|R
50|$|The common {{friction}} tube is {{a copper}} tube, packed with powder, having {{at the upper}} end a short branch (called a nib piece) at right angles. This branch is filled with friction composition in which a friction bar is embedded. When the friction bar is sharply pulled out, {{by means of a}} lanyard, the composition is ignited and sets fire to the powder in the long tube; the flash is conveyed through the vent and ignites the gun charge. For naval purposes, to prevent the sailors from being cut on the face or hurting their feet, tubes of quill instead of copper were used. If friction tubes are employed when cordite or other smokeless powder charges are used, the erosion of the vent is very rapid unless the escape of the gas is prevented; in this case T-headed tubes are used. They are similar in action to the ordinary type, but are <b>fixed</b> to the <b>vent</b> by the head fitting a bayonet joint formed with the vent. The explosion blows a small ball upwards and blocks the coned hole {{at the top of the}} tube and so prevents any rush of gas.|$|R
