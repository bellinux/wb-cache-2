5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Dinah {{can be traced}} back to a poorly {{organized}} area of disturbed weather that formed on August18 close to Guam and was embedded in the monsoon trough, at the time situated near the equator. At 06:00UTC on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, as the system started to show signs of organization. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along the axis of the system, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start keeping an eye on the low. Late on August20, there was a rapid increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of the thunderstorm activity, and satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak Technique reached T2.0/. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on August21.|$|E
5|$|The 1798 China Fleet sailed {{without further}} incident. During the ensuing year Resistance was {{destroyed}} by an accidental explosion in July in the Bangka Strait, {{and the majority of}} Rainier's forces were focused on disrupting the French occupation of Suez in the Red Sea. This diversion of British resources created gaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> in merchant shipping and Sercey was able to send the frigate Preneuse and corvette Brûle-Gueule to Manila late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadron. At the beginning of February 1799, this combined force sailed to Macau, taking the British defences by surprise. The British commander Captain William Hargood counterattacked, advancing on the Franco-Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the Wanshan Archipelago. The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fleet was not attacked again until the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804, at which a French squadron was again driven off in confusion. The frigates Cooke had mimicked, Forte and Prudente were sent to operate independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean in early 1799. Prudente was captured by HMS Daedalus at the Action of 9 February 1799 near Southern Africa, and Forte was intercepted by HMS Sybille under Cooke on 28 February near Balasore in Bengal. In the ensuing battle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded, dying on 25 May.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} met with a flood of {{nationalist}} and anti-Albanian statements in the Serbian press. This was, in itself, a significant development. The Communist Yugoslav state had for many years made open nationalism a taboo subject, and the Yugoslav media had previously systematically downplayed nationalism.

Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, {{received}} far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a Hopi from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave {{more attention to the}} woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.|$|E

At that time, the CBC only had {{rights to the}} Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi-finals, the CBC's worst nightmare became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC {{found a way to}} link their Windsor viewers as having a vested interest in the Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with nary a glitch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{depression}} {{moved slowly}} toward the southwest and became better organized, despite a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of deep convection. By late September 28 the depression was approaching tropical storm status; it turned to the northwest and attained winds of [...] at 0600 UTC on September 29, at which time it was assigned the name Otis. That evening, wind shear relented and conditions became more favorable for the storm's intensification. Convection wrapped almost fully around the center, and early on September 3, Otis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye feature developed; it quickly became better defined as it entered the scope of weather radar in Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
