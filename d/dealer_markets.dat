5000|$|Group portraits were {{produced}} {{in great numbers}} during the Baroque period, particularly in the Netherlands. Unlike {{in the rest of}} Europe, Dutch artists received no commissions from the Calvinist Church which had forbidden such images or from the aristocracy which was virtually non-existent. Instead, commissions came from civic and businesses associations. Dutch painter Frans Hals used fluid brush strokes of vivid color to enliven his group portraits, including those of the civil guards to which he belonged. Rembrandt benefitted greatly from such commissions and from the general appreciation of art by bourgeois clients, who supported portraiture as well as still-life and landscapes painting. In addition, the first significant art and <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> flourished in Holland at that time.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{official}} stock markets in Paris were operated by the Compagnie des agents de change, directed by the elected members of a stockbrokers' syndical council. The number of dealers in each of the different trading areas of the Bourse was limited. There were around 60 agents de change (the official stockbrokers). An agent de change had to be a French citizen, benominated by a former agent or his estate, and be approved by the Minister of Finance, and he was appointed by decree of the President of the Republic. Officially, the agents de change could not trade for their own account nor even be a counterpart to someone who wanted to buy or sell securities with their aid; they were strictly brokers, that is, intermediaries. In the financial literature, the Paris Bourse is hence referred to as order-driven market, as opposed to quote-driven markets or <b>dealer</b> <b>markets,</b> where price-setting is handled by a dealer or market-maker. In Paris, only agents de change could receive a commission, at a rate fixed by law, for acting as an intermediary. However, parallel arrangements were usual in order to favor some clients' quote. The Commodities Exchange was housed in the same building until 1889, when it moved to the present Bourse de commerce.Moreover, until about the middle of the 20th century, a parallel market known as [...] "La Coulisse" [...] was in operation.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} market organization on incentives to invest and on the volume of trade. Businesses purchase trillions {{of dollars worth of}} resources and manufactured inputs from other businesses both directly and through dealers. Hundreds of new dealers have entered the market with the advent of business-to-business electronic commerce. Buyers and sellers in business-to-business markets undertake substantial complementary investments that respectively raise the value of purchased inputs or lower the cost of manufacturing inputs that are sold. Such complementary investments are likely to be general rather than transaction specific. The paper examines three types of market organization: a search <b>market,</b> a <b>dealer</b> <b>market</b> and competition between a search <b>market</b> and a <b>dealer</b> <b>market.</b> In either the search <b>market</b> or the <b>dealer</b> <b>market,</b> there are incentives for inefficient under investment.

40|$|The {{conventional}} response {{given to}} explain {{the difference between an}} auction and <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> is that auction markets are order driven and <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> are quote driven. However this paper argues that same set of equilibrium prices will obtain in each market. In <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> liquidity is supplied by entry of any trader to supply liquidity by permitting the submission of limit orders.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of Nasdaq that {{includes}} the two ways in which marketmakers compete for order flow: quotes and direct payments.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{whether there is}} more {{informed}} trading in an anonymous market than in a non-anonymous market. It is widely believed that institutional traders prefer to trade in an anonymous environment, whereas market markers in a non-anonymous setting protect themselves by diverting informed trades to other trading venues. We conduct our analysis by using the unique institutional characteristics of the London Stock Exchange where an anonymous electronic order book market (SETS) operates alongside a non-anonymous voluntarily <b>dealer</b> <b>market.</b> We measure asymmetric information using metrics based on both trade flow (PIN) and priceimpact. Whereas PIN is equal on the markets, our evidence regarding the price impact of trades shows {{strong support for the}} ability of dealers to identify informed order flow. The permanent price impact of trades is significantly lower on the <b>Dealer</b> <b>market</b> than on SETS suggesting that informed traders do not benefit a lot from dealers. We also find that the <b>Dealer</b> <b>market</b> can compete effectively with SETS for uninformed order flow. Institutions also appear to prefer trading with dealers as most large trades are routed to the <b>Dealer</b> <b>market</b> and such sizes are not obtainable on SETS. Finally, we show that the temporary price impact of trades on the <b>Dealer</b> <b>market</b> is significantly larger than on SETS, indicating that liquidity for large trades, can be acquired on the <b>Dealer</b> <b>market,</b> but it comes at a considerable cost. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the nature and evolution of a dealer market for Nasdaq stocks. Despite size differences in sample stocks, there is a surprising consistency to their trading. One dealer tends to dominate trading in a stock. Markets are concentrated and spreads are increasing in the volume and market share of the dominant dealer. Entry and exit are ubiquitous. Exiting dealers are those with very low profits and trading volume. Entering market makers fail to capture a meaningful share of trading or profits. Thus, free entry does little to improve the competitive nature of the market as entering dealers have little impact. We find, however, that for small stocks, Nasdaq dealer market is being more competitive than the specialist market. <b>Dealer</b> <b>markets</b> are widely used for trading financial assets. In the U. S., bonds and foreign exchange trade almost exclusively in <b>dealer</b> <b>markets,</b> and equity trading on the Nasdaq dealer market, at least by some measures, is now greater than it is on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). There are more listed securities on the Nasdaq market than on the NYSE, and there are more initial public offerings (IPOs). 1 This latter fact reflects the particular importance that <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> have for smaller firms who, while occasionally switching to exchanges as mature firms, typically begin trading in a dealer setting. A defining feature of <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> is the price-setting competition of multiple marke...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn <b>dealer</b> <b>markets,</b> {{liquidity}} suppliers have entire {{flexibility to}} bargain {{on the price}} with their customers. In limit order markets, they are restricted to convex schedules: they cannot sell the first share at a higher price than the second.

In <b>dealer</b> <b>markets,</b> risk-sharing can be efficient, but spreads tend to be large. In limit order markets, the unique equilibrium entails efficient risk-sharing and competitive spreads. Hence there is a non-monotonic relation between {{the efficiency of the}} market {{and the extent to which}} the offers of the liquidity suppliers are restricted...|$|E
40|$|Competition for Order Flow as a Coordination Game Competition {{for order}} flow can be {{characterized}} as a coordination game with mul-tiple equilibria. Analyzing competition between <b>dealer</b> <b>markets</b> and a crossing net-work, we show that the crossing network is more stable for lower traders ’ disutilities from unexecuted orders. By introducing private information, we prove existence of a unique equilibrium with market consolidation. Assets with low volatility and large volumes are traded on crossing networks, others on <b>dealer</b> <b>markets.</b> Efficiency requires more assets to be traded on crossing networks. If traders ’ disutilities differ sufficiently, a unique equilibrium with market fragmentation exists. Low disutility traders use the crossing network while high disutility traders use the dealer market. The crossing network’s market share is inefficiently small. ...|$|E
