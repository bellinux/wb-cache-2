Thus, in a cross between two AaDd plants, 3/4 of the plants will be colorless, and the yellow and green phenotypes are expressed only in dd plants.

50|$|Under {{the same}} {{assumptions}} in additive and dominance QTL mapping of ICIM, an additive by additive <b>epistatic</b> <b>effect</b> between two interacting QTL can be completely {{absorbed by the}} four marker interaction variables between the two pairs of flanking markers 5. That is to say, the coefficients of four marker interactions of two pairs of flanking markers contain the genetic information of the additive by additive epistasis between the two marker intervals. As a consequence, a linear model of phenotype regressing on both markers and marker multiplications can fit the positions and effects of all QTL and their digenic interactions. Similar to the additive QTL mapping of ICIM, two-step strategy was also adopted in additive by additive epistasis mapping. In the first step, stepwise regression was applied to identify the most significant marker and marker interactions. In the second step, two-dimensional scanning was conducted for detecting additive by additive QTL and estimating the genetic effects, based on the phenotypic values adjusted by the regression model in the first step.|$|E
5000|$|Epistasis {{refers to}} genetic {{interactions}} {{in which the}} mutation of one gene masks the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus. Systematic analysis of these epistatic interactions can {{provide insight into the}} structure and function of genetic pathways. Examining the phenotypes resulting from pairs of mutations helps in understanding how the function of these genes intersects. Genetic interactions are generally classified as either Positive/Alleviating or Negative/Aggravating. Fitness epistasis (an interaction between non-allelic genes) is positive (in other words, diminishing, antagonistic or buffering) when a loss of function mutation of two given genes results in exceeding the fitness predicted from individual effects of deleterious mutations, and it is negative (that is, reinforcing, synergistic or aggravating) when it decreases fitness. Ryszard Korona and Lukas Jasnos showed that the <b>epistatic</b> <b>effect</b> is usually positive in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Usually, even in case of positive interactions double mutant has smaller fitness than single mutants.The positive interactions occur often when both genes lie within the same pathway [...] Conversely, negative interactions are characterized by an even stronger defect than would be expected in the case of two single mutations, and in the most extreme cases (synthetic sick/lethal) the double mutation is lethal. This aggravated phenotype arises when genes in compensatory pathways are both knocked out.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} causes for {{transgressive}} segregation in hybrids. One cause can {{be due to}} recombination of additive alleles. Recombination results in new pairs of alleles at two or more loci. These different pairs of alleles can give rise to new phenotypes since gene expression has been changed at these loci. Another cause can be elevated mutation rate. When mutation rates are high, it is more probable that a mutation will occur and cause an extreme phenotypic change. Reduced developmental stability is another cause for transgressive segregation. Developmental stability refers to the capability of a genotype {{to go through a}} constant development of a phenotype in a certain environmental setting. If there is a disturbance due to genetic or environmental factors, the genotype will be more sensitive to phenotypic changes. Another cause arises from the interaction between two alleles of two different genes, also known as the <b>epistatic</b> <b>effect.</b> Epistasis is the event when one allele at a locus prevents an allele at another locus to express its product as if it is masking its effect. Therefore, epistasis can be related to gene over dominance caused by heterozygosity at specific loci.2 What this means is that the heterozygote (hybrid) when compared to the homozygote (parent) is better adapted and therefore shows more transgressive, extreme phenotypes. All of these causes lead to the appearance of these extreme phenotypes and creates a hybrid species that will deviate away from the parent species niche and eventually create an individual [...] "hybrid" [...] species.|$|E

The seven traits investigated were grain length (GL), grain length to width ratio (LWR), chalk grain rate (CGR), chalkiness degree (CD), gelatinization temperature (GT), amylose content (AC) and gel consistency (GC) of head rice. Three mapping methods employed were composite interval mapping in QTLMapper 2. 0 software based on mixed linear model (MCIM), inclusive composite interval mapping in QTL IciMapping 3. 0 software based on stepwise regression linear model (ICIM) and multiple interval mapping with regression forward selection in Windows QTL Cartographer 2. 5 based on multiple regression analysis (MIMR). Results showed that five QTLs with additive effect (A-QTLs) were detected by all the three methods simultaneously, two by two methods simultaneously, and 23 by only one method. Five A-QTLs were detected by MCIM, nine by ICIM and 28 by MIMR. The contribution rates of single A-QTL ranged from 0. 89 % to 38. 07 %.

Moreover, an additional set of 37 hybrids were genotyped and phenotyped in an independent environment. The decomposition of the phenotypic variance components and the cross-validated results of the QTL mapping and genome-wide predictions revealed that the hybrid performance in rapeseed was driven by a mix of additive, dominance, and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects.</b> Interestingly, the genome-wide prediction accuracy in the additional 37 hybrids remained high when modeling exclusively additive effects but was severely reduced when dominance or <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects</b> were also included.

The grain weight heat susceptibility index [GWHSI = (grain weight at optimum temperature－grain weight at high temperature) / grain weight at optimum temperature× 100] was employed to evaluate the tolerance of rice to heat stress. A genetic linkage map with 245 RFLP markers and a mixed linear-model approach was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and their main effects, epistatic interactions and QTL×environment interactions (Q×E). The threshold of LOD score= 2. 0 was used to detect the significance of association between marker and trait. A total of 3 QTLs controlling heat tolerance during grain filling were detected, on chromosomes 1, 4 and 7, with LOD scores of 8. 16, 11. 08 and 12. 86, respectively, and they explained the phenotypic variance of 8. 94, 17. 25 and 13. 50 %, correspondingly.

Although a number of QTL mapping methods for binary traits have been developed, there still lacks an efficient and powerful method that can handle both main and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects</b> of a relatively large number of possible QTLs. 				 				 					 						Results 					In this paper, we use a Bayesian logistic regression model as the QTL model for binary traits that includes both main and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects.</b> Our logistic regression model employs hierarchical priors for regression coefficients similar to the ones used in the Bayesian LASSO linear model for multiple QTL mapping for continuous traits.

We made use of thousands of gene expression traits from linkage and eQTL studies, to compare the performance of different strategies. We found that using information from marginal associations between markers and phenotypes to detect <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects</b> yielded a lower false discovery rate (FDR) than a strategy solely using biological annotation in yeast, whereas results from human data were inconclusive. For future studies whose aim is to discover <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects,</b> we recommend incorporating information about marginal associations between SNPs and phenotypes instead of relying solely on biological annotation. Improved methods to discover <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects</b> will result in a more complete understanding of complex genetic effects...|$|R
40|$|Gene–gene {{interaction}} {{may play}} {{important roles in}} complex disease studies, in which interaction effects coupled with single-gene effects are active. Many interaction models have been proposed {{since the beginning of}} the last century. However, the existing approaches including statistical and data mining methods rarely consider genetic interaction models, which make the interaction results lack biological or genetic meaning. In this study, we developed an entropy-based method integrating two-locus genetic models to explore such interaction effects. We performed our method to simulated and real data for evaluation. Simulation results show that this method is effective to detect gene–gene interaction and, furthermore, it is able to identify the best-fit model from various interaction models. Moreover, our method, when applied to malaria data, successfully revealed negative <b>epistatic</b> <b>effect</b> between sickle cell anemia and a þ-thalassemia against malaria...|$|E
40|$|A {{link between}} myelin basic protein (MBP) {{polymorphism}} and multiple sclerosis (MS) {{has been reported}} in some populations but not in others. We analysed two polymorphisms in the 5 ′ flanking region of the MBP exon 1 gene in MS patients from the founder population of Sardinia. Using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), MBP polymorphisms were analysed in 363 singleton MS families. No distortion in transmission of the tetranucleotide repeat (ATGG) 12 and of the 1116 - 1540 nt alleles was found. Moreover, we discovered no <b>epistatic</b> <b>effect</b> of the MBP gene on the HLA/MHC DRB 1, DQB 1, DPB 1 loci or on alleles defined by D 6 S 1683 marker found to be associated with MS in Sardinians. We concluded that the MBP gene does not play a role in MS susceptibility in Sardinians...|$|E
40|$|The {{epistatic}} variance {{has been}} introduced by Davidor {{as a tool for}} the evaluation of interdependences between genes, thus possibly giving clues about the difficulty of optimizing functions with genetic algorithms (GAs). Despite its theoretical grounding in Walsh function analysis, several studies have shown its weakness as a predictor of GAs results. In this paper, we focus on binary search spaces and propose to measure <b>epistatic</b> <b>effect</b> on the level of individual genes, an approach that we call bit-wise epistasis. We give examples of this measure on several well-known test problems, then we take into account this supplementary information to improve the performances of evolutionary algorithms. We conclude by pointing towards possible extensions of this concept to real size problems. 1 Introduction An important issue tackled by epistasis studies, in genetic algorithms (GAs), is understanding and characterizing the difficulty to optimize functions. In other words, how well are epista [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The term {{epistasis}} {{refers to}} interactions between multiple genetic loci. Genetic epistasis {{is important in}} regulating biological function and is considered to explain part of the 'missing heritability,' which involves marginal genetic effects that cannot be accounted for in genome-wide association studies. Thus, the study of epistasis is {{of great interest to}} geneticists. However, estimating <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects</b> for quantitative traits is challenging due to the large number of interaction effects that must be estimated, thus significantly increasing computing demands. Here, we present a new web server-based tool, the Pipeline for estimating <b>EPIStatic</b> genetic <b>effects</b> (PEPIS), for analyzing polygenic <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects.</b> The PEPIS software package is based on a new linear mixed model that has been used to predict the performance of hybrid rice. The PEPIS includes two main sub-pipelines: the first for kinship matrix calculation, and the second for polygenic component analyses and genome scanning for main and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects.</b> To accommodate the demand for high-performance computation, the PEPIS utilizes C/C++ for mathematical matrix computing. In addition, the modules for kinship matrix calculations and main and epistatic-effect genome scanning employ parallel computing technology that effectively utilizes multiple computer nodes across our networked cluster, thus significantly improving the computational speed. For example, when analyzing the same immortalized F 2 rice population genotypic data examined in a previous study, the PEPIS returned identical results at each analysis step with the original prototype R code, but the computational time was reduced from more than one month to about five minutes. These advances will help overcome the bottleneck frequently encountered in genome wide <b>epistatic</b> genetic <b>effect</b> analysis and enable accommodation of the high computational demand. The PEPIS is publically available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{quantitative}} {{traits are}} controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL). The contribution of each locus may be negligible but the collective contribution of all loci is usually significant. Genome selection that uses markers of the entire genome to predict the genomic values of individual plants or animals can be more efficient than selection on phenotypic values and pedigree information alone for genetic improvement. When a quantitative trait is contributed by <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects,</b> using all markers (main effects) and marker pairs (<b>epistatic</b> <b>effects)</b> to predict the genomic values of plants can achieve the maximum efficiency for genetic improvement. Results In this study, we created 126 recombinant inbred lines of soybean and genotyped 80 makers across the genome. We applied the genome selection technique to predict the genomic value of somatic embryo number (a quantitative trait) for each line. Cross validation analysis showed that the squared correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted embryo numbers was 0. 33 when only main (additive) effects were used for prediction. When the interaction (<b>epistatic)</b> <b>effects</b> were {{also included in the}} model, the squared correlation coefficient reached 0. 78. Conclusions This study provided an excellent example for the application of genome selection to plant breeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Most complex {{traits of}} animals, plants, and humans are {{influenced}} by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Interactions among multiple genes play fundamental roles in the genetic control and evolution of complex traits. Statistical modeling of interaction effects in quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis must accommodate {{a very large number}} of potential genetic effects, which presents a major challenge to determining the genetic model with respect to the number of QTL, their positions, and their genetic effects. In this study, we use the methodology of Bayesian model and variable selection to develop strategies for identifying multiple QTL with complex epistatic patterns in experimental designs with two segregating genotypes. Specifically, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to determine the number of QTL and to select main and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects.</b> With the proposed method, we can jointly infer the genetic model of a complex trait and the associated genetic parameters, including the number, positions, and main and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects</b> of the identified QTL. Our method can map a large number of QTL with any combination of main and <b>epistatic</b> <b>effects.</b> Utility and flexibility of the method are demonstrated using both simulated data and a real data set. Sensitivity of posterior inference to prior specifications of the number and genetic effects of QTL is investigated...|$|R
