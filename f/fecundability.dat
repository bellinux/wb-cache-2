40|$|Effective <b>fecundability</b> {{is defined}} as the monthly {{probability}} for a conception that leads to a livebirth. One method of assessing effective <b>fecundability</b> is by examining lengths of first birth intervals. Using demographic records of marriage and birth, we examine the effects of maternal age, paternal age, mother’s education, and religion on effective <b>fecundability</b> in a rural region of Bangladesh. Data came from a prospective demographic and health survey conducted in Matlab thana by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Marriage and birth records from 1975 to 1982 were used to generate first birth intervals. A parametric hazards model of <b>fecundability</b> was used to simultaneously estimate primary sterility, effective <b>fecundability</b> as well as effects of fixed and time varying covariates on effective <b>fecundability.</b> Marriage records were matched for 10, 255 pairs of partners, including exact times to birth and observations right censored by death, divorce, migration, or the end of record-keeping. The age range at marriage for wives was 12 and 25 years. The prevalence of primary sterility was 5. 1 % (± 2. 6 % SE). The estimate of effective <b>fecundability</b> was 0. 053 (± 0. 002). The most parsimonious model showed reduced <b>fecundability</b> for women under 16 years and highest <b>fecundability</b> from 17 to 19 years, relative to the reference age group (20 to 25) years. <b>Fecundability</b> was significantly higher for father’s age 25 to 29 years relative to other ages. Religion and mother’s education were not associated with <b>fecundability.</b> The results suggest that Bangladeshi women have a higher prevalence of sterility and lower effective <b>fecundability</b> compared to other samples in developing settings...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fecundability</b> is {{regarded}} as one of the important parameters of fertility performance of the married women. Due to the complex nature of <b>fecundability,</b> we have attempted to estimate mean <b>fecundability</b> from the first conception interval. The first conception intervals have been obtained utilizing the data extracted from the 1999 - 2000 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey(BDHS). The purpose of the study is to estimate mean <b>fecundability</b> by various classical and non classical methods of estimation. Since the cohort of women is not homogeneous, we have attempted to estimate the mean natural <b>fecundability</b> from the Beta Distribution with parameters a and b. For the classical method, the parameters are estimated by the method of moments and method of maximum likelihood. For the non classical methods, standard, hierarchical, and empirical Bayes were used to estimate the mean <b>fecundability.</b> By using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey(1999 - 2000) Data, the mean conception delay of the Bangladeshi women has been found to be 21. 31 months after their first marriage and mean <b>fecundability</b> is 0. 04692. This mean <b>fecundability</b> is computed as the reciprocal of mean conception delay. The theoretical arithmetic mean fecundabilities were found to be 0. 058 and 0. 066 employing the method of moments and method of maximum likelihood. The standard Bayes estimate of <b>fecundability</b> is 0. 04696 while the Hierarchical and Empirical Bayes estimate of <b>fecundability</b> are 0. 04694 and 0. 04692. To compute the Hierarchical Bayes estimate, we used the Gibbs Sampler technique. In the case of Hierarchical Bayes method, we model the prior in terms of another random variable but in Empirical Bayes method, we estimate the parameter instead of attempting to model the parameter from the data. In this study, we have observed that the variation in mean <b>fecundability</b> is negligible whatever the methods of estimation be. Department of Mathematical SciencesThesis (M. A. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} {{described}} geographic variations in human <b>fecundability,</b> but this phenomenon has almost exclusively been studied {{at an international}} level rather than within a given country. Our aim was to describe geographic variations in <b>fecundability,</b> the monthly probability of pregnancy, between four cities of France. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in four French maternity units from Toulouse, Rennes, Lyons and Paris, among partners of pregnant women. Women were asked about the time to pregnancy (TTP) of their current pregnancy. TTP was analysed with a discrete Cox model allowing to estimate <b>fecundability</b> ratios (FR). RESULTS: Time to pregnancy was defined for 894 couples. There was no strong evidence of heterogeneity in <b>fecundability</b> between the four compared cities (p= 0. 05 without adjustment and p= 0. 25 after adjustment for behavioural and medical factors). The highest <b>fecundability</b> was observed in Rennes and the lowest in Toulouse (<b>fecundability</b> ratio (FR) = 1. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 63). Differences in <b>fecundability</b> were smaller between the other cities. CONCLUSION: We highlighted a possibly slightly higher <b>fecundability</b> in Rennes compared to Toulouse. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed. We note that the {{finding is consistent with}} previous observations indicating a higher sperm concentration among semen donors in Rennes than in Toulouse...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{convolution}} model of <b>fecundability,</b> controling {{for the effects}} of postpartum amenorrhea and unobserved heterogeneity in <b>fecundability.</b> Simulation analysis was used to assess the validity and reliability of estimates derived from the model. Analysis showed that the model captured the mean and standard deviation of age at the onset of sterility in simulated populations where sterility followed either a Gompertz, a gamma, or a lognormal distribution. The model performed well when sterility was specified by either a lognormal or a gamma distribution. The model also accurately estimated <b>fecundability</b> and postpartum amenorrhea. Next, the model was found to fit data from 17 th and 18 th century French Canadian birth histories. In this French Canadian sample the mean age at sterility was found to be 46. 3 years using a gamma model. The decline in <b>fecundability</b> was almost linear after age 30. Thus, <b>fecundability</b> at age 40 had declined to about one-third of that observed at age 30. Variability in individual <b>fecundability</b> was quite high. For example, women with <b>fecundability</b> one standard deviation above the mean had about 2. 3 times as high <b>fecundability</b> as women one standard deviation below the mean.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>fecundability</b> derives its {{importance}} {{for the study of}} human fertility {{from the fact that it}} is one of the principal determinants of fertility and is a major standard by which the impact of fertility regulation can be assessed; very few attempts have been made in Bangladesh for estimating <b>fecundability.</b> This study attempts to evaluate the levels, patterns, and trends of <b>fecundability</b> and identify the factors affecting <b>fecundability</b> in Bangladesh based on national surveys of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2007 - 1994. Total 9703 ever married women are included in the bivariate and multivariate analyses which reveal that age at first birth, age at marriage and marital duration play an important role in influencing marriage to first birth interval positively and thus <b>fecundability</b> negatively.

40|$|Background: Demographers, epidemiologists and clinicians {{have long}} been {{interested}} in the estimation of age-specific <b>fecundability.</b> With the progressive postponement of age at family formation in Western countries, this topic has recently {{become the focus of}} renewed attention. Methods: In order to correctly estimate the effect of biological ageing on <b>fecundability</b> it is crucial to collect detailed information through a rigorous study design and to apply suitable models for analysing time to pregnancy data. In this article we discuss some methodological problems concerning the study of <b>fecundability</b> and its dependence on biological ageing. We also present the Multinational Study in Daily <b>Fecundability</b> which has produced a very rich database with detailed behavioural and physiological information prospectively collected on every cycle. Finally, we review some results on age effects obtained from these data. Results: Our findings show that the decline in <b>fecundability</b> from age 28 to age 33 is not statistically significant and very modest. Conclusion: The results presented here {{do not appear to be}} particularly alarming with regard to the postponement of conception of the first child from age 28 to 33. This postponement could however lead to attempts to conceive a second child after age 35, when <b>fecundability</b> starts to decrease rapidly and when the risk of genetic disorders increases...|$|E

40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} (PA) {{may influence}} <b>fecundability</b> through alterations in endocrine function. The limited {{studies that have}} evaluated PA and <b>fecundability</b> in non-clinical populations have utilized internet-based recruitment, contain potential issues in measurement, and have yielded inconclusive results. Methods: We evaluated the association between PA and time-to-pregnancy in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial, which included 1228 women attempting pregnancy ages 18 – 40 with prior pregnancy loss. PA was measured at baseline using the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire to determine hours/week of activity (vigorous, moderate, and walking) and hours/day of sedentary (sitting) behavior. Pregnancy was assessed using urine hCG assays. Discrete time Cox models were used to estimate <b>fecundability</b> odds ratios (FORs) adjusted for marital status and parity, accounting for left truncation and right censoring. Results: We observed a positive association between <b>fecundability</b> and vigorous PA of ≥ 4 hrs/week vs. none (FOR= 1. 55, 95 % CI: 1. 17, 2. 07) adjusted for marital status and parity. In stratified multivariable models, this association was most pronounced among overweight/obese women reporting vigorous PA of ≥ 4 hrs/week compared to none (FOR= 2. 27, 1. 41, 3. 65); however, {{there was no significant}} effect modification. <b>Fecundability</b> was not associated with categorical measures of moderate PA, walking, or sitting. Conclusion: In this study, <b>fecundability</b> was positively associated with vigorous PA. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms to explain the relationship through which vigorous PA might affect time-to-pregnancy; however, such improvements in <b>fecundability</b> may be related to a reduction in ovulatory disorders...|$|E
40|$|Modelization of <b>fecundability</b> stepped {{recently}} from demography and population-based contexts to repro-ductive {{biology and}} treatment of infertility. This created a strong call for flexibility and robustness. Indeed, explained and unexplained heterogeneities are non-negligible sources of bias that result in false conclu-sions as to the determinants of fertility or to the success rates of reproductive techniques, among other examples. There are two main sources of heterogeneity: biological heterogeneity and heterogeneity of sexual behaviour. A uniform presentation of time-to-pregnancy and Barrett–Marshall models is proposed to enlighten their similarities and differences in modelling heterogeneity of <b>fecundability.</b> Mixed models for <b>fecundability</b> studies are presented as tools to allow for unexplained heterogeneity and to quantify heterogeneity {{of the effect of}} observed factors and variability of size of this unexplained heterogeneity between subpopulations. Some criteria for the modelling strategy in <b>fecundability</b> studies are suggested with emphasis on the unit-treatment additivity criterion. The strong and complex selection process result-ing from heterogeneity is described as well as the selection and cross-selection processes of observed and unobserved <b>fecundability</b> factors. Consequences regarding data collection and statistical inference are dis-cussed. In the current context, a consensus setting general rules for data collection and statistical analysis would be useful to compare the results and increase the reliability of these results in medical practice. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reports have {{suggested}} {{a decline in}} sperm concentration {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century. The effect of this decline on <b>fecundability</b> (the monthly probability of pregnancy) could be detected in principle by a study of time to pregnancy. In practice, the amplitude of this expected effect is not well known and the statistical power of time-to-pregnancy studies to detect it has not been explored. METHODS: We developed a nonparametric model to describe a temporal decline in sperm concentration using data on French semen donors. We then applied this model to 419 Danish couples planning a first pregnancy in 1992, to predict their time to pregnancy as if the pregnancy attempt had begun during earlier decades with higher sperm concentrations. Finally, we used bootstrap simulations to estimate the statistical power of prospective or retrospective studies that compared <b>fecundability</b> (estimated from time to pregnancy) across these time periods. We express the change in <b>fecundability</b> over time as a <b>fecundability</b> ratio (FR), with values less than 1 indicating decreased <b>fecundability.</b> RESULTS: We estimate that the median sperm concentration decreased by 21 % from 1977 to 1992 and by 47 % from 1947 to 1992. The estimated decline in <b>fecundability</b> with those semen changes was 7 % from 1977 to 1992 (FR = 0. 93, adjusted) and 15 % from 1947 to 1992 (FR = 0. 85, adjusted). The total numbers of couples that would be needed in prospective studies of time to pregnancy to detect these changes in <b>fecundability</b> (with a power of 80 %) were 12, 000 when comparing 1977 to 1992, and 2000 when comparing 1947 to 1992. Retrospective studies of the same size that excluded childless couples had much lower statistical power and were biased toward the null. CONCLUSION: The effect of realistic declines in sperm concentration on time to pregnancy may be observed only with studies that include several thousand couples...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Although {{pesticides}} {{are regularly}} used in agriculture, relatively {{little is known}} about possible adverse health effects, especially reproductive effects, due to occupational exposure. This explorative study investigates the relation between exposure of the fruit grower to pesticides and <b>fecundability</b> (probability of pregnancy) in a population of fruit growers. METHODS [...] The analysis is based on self reported data and includes 91 pregnancies during 1978 - 1990 of 43 couples. Cox' proportional hazards model was used to analyse time to pregnancy after correction for gravidity and consultation with a physician for fertility problems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS [...] Application of pesticides solely by the owner was associated with a long time to pregnancy, resulting in a <b>fecundability</b> ratio of 0. 46 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 28 - 0. 77). Similarly a low spraying velocity (< or = 1. 5 hectares/h) resulted in a <b>fecundability</b> ratio of 0. 47 (95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 76) and is {{associated with the use of}} older spraying techniques and tractors without a cabin. These factors were assumed to cause high exposure, which was confirmed by exposure measurements in the field. The effect of high exposure was mainly apparent if the couple had intended to become pregnant in the period from March-November (<b>fecundability</b> ratio 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 20 - 0. 92). This is the period in which pesticides are applied. Out of the spraying season the effect of a high exposure was absent (<b>fecundability</b> ratio 0. 82, 95 % CI 0. 33 - 2. 02).

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increase}} {{in the frequency of}} disorders of the male human reproductive organs has been described over recent decades. Neither its causes nor its consequences on fecundity, the ability of the couples to produce a live child, are clearly known. This lack of knowledge may partly be due to methodological difficulties specific to reproductive epidemiology. METHODS: We discuss the relevance and limits of some markers of the male aspects of human reproduction, focusing on semen parameters and <b>fecundability,</b> a measure of the probability of pregnancy. RESULTS: Semen parameters are associated with <b>fecundability,</b> although they have a relatively low sensitivity to detect couples with low <b>fecundability.</b> The study of semen parameters proved central to describe the influence of environmental factors on the male side of reproductive function. The main limitation of semen studies is low participation rates and the possible selection biases ensuing. <b>Fecundability</b> can be estimated by collecting waiting time to pregnancy. Its assessment in retrospective studies often excludes the least fecund, those couples remaining childless, which entails a bias and a decrease in statistical power. The prospective approach and an approach relying on the enrollment of a cross-sectional sample of the couples currently trying to obtain a pregnancy (current duration approach) do not have these limitations. Although it has never been used, the assessment of <b>fecundability</b> using the current duration approach is promising both for aetiologic research and monitoring. CONCLUSION: Most of the potential markers of male reproductive function are not assessed in the general population of France, {{with the exception of the}} incidence rate of testis cancer, which is currently increasing.

40|$|Postponing {{the start}} of childbearing raises the {{question}} of fertility postponed versus fertility foregone. One of the limitations of previous studies of 'How late can you wait?' is that any observed decline in the probability of conception with age could be due to a decline in <b>fecundability</b> with age or due to a decline in coital frequency with age or due to both factors. Using data from a multinational longitudinal study conducted to determine the daily probability of conception among healthy subjects, a discrete-time event history model with long-term survivors (sterile population) is used to study the relationship between age and <b>fecundability</b> for childless women, while controlling for the pattern of intercourse within a menstrual cycle. The findings suggest that women can wait until their early thirties to try for a first birth, providing that they are not already sterile, as the magnitude of the decline in <b>fecundability</b> is very modest and of little practical importance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{elucidate}} possible {{effects on}} <b>fecundability</b> from chemical, biological, and physical agents in laboratories, a retrospective study {{based on a}} questionnaire was conducted among female personnel who worked in Swedish biomedical research laboratories. Female personnel in non-laboratory departments were used as a reference group. The maximum number of women included in the analyses was 560.  This corresponded to 2519  menstrual cycles. These women had given birth at least once during the period 1990 - 4.  METHODS—Time to pregnancy was used to estimate the fecundability—that is, probability of conception of a clinically detectable pregnancy per cycle. The <b>fecundability</b> ratio (FR) between exposed and unexposed cycles was calculated with a discrete time analogue of the Cox's proportional-hazards model. The FR estimates below unity indicate subfecundity.  RESULTS—Work with organic solvents in general in laboratory work, gave a decreased adjusted <b>fecundability</b> ratio (FR) of 0. 79  (95 % confidence interval (95  % CI) 0. 68  to 0. 93).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND Over {{the past}} decades, the {{proportion}} of couples who resort to infertility treatment has tremendously increased, and fertility (the final number of children) sharply declined. We explored the roles of two potential causes of these trends: a temporal decline in the couples' <b>fecundability</b> and a postponement of age at initiation of pregnancy attempts. METHODS We conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation for the reproductive history of 100 000 women based on the fertility and socio-demographic characteristics of the 1968 birth cohort in France. Declines in <b>fecundability</b> of various amplitudes have been implemented, as well as increases {{in the distribution of}} age at initiation of pregnancy attempts. RESULTS A decline in <b>fecundability</b> by 15 % implied a decrease in fertility by 4 %, and an increase in {{the proportion of}} couples eligible for infertility treatments by 73 %. An increase in the mean age at initiation of first pregnancy attempt by 2. 5 years from 25 years entailed a decrease by 5 % in fertility and an increase by 32 % in the proportion of couples eligible for infertility treatments. CONCLUSION A relatively important decrease in <b>fecundability</b> and an increase by 2. 5 years in age at first pregnancy attempt are likely to have only a limited impact on fertility.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: People in {{developed}} countries are widely exposed to low levels of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Seafood is {{a major contributor to}} PCB exposure. Toxicity of those various pollutants to reproductive and endocrine functions raises questions about possible effects on fertility. We explored whether serum levels of these pollutants and seafood consumption were associated with the fertility of couples enrolled in a French birth cohort (PELAGIE). METHODS: Time-to-pregnancy was investigated in 3, 421 pregnant women by asking how many months they had taken to conceive. Levels of 14 organochlorine pesticides, 12 PCBs, and 10 PBDE compounds were measured in cord blood serum from a random subcohort (n = 394). Mercury concentrations measured in maternal hair were considered as a potential coexposure. <b>Fecundability</b> odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from multivariate discrete-time Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Shellfish consumption was associated with longer time-to-pregnancy (<b>fecundability</b> OR ≥twice/week vs. 0. 410 µg/L vs. < 0. 266 µg/L, <b>fecundability</b> OR = 0. 46 [0. 32 - 0. 66]). In multiple sensitivity analyses, reduced <b>fecundability</b> was most consistently associated with shellfish consumption, p,p'-DDE, total PCBs, PCB 153, and PCB 187. Models that simultaneously included multiple coexposure factors led to similar conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were robust in sensitivity analyses, including analysis restricted to primiparous women.

40|$|Fertility {{traits in}} humans are heritable, however, {{little is known}} about the genes that {{influence}} reproductive outcomes or the genetic variants that contribute to differences in these traits between individuals, particularly women. To address this gap in knowledge, we performed an unbiased genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping study to identify common regulatory (expression) single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs) in mid-secretory endometrium. We identified 423 cis-eQTLs for 132 genes that were significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 %. After pruning for strong LD (r 2 > 0. 95), we tested for associations between eSNPs and <b>fecundability</b> (the ability to get pregnant), measured as the length of the interval to pregnancy, in 117 women. Two eSNPs were associated with <b>fecundability</b> at a FDR of 5 %; both were in the HLA region and were eQTLs for the TAP 2 gene (P = 1. 3 x 10 - 4) and the HLA-F gene (P = 4. 0 x 10 - 4), respectively. The effects of these SNPs on <b>fecundability</b> were replicated in an independent sample. The two eSNPs reside within or near regulatory elements in decidualized human endometrial stromal cells. Our study integrating eQTL mapping in a primary tissue with association studies of a related phenotype revealed novel genes and associated alleles with independent effects on <b>fecundability,</b> and identified a central role for two HLA region genes in human implantation success...|$|E

Tests of heterogeneity in the <b>fecundability</b> data through goodness of fit tests of the geometric distribution are developed, along with a likelihood ratio test statistic and a score test statistic. Simulations show both are liberal, and empirical level of the likelihood ratio statistic is larger than that of the score test statistic. A power comparison shows that the likelihood ratio test has a power advantage. A bootstrap p-value procedure using the likelihood ratio statistic is proposed...|$|E

The hypothesis that acceptors of family planning have higher <b>fecundability</b> than non-acceptors has been widely accepted. On the other hand, methods of estimating <b>fecundability</b> (the probability of conception) indirectly from data on other measurable variables such as month of first conception, have not been investigated to see how close the estimates they provide come to the theoretical values. This study, utilizing computer simulation, is mainly concerned with the investigation of these two related problems.

40|$|Few tools {{exist in}} {{reproductive}} epidemiology for studying {{adverse effects on}} fertility. Data on time to pregnancy (the number of menstrual cycles required to conceive) {{can be used to}} estimate <b>fecundability</b> ratios, a sensitive endpoint for identifying factors associated with reduced fertility. Time-to-pregnancy data can be collected in detailed interviews. The accuracy of data collected on brief, self-administered questionnaires is not known. In a study of occupational exposures to dental assistants conducted in 1987 - 1988, 523 women provided time-to-pregnancy data both on a short, mailed questionnaire and in a detailed telephone interview. The correlation between the two measures was 0. 82. Assuming that the detailed data were accurate, reporting errors in data from the short form were distributed nondifferentially with respect to most covariates of interest in <b>fecundability</b> analyses. Simulation studies were conducted to estimate bias and loss of power from the misclassifteation. Bias was toward the null. Substantial power was lost in detecting weak exposures. However, exposures that reduce <b>fecundability</b> by 50 percent (equivalent to adding about three cycles to the median time to pregnancy) could still be detected with 80 percent power in samples o...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{influence}} of prenatal diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure on time to pregnancy or sec-ondary sex ratio in men. The authors evaluated these associations among men participating in the DES Combined Cohort Follow-up Study for whom exposure status was confirmed by medical record. In 2001, men provided data on their reproductive histories. Demographic, behavioral, and medical data were collected in 1994, 1997, and 2001. Cox’s proportional hazards models with frailty were used to estimate <b>fecundability</b> ratios for time to preg-nancy in relation to DES. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios for fathering a male birth in relation to DES. Models included potential confounders and accounted for multiple pregnancies contributed by each man. Overall, DES was not associated with a delay in time to pregnancy (<b>fecundability</b> ratio 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 86, 1. 06). The odds ratio for fathering a male birth was 0. 92 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 80, 1. 04) comparing the exposed with the unexposed. In conclusion, prenatal DES exposure was not associated with a significant decrease in either <b>fecundability</b> or secondary sex ratio. diethylstilbestrol; estrogens; fertility; males; reproduction; sex rati...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Female {{greenhouse}} workers, who {{constitute a}} major occupational group exposed to pesticides at childbearing age, were studied {{to measure the}} effects of pesticide exposure on time to pregnancy. METHODS: Data were collected through postal questionnaires with detailed questions on time to pregnancy, lifestyle factors (eg, smoking habits, coffee and alcohol consumption), and worktasks (eg, application of pesticides, re-entry activities, and workhours) of the respondents and their partners in a 6 -month period prior to conception {{of the most recent}} pregnancy. The relation between time to pregnancy and exposure to pesticides among 398 female greenhouse workers and 524 referents was studied in a Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The crude <b>fecundability</b> ratio for female greenhouse workers versus the reference group was 1. 18 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 03 - 1. 35], but correction for confounding changed the <b>fecundability</b> ratio to 1. 11 (95 % CI 0. 96 - 1. 29). An evaluation of specific biases for time-to-pregnancy studies showed that these results were biased by the reproductively unhealthy worker effect. Restricting the analyses to full-time workers or first pregnancies only resulted in an adjusted <b>fecundability</b> ratio of 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 67 - 1. 19) and 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 62 - 1. 32), respectively. Among the primigravidous greenhouse workers, an association was observed between prolonged time to pregnancy and gathering flowers (<b>fecundability</b> ratio 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 1. 19). CONCLUSIONS: This study may offer some evidence for the hypothesis of adverse effects of pesticide exposure on time to pregnancy, but {{more research is needed to}} elucidate these effects...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} found {{decreased}} <b>fecundability,</b> that is, the ability to conceive in a menstrual cycle, with increasing female age. To evaluate the effect of maternal age on waiting time to pregnancy, the authors reviewed hospital charts of all pregnant women attending prophylactic antenatal care at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, during 1972 – 1987. Only the first pregnancy of each woman and only planned pregnancies were included (n = 14, 754). The <b>fecundability</b> odds ratio (FR) was calculated as {{the odds of a}} conception in a menstrual cycle among the older women divided by the odds among women aged 15 – 24 years. The FR for women aged 25 – 29 years was 1. 12 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04, 1. 20), for women aged 30 – 34 years it was 1. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 01, 1. 30), and for women above 34 years the FR was 2. 44 (95 % CI: 1. 84, 3. 22) after adjustment for confounders. The increased <b>fecundability</b> with age is contrary to previous studies and may be explained by selection bias, as sterile women were not included. In addition, some very fertile young women who became pregnant by accident before efficient birth control methods were available and therefore were excluded from time to pregnancy studies may now use oral contraceptives until they plan a pregnancy later in life and are included.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{approach to}} the study of human reproduction involves construction of probability models for the number, sequence and timing of births to couples.

40|$|BACKGROUND: New {{biological}} {{markers of}} male fecundity {{are needed for}} use in large-scale epidemiological studies. We studied the association between male inhibin B and <b>fecundability.</b> METHODS: Four hundred and thirty Danish couples without previous reproductive experience were followed from termination of contraception until pregnancy or for a maximum of six menstrual cycles. At enrolment we obtained semen samples (n = 418) and blood samples to measure reproductive hormones, including inhibin B (n = 343). RESULTS: The <b>fecundability</b> odds ratio for an increment of male inhibin B by 1 log pg/ml was 1. 428 (95 % confidence interval 1. 022 - 1. 994), adjusted for factors influencing the crude estimate. Only inhibin B values below 100 pg/ml were strongly related to <b>fecundability.</b> We designed a receiver operating characteristic curve based on the 29 males with serum inhibin B <= 100 pg/ml. The area under the curve (AUC) for inhibin B was 0. 787 and the corresponding AUCs for sperm density and FSH were 0. 913 and 0. 800, respectively. CONCLUSION: Serum inhibin B may be a reliable marker of male fecundity for epidemiological research and may have some advantages over sperm density. Our findings {{do not support the}} replacement of sperm density by male inhibin B when obtaining sperm data is an option...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective A long-term, {{follow-up}} study comparing mild and severe forms of endometriosis and their <b>fecundability,</b> on 28 women diagnosed with endometriosis in adolescence. Methodology Twenty-eight patients were identified from a prospective cohort of 52 adolescents (ages 12 to 18 years) with operative diagnosis of endometriosis between July 1993 and December 1995. All patients presented with chronic pelvic pain unresponsive to conservative medical management. Diagnosis of pregnancy {{was made by}} sonographic identification of intrauterine pregnancy, positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin or pathological confirmation of products of conception. Patients were categorized as fertile or sub-fertile by having > 12 months of unprotected intercourse without conception. Follow-up was done for 8. 6 years. Results Staging of endometriosis was performed according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine standards. Stage I = 14. 3 %; Stage II = 39. 3 %; Stage III = 42. 8 %; Stage IV = 3. 6 %. <b>Fecundability</b> rates in each stage were statistically significant: Stage I (75 %), Stage II (55 %), Stage III (25 %), Stage IV (0 %) (p Conclusion In our cohort, even at the earliest point in the natural life cycle of endometriosis there is an inverse relationship between stage of disease at diagnosis and <b>fecundability.</b> </p...|$|E
