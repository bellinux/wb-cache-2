500|$|Away {{from its}} context as a song {{designed}} purely to {{bring attention to}} the Bengalis' cause, as Harrison himself described it, [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] has often been viewed by commentators as a rushed and underwhelming composition. Robert Rodriguez qualifies this opinion, however: [...] "As a single, the song was possibly not the most commercial of records, but as a call to service, it could scarcely have been improved upon." [...] "Bangla Desh"'s standing as rock music's first charity single is not overlooked, with Ian Inglis stating: [...] "'Bangla Desh' serves {{as a model for}} the charity singles that would become commonplace in the decades ahead, although, in this instance, the power of Harrison's song lies not in its assembly of famous performers but in its literal and absolute commitment." [...] On this point, Leng deems the song as having [...] "as much raw energy as anything [...] Plastic Ono Band ever offered". In The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes: [...] "Harrison's lyric and vocal were concise and powerful, a <b>direct</b> <b>call</b> for action in a specific crisis. As such, 'Bangla Desh' remains one of the most cogent social statements in music history." ...|$|E

[...] That afternoon, a group of local community leaders came to the hospital reporting that entire families were dying in their villages. [...] He ignored the usual bureaucratic protocols and placed a <b>direct</b> <b>call</b> to Dr. Sam Okware, Uganda's Commissioner of Community Health Services, who dispatched a team from the Uganda Virus Research Institute to take blood samples. [...] By the time the team arrived, Lukwiya had already set up an isolation ward for suspected Ebola cases, {{in line with the}} WHO guidelines. [...] The special ward was staffed by three physicians, five nurses and five nursing assistants, all volunteers. When a South African lab confirmed the Ebola outbreak on 15 October, and a WHO delegation arrived in Gulu, they were astonished at the efficiency of the operation.

"Yes, it is {{impossible}} to believe, till some day you see a ship not your own ship (that isn't so impressive), but some ship in company, blow up all of a sudden and plop under almost before you know what has happened to her. Then you begin to believe. Henceforth you go out for the work to see--what you can see, and you keep on at it with the conviction that some day you will die from something you have not seen. One envies the soldiers {{at the end of the}} day, wiping the sweat and blood from their faces, counting the dead fallen to their hands, looking at the devastated fields, the torn earth that seems to suffer and bleed with them. One does, really. The final brutality of it--the taste of primitive passion--the ferocious frankness of the blow struck with one's hand--the <b>direct</b> <b>call</b> and the straight response. Well, the sea gave you nothing of that, and seemed to pretend that there was nothing the matter with the world." ...|$|E
60|$|The second object, in {{this part}} of the plan, of the act of 1773, namely, that of {{inspection}} by the ministers of the crown, appears not to have been provided for, so as to draw the timely and productive attention of the state on the grievances of the people of India, and on the abuses of its government. By the Regulating Act, the ministers were enabled to inspect one part of the correspondence, that which was received in England, but not that which went outward. They might know something, but that very imperfectly and unsystematically, of the state of affairs; but they were neither authorized to advance nor to retard any measure taken by the Directors in consequence of that state: they were not provided even with sufficient means of knowing what any of these measures were. And this imperfect information, together with the want of a <b>direct</b> <b>call</b> to any specific duty, might have, in some degree, occasioned that remissness which rendered even the imperfect powers originally given by the act of 1773 the less efficient. This defect was in a great measure remedied by a subsequent act; but that act was not passed until the year 1780.|$|E

60|$|Of this feeling, then, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} forms: the first, the wish to exercise self-denial {{for the sake of}} self-discipline merely, a wish acted upon in the abandonment of things loved or desired, there being no <b>direct</b> <b>call</b> or purpose to be answered by so doing; and the second, the desire to honor or please some one else by the costliness of the sacrifice. The practice is, in the first case, either private or public; but most frequently, and perhaps most properly, private; while, in the latter case, the act is commonly, and with greatest advantage, public. Now, it cannot but at first appear futile to assert the expediency of self-denial for its own sake, when, for so many sakes, it is every day necessary to a far greater degree than any of us practise it. But I believe it is just because we do not enough acknowledge or contemplate it as a good in itself, that we are apt to fail in its duties when they become imperative, and to calculate, with some partiality, whether the good proposed to others measures or warrants the amount of grievance to ourselves, instead of accepting with gladness the opportunity of sacrifice as a personal advantage. Be this as it may, {{it is not necessary to}} insist upon the matter here; since there are always higher and more useful channels of self-sacrifice, for those who choose to practise it, than any connected with the arts.|$|E
60|$|I am {{authorized}} {{to say for}} Mr. Burke, that he considers that cause assigned for the outrage offered to him as ten times worse than the outrage itself. There is such a strange confusion of ideas on this subject, that {{it is far more}} difficult {{to understand the nature of}} the charge than to refute it when understood. Mr. Fox's friends were, it seems, seized with a sudden panic terror lest he should pass for a republican. I do not think they had any ground for this apprehension. But let us admit they had. What was there in the Quebec Bill, rather than in any other, which could subject him or them to that imputation? Nothing in a discussion of the French Constitutions which might arise on the Quebec Bill, could tend to make Mr. Fox pass for a republican, except he should take occasion to extol that state of things in France which affects to be a republic or a confederacy of republics. If such an encomium could make any unfavorable impression on the king's mind, surely his voluntary panegyrics on that event, not so much introduced as intruded into other debates, with which they had little relation, must have produced that effect with much more certainty and much greater force. The Quebec Bill, at worst, was only one of those opportunities carefully sought and industriously improved by himself. Mr. Sheridan had already brought forth a panegyric on the French system in a still higher strain, with full as little demand from the nature of the business before the House, in a speech too good to be speedily forgotten. Mr. Fox followed him without any <b>direct</b> <b>call</b> from the subject-matter, and upon the same ground. To canvass the merits of the French Constitution on the Quebec Bill could not draw forth any opinions which were not brought forward before, with no small ostentation, and with very little of necessity, or perhaps of propriety. What mode or what time of discussing the conduct of the French faction in England would not equally tend to kindle this enthusiasm, and afford those occasions for panegyric, which, far from shunning, Mr. Fox has always industriously sought? He himself said, very truly, in the debate, that no artifices were necessary to draw from him his opinions upon that subject. But to fall upon Mr. Burke for making an use, at worst not more irregular, of the same liberty, is tantamount to a plain declaration that the topic of Franco is tabooed or forbidden ground to Mr. Burke, and to Mr. Burke alone. But surely Mr. Fox is not a republican; and what should hinder him, when such a discussion came on, from clearing himself unequivocally (as his friends say he had done near a fortnight before) of all such imputations? Instead of being a disadvantage to him, he would have defeated all his enemies, and Mr. Burke, since he has thought proper to reckon him amongst them.|$|E
