Introduction: When we review the <b>dairy</b> <b>interests</b> of Kansas, noting the {{improved}} {{methods of the}} cheese factory, the skimming station and the creamery, and the increasing demand for milk in our cities, we turn naturally {{to the source of}} the raw material and inquire as to its permanence and whether it is equal to the demands made upon it. We all know that the cow, as a source of milk supply to the human race, is something of an abnormal creature, made possible only by a long and careful process of feeding, breeding, selection and milking, and that without due precautions she will gradually drift back to the natural conditions of giving only milk enough to supply the needs of her offspring. The possibility of not only maintaining the present high standard, but of further, and more rapid and wide spread improvement is clearly shown when we consider what has already been done under conditions less favorable than now exist. The Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire herds have become famous as milk producers, though many of the breeders of these cattle know little or nothing of the foundation principles of breeding, feeding and variation. They lacked the stimulus that has been given by the Babcock test and the invention of modern dairy machinery and methods. Knowledge was not so easily obtained as at present. There was no improved stock with which the early breeders could cross their common stock, for all cattle were wild originally. The dawn of the twentieth century certainly offers great encouragement to those who wish to continue the work so well begun...|$|E

Hayward, in collecting data concerning the history of butter, found it mentioned in the Vedas - written 2, 000 to 1, 400 B. C. Its importance at that time is uncertain but reports show that later its manufacture was practiced in countries which today have but few <b>dairy</b> <b>interests.</b> It has been used during the past for various purposes but probably never reached the importance commercially that it has at present. In addition to being a food, it was formerly used as an object for sacrifice in worship, a remedy for injuries to the skin, a hair dressing, an ointment for the body, an oil for lamps, and as an indication of wealth. It was not, however, until recent years that dairy farming and manufacture of butter took the important place that it now holds in agricultural science and practice. It was not until the establishment of agricultural schools and colleges that an effort was made to improve methods and product. The effort is now being made in all dairy sections and is due largely to the advance of agricultural science and the dissemination of knowledge through colleges, agricultural newspapers, bulletins and circulars. The present demand for butter as a food is such that it has proven profitable to increase the study of conditions affecting its quality and to improve methods in order that a better and more uniform product may be offered to the market and consumer. The demands of that market and its resulting classification of butter will enable a better understanding of the importance and position of dairy or farm butter on the American markets.

40|$|Inter{{national}} {{trade is}} one of the hot topics in dairy circles these days. Look at the record of key dairy issues at the national level last year. First it was humanitarian assistance to the for-mer Soviet Union, under which over $ 100 million worth of U. S. dairy products were shipped to the former Soviet republics last winter. During the spring, U. S. <b>dairy</b> <b>interests</b> successful-ly opposed increased imports of Goya cheese under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and stopped domestic price udercutting by imported Swiss cheese. Summer saw the conclusion of negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which would progressively open up trade in dairy products between the U. S. and Mexico. By last fall, commercial exports of U. S. dairy products under the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) began to reach levels that attracted widespread attention. Under the DEIP, contracts to commercially export about 2. 65 billion pounds (milk equivalent) of U. S. dairy products were signed during 1992. By winter, an agreement on agriculture reached between the U. S. and the European Community (EC) seemed to pave the way to wrap up the 6 -year-old Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). While the GATT negotiations are not moving as fast as was thought late last year, nevertheless an eventual GATT deal would bring further changes to the U. S. dairy industry, both in terms of additional imports as well as additional export opportunities. Involving such things as DEIP, GATT, NAFTA, GSP, GSM, and the EC, this may all appear more like alphabet soup than serious matters U. S. dairy farmers should pay attention to. But international trade has come to the U. S. dairy industry to stay, and it will have an increasing impact on all our bottom lines. In my comments, I want to focus on free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the Uruguay Round negotiations under GATT.

40|$|Hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging, hybrid process {{analytical}} technology, combining {{imaging and}} spectroscopic techniques for food quality monitoring and assessment. While this technique has recently proved popular for food quality assessment in {{the fruit and}} seafood industries, {{there are only a}} few reported applications of HSI in the <b>dairy</b> industry. The <b>interest</b> in HSI is due to its ability to process a considerable amount of spectral data over a spatial dimension. In this work we analysed three plants all making a specific valuable milk powder. However the milk powder produced by each plant is different and each plant has different key equipment types such as the dryer. It is hypothesised that there is a causal relationship here. In this paper, the potential application of HSI to discriminate between the milk powders produced at the three different plants is presented, specifically with respect to the prediction and monitoring of functional properties such as dispersibility and solubility. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on hyper-spectral data extracted from milk powder samples from the three plants. The results showed that the major discrimination between milk powders produced by the different factories occur in principal components (PC) 2 and 3, and not in the first PC as this component correlates to milk powder morphology. Furthermore, the potential of the HSI technique to classify the powder as either on or off-spec at close to real time speeds is explored. The current limitations of this process analytical technique and potential future developments involving HSI in the dairy industry are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} is {{the summary}} of the report "Marketing opportunities for dairy products from dam rearing systems" by Christine Bickelhaupt MSc, Dr. Ir. Cynthia Verwer (Louis Bolk Institute), Dr. Ir. Dianne Hofenk (Wageningen University). Organic farming systems aim not only for more sustainable farming practices than conventional ones, but also for better welfare of farm animals. Nevertheless, organic dairy cattle husbandry still shows many similarities with the conventional way of farming. These also include the fact that calves get separated from their mother {{as quickly as possible}} after birth for various reasons. Dam rearing systems were developed with the aim of better animal welfare by means of keeping the calves with their mother cows for a certain time and allow the calves to suckle their (foster) dam. This study investigated the marketing opportunities for dairy products from Dutch farms with a dam rearing system, since the extra effort of farmers on animal welfare is not valued at the moment by other stakeholders in the supply chain. A stakeholder analysis was undertaken that comprised dairy companies, certification bodies, a <b>dairy</b> farmers' <b>interest</b> group, farmers operating with dam rearing systems and retailers from the organic sector. A systematic qualitative approach was used with semi-structured interviews, and an online questionnaire for retailers. The data was coded for commonalities and differences in opinions, and identified per stakeholder group. Results reveal that there is no golden standard on dam rearing, which makes it difficult to determine the financial added value of these systems and how to put them on the market. Nevertheless, the added value of dam rearing systems is found in improvements on animal welfare for both calf and cow as well as with respect to the image of the marketable products. Another surplus of the dam rearing system is the farmers' voluntary extra effort on top of the required minimum standards for organic farming. Dam rearing systems improve the animals' performance, especially concerning the calves' development and growth, and decrease the farmers' workload. However, dam rearing systems can also have some disadvantages; the risk of direct disease transmission, the separation process between calf and cow and "losses" in saleable milk are current bottlenecks that need to be dealt with. Control is lost over both the cows' performance and the calves' milk consumption, and extra attention is required during the milking and with respect to the calves' health and nutritional status. Apart from that, adjustments need often {{to be made in the}} stable facilities, and more expertise and long-term experience about dam rearing systems is needed. With respect to the marketing, the small base of farmers operating with dam rearing systems does not allow for product marketing on a larger scale yet. Therefore, direct and regional marketing seem to be best suited, while children and mothers are considered to feel most attracted by products from such farming methods. Based on these results, recommendations are provided...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{coagulation}} and acidity {{traits are}} important factors {{to inform the}} cheesemaking process. Those traits have been deeply studied in bovine milk, whereas scarce information is available for buffalo milk. However, the <b>dairy</b> industry is <b>interested</b> in a method to determine milk coagulation and acidity features quickly and in a cost-effective manner, which {{could be provided by}} Fourier-transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential of FT-MIR to predict coagulation and acidity traits of Mediterranean buffalo milk. A total of 654 records from 36 herds located in central Italy with information on milk yield, somatic cell score, milk chemical composition, milk acidity [pH, titratable acidity (TA) ], and milk coagulation properties (rennet coagulation time, curd firming time, and curd firmness) were available for statistical analysis. Reference measures of milk acidity and coagulation properties were matched with milk spectral information, and FT-MIR prediction models were built using partial least squares regression. The data set was divided into a calibration set (75 %) and a validation set (25 %). The capacity of FT-MIR spectroscopy to correctly classify milk samples based on their renneting ability was evaluated by a canonical discriminant analysis. Average values for milk coagulation traits were 13. 32 min, 3. 24 min, and 39. 27 mm for rennet coagulation time, curd firming time, and curd firmness, respectively. Milk acidity traits averaged 6. 66 (pH) and 7. 22 Soxhlet-Henkel degrees/ 100 mL (TA). All milk coagulation and acidity traits, except for pH, had high variability (17 to 46 %). Prediction models of coagulation traits were moderately to scarcely accurate, whereas the coefficients of determination of external validation were 0. 76 and 0. 66 for pH and TA, respectively. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that information on milk coagulating ability is present in the MIR spectra, and the model correctly classified as noncoagulating the 91. 57 and 67. 86 % of milk samples in the calibration and validation sets, respectively. In conclusion, our results can be relevant to the dairy industry to classify buffalo milk samples before processing...|$|R
40|$|Background Antimicrobial use in {{livestock}} production {{is an important}} contemporary issue, which is of public interest worldwide. Antimicrobials are not freely available to Austrian farmers and can only be administered to livestock by veterinarians, or by farmers who are trained members of the Animal Health Service. Since 2015, veterinarians have been {{required by law to}} report antimicrobials dispensed to farmers for use in food-producing animals. The study presented here went further than the statutory framework, and collected data on antimicrobials dispensed to farmers and those administered by veterinarians. Methods Seventeen veterinary practices were enrolled in the study via convenience sampling. These veterinarians were asked to contact <b>interested</b> <b>dairy</b> farmers regarding participation in the study (respondent-driven sampling). Data were collected from veterinary practice software between 1 st October 2015 and 30 th September 2016. Electronic data (89. 4 %) were transferred via an online interface and paper records (10. 6 %) were entered by the authors. Antimicrobial treatments with respect to udder disease were analysed by number of defined daily doses per cow and year (nDDDvet/cow/year), based on the European Medicines Agency technical unit, Defined Daily Dose for animals (DDDvet). Descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse the results. Results Antimicrobial use data from a total of 248 dairy farms were collected during the study, 232 of these farms treated cows with antibiotics; dry cow therapy was excluded from the current analysis. The mean number of DDDvet/cow/year for the antimicrobial treatment of all udder disease was 1. 33 DDDvet/cow/year. Of these treatments, 0. 73 DDDvet/cow/year were classed as highest priority critically important antimicrobials (HPCIAs), according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. The Wilcoxon rank sum test determined a statistically significant difference between the median number of DDDvet/cow/year for acute and chronic mastitis treatment (W = 10, 734, p <  0. 001). The most commonly administered antimicrobial class for the treatment of acute mastitis was beta-lactams. Intramammary penicillin was used at a mean of 0. 63 DDDvet/cow/year, followed by the third generation cephalosporin, cefoperazone, (a HPCIA) at 0. 60 DDDvet/cow/year. Systemic antimicrobial treatments were used at a lower overall level than intramammary treatments for acute mastitis. Discussion This study demonstrated that Austrian dairy cows in the study population were treated with antimicrobial substances for udder diseases at a relatively low frequency, however, a substantial proportion of these treatments were with substances considered critically important for human health. While it is vital that sick cows are treated, reductions in the overall use of antimicrobials, and critically important substances in particular, are still possible...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the factors influencing dairy farmers´ decisions to invest in automated milking systems (AMS). The problem studied involves uncertainty, information and complexity for dairy farmers in specific decision contexts. The frame of reference in the thesis combines contingency theory and decision theory and is used in a qualitative analysis of a set interview with dairy farmers who have recently bought an AMS and salespersons from Delaval, one of the AMS suppliers. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop an understanding of the decision making processes of dairy farmers, and in particular to identify which types of factors influence the outcome of an investment decision in the technological development of a farm. The study uses Thompsons` (1967) theory about the structure that organizations develop to handle the input of information. Thus, interest is focused on how a farm business structure handles information in the AMS decision, investigating the differences in information with Delaval’s "feed first principle" system and Lely’s "free cow traffic" system. The results of the qualitative interviews with the dairy farmers who bought an AMS show that there are three important factors that influence the outcome: employees, suppliers and the owner. Results of the qualitative interviews with the salespersons show that the salespersons are aware of the factors that are important to the farmers. Of the three main factors influencing the outcome of the decision, the role of employees was particularly evident. An employee milking cows is perceived to require more resources than an AMS. Having employees is costly, so the <b>dairy</b> farmer is <b>interested</b> in developing his operation into a more cost-efficient operation. Lely’s free-feed system does not have a specific order in which cows have to proceed, but with Delaval’s feed first principle there are specific orders that must be followed. Thompson’s theory suggests that this will lead to differences in how the organizations are structured, whereas in the case of Delaval, the dairy farmer must contend with more information than he does in the case of Lely. The study concludes that farmers have different relations with the suppliers in the market, and that farmers believe in different milking systems. These factors influence the decisions made by farmers, which in turn effect change to the structure of organization. In the end, it comes down to a question of the system in which the farmer believes : either it will be necessary to handle more information in a more complex organization or handle less information in a less complex organization. Delaval’s salespersons are well aware of the factors that influence the farmer’s decision to invest in an AMS, but perhaps do not fully recognize why farmers choose the specific AMS system...|$|R
40|$|Enteric methane (CH 4) is {{produced}} {{as a result}} of microbial fermentation of feed components in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant livestock. Methane has no nutritional value for the animal and is predominately released into the environment through eructation and breath. Therefore, CH 4 not only represents a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming, but also an energy loss, making enteric CH 4 production one of the main targets of greenhouse gas mitigation practices for the dairy industry. Obviously, reduction of CH 4 emission could be achieved by simply reducing livestock numbers. However, the global demand for dairy products has been growing rapidly and is expected to further grow in the future. Therefore, it is critical to minimize environmental impact to produce high-quality dairy products. The overall aim of this PhD research was, therefore, to develop a proxy for CH 4 emission that can be measured in milk of dairy cows. There are currently a number of potentially effective dietary CH 4 mitigation practices available for the livestock sector. The results of Chapter 3 show that replacing fiber-rich grass silage with starch-rich corn silage in a common forage-based diet for dairy cattle offers an effective strategy to decrease enteric CH 4 production without negatively affecting dairy cow performance, although a critical level of starch in the diet seems to be needed. Little is known whether host genetics may influence the CH 4 emission response to changes in diet. Therefore, the interaction between host DGAT 1 K 232 A polymorphism with dietary linseed oil supplementation was evaluated in Chapter 7. The results of Chapter 7 indicate that DGAT 1 K 232 A polymorphism is associated with changes in milk composition, milk N efficiency, and diet metabolizability, but does not affect digestibility and enteric CH 4 emission, whereas linseed oil reduces CH 4 emission independent of the DGAT 1 K 232 A polymorphism. Accurate and repeatable measurements of CH 4 emission from individual dairy cows are required to assess the efficacy of possible mitigation strategies. There are several techniques to estimate or measure enteric CH 4 production of dairy cows, including climate respiration chambers, but none of these techniques are suitable for large scale precise and accurate measurements. Therefore, the potential of various metabolites in milk, including milk fatty acids (MFA), as a proxy (i. e., indicators or animal traits that are correlated with enteric CH 4 production) for CH 4 emission of <b>dairy</b> cows gained <b>interest.</b> Until recently, gas chromatography was the principal method used to determine the MFA profile, but this technique is unsuitable for routine analysis. This has led to the application of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for determination of the MFA profile. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the recent research that relates MFA with CH 4 emission, and discusses the opportunities and limitations of using FTIR to estimate, indirectly via MFA or directly, CH 4 emission of dairy cattle. The recent literature on the relationship between MFA and CH 4 emission gives inconsistent results. Where some studies found a clear and strong relation, other studies consider MFA to be unreliable predictors for CH 4 emitted by dairy cows. Even the studies that do find a clear relation between MFA and CH 4 emissions do not describe similar prediction models using the same MFA. These discrepancies can be the result of many factors, including dietary composition and lactation stage. Additionally, literature showed that the major advantages of using FTIR to predict CH 4 emission include its simplicity and potential practical application on a large scale. Disadvantages include the inability to predict important MFA for the prediction of CH 4 emission, and the moderate power of FTIR to directly predict CH 4 emission. The latter was also demonstrated in Chapter 9, in which the CH 4 prediction potential of MFA was compared with that of FTIR using data from 9 experiments (n = 218 individual cow observations) covering a broad range of roughage-based diets. The results indicate that MFA have a greater potential than FTIR spectra to estimate CH 4 emissions, and that both techniques have potential to predict CH 4 emission of dairy cows, but also limited current applicability in practice. Much focus has been placed on the relationship between MFA and CH 4 emission, but milk also contains other metabolites, such as volatile and non-volatile metabolites. Currently, milk volatile metabolites have been used for tracing animal feeding systems and milk non-volatile metabolites were shown {{to be related to the}} health status of cows. In Chapter 4, the relationship between CH 4 emission and both volatile and non-volatile metabolites was investigated, using data and milk samples obtained in the study described in Chapter 3. In general, the non-volatile metabolites were more closely related to CH 4 emissions than the volatile metabolites. More specifically, the results indicate that CH 4 intensity (g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk; FPCM) may be related to lactose synthesis and energy metabolism in the mammary gland, as reflected by the milk non-volatile metabolites uridine diphosphate-hexose B and citrate. Methane yield (g/kg dry matter intake) on the other hand, may be related to glucogenic nutrient supply, as reflected by the milk non-volatile acetone. Based on the metabolic interpretations of these relationships, it was hypothesized that the addition of both volatile and non-volatile metabolites in a prediction model with only MFA would enhance its predictive power and, thus, leads to a better proxy in milk for enteric CH 4 production of dairy cows. This was investigated in Chapter 5, again using data and milk samples described in Chapter 3. The results indicate that MFA alone have moderate to good potential to estimate CH 4 emission. Furthermore, including volatile metabolites (CH 4 intensity only) and non-volatile metabolites increases the CH 4 emission prediction potential. The work presented in Chapters 3, 4 and 5, was based upon a small range of diets (i. e., four roughage-based diets in which grass silage was replaced partly or fully by corn silage) of one experiment. Therefore, in Chapter 6, the relationship between CH 4 emission and the milk metabolome in dairy cattle was further quantified. Data (n = 123 individual cow observations) were used encompassing a large of roughage-based diets, with different qualities and proportions of grass, grass silage and corn silage. The results show that changes in individual milk metabolite concentrations can be related to the ruminal CH 4 production pathways. These relationships are most likely the result from changes in dietary composition that affect not only enteric CH 4 production, but also the profile of volatile and non-volatile metabolites in milk. Overall, the results indicate that both volatile and non-volatile metabolites in milk might provide useful information and increase our understanding of CH 4 emission of dairy cows. However, the development of CH 4 prediction models revealed that both volatile and non-volatile metabolites in milk hold little potential to predict CH 4 emissions despite the significant relationships found between individual non-volatile metabolites and CH 4 emissions. Additionally, combining MFA with milk volatile metabolites and non-volatile metabolites does not improve the CH 4 prediction potential relative to MFA alone. Hence, it is concluded that it is not worthwhile to determine the volatile and non-volatile metabolites in milk in order to estimate CH 4 emission of dairy cows. Overall, in comparison with FTIR, volatile and non-volatile metabolites, the MFA are the most accurate and precise proxy in milk for CH 4 emission of dairy cows. However, most of MFA-based models to predict CH 4 emission tend to be accurate only for the production system and the environmental conditions under which they were developed. In Chapter 8 it was demonstrated that previously developed MFA-based prediction equations did not predict CH 4 emission satisfactory of dairy cows with different DGAT 1 genotypes or fed diets with or without linseed oil. Therefore, the greatest shortcoming today of MFA-based CH 4 prediction models is their lack of robustness. Additionally, MFA have restricted practical application, meaning that most MFA retained in the current CH 4 prediction models cannot be determined routinely because of the use of gas chromatography. The MFA that can be determined with the use of infrared spectroscopy are however no promising predictors for CH 4 emission. Furthermore, MFA have only a moderate CH 4 prediction potential. This together suggests that it might not be the best option to focus in the future on MFA alone as a proxy for CH 4 emission of dairy cows.    The FTIR technique has a low to moderate CH 4 prediction potential. However, FTIR has a great potential for practical high throughput application, facilitating repeated measurements of the same cow potentially reducing random noise. Results of this thesis also demonstrated that FTIR spectra do not have the potential to detect differences in CH 4 emission between diets which are, in terms of forage level and quality, commonly fed in practice. Moreover, the robustness of FTIR spectra is currently unknown. Hence, it remains to be investigated whether FTIR spectra can predict CH 4 emissions from dairy cows housed under different conditions from those under which the FTIR-based prediction equations were developed. It is therefore concluded that the accuracy and precision to predict CH 4 emission using FTIR needs to increase, and the capacity of FTIR to evaluate the differences in CH 4 emission between dairy cows and different types of diets needs to improve, in order to actually be a valuable proxy for CH 4 emission of dairy cows...|$|R
