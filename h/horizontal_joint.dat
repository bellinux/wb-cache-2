6000|$|... § III. And it is {{just that}} it should be so seen, for it is the {{original}} of nearly all the rest. It is not the elaborate and more studied developement of a national style, but the great and sudden invention of one man, instantly forming a national style, and becoming the model for the imitation of every architect in Venice for upwards of a century. It was the determination of this one fact which occupied me the greater part of the time I spent in Venice. It had always appeared to me most strange that there should be in no part of the city any incipient or imperfect types of the form of the Ducal Palace; it was difficult to believe that so mighty a building had been the conception of one man, not only in disposition and detail, but in style; and yet impossible, had it been otherwise, but that some early examples of approximate Gothic form must exist. There is not one. The palaces built between the final cessation of the Byzantine style, about 1300, and the date of the Ducal Palace (1320-1350), are all completely distinct in character, so distinct that I at first intended the account of them to form a separate section of this volume; and there is literally no transitional form between them and the perfection of the Ducal Palace. Every Gothic building in Venice which resembles the latter is a copy of it. I do not mean that there was no Gothic in Venice before the Ducal Palace, but that the mode of its application to domestic architecture had not been determined. The real root of the Ducal Palace is the apse of the church of the Frari. The traceries of that apse, though earlier and ruder in workmanship, are nearly the same in mouldings, and precisely the same in treatment (especially in the placing of the lions' heads), as those of the great Ducal Arcade; and the originality of thought in the architect of the Ducal Palace consists in his having adapted those traceries, in a more highly developed and finished form, to civil uses. In the apse of the church they form narrow and tall window lights, somewhat more massive than those of Northern Gothic, but similar in application: the thing to be done was to adapt these traceries to the forms of domestic building necessitated by national usage. The early palaces consisted, as we have seen, of arcades sustaining walls faced with marble, rather broad and long than elevated. This form was kept for the Ducal Palace; but instead of round arches from shaft to shaft, the Frari traceries were substituted, with two essential modifications. Besides being enormously increased in scale and thickness, that they might better bear the superincumbent weight, the quatrefoil, which in the Frari windows is above the arch, as at a, Fig. XXI., on previous page, was, in the Ducal Palace, put between the arches, as at b; the main reason for this alteration being that the bearing power of the arches, which was now to be trusted with the weight of a wall forty feet high,[75] was thus thrown between the quatrefoils, instead of under them, and thereby applied at far better advantage. And, in the second place, the joints of the masonry were changed. In the Frari (as often also in St. John and St. Paul's) the tracery is formed of two simple cross bars or slabs of stone, pierced into the requisite forms, and separated by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint,</b> just on a level with the lowest cusp of the quatrefoils, as seen in Fig. XXI., a. But at the Ducal Palace the <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> is in the centre of the quatrefoils, and two others are introduced beneath it at right angles to the run of the mouldings, as seen in Fig. XXI., b.[76] The Ducal Palace builder was sternly resolute in carrying out this rule of masonry. In the traceries of the large upper windows, where the cusps are cut through as in the quatrefoil Fig. XXII., the lower cusp is left partly solid, as at a, merely that the joint a b may have its right place and direction.|$|E

50|$|Because the masonry veneer is non-structural, {{it must be}} {{tied back}} to the {{building}} structure to prevent movement under wind and earthquake loads.

Brick ties are used for this purpose, and may {{take the form of}} corrugated metal straps nailed or screwed to the structural framing, or as wire extensions to <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> reinforcement in a fully masonry veneer system. Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, shelf angles are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame. In multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a curtain wall.|$|E

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{analysis on}} 58 beam-column joint specimens has been conducted. The analysis considered 14 fundamental parameters {{in the design}} of each specimen and two performance indicators: the horizontal shear strength ratio between the maximum measured strength and the theoretical strength at beam yield, and the nominal curvature ductility of the adjacent beams. Each parameter was varied by a power function, while the linear correlation coefficient between each parameter and performance indicator was recorded. A combined multiple parameter analysis was then conducted to show the interaction of the design parameters and show the representative influences of each parameter based on the magnitude of the applied power functions. Two design equations were constructed from the most influential design parameters, one for each performance indicator. The shear strength ratio was found to be governed by the <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> shear stress, the column axial stress and the yield strength of the longitudinal beam reinforcement. The available curvature ductility of the adjacent beams was also found to be governed by the <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> shear stress, the column axial stress and the yield strength of the longitudinal beam reinforcement, but also the quantity of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> shear reinforcement. The influence of the column axial stress on both performance indicators was found to be best represented by a quadratic function. This was because the column axial stress was found to be beneficial up to stress levels of, but axial stress levels exceeding were found to be detrimental to the performance of the beam-column joint, compared to a joint with no axial stress on the columns. The non-linear relationship of the column axial stress agreed with the design assumptions in NZS 3101 for low axial stress values, but at higher axial stress values NZS 3101 assumes a continued performance increase as a result of increasing axial stress, which {{has been found to be}} un-conservative. Additionally, an interaction between the column axial stress and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> shear stress has been identified. As a result, beam-column joints with high column axial stress levels above 0. 40 and <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> shear stress levels in the order of have been shown to fail in a brittle crushing of the concrete in the joint core. Considering this behaviour, it is recommended that the column axial stress levels in earthquake designed beam-column joints should not exceed 0. 35. The results of the parametric analysis were then compared against the current NZS 3101 design equations for conservatism. It was found that a reduction in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>joint</b> shear reinforcement may be possible for beam-column joints incorporating Grade 300 steel in the longitudinal reinforcement of the beams and axial stress levels below 0. 25, but when Grade 500 steel is used or the column axial stress is greater than 0. 25, an increase in the joint shear reinforcement is required compared to NZS 3101. The current NZS 3101 design requirement of at least 40 % of the joint shear force, to be resisted by means of joint shear reinforcement, has been found to be appropriate...|$|E

It was first in 1968, after a gas explosion in a 22 story building, Ronan Point, London that led to a progressive collapse that made the world aware of this problem and that it needed to be addressed. The event made that certain standards was implemented in several countries to decrease the risk of progressive collapse. The standards for progressive collapse arrived in Sweden 1972. In Sweden there is two standards that concerns dimensioning about progressive collapse, which are 1991 - 1 - 7 and 1992 - 1 - 1. Although the standards are hard to interpret and design engineers have had to draw their own conclusions.
