5|$|Round two {{started with}} two fighters {{throwing}} strikes with St-Pierre landing a punch drawing blood from Penn's nose. St-Pierre then clinched up and tripped Penn to the <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> Penn attempted to defend using the rubber guard, but St-Pierre passed to half-guard and eventually side-control while landing punches. The two continued grappling with Penn taking several ground-and-pound punches from St-Pierre until the round ended.|$|E

5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Juventus {{returned}} {{to play in}} the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old <b>ground,</b> <b>there</b> is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} the Grand Palace {{followed}} that of the Royal Palace at Ayutthaya in location, organization, and in the divisions of separate courts, walls, gates and forts. Both palaces featured a proximity to the river. The location of a pavilion serving as a landing stage for barge processions also corresponded {{with that of the}} old palace. To the north of the Grand Palace there is a large field, the Thung Phra Men (now called Sanam Luang), which is used as an open space for royal ceremonies and as a parade <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> was also a similar field in Ayutthaya, which was used for the same purpose. The road running north leads to the Front Palace, the residence of the Second King of Siam.|$|E
5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the <b>ground.</b> <b>There</b> were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
