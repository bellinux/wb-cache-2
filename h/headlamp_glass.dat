5000|$|The European (E-spec) and Asian (JDM) models {{had many}} {{differences}} versus the North American (A-spec) models. These include: raised turn signal side markers vs the A-Spec flush mounted side markers, small fog lights with silver bezels vs the A-Spec full fitting fog lights, different interior cloth patterns, projector <b>headlamps</b> (<b>glass</b> lenses), a 1.8-liter FP engine, and a hatchback model. Europe {{also received a}} diesel-engined version, using the [...] "Comprex" [...] pressure-wave supercharged RF engine seen in the previous generation JDM Capella. Power in Europe is [...] ECE at 4000 rpm, while the Japanese model claims [...] JIS at the same engine speed.|$|R

2500|$|Citroën SM non-US market {{vehicles}} were equipped with heating of the <b>headlamp</b> cover <b>glasses,</b> this heat supplied by ducts carrying warm {{air from the}} radiator exhaust to {{the space between the}} headlamp lenses and the cover glasses. This provided demisting/defogging of the entire interior of the cover glasses, keeping the glass clear of mist/fog over the entire surface. The glasses have thin stripes on their surfaces that are heated by the headlight beams; however, the ducted warm air provides demisting when the headlamps are not turned on. The glasses' stripes on both D and SM cars appear similar to rear windshield glass electric defogger heating strips, but they are passive, not electrified ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 14) This {{study examined}} the effect that hydrophobic treatment of <b>glass</b> <b>headlamp</b> lenses has on light output when headlamps are exposed to contaminants under naturalistic driving conditions. The hypothesis, a priori, was that the water-repelling nature of a glass surface after hydrophobic treatment would aid in minimizing the adhesion, or promote the removal, of contaminants on the lens, thereby leaving light output less affected. Additional variables of interest included the presence of precipitation, {{the side of the}} vehicle the headlamp was on, and whether the headlamp was illuminated during the exposure. The study examined vehicles with glass lenses installed as intended by the vehicle manufacturer. The vehicles were driven on a 155 -km route under conditions of active precipitation or no precipitation, and with or without the headlamps on. Subsequent to each drive, measurements of light output were made at eight key test points in the headlamp beam pattern. The headlamps were then cleaned and measured again. In this way, each headlamp served as its own control. The results indicate that hydrophobic treatment of <b>glass</b> <b>headlamp</b> lenses did not affect light output. However, the presence of precipitation did result in decreased light output below the horizontal cutoff of the beam pattern and increased light output above the horizontal cutoff. This result was especially evident above the horizontal cutoff when the headlamps had been illuminated. The side of the vehicle the headlamp was on did not affect light output...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{headlamp}} lenses reduce {{weight and}} reduce lens breakage, which can improve nighttime visibility and safety plastics autos Plastic headlamp lenses reduce weight and reduce lens breakage, which can improve nighttime visibility and safety Over the last decade, automobile manufacturers {{have focused on}} vehicle lighting improvements {{as a way to}} improve vehicle safety, as more than 60 % of all traffic accidents took place in poorly lit conditions during that time period. 1 The use of plastic in headlamp applications enables automakers to reduce weight without sacrificing optical performance while increasing resistance to breakage. 2 <b>Glass</b> <b>headlamp</b> lenses began to be replaced with polycarbonate ones in the 1980 s. 3 Today...|$|R
40|$|Refractive {{index and}} metal ion {{concentrations}} (Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Sr, Ti and Zr) were determined for four product-use categories: <b>headlamp</b> glass; container <b>glass,</b> non-vehicle window float glass, and vehicle float glass. Linear discriminant modelling using these data allowed differentiation {{of the four}} glass types but further discrimination was not possible within a product-use category. For this specific set of glasses, the concentrations {{of a number of}} metal ions were found to be correlated in some cases. This precluded the use of traditional probability calculations in using elemental composition data for interpretation of glass evidence. Alternative approaches to glass data interpretation are suggested...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Vauxhall {{acknowledged}} that their rather dull model range needed a makeover, {{and developed a}} radical version of the Firenza, known officially as the High Performance (HP) Firenza, but known colloquially as the [...] "droopsnoot" [...] after its dramatically styled aerodynamic nose. The nose was moulded from GRP, and featured two pairs of Cibié <b>headlamps</b> behind toughened <b>glass</b> covers. The overall look was somewhat reminiscent of the Renault Alpine A310, and used the same headlamp units. Several prototypes of the HP Firenza were considered with different types of front end treatment, requiring different degrees of change from the standard production front end, including cars known as Black Knight and Daytona, the latter for its resemblance to the Ferrari Daytona, a favourite of Wayne Cherry.|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, {{the front}} of the Dakota {{received}} a new grille and hood which extended the engine compartment to better fit the optional [...] 5.2 L V8, which was inspired by the earlier Shelby Dakota V8 option. By 1992, the standard square sealed-beam <b>glass</b> <b>headlamps</b> were phased out for the aerodynamic-style molded plastic headlamps attached to the grill components. It was equipped with halogen lights, making 1991 the only year for a unique front-end for the Dakota, though it is mechanically possible to fit sealed beams on 1992 to 1996 model years, as this model year was an overlap between new grille introduction and new headlamp introduction. Also debuting in 1991 were six-bolt wheels (replacing the earlier five-bolt wheels) based on Dodge's marketing attempting to differentiate the Dakota from competing manufacturers' trucks and the upcoming introduction of the redesigned Ram, and 1991 was also the first year for an optional driver-side airbag (made standard in 1994) and the last year for the Dakota convertible.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear <b>glass</b> <b>headlamp</b> covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) - the overriders have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|R
