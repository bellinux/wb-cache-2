In future, it would be of great interest also to simulate the injection bonding process. The planned flow paths could be validated at an early stage, with adherend geometries being adapted even before the first prototypes are produced.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{gustatory}} {{system provides}} vital sensory information to determine feeding and appetitive learning behaviors. Very little is known, however, about higher-order gustatory circuits {{in the highly}} tractable model for neurobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report second-order sweet gustatory projection neurons (sGPNs) in the Drosophila brain using a powerful behavioral screen. Silencing neuronal activity reduces appetitive behaviors, whereas inducible activation results in food acceptance via proboscis extensions. sGPNs show functional connectivity with Gr 5 a+ sweet taste neurons and are activated upon sucrose application to the labellum. By tracing sGPN axons, we identify the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) as an <b>immediate</b> higher-order <b>processing</b> center for sweet taste. Interestingly, starvation increases sucrose sensitivity of the sGPNs in the AMMC, suggesting that hunger modulates the responsiveness of the secondary sweet taste relay. Together, our results provide a foundation for studying gustatory processing and its modulation by the internal nutrient state...|$|R

30|$|In {{this article}} we report the {{synthesis}} of Na 2 O nanotip clusters using femtosecond laser irradiation of soda-lime glass. Laser irradiation focused inside soda-lime silicates has been suggested to cause the precipitation of Na nanoparticles [31].

The ultrafast laser technique used in this work results in <b>immediate</b> nanotip <b>processing</b> and requires no surfactant, catalyst, nor pressure chamber. The definitive goal for fabricators is the ability to control growth, geometry, and size of the nanostructures.

40|$|Behavioral {{research}} {{has led to}} the view that items in short-term memory can be parsed into two categories: a single item in the focus of attention that is available for <b>immediate</b> cognitive <b>processing</b> and a small set of other items that are in a heightened state of activation but require retrieval for further use. We examined this distinction by using an item-recognition task. The results show that the item in the focus of attention is represented by increased activation in inferior temporal representational cortices relative to other information in short-term memory. Functional connectivity analyses suggest that activation of these inferior temporal regions is maintained via frontal- and posterior-parietal contributions. By contrast, other items in short-term memory demand retrieval mechanisms that are represented by increased activation in the medial temporal lobe and left mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These results show that there are two distinctly different sorts of access to information in short-term memory, and that access by retrieval operations makes use of neural machinery similar to that used in long-term memory retrieval...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most neuroimaging studies {{investigating}} {{sexual arousal}} in paedophilia used erotic pictures {{together with a}} blocked fMRI design and long stimulus presentation time. While this approach allows the detection of sexual arousal, it does not enable {{the assessment of the}} <b>immediate</b> <b>processing</b> of erotically salient stimuli. Our study aimed to identify neuronal networks related to the <b>immediate</b> <b>processing</b> of erotic stimuli in heterosexual male paedophiles and healthy age-matched controls. METHODS: We presented erotic pictures of prepubescent children and adults in an event related fMRI-design to eight paedophilic subjects and age-matched controls. RESULTS: Erotic pictures of females elicited more activation in the right temporal lobe, the right parietal lobe and both occipital lobes and erotic pictures of children activated the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both groups. An interaction of sex, age and group was present in the right anteriolateral oribitofrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our event related study design confirmed that erotic pictures activate some of the brain regions already known {{to be involved in the}} processing of erotic pictures when these are presented in blocks. In addition, it revealed that erotic pictures of prepubescent children activate brain regions critical for choosing response strategies in both groups, and that erotically salient stimuli selectively activate a brain region in paedophilic subjects that had previously been attributed to reward and punishment, and that had been shown to be implicated in the suppression of erotic response and deception...|$|E
40|$|Spoken {{words are}} highly variable. A single word {{may never be}} uttered the same way twice. As listeners, we {{regularly}} encounter speakers of different ages, genders, and accents, {{increasing the amount of}} variation we face. How listeners understand spoken words as quickly and adeptly as they do despite this variation remains an issue central to linguistic theory. We propose that learned acoustic patterns are mapped simultaneously to linguistic representations and to social representations. In doing so, we illuminate a paradox that results in the literature from, we argue, the focus on representations and the peripheral treatment of word-level phonetic variation. We consider phonetic variation more fully and highlight a growing body of work that is problematic for current theory: Words with different pronunciation variants are recognized equally well in <b>immediate</b> <b>processing</b> tasks, while an atypical, infrequent, but socially-idealized form is remembered better in the long-term. We suggest that the perception of spoken words is socially-weighted, resulting in sparse, but high-resolution clusters of socially-idealized episodes that are robust in <b>immediate</b> <b>processing</b> and are more strongly encoded, predicting memory inequality. Our proposal includes a dual-route approach to speech perception in which listeners map acoustic patterns in speech to linguistic and social representations in tandem. This approach makes novel predictions about the extraction of information from the speech signal, and provides a framework with which we can ask new questions. We propose that language comprehension, broadly, results from the integration of both linguistic and social information...|$|E

In Experiments 2 through 4, performance was virtually identical to Asian and White faces in match-to-sample, immediate recognition.
