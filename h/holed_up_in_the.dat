5|$|In 2011, a two chapter {{spin-off}} manga titled Battle Royale: Angels' Border {{was drawn}} by Mioko Ohnishi and Youhei Oguma (each drawing one chapter). It {{focuses on the}} six girls who <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse, was published in Young Champion and later combined into one tankōbon volume on January 20, 2012. The single volume was published in North America by Viz Media on June 17, 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November the commandos gave {{control of}} Flushing to the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and {{prepared}} to move by sea to support {{the rest of the}} brigade at Westkapelle. Before they could disembark, weather conditions deteriorated and they were forced to march around the coast to reach brigade headquarters at Zoutelande. Lack of supplies curtailed their involvement in the battle for the next two days. Supplies eventually caught up with them and on 6 November they prepared to continue. By now intelligence from Dutch residents and prisoners had revealed that the remaining Germans were <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wooded area between Domburg and Vrouwenpolder.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore {{begins with a}} black and white {{flashback}} to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit.|$|E

5|$|De Montfort {{was unable}} to {{consolidate}} his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country. In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England {{with the support of}} Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army. Edward pursued de Montfort's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself. De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, {{was unable to}} retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued. Edward was triumphant and de Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors; Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety. In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266. The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Ely, surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|In June 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi {{ordered an}} attack on Sikh separatists {{belonging}} to the Khalistan movement who had <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Golden Temple in Amritsar. The operation resulted in 500-1,500 civilian deaths and heavy damage to the Akal Takht.|$|E
25|$|During the afternoon, rebels {{pulled back}} from an area near Green Square, in what they claim was a plan to launch a coordinated {{offensive}} elsewhere. Rebel forces in Tajura said they were negotiating with loyalist forces, <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local hospital, to surrender.|$|E
5000|$|Battle Royale: Angels' Border {{is written}} by Koushun Takami and {{illustrated}} by Mioko Ohnishi and Youhei Oguma. Set within {{the continuity of the}} original Battle Royale novel, it contains two side stories about <b>the</b> girls that <b>hole</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse. The first episode follows {{the point of view of}} Haruka Tanizawa. The second one is devoted to Chisato Matsui and Shinji Mimura.|$|R
50|$|Sanderson plays Kane, a hate-fuelled racist redneck who absconds {{from jail}} with his sidekicks (an Asian and a Mexican).

25|$|Geoffrey Rush as the Marquis de Sade, the flamboyantly {{outrageous}} Marquis {{refuses to}} conform to the moral standards of the day, making an enemy of Emperor Napoléon I Bonaparte with his scandalous pornography and political commentary. Director Philip Kaufman encouraged Rush to portray the Marquis as something of a dissolute rock star <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ritz Carlton. Rush used Francine du Plessix Gray's 1998 biography At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life as a reference and had previously acted in a production of Marat/Sade.|$|E
25|$|With the Chinese army greatly weakened, the Burmese then {{launched}} their offensive. First, Ne Myo Sithu easily retook the lightly held Bhamo. The main Chinese army was now totally <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kaungton-Bhamo corridor, {{cut off from}} all supplies. The Burmese then proceeded to attack the main Chinese army from two sides Balamindin's army out of Kaungton fortress, and Ne Myo Sithu's army from the north. The Chinese retreated eastwards and then northwards where another Burmese army led by Maha Thiha Thura was waiting. The two other Burmese armies also followed up, and the Chinese army was destroyed entirely. Maha Sithu's army which had been guarding the western flank of the Irrawaddy, then marched north of Myitkyina and defeated other lightly held Chinese garrisons at the border. The Burmese armies proceeded to occupy eight Chinese Shan States within Yunnan.|$|E
25|$|At 03:00 on October 26, around 1,000 {{troops in}} 4 {{companies}} from PLA Regiment 246 and the 85th division landed on Kinmen to reinforce PLA forces {{already on the}} island landing again at Huwei and Guningtou. At dawn, Regiment 246 managed to break through ROC forces surrounding the village of Guningtou, making a rendezvous with the surviving PLA troops <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town. At 06:30, the ROC 118th division launched a counterattack along the northern coast on PLA forces in Guningtou at Lincuo. The resulting battle was extremely bloody and soon turned into urban warfare {{in the streets and}} alleyways of Guningtou. With air support from American-made B-26 and B-25 bombers of the ROC Air Force, ROC forces eventually prevailed, taking Lincuo by noon and Nanshan (南山) at 3PM. Surviving PLA forces began falling back to the coast.|$|E

50|$|Rick's friend Brian (Emilio Linder) {{and uncle}} Bill go {{to a nearby}} ranger station to use the radio. There they stumble on the alien mother, {{as well as the}} body of a second poacher, which also bears the dot pattern. The alien kills Brian while Bill flees to the cabin. The alien beats him home, however, and kills band-member Tracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band's camper. Tommy {{witnesses}} the attack through his telescope. The survivors decide to <b>hole</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabin until the next day.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{the loss}} {{of control over the}} fertile {{southern}} grassland meant that Xiongnu had to <b>hole</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold, barren land of the northern Gobi Desert and Siberia, struggling to survive. As a result, there was a true truce between the Han Dynasty and Xiongnu for seven years, which ended after a Xiongnu raid in 112 BC at Wuyuan. [...] The Xiongnu, however, never recovered to the strength of their past glory days, and would break apart into smaller clans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming decades.|$|R
25|$|On 22 June 1922, in {{an attempt}} to {{dislodge}} Anti-Treaty forces <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Four Courts, salvos were launched by Free State troops into the area housing Anti-Treaty munitions, which led to an enormous out-of-control fire. The massive conflagration spread rapidly, destroying the buildings and resulting in the almost total destruction of the mass of Irish historical records archived in the Public Records Office of Ireland (and {{in other parts of the}} Four Courts). As this closely followed the 1921 destruction of centuries of other important Irish records kept in the Custom House, Dublin, the cumulative effect was the annihilation of a huge swath of Ireland's historical resources, to the despair of future researchers seeking to document many aspects of Irish history. Subsequent efforts by archivists and other interested parties have played an extremely important role in attempting to replace what was lost but, though an impressive inventory of material has been amassed, continues to accumulate and is now housed in the National Archives of Ireland, much of what was lost in the 1922 fire was irreplaceable. Which side bore the burden of the blame for the fire led to recriminations in the fire's aftermath, but the question of which side was ultimately responsible remains unresolved.|$|E
25|$|At 06:00 on 7 June B Company intercepted a {{communist}} company attempting {{to enter the}} town, and after blocking the exit and entry routes—and again supported by armour—they forced them to withdraw. On the second day the clearing of the village continued. D Company, with a platoon from B Company attached, met sporadic resistance {{from a number of}} small groups still <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village. To fully clear the village every bunker, house and any likely areas of concealment had to be searched. Later in the morning South Vietnamese forces in the northern hamlet of Duc Trung came under attack, and B Company and the Assault Pioneer Platoon were deployed to provide assistance. Indeed, most of the action now centred on Duc Trung, with a helicopter reporting a force of up to 80 communist troops moving between the buildings. With the pioneers blocking to the south a Regional Force reaction company cleared the village, however the VC had already left. By 13:00 heavy firing again broke out in Duc Trung, with the South Vietnamese rapidly overrun by over a hundred communists. Accurate artillery fire was effective in stabilising the situation, however, and B Company with a troop of tanks swept the hamlet. During the afternoon D Company continued to clear Binh Ba and further close-quarter fighting followed before the Australians withdrew to allow the South Vietnamese to complete the clearance. By the evening the village was secure, and B and D Companies adopted blocking positions overnight.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, while <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Embassy in Beijing, Chinese {{dissident}} Chen Guangcheng telephoned Smith to seek his advice. Smith {{suggested that}} Chen seek to depart China {{and continue to}} push for human rights in China from outside the country. [...] After leaving the embassy, and while being treated at a Beijing hospital, he telephoned Smith during a session of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Smith spoke with Chen and allowed Chen to make statements and ask questions to those present in the Committee room.|$|E
50|$|Vicent Peris, after <b>holing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secure fort {{for some}} months at Xàtiva, {{came back to}} Valencia {{on the night of}} February 18, 1522. He hoped to revive the Germanies and respark the revolt. Meeting with his supporters, he was somehow seen or betrayed, and a desperate night battle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets broke out between the agermanats and royal soldiers. Eventually, Peris was cornered and smoked out by setting his house on fire. He was arrested, and on March 3, 1522, he was {{executed}} along with his closest supporters by drawing and quartering.|$|R
50|$|The plan succeeds. The besieged unit is able {{to break}} out and <b>hole</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canyon, and Jess, though his horse dies and he is parched from thirst, {{is able to}} kill his pursuers {{and get to the}} fort. Reinforcements are {{immediately}} sent to the canyon, where the unit is under constant attack and the defenders are being killed one by one. Willard Grange is captured by the Apaches and is tied upside down over an open flame overnight so that his cries of agony will prevent the others from resting.|$|R
5000|$|He <b>holes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{house of}} his friends Blip (a fellow college professor) and Sophia, two organic hippie types.

Each chapter also begins with a selection from the [...] "Book o' Billets-Doux" [...] ("love letters" [...] in French), which he found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dome and is apparently an extended conversation between Blip and Sophia which they wrote, eventually while succumbing to the virus.|$|R
2500|$|The {{suicide bomber}} struck the protest {{in the evening}} at around 18:10 local time. According to a Counter Terrorism Department official, the {{perpetrator}} had traveled by foot as revealed by closed-circuit footage. Soon after the blast, contingents of the Pakistan Army and Rangers were deployed to the site and cordoned off the area. Forensic teams began collecting evidence to start investigations. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar {{claimed responsibility for the}} attack via a text message, calling it revenge for the Pakistani military's counterinsurgency operation against militants <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern tribal areas across the Afghan border. The group had also issued threats three days prior to the attack, stating it would target government installations throughout the country as part of a campaign called [...] "Operation Ghazi".|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{crushed the}} {{rebellion}} mercilessly, inflicting terrible vengeance on captured rebels. Jordan was a pretender {{to the throne}} at this stage, having even been crowned and having received a gift of jewels from Queen Constance, who had thrown her support to the rebels against her own husband. He was <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle of Castrogiovanni. He surrendered to Henry and was tortured and executed in June 1197 {{in front of the}} queen. According to Otto of Sankt Blasien, the emperor [...] "ordered that a man who aspired to the royal crown [...] should have a crown fixed to him by iron nails". Others indicate that he was forced to sit on a red-hot throne and that the crown nailed to his head was heated until glowing.|$|E
2500|$|Clashes {{broke out}} between insurgents and the Armed Forces {{along the border}} with Russia in Shakhtarsk Raion on 16 July. Insurgents who had been <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Stepanivka made an attempt to escape encirclement by {{government}} forces at 05:00. According to a report by the National Guard, a roadblock near the border village of Marynivka was attacked by the insurgents with tanks, mortar fire, and anti-tank missiles. The checkpoint was shelled for over an hour, causing significant damage to infrastructure in Marynivka. Guardsmen managed to repel the attack, and forced the insurgents back to Stepanivka, where fighting continued. The battle then moved to the nearby village of Tarany. At least eleven Ukrainian soldiers died in the fighting. Attempts to form a [...] "contact group" [...] between the insurgents and the Ukrainian government, part of President Poroshenko's [...] "fifteen-point peace plan", failed, leaving little hope of a renewed ceasefire. The insurgents later said that they successfully retook Marynivka from the Armed Forces.|$|E

2500|$|Himilco {{chose not}} to set up base at Messene, which would have given him control over the strait and a harbor that could house his entire fleet, and also {{put him in a}} {{position}} to hinder naval traffic between Italy and Sicily. Himilco probably was not confident about holding the city this far away from Carthage. [...] Furthermore, majority of the Greeks of Messana were <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hill fortresses nearby, and reducing them required time, which in turn would enable Dionysius to strengthen himself for the coming battle. The ultimate Carthaginian goal was the defeat of Syracuse, Messana was just a sideshow. Bringing reinforcements from Carthage would be time consuming as Carthage had no standing army and would need time to raise fresh mercenaries, while dividing the field army to guard Messana would decrease his striking power against Dionysius. Himilco on the other hand could not entirely ignore the hostile Greek fortresses in his rear, as they might cause problems once he left the site. His solution was simple and ingenious at the same time, something that is termed indirect approach.|$|E
2500|$|After Yuan Shao's {{death in}} June 202, Cao Cao {{launched}} a campaign against Yuan's sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang and defeated them at the Battle of Liyang. In the following year, when Cao Cao was planning to attack Liu Biao, he received news that Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang had started fighting over control of Ji Province. Yuan Tan sent his adviser Xin Pi to convey to Cao Cao his wish to surrender and seek aid from Cao in countering his brother. Cao Cao considered accepting Yuan Tan's surrender and sending troops to aid him, and then consulted his advisers. Most of them thought that Liu Biao was more powerful and that Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang posed no threat, so they urged Cao Cao to attack Liu Biao first. Xun You had a different opinion from them. He said, [...] "The Empire has experienced so much turmoil, yet Liu Biao has <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jiang and Han regions. This shows {{that he has no}} intention of expanding his territory. The Yuans occupy four provinces and have 100,000 troops. Yuan Shao had treated his subordinates generously and hoped that his sons would cooperate harmoniously to safeguard his territories; that was why turmoil in the Empire never seemed to end. As of now, relations between the brothers have deteriorated and they seek to destroy each other. If one of them defeats and absorbs the other, he will become more powerful and more difficult to defeat. If you take advantage of their internal conflict to defeat them, you will restore stability in the Empire. You shouldn't miss this great opportunity." [...] Cao Cao agreed, accepted Yuan Tan's surrender and led his forces to attack Yuan Shang. Yuan Tan later rebelled against Cao Cao but was defeated and killed at the Battle of Nanpi in 205.|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, {{the third}} phase of the {{operation}} started as airborne troops boarded on C-130 transport aircraft, jumped off and stormed the militant-held valley of Swat. The name of this sub-operation of Black Thunderstorm {{has been referred to}} as Operation Rah-e-Rast in Urdu [...] In more than a month of fighting, by June 15, 106 soldiers and 1,040 militants were killed. Militant fighters were <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> emerald mines and in the main town of Swat district, Mingora. The emerald mines were secured by the Army's 50th Airborne division by May 7, but the militants were still holding their positions in Mingora and on a strategic hilltop overlooking the town. Meanwhile, on May 7, in Lower Dir, which was previously declared clear of the Taliban by the military, militants overran a paramilitary fort, killing three paramilitary soldiers and capturing 10 policemen. On the midnight of May 10, additional airborne troops with small teams of Pakistan Navy SEALs jumped off from C-130 transport aircraft, and attacked a Taliban hidden training camp at Banai Baba in Shangla district, which is just east from Swat. In the fighting at Banai Baba the military reported killing 150 militants for the loss of two soldiers. At {{the same time as the}} fighting in Shangla, some sporadic fighting was still continuing in Lower Dir where, over four days, 109 more militants were killed. Also, further west, in the Mohmand agency, a group of 300 militants attacked a military outpost; in the fighting that ensued 26 militants were killed and 14 soldiers were wounded. On May 12, Pakistani SSG commandos were inserted by helicopters into the Piochar area, a rear-support base for the militants in the northern part of the Swat valley, to conduct search-and-destroy operations.|$|E
