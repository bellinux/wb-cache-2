5|$|Banksia grossa mainly occurs {{from west}} of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. It grows in shallow sand over laterite, <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> sand, and {{occasionally}} atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges.|$|E

5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E

50|$|Spot size, or {{the width}} of the laser beam, {{directly}} affects the depth of penetration of the light energy due to scattering effects in the dermal layer.

5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after the burst <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> convection on September17 deteriorated. Later on September18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1860s whaling {{declined}} rapidly {{with the increasing}} use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War – with unfortunate consequences for the island. To explore alternative means of income Thompson, in 1867, purchased the Sylph which was the first local vessel to trade with Sydney (mainly pigs and onions). It anchored <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> water at what is now Sylph's Hole off Old Settlement Beach, but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873 which added to the woes of the island at this time.|$|E

5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> water occasionally {{results in}} significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, {{but also from}} oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lyn was <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> {{financial}} difficulties {{after having been}} promoted to the Elite League after the 1991 season. To create additional liquidity, the club sold its 44% share in Ullevaal to the Football Association for NOK4.4 million in January 1993. At the same time, NFF bought the 5.1% stake owned by the other clubs, making NFF the sole owner of the stadium. In October, the limited company Lyn Fotball AS was founded {{to take over the}} elite football teams in Lyn. At the same time, the club announced that it planned to purchase back their shares in Ullevaal Stadion, by letting the club take up a loan.|$|E

5|$|In Greco-Roman times saffron {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their {{customers}} {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.|$|E
5|$|In October the {{dry season}} sets in across much of Florida (starting early in the month in {{northern}} Florida and {{near the end of}} the month <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> southern Florida) and lasts until late April in most years. Fronts from mid-latitude storms north of Florida occasionally pass through northern and central parts of the state which bring light and brief winter rainfall. Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years {{the dry season}} becomes quite severe and water restrictions are imposed to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience any type of frozen precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>deep</b> seawaters the isotope 230Th {{make up to}} 0.04% {{of natural}} thorium. This is because its parent 238U is soluble in water, but 230Th is {{insoluble}} and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230Th isotope, since 230Th {{is one of the}} daughters of 238U. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013.|$|E
