50|$|Laboratory scale {{spargers}} (also {{known as}} gas diffusing stones or diffusors) {{as well as}} scrubbers, and gas-washing bottles (or Drechsel bottles) are similar glassware items which may use a fritted glass piece fused {{to the tip of}} a gas-inlet tube. This fritted glass tip is placed inside the vessel with liquid inside during use such that the fritted tip is submerged in the liquid. To maximize surface area contact of the gas to the liquid, a gas stream is slowly blown into the vessel through the fritted glass tip so that it breaks up the gas into many tiny bubbles. The purpose of sparging is to saturate the enclosed liquid with the gas, often to displace another <b>gaseous</b> <b>component.</b> The purpose of a scrubber or gas-washing bottle is to scrub the gas such that the liquid absorbs one (or more) of the gaseous components to remove it from the gas stream, effectively purifying the gas stream.|$|E
5000|$|The Serpens-Aquila Rift (also {{known as}} the Aquila Rift) is a region of the sky in the constellations Aquila, Serpens Cauda, and eastern Ophiuchus {{containing}} dark interstellar clouds. The region forms part of the Great Rift, a dark band that passes {{through the middle of}} the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy. The clouds that form this structure are called [...] "molecular clouds", constituting a phase of the interstellar medium which is cold and dense enough for molecules to form, particularly molecular hydrogen (H2). These clouds are opaque to light in the optical part of the spectrum due to the presence of interstellar dust grains mixed with the <b>gaseous</b> <b>component</b> of the clouds. Therefore, the clouds in the Serpens-Aquila Rift block light from background stars in the disk of the Galaxy, forming the dark rift. The complex is located in a direction towards the inner Galaxy, where molecular clouds are common, so it is possible that not all components of the rift are at the same distance and physically associated with each other.|$|E

5000|$|He {{joined the}} California Institute of Technology (Caltech) as Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1967. Shortly after joining Caltech, he became {{intrigued}} with Los Angeles's historic smog, which, at that time, was near record highs. Caltech biology professor Ari Haagen-Smit had, {{in the early}} 1950s, surmised that ozone, the principal <b>gaseous</b> <b>component</b> of smog, results from reactions involving volatile hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Seinfeld realized that modeling the formation of smog over an urban area like Los Angeles would involve describing mathematically the three-dimensional transport, mixing, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. A key component was describing the chemistry of the sunlight-driven hydrocarbon - NOx system. At the time of Haagen-Smit's classic papers, the actual mechanism of the underlying chemistry was unknown. The essential role of the hydroxyl (OH) radical in tropospheric chemistry was not established until about 1970. Seinfeld and his group formulated a chemical mechanism for ozone formation and in 1973 developed the first urban-scale atmospheric chemical-transport model, which {{was applied to the}} Los Angeles basin. This work, published in three papers in the journal, Atmospheric Environment, initiated what emerged as an entire field of scientific endeavor devoted to the modeling of tropospheric pollution. Although he continued to conduct research on optimization for several years, in the early 1970s he formed a major research group on atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, and atmospheric modeling. [...] As of 2009, he has served as mentor to 73 PhD graduates, about half of whom occupy faculty positions in major universities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This article {{describes}} a new {{method of measurement}} and determination of an average concentration of <b>gaseous</b> <b>components</b> of flue gases at the boiler output, {{which is based on}} the use of equipment for continuous network sampling and analysis of gaseous pollutants, developed at the VŠB-TU Ostrava for the purpose of diagnostic measurements in the energy sector. The advantage of this method in comparison with the commonly used system of measurements of concentrations of <b>gaseous</b> <b>components</b> in flue gases at one point of flue gas ducting is its higher accuracy in the determination of the average value of concentration at the output from incineration sources, and the corresponding lower uncertainty in determining the efficiency of these devices.

40|$|There are {{lines of}} {{evidence}} which relate bounds on the primordial water {{content of the}} Earth's mantle to a magma ocean and the accompanying Earth accretion process. We assume initially (before a magma ocean could form) that as the Earth accreted, it grew from volatile- (H 2 O, CO 2, NH 3, CH 4, SO 2, plus noble) gas-rich planetesimals, which accreted to form an initial 'primitive accretion core' (PAC). The PAC retained the initial complement of planetesimal <b>gaseous</b> <b>components.</b> Shock wave experiments in which both solid, and more recently, the <b>gaseous</b> <b>components</b> of materials such as serpentine and the Murchison meteorite have demonstrated that planetesimal infall velocities of less than 0. 5 km/sec, induce shock pressures of less than 0. 5 GPa and result in virtually complete retention of planetary gases...|$|R

The remaining stellar fraction F∗ is a smooth function of the star formation efficiency ǫ∗, and depends on the distribution function of the stars.
