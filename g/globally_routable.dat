50|$|In IPv4 {{it is very}} {{difficult}} for an organization to get even one <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane. Unicast address assignments by a local Internet registry for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.|$|E
50|$|RFC 3927 {{warns against}} the {{simultaneous}} use of IPv4 addresses of different scope, such as configuring link-local addresses {{as well as}} <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> addresses on the same interface. Therefore, hosts search for a DHCP server on the network before assigning link-local addresses.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> or {{a private}} address becomes {{available}} after a link-local address has been assigned, {{the use of}} the new address should generally be preferred to the link-local address for new connections but communication via the link-local address is still possible.|$|E
5000|$|In IPv4, typical [...] "configuration protocols" [...] include DHCP or PPP. Although DHCPv6 exists, IPv6 hosts {{normally}} use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol {{to create}} a <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> unicast address: the host sends router solicitation requests and an IPv6 router responds with a prefix assignment.|$|E
50|$|As the IPv4 address pool depletes, some ISPs {{will not}} be able to provide <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IPv4 {{addresses}} to customers. Nevertheless, customers are likely to require access to services on the IPv4 Internet. Several technologies have been developed for providing IPv4 service over an IPv6 access network.|$|E
5000|$|On system startup, a node {{automatically}} {{creates a}} link-local address on each IPv6-enabled interface, even if <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> addresses are manually configured or obtained through [...] "configuration protocols" [...] (see below).

50|$|A public IP address, {{in common}} parlance, is a <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> unicast IP address, {{meaning that the}} address is not an address {{reserved}} for use in private networks, such as those reserved by RFC 1918, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing. Public IP addresses {{may be used for}} communication between hosts on the global Internet.|$|E
50|$|End2End Direct {{messaging}} requires <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> ("public") IP addresses for all nodes involved. It {{is incompatible}} with NAT (Network Address Translation). It can work within a private internet (a subset of the IPv4 Internet that uses a flat address space with no NAT), or between any two nodes on the public IPv6 Internet. NAT prevents incoming connections, so any user to user messaging must use intermediary servers.|$|E
50|$|Link-local {{addresses}} and the loopback address have link-local scope, {{which means they}} can only be used on a single directly attached network (link). All other addresses (including Unique local addresses) have global (or universal) scope, which means they are (or could be) <b>globally</b> <b>routable,</b> {{and can be used}} to connect to addresses with global scope anywhere, or to addresses with link-local scope on the directly attached network.|$|E

50|$|HTTP is {{designed}} to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them when possible to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> address, by relaying messages with external servers.|$|E
5000|$|Teredo {{increases}} the attack surface by assigning <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IPv6 addresses to network hosts behind NAT devices, which could otherwise be unreachable from the Internet. By doing so, Teredo potentially exposes any IPv6-enabled application {{with an open}} port to the outside. Teredo tunnel encapsulation can mask {{the contents of the}} IPv6 data traffic from packet inspection, enabling the spread of both IPv6 and even some IPv4 malware. [...] US CERT has published a paper, on the risks of malware using IPv6 tunneling. [...] Teredo also exposes the IPv6 stack and the tunneling software to attacks should they have any remotely exploitable vulnerability.|$|E
50|$|In the IMS it is {{possible}} for a user to have multiple terminals (e.g. a mobile phone, a computer) or application instances (e.g. video telephony, instant messaging, voice mail) that are identified with the same public identity (i.e. SIP URI). Therefore, a mechanism is needed in order to route requests to the desired device or application. That is what a <b>Globally</b> <b>Routable</b> User Agent URI (GRU) is: a URI that identifies a specific user agent instance (i.e. terminal or application instance) and it does it globally (i.e. it is valid to route messages to that user agent from any other user agent on the Internet).|$|E
50|$|DirectAccess {{establishes}} IPsec tunnels {{from the}} client to the DirectAccess server, and uses IPv6 to reach intranet resources or other DirectAccess clients. This technology encapsulates the IPv6 traffic over IPv4 {{to be able to}} reach the intranet over the Internet, which still (mostly) relies on IPv4 traffic. All traffic to the intranet is encrypted using IPsec and encapsulated in IPv4 packets, which means that in most cases, no configuration of firewalls or proxies should be required. A DirectAccess client can use one of several tunneling technologies, depending on the configuration of the network the client is connected to. The client can use 6to4, Teredo tunneling, or IP-HTTPS, provided the server is configured correctly {{to be able to use}} them. For example, a client that is connected to the Internet directly will use 6to4, but if it is inside a NATed network, it will use Teredo instead. In addition, Windows Server 2012 provides two backward compatibility services DNS64 and NAT64, which allows DirectAccess clients to communicate with servers inside the corporate network even if those servers are only capable of IPv4 networking. Due to the <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> nature of IPv6, computers on the corporate network can also initiate a connection to DirectAccess clients, which allows them to remotely manage (Manage Out) these clients at any time.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the only}} method of ICMP hole {{punching}} or hole punching without third party involvement (autonomous NAT traversal) {{was developed by}} Samy Kamkar on January 22, 2010 and released in the open source software pwnat, and the method was later published in the IEEE. According to the paper:The proposed technique assumes that the client has somehow learned the current external (<b>globally</b> <b>routable)</b> IP address of the server's NAT.The key idea for enabling the server to learn the client'sIP address is for the server to periodically send a message toa fixed, known IP address. The simplest approach uses ICMPECHO REQUEST messages to an unallocated IP address, suchas 1.2.3.4. Since 1.2.3.4 is not allocated, the ICMP REQUESTwill not be routed by routers without a default route;ICMP DESTINATION UNREACHABLE messages that maybe created by those routers can just be ignored by the server.As {{a result of the}} messages sent to 1.2.3.4, the NATwill enable routing of replies in response to this request.The connecting client will then fake such a reply. Specifically, the client will transmit an ICMP message indicatingTTL_EXPIRED. Such a message could legitimatelybe transmitted by any Internet router and the sender addresswould not be expected to match the server's target IP.The server listens for (fake) ICMP replies and upon receiptinitiates a connection to the sender IP specified in the ICMP reply.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ideally, an Internet Service Provider offers {{reachability}} to {{the entire}} Internet.

Outdated Bogon filters, specialized services, and regional differences have all been conjectured as possible sources of reachability differences. However, to the best of knowledge, no systematic study has verified and quantified the extent of such differences, and no analysis exists to show which (if any) of the common conjectures are the dominant causes. In this paper we provide an initial systematic study of top-tier ISP reachability differences.

40|$|Routing {{complexity}} of the core network is crucial to Internet scalability. IPv 6 {{is believed to have}} better performance in multihoming than conventional IPv 4. With the depolyment of native IPv 6 backbone networks, a new door is opened to a better Internet, empowered by the combination of a well-aggregated IPv 6 -only core and the fertile application resources which still remain in IPv 4 networks. To achieve this ideal, we propose a prefix-specific address mapping to realize a scenario in which an IPv 6 <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> prefix plays the role of a locator, while IPv 4 host address is used as an identifier.

40|$|The Internet is {{constantly}} changing and evolving. In this thesis the behaviour of {{various aspects of}} the implementation of TCP underlying the Internet are measured. These include measures of Initial Congestion Window (ICW), type of reaction to loss, Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) support, Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) support. We develop a new method to measure congestion window reduction due to three duplicate ACK inferred loss. In a previous study 94 % of classified servers showed window halving, whereas we found that 50 % of classified servers exhibited Binary Increase Congestion control (BIC) or Cubic style behaviour, which is a departure from a Request For Comments (RFC) requirement to reduce the congestion window by at least 50 %. ECN is predicted to improve Internet performance, but previous studies have revealed a low support for it 0. 5 %, and ECN connections failed at a high rate due to middlebox interference 9 %; in this thesis we show a steady increase over time of ECN being implemented and supported 7. 2 %- 10. 3 %. ECN testing of webservers with <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IPv 6 adderesses showed a higher success rate 21. 9 %. Analysis of congestion control behaviour such as Tahoe, Reno and New Reno showed New Reno dominating more strongly than before, increasing from 35 % to 70 % of popular webservers. SACK sending analysis revealed that 45 % of popular webservers implement it properly, as compared to 18 % in earlier studies. SACK receiving analysis showed higher results to the earlier studies, with success increasing from 64. 7 % to 81. 1 %. For both of these SACK studies results for webservers with <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IPv 6 addresses showed a higher success rate when errors remained low. Analysis of ICW indicates that 75 % of popular webservers implement the older ICW regime of an initial congestion window of two or less packets, as compared to 96 % in previous studies. The new regime of an ICW of three or four packets depending on segment size was implemented at 20 %. We see from these results that RFCs do affect TCP implementation, but change can be slow.

30|$|In [26], two PMIPv 6 {{multicast}} {{methods are}} proposed, called the MAG-based method and local mobility anchor (LMA)-based method. However, these two methods {{are not very}} good {{in terms of the}} feasibility through the validation of our experiments. For the LMA-based method, since RFC 3810 [34] specifies the source address of the report message sent by the receivers is the link address, it is infeasible for the receiver to send the report message with the source address which is a <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> address. In addition, the multicast data sent by the multicast source MN cannot go through the bidirectional tunnel established by PMIPv 6 because current PMIPv 6 specification mainly concerns on the mobility support for unicast routing and does not describe the multicast data forwarding scheme. For the MAG-based multicast source mobility approach, if there is no improvement for current scheme, the join message from receivers cannot be sent to the MAG directly. The reason is that the LMA is the topological anchor for the MN, thereby the join message will be sent to the LMA rather than the MAG.|$|E
40|$|Many Internet service {{providers}} (ISPs) {{throughout the world}} {{are now in the}} process of integrating IPv 6 into their Internet access products for retail customers and corporate clients. One of the most important features of the IPv 6 protocol is its huge address space. This will enable users to assign a life-long stable, unique and <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IP address to each personal device. All users will be able to set up public services at home and be able to communicate from and to their devices from any point in the network. The resulting end-to-end reachability is considered a major improvement over the current situation. IPv 6 evoked a new debate between privacy and security in order to attract more unique IP addresses to locate users, especially with the advent of mobile devices. While the initial IPv 6 specification from 1995 does already contain a variety of security considerations (namely, message integrity protection as well as encryption based on IPsec), privacy aspects have not played a major role in the beginning.

40|$|Abstract—Named Data Networking (NDN) is a {{proposed}} information-centric {{design for the}} future Internet architecture, where application names are directly used to route requests for data. This key component of the architecture raises concerns about scalability of the forwarding system in NDN network, i. e., {{how to keep the}} routing table sizes under control given unbounded nature of application data namespaces. In this paper we apply a well-known concept of Map-and-Encap to provide a simple and secure namespace mapping solution to the scalability problem. More specifically, whenever necessary, application data names can be mapped to a set of <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> names that are used to retrieve the data. By including such sets in data requests, we are informing (more precisely, hinting) the forwarding system of the whereabouts of the requested data, and such hints can be used when routers do not know from where to retrieve the data using application data names alone. This solution enables NDN forwarding to scale with the Internet’s well-understood routing protocols and operational practice, while keeping all the benefits of the new NDN architecture. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Several {{components}} {{contribute to}} handover delay of Mobile IPv 6, namely, movement detection time, address configuration time, binding registration time, and route optimization time. Through testbed experiments, {{we found that}} the dominating delay component is the address configuration time, which is the time required to configure a new <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IPv 6 address on the mobile node after it moves to a foreign network. A typical process of IPv 6 address configuration requires a duplicate address detection (DAD) procedure. During DAD, a mobile node sends a neighbor solicitation message to ask whether its new address is being used. If no node replies within a set timer, a mobile node can assume the new address is unique on that network. On the Linux testbed, DAD takes as much as 1 second, which causes intolerable disruption in case of time-critical applications. This work studies techniques for reducing delay during the DAD procedure. Main contributions of this work are the insights into benefits and shortcomings of different DAD techniques, as well as benchmarks for design of future DAD protocols. I...|$|E
40|$|The use of ad hoc {{networking}} technologies {{is emerging}} as a viable and cost-effective solution to extend the range of traditional wireless local area networks (WLANs). In these networks, mobile client traffic reaches the access points through multi-hop wireless paths that are established by using an ad hoc routing protocol. However, several technical challenges have to be faced in order to construct such an extended WLAN. For instance, traditional autoconfiguration protocols commonly used in infrastructure-based WLANs, such as DHCP or Zeroconf, are not directly applicable in multi-hop wireless networks. To address this problem, {{in this paper we}} propose extensions to DHCP to enable the dynamic allocation of <b>globally</b> <b>routable</b> IPv 4 addresses to mobile stations in hybrid ad hoc networks, which transparently integrate conventional wired technologies with wireless ad hoc networking technologies. Some of the attractive features of our solution are its ability to cope with node mobility, the introduction of negligible protocol overheads, and the use of legacy DHCP servers.
