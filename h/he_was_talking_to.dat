25|$|Ibrahimović {{received}} a three-match ban after being shown a red card in a 1–1 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach. An additional three-match ban {{was given to}} Ibrahimović in February 2012 in a 2–1 home defeat against Fiorentina for swearing at an assistant referee.

25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to,</b> whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Following the game, the Canadians {{complained that}} Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader, the German referees {{of the match}} (the same ones who {{refereed}} a controversial Canada-Sweden game), were biased, since Canada was handed 31 minutes in penalties during the game, while the Soviets only received four minutes. Phil Esposito complained that one goal by the Soviets was directly {{the result of the}} referee dropping the puck while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a teammate.

According to Witwer, Starkiller's characteristics and personality depended on who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> and what circumstances he is in.

Although acting as a villain in the beginning of the , Blackman has commented how Starkiller is [...] "really just this damaged kid." ...|$|E
500|$|Diệm's {{family also}} seized {{businesses}} belonging to Buddhists {{in order to}} enrich themselves.

Forgetting that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a Buddhist, Diệm once told a high-ranking officer, [...] "Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted." [...] The distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias intended to repel Vietcong guerrillas resulted in weapons only being given to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies, and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of Buddhist pagodas occurred. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diệm's regime.|$|E
500|$|Chebotareva, {{who grew}} to love [...] "sweet" [...] Tatiana {{almost like a}} daughter, {{described}} how the shy grand duchess once reached out to hold her hand when Tatiana was nervous about walking {{in front of a}} large group of nurses. [...] "I am so terribly embarrassed and frightened – I do not know whom I greeted and whom not," [...] Tatiana told Chebotareva. Tatiana's informality also impressed Chebotareva's son, Gregory. Tatiana once called Chebotareva at her home on the telephone and spoke first to her sixteen-year-old son. Gregory was annoyed when the grand duchess referred to him by his diminutive name, [...] "Grisha." [...] Not realizing who she was, the affronted Gregory asked the grand duchess to identify herself and she replied, [...] "Tatiana Nikolaevna." [...] When he asked her again, still not believing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a Romanov, Tatiana again failed to claim the imperial title of Grand Duchess and replied that she was [...] "Sister Romanova the Second." ...|$|E

500|$|Gielgud was {{uninterested in}} {{religion}} or politics. As a boy {{he had been}} fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner {{not long after the}} Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, [...] "Whereabouts are you living now?", unaware that, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the prime minister, Clement Attlee, the answer was [...] "10 Downing Street". In his Who's Who entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic Nicholas de Jongh wrote that Gielgud's personality was [...] "such infinite, mischievous fun", and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, [...] "the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monaco was first prototyped when Andy Schatz {{was working for}} TKO Software, a video game {{development}} company based in Santa Cruz, California. The game was originally inspired by the top-down minimap in the Hitman series and was described by Schatz as being similar to Jason Rohrer's 2014 video game The Castle Doctrine during its early stages of development. His original plans were to release Monaco as an Xbox Live Indie Games title, made within six weeks. He said that when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> people about it at this stage, he described it as [...] "The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman". The development at TKO was done in three weeks while the company solicited paying work. Before TKO shut down in 2005, Schatz left and founded his own independent company, Pocketwatch Games. After Pocketwatch Games experimented with simulation games, such as 2006 Independent Games Festival finalist [...] and Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Dinosauria, Schatz prototyped {{an early version of}} Monaco using Microsoft XNA as to see if it worked on the Xbox 360.|$|E
500|$|Another {{alternative}} and younger version of Mileena {{appears in the}} 2011 live-action webisode series , portrayed by martial artist Jolene Tran in her acting debut. Their story is told in the two-part episode [...] "Kitana & Mileena," [...] which featured both animated and live-action sequences. Mileena is {{shown to be a}} Shang Tsung-created clone like in the games, but of an age similar to Kitana's, as they were together since their infancy, and her scarred but otherwise normal-looking mouth (with lips, except as a baby) changes as her teeth grow when she is overcome by a cannibalistic rage. The adolescent Mileena is clad in violet, {{does not appear to be}} Kitana's twin, and is seen wearing a mask only in some of the animated sections (in which both of them are wearing outfits similar to those in Mortal Kombat II). She is shown spar-dueling against Kitana and losing to her, then killing and devouring a palace guard in a fit of insanity, as well as killing impostors of King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father, in a team together with Kitana. When the two are eventually sent by Shao Kahn on a mission to assassinate the actual King Jerrod, Mileena kills him with a double sai throw to the chest when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Kitana.|$|E

2500|$|Paraguayans often {{referred}} to him simply as [...] "Dr. Francia" [...] or Karaí Guazú ("great lord" [...] in Guaraní).

Yasir Hameed denied the allegations, saying that he thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a potential sponsor, and only stated what he read on the news. In November 2010, wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider left the Pakistani cricket team before their fifth and decisive one-day game against South Africa, and flew from Dubai (where the series was being held) to London's Heathrow Airport. Haider asked for asylum and claimed {{that he had been}} threatened to throw the game. Haider's Pakistani stipend was suspended by the Pakistani Cricket Board.
