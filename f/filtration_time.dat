40|$|To help {{understand}} and predict {{the role of}} natural organic matter (NOM) in the fouling of low-pressure membranes, experiments were carried out with an apparatus that incorporates automatic backwashing and long filtration runs. Three hollow fibre membranes of varying character {{were included in the}} study, and the filtration of two different surface waters was compared. The hydrophilic membrane had greater flux recovery after backwashing than the hydrophobic membranes, but the efficiency of backwashing decreased at extended <b>filtration</b> <b>times.</b> NOM concentration of these waters (7. 9 and 9. 1 mg/L) had little effect on the flux of the membranes at extended <b>filtration</b> <b>times,</b> as backwashing of the membrane restored the flux to similar values regardless of the NOM concentration. The solution pH also had little effect at extended <b>filtration</b> <b>times.</b> The backwashing efficiency of the hydrophilic membrane was dramatically different for the two waters, and the presence of colloid NOM alone could not explain these differences. It is proposed that colloidal NOM forms a filter cake {{on the surface of the}} membranes and that small molecular weight organics that have an adsorption peak at 220 nm but not 254 nm were responsible for “gluing” the colloids to the membrane surface. Alum coagulation improved membrane performance in all instances, and this was suggested to be because coagulation reduced the concentration of “glue” that holds the organic colloids to the membrane surface...|$|R

50|$|Electrofiltration is a {{technique}} for separation and concentration of colloidal substances - for instance biopolymers. The principle of electrofiltration is based on overlaying electric field on a standard dead-end filtration. Thus the created polarity facilitates electrophoretic force which is opposite to the resistance force of the filtrate flow and directs the charged biopolymers. This provides extreme decrease in the film formation on the micro- or ultra-filtration membranes and the reduction of <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> from several hours by standard filtration to a few minutes by electrofiltration. In comparison to cross-flow filtration electrofiltration exhibits not only increased permeate flow but also guarantees reduced shear force stress which qualifies it as particularly mild technique for separation of biopolymers that are usually unstable.|$|E
50|$|Fluids {{flow through}} a filter {{due to a}} {{difference}} in pressure—fluid flows from the high pressure side to the low pressure side of the filter, leaving some material behind. The simplest method to achieve this is by gravity and {{can be seen in}} the coffeemaker example. In the laboratory, pressure in the form of compressed air on the feed side (or vacuum on the filtrate side) may be applied to make the filtration process faster, though this may lead to clogging or the passage of fine particles. Alternatively, the liquid may flow through the filter by the force exerted by a pump, a method commonly used in industry when a reduced <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> is important. In this case, the filter need not be mounted vertically.|$|E
50|$|High {{filtration}} rate {{can be obtained}} from producing thin cake. However, a conventional filter press is a batch system and the process must be stopped to discharge the filter cake and reassemble the press, which is time consuming. Practically, maximum {{filtration rate}} is obtained when the <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> is greater than the time taken to discharge the cake and reassemble the press to allow for cloth's resistance.Properties of the filter cake affect the filtration rate, and it is desirable for the particle's size to be as large as possible to prevent pore blockage by using a coagulant. From experimental work, flow rate of liquid through the filter medium is proportional to the pressure difference. As the cake layer forms, pressure applies to the system increases and the flow rate of filtrate decreases. If the solid is desired, the purity of the solid can be increased by cake washing and air drying.Sample of filter cake can be taken from different locations and weighed to determine the moisture content by using overall material balance.|$|E

Organic characterisation using liquid chromatography with a photodiode array (PDA) and fluorescence spectroscopy (Method A), and UV 254, organic carbon and organic nitrogen detectors (Method B), was undertaken on wastewater before and after magnetic IX treatment. Results showed partial removal of the biopolymer fraction at high IX doses. With increasing concentration of IX, evidence for nitrogen-containing compounds such as proteins and amino acids disappeared from the LC-OND chromatogram, complementary to the fluorescence response. A greater fluorescence response of tryptophan-like proteins (278 nm/ 343 nm) for low IX concentrations was consistent with aggregation of tryptophan-like compounds into larger aggregates, either by self-aggregation or with polysaccharides. Recycling of IX resin through multiple adsorption steps without regeneration maintained {{the high level of}} humics removal but there was no continued removal of biopolymer. Subsequent membrane filtration of the IX treated waters resulted in complex fouling trends. Filtration tests with either polypropylene (PP) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes showed higher rates of initial fouling following treatment with high IX doses (10 mL/L) compared to filtration of untreated water, while treatment with lower IX doses resulted in decreased fouling rates relative to the untreated water. However, at longer <b>filtration</b> <b>times</b> the rate of fouling of IX treated waters was lower than untreated water and the relative fouling rates corresponded to the amount of biopolymer material in the feed. It was proposed that the mode of fouling changed from pore constriction during the initial filtration period to filter cake build up at longer <b>filtration</b> <b>times.</b> The organic composition strongly influenced the rate of fouling during the initial filtration period due to competitive adsorption processes, while at longer <b>filtration</b> <b>times</b> the rate of fouling appeared to depend upon the amount of biopolymer material in the feed water. © 2013...|$|R

30|$|Since {{the cake}} {{deposition}} resulting from particulates aggregation {{accounted for the}} major flux decline, this {{is an indication that}} the fouling involved did not seriously affect the pore structure of the membrane. The 5 and 10  kDa UF membranes were much stable at the TMP of 120 and 40  kPa, respectively, compared with the 1  kDa UF membrane based on the R 2 values. Furthermore, with cake layer formation, it could be predicted that steady state filtration of biotreated POME could be sustainably attained at longer <b>filtration</b> <b>times</b> without a complete pore blocking. Also, fouling due to cake layer formation is reversible, and this gives an idea of the necessary cleaning methods during the stage process design.

30|$|Similar trends were {{observed}} at all TMPs, and {{this indicates that}} the feedwater still contained some constituents that might be accumulating {{on the surface of}} the membranes, thus resulting in fouling or pore blocking. Relatively similar flux-time trends {{were observed}} in previous flux decline studies (Cai et al. 2013; Rashid et al. 2013). It was also observed that the UF membranes were somewhat affected by the foulants contained in the feed, and this is evident from their very low fluxes. The reason for this may be attributed to the smaller pore sizes possessed by the UF membrane which lead to their higher resistances and retention capacities (Lee et al. 2007). From the foregoing, since the flux-time plots are usually employed in predicting the flux condition at long <b>filtration</b> <b>times,</b> these results indicate that the permeate flux will approach a relatively steady-state at prolonged filtration periods.|$|R

On the other hand, the chemical composition of the resulting fractions is not influenced. Longer residence times lead to longer <b>filtration</b> <b>times</b> and lower oil entrapment, whereas the yield is not affected.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} the {{conservatism}} {{in the current}} Dutch recommendations on the external friction angle of diaphragm walls: = [, 20 °] (for curved slip surfaces) (CUR/COB, 2010), {{by means of an}} experimental investigation. Based on literature, two sources of conservatism are identified: 1) filter cake contamination by excavated soil particles is not taken into account, which can lead to an increased of around 30 ° (Day et al., 1981; Henry et al., 1998; Arwanitaki et al., 2007); 2) a continuous shear plane through the filter cake is assumed, ignoring the influence of concrete roughness and filter cake thickness. Cernak et al. (1973) and Lam et al. (2014) found that the concrete roughness causes an increased shear strength compared to the filter cake below a certain <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> (which controls the filter cake thickness). These aspects are captured in a conceptual model (hypothesis), which predicts the development of interface shear strength as a function of <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> for the case of a contaminated filter cake compared to a clean filter cake: For a contaminated filter cake, the lower boundary shear strength, which is that of the filter cake, is higher compared to that of a clean filter cake. However, this lower boundary is reached after a shorter <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> for a contaminated filter cake compared to a clean filter cake, caused by the higher filter cake growth rate due to slurry contamination. The first experimental phase focusses on the filter cake shear strength. A series of small-scale direct-shear tests (∅ 67 mm) on sand/filter cake (clean) /cement-mortar samples show a linear trend of peak shear strength of 18, 3 ° for normal pressures in the range of 200 kPa - 400 kPa at a shear rate of 1, 2 mm/min. This result corresponds to the friction angle of 19, 5 ° by Deltares (2008), which lies at the basis of the current Dutch recommendations. Additional tests on clean filter cakes indicate a peak shear strength around 23 ° at a shear rate of 0, 0072 mm/min. Test series on contaminated filter cakes show an increased linear trend of peak shear strength of 25, 6 ° for normal pressures in the range of 200 kPa - 400 kPa at a shear rate of 1, 2 mm/min. The filter cake contamination is based on an analysis of an in-situ slurry sample analysis from the Spoorzone Delft project. Increased friction angles of 28, 5 ° and 32, 8 ° are observed at 0, 0072 mm/min shear rate. In the second experimental phase, the influence of <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> on the interface shear strength for clean and contaminated filter cakes is investigated. In total, 7 direct-shear tests have been performed on sand/filter cake/concrete samples (170 mm x 170 mm), in which a realistic diaphragm wall concrete mix is applied (max. aggregate size 16 mm, class F 5). The test results (normal pressure of 200 kPa, shear rate 1, 2 mm/min) show a decrease of interface shear strength with increased <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> for both clean and contaminated filter cake samples and it is shown that for the contaminated case the filter cake shear strength is reached after a shorter <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> (around 12 hours) compared to clean filter cakes (around 24 hours), confirming the hypothesis. An analysis of the concrete surface textures (based on 3 D laser scans) indicates an increased surface roughness with increased filter cake thickness. The obtained concrete surface roughness is comparable to in-situ conditions based on an analysis of in-situ data from the Spoorzone Delft project. In this comparison the influence of macro-roughness patterns is not taken into account. The experimental results of this thesis indicate that the main source of conservatism of the current Dutch recommendations on is the omission of the influence of filter cake contamination on the filter cake shear strength. In addition, could further be optimised as a function of <b>filtration</b> <b>time.</b> However, the time frame of increased interface shear strength from the filter cake shear strength towards is limited for contaminated filter cakes (around 12 hours in this research). It is therefore concluded that the recommended value(s) can best be based on contaminated filter cake shear strength, omitting the time effect. It is therefore suggested that future research should focus on the lower boundary shear strength for the case of in-situ filter cake samples. For this purpose the developed direct-shear set-up can be applied. It is also suggested to further investigate the influence of macro-roughness patterns, since it can not be excluded that macro-roughness patterns do not cause an extended time frame of increased interface shear strength.

Background:The tube press, a high pressure filtration application, is designed to filter fine particles. Inside the tube press, there is a filter cloth, supported by a backing mesh behind the filter cloth, to prevent the filter cloth of being damaged by the high pressure in the tube press. Since there are no current reports on the subject of how the backing mesh affects the filtration in tube presses, this study aims to find out if and how the differences appear, in terms of <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> and moist content in the slurry product, when different backing meshes are used. A parameter that usually affects filtration results of a slurry is the slurry temperature, which is also analyzed in this report. The way it is analyzed is by comparing if different temperatures of the slurry affects the backing mesh differently, depending on the backing mesh used. This is done by exposing and testing the backing meshes to three different temperatures, and then comparing if the results differ between each backing mesh. Method:Collection of information through experiments with a piston press, of which five different backing mesh compositions are tested for three different temperatures of the same slurry. Conclusion:The conclusion made regarding the temperature of the slurry, is that it clearly affects the <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> for the piston press, regardless of which backing mesh is used. There was a reduction in <b>filtration</b> <b>time</b> as the temperature of the slurry was higher, due to lower viscosity, which appeared regardless of the backing mesh used.

During ultrafiltration through ceramic or polysulfone membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 - 300 kDa, the content of anthocyanins was reduced to 220 - 370 mg l, but a light transmission at 625 nm was as high as 96 %. The permeate flux in MF was maintained at high values above 170 l m h at 3 bar for more than 2 h by backwashing the membrane with a compressed air every 6 min for 1 min. The cake compression at high pressures was avoided by short <b>filtration</b> <b>times</b> between backwashing...|$|R

A new plant that will replace all three of the Lorton and Occoquan plants was under construction and expected to go online in the fall of 2005.|$|R
