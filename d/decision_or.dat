5|$|In June1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition {{sued the}} San Diego City Council to {{require them to}} move the western {{terminus}} of SR56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August1, the City of San Diego received a petition {{in which more than}} 45,000people requested that the City Council overturn their <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in Marina del Rey.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts. The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own <b>decision,</b> <b>or</b> uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} choice of {{remaining}} with Clarkson, whose plans were nullified by SDCC's <b>decision,</b> <b>or</b> cooperating with the council, Maguire chose the former and with Mulden's financing, initiated a High Court judicial review of the decision. The review failed and on 11 April 2005, facing debts of over two million Euro, the club entered into examinership. The 400 Club agreed to completely bankroll the club during the process. On 5 May 2005, Tony Maguire resigned on request by the FAI, who had discovered that the club had submitted their 2003 accounts in their {{application for a licence}} for the 2005 season. This resulted in a points deduction and subsequent relegation under Roddy Collins. The examinership concluded in July 2005 with the examiner accepting the 400 Club's bid for Shamrock Rovers, saving the club from extinction, and the supporters-owned club won promotion at the first attempt in 2006 under Pat Scully. The 2007 and 2008 seasons at Tolka Park were ones of overachievement and stability, but the major event of the period was the recommencement of building on the stadium after more than two years of legal disputes between the council and Thomas Davis CLG.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, a {{distinction}} was drawn between jurisdictional errors {{of law and}} non-jurisdictional errors of law. A jurisdictional error of law was committed when a public authority made a <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> took some action even though it lacked jurisdiction to do so, for example, if the process was tainted by simple ultra vires. In this event, the High Court could judicially review the matter. On the other hand, a non-jurisdictional error of law occurred when an authority was properly empowered to make a <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> take action, but it was alleged that the authority had exercised its discretion in breach of some administrative law principle. In such cases, the Court {{was not allowed to}} intervene by exercising judicial review, save in certain circumstances such as a breach of natural justice. This distinction applied both to the exercise of power by public authorities and to courts and tribunals.|$|E

25|$|The Nurses and Midwives Tribunal is {{a former}} {{tribunal}} that {{was established in the}} Australian state of New South Wales which dealt with appeals and complaints of professional misconduct by nurses and midwives. The tribunal generally heard matters after the Nurses and Midwives Board has made a <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> a professional association had referred an issue to the tribunal. The tribunal heard matters in an informal manner in an attempt to do justice in the matter. The tribunal also conducted inquiries into complaints referred by the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the completion of}} the second prototype, an initial order for 99 production aircraft was placed with Macchi. The G.50, which during the same flight tests held at Guidonia airport had out-turned the Macchi, was also placed in limited production, because it had been determined that the former could be brought into service earlier. The <b>decision,</b> <b>or</b> indecision, involved in producing multiple overlapping types led to greater inefficiencies in both production and in operation. In June 1939, production of the C.200 formally commenced.|$|E

25|$|In other words, {{according}} to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise {{because of any}} conscious <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|E

At the same time, capacity was boosted by bringing in nurses {{to carry out the}} bulk of the medical assessments using a new semi-structured interview technique, with the findings recorded in digital format. This meant that from 2008, most new claims were scrutinised by a healthcare professional; those whose claims reached the threshold for eligibility were granted ESA - either shortly after the initial assessment, following an internal review of the initial <b>decision,</b> <b>or</b> after an external appeal.|$|E

5000|$|Supreme Court {{opinions}} and other judicial decisions - Judicial precedent in Thailand is not binding. Courts are not bound {{to follow their}} own decisions. Lower courts are not bound to follow precedents set by higher courts. However, Thai law has been influenced by common law precedent. Courts are therefore significantly influenced by earlier <b>decisions</b> <b>or</b> <b>decisions</b> of higher courts. The Supreme Court of Justice publishes its decisions, known as [...] "Supreme Court Opinions". These are frequently used as secondary authorities and are numbered according to the year issued. Other judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>or</b> rulings are published by the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E
25|$|Australia has a Common law {{understanding}} of locus standi or standing which {{is expressed in}} statutes such as the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and common law decisions of the High Court of Australia especially the case Australian Conservation Foundation v Commonwealth (1980). At common law, the test for standing is whether the plaintiff has a 'special {{interest in the subject}} matter of the action'. Under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to have standing the applicant must be ‘a person who is aggrieved’, defined as ‘a person whose interests are adversely affected’ by the <b>decision</b> <b>or</b> conduct complained of. This has generally been interpreted in accordance with the common law test.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their <b>decision,</b> <b>or</b> switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E
