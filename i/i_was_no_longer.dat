My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly {{alone in a}} world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of Cambridge, Byron {{originally}} {{wanted to}} go to Christ Church, Oxford but there were no vacancies. Instead, he chose Cambridge at Drury's recommendation. The choice did not matter, since college life in general did not suit his personality. He wrote in his diary, [...] "I was so completely alone in this new world that it half broke my spirits... It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of my life that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a boy". However, this did not mitigate his contempt towards the other students, and he quickly grew dissatisfied with the society surrounding Cambridge: [...] "It is the Devil or at least his principal residence. They call it the University, but any other appellation would have suited it better, for Study is the last pursuit of the Society".|$|E
2500|$|The Nun stars Karina as Suzanne Simonin, as a {{young woman}} forced into a convent by her family, who's {{physically}} and psychologically tortured. She attempts to escape while dealing with her hateful mother, an empathetic mother superior, an indifferent attorney, a lesbian nun and a sympathetic-but-lustful monk. According to Rivette, [...] "The shooting of La Religieuse was difficult ... I was troubled because we had done the piece before as a play with the sentiments, rehearsals, etc, and I realized when I shot the film that since the people were doing the same text, the same words, my mind was wandering and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> listening to the words". Karina described Rivette's direction as hyperactive; he was constantly [...] "darting in and out of all corners ... always looking at this or that detail." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, Standing Bear {{decided to}} leave. He {{was no longer}} willing to endure {{existence}} {{under the control of}} an overseer. Luther sold his land allotment and bought a house in Sioux City, Iowa, where he worked as a clerk in a wholesale firm. After a brief job doing rodeo performances with Miller Brothers 101 Ranch in Oklahoma, he moved to California to seek full-time employment in the motion picture industry. In later years, Luther reflected upon his decision to leave the reservation: “Sixteen years ago I left reservation life and my native people, the Oglala Sioux, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> willing to endure existence under the control of an overseer. For about the same number of years I had tried to live a peaceful and happy life; tried to adapt myself and make re-adjustments to fit the white man’s mode of existence. [...] But I was unsuccessful. I developed into a chronic disturber. [...] I was a bad Indian, and the agent and I never got along. I remained a hostile, even a savage, if you please. And I still am. I am incurable.” [...] While Standing Bear left the confinement of the reservation, he continued his serious responsibilities and as an Oglala Lakota chief, fighting to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty through public education.|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook did {{not return}} and made her final {{appearance}} as Sam on 24 January 2000. She has since confessed that her drug taking was the reason why she was written out. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "I wasn't fired this time, but let's just say when they {{gave me the opportunity}} to walk I took it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> interested in acting and that had become blatantly obvious to everyone on set. The soap was now being shown four times a week and it was impossible to balance the workload with my addiction [...] Not only had [...] destroyed my nose, but it was about to destroy my career again as well [...] The producers were tiring of my behaviour [...] When I did leave the production at the end of 1999 it was in fact a fairly mutual decision. I admit that had I begged the producers to let me stay this time I doubt if they would have allowed me to. But I was happy to go [...] Looking back to that point now it fills me with shame that I could have behaved in that way and let down so many people". Following her axing, Westbrook's eroded nasal septum was revealed to the public by the press, after she was photographed at the 2000 British Soap Awards.|$|E
