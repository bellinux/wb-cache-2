5|$|The Badami cave temples are {{carved out}} of soft Badami {{sandstone}} on a hill cliff. The plan {{of each of the}} four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside the cave. The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> sequence of excavation.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fast}} {{development}} {{of service and}} industry sectors in Vietnam during the last decades the contribution of agriculture to the national GDP decreases continuously from 80-90% to approximately 30-50%.

25|$|A second, {{though not}} as popular {{hypothesis}} is that the Indus script belongs to the Munda family of languages.

25|$|CMFDA was {{initially}} {{used as a}} cell tracker. Unfortunately, {{it has also been}} mistakenly used as a glutathione probe. Unlike monochlorobimane, whose fluorescence increases upon reacting with glutathione, the fluorescence increase of CMFDA is due to the hydrolysis of the acetate groups inside cells. Although CMFDA may react with glutathione in cells, the fluorescence increase <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> reaction. Therefore, studies using CMFDA as a glutathione probe should be revisited and re-interpreted.|$|E

Judges also retain the right to oversee mandatory reconciliation in the case of divorce, which many women's organizations fear will be used to limit women's autonomy during divorce proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Keep in {{mind that}} LDL-C is not a {{measurement}} of actual LDL particles; LDL-C is only an estimate (not measured from the individual's blood sample) of how much cholesterol is being transported by all LDL particles; either a smaller concentration of large particles or {{a high concentration of}} small particles. Also keep {{in mind that}} LDL particles carry many fat molecules (typically 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules per LDL particle); this includes cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and others. Thus even if the hundreds to thousands of cholesterol molecules within an average LDL particle were measured, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> other fat molecules or even the number of LDL particles.|$|E
25|$|The {{average income}} per {{household}} in Aix-les-Bains is about €15,606 per year. However, this number <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> reality {{for the majority}} of Aix-les-Bains households whose earnings are modest, or even precariously low. The share of households taxed in 2005 was 66.8%. The number of indebted taxpayers of the wealth tax is two hundred and twelve. The average wealth tax for the commune is approximately €4,091 per year which is slightly lower than the national average which has an average tax of €5,683 per year. With respect to the mean wealth of those liable to pay the Solidarity tax on wealth, it amounts locally to €1,338,548 per year compared to €1,493,167 per year for the average national.|$|E

All Western nations voted for the resolution, with the exception of the United Kingdom (the Mandate holder), Greece and Turkey. The Soviet bloc also voted for partition, with the exception of Yugoslavia, which was to be expelled from Cominform the following year. The majority of Latin American nations following Brazilian leadership, voted for partition, with a sizeable minority abstaining. Asian countries (primarily Middle Eastern countries) voted against partition, with the exception of the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|The 198486 {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} the cemetery had followed clearly delineated limits, and that while a large space of hillside had been available, all of the burials were located within the 112 to 118 metre contours. Only inhumations were found at the site, with no cremation burials. 73 graves had been excavated from the Western Area, 52 from the Eastern Area, 4 {{to the left of}} the main cemetery, and an estimated 53 from the Central Area: a total of 182 graves has been established for the cemetery. Taking into account potential further isolated graves outside the main area of the cemetery, Philp suggested that there might be between 180 and 220 graves at the site, containing between 200 and 220 individuals. Based on the idea that the cemetery was used for a century between 650 and 750 CE, Philp suggested that there would have been an average two burials at the cemetery per year. Taking this and the average life expectancy of 26 into account, he suggested that the cemetery served a local community of around 70 to 90 people, making it the largest known community in West Kent at this period. The majority of skeletal remains had survived well due to the well drained chalk geology, although in a number of graves, particularly those of children, they have almost entirely eroded. Based on the 198486 excavation, archaeologists noted that 4 infants were buried alongside the 48 juveniles and adults. The site therefore <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> high levels of infant mortality that local communities would have faced.|$|E
