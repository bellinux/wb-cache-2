25|$|The main {{institutions}} {{of law in}} industrialised countries are independent courts, representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, bureaucratic organisation, the legal profession and civil society itself. John Locke, in his Two Treatises of Government, and Baron de Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws, advocated for a separation of powers between the political, legislature and <b>executive</b> <b>bodies.</b> Their principle was that no person {{should be able to}} usurp all powers of the state, in contrast to the absolutist theory of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan.|$|E
25|$|Rodezno’s {{leadership}} {{was marked by}} rapprochement strategy towards the Alfonsinos, exercised by means of alliances within Acción Popular, Renovación Española and Bloque Nacional, but not within CEDA; its objective was sort of dynastical union on Traditionalist platform.

When sitting in <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> of the organizations mentioned, Rodezno and Pradera were getting detached from the mainstream Carlist feeling.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the Australia Act 1986, the Queen {{has the power to}} appoint, on the advice of the relevant state premier, a governor in each of the Australian states, who themselves appoint <b>executive</b> <b>bodies,</b> as well as people to fill casual Senate vacancies, if the relevant state parliament is not in session, under the Great Seal of the State. The state governors continue to serve as the direct representatives of the Queen, in no way subordinate to the Governor-General, and they carry out on her behalf all of the Queen's constitutional and ceremonial duties in respect of their respective state. The Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory resemble states in many respects, but are administered directly by the Commonwealth of Australia; an administrator, appointed by the Governor-General upon the advice of the Commonwealth government, takes the place of a state governor in the Northern Territory. The Australian Capital Territory has no equivalent position.|$|E
500|$|The Council first {{appeared}} in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) as the [...] "Special Council of Ministers", set up to counterbalance the High Authority (the supranational executive, now the Commission). The original Council had limited powers: issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, and the Council's consent was only required on decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, the Council only scrutinised the High Authority (the executive). In 1957, the Treaties of Rome established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) and the Council of the European Economic Community (EEC). However, due to objections over the supranational power of the Authority, their Councils had more powers; the new <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> were known as [...] "Commissions".|$|E
500|$|The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) is the top-tier {{administrative}} {{body for the}} local governance of Greater Manchester. It was established on 1 April 2011 as a pilot combined authority, unique to local government in the United Kingdom. It consists of ten indirectly elected members, each a directly elected councillor {{from one of the}} ten metropolitan boroughs that comprise Greater Manchester. The authority derives most of its powers from the Local Government Act 2000 and Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, and replaced a range of single-purpose joint boards and quangos in 2011, to provide a formal administrative authority for Greater Manchester with powers over public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, carbon neutrality and planning permission. Functional <b>executive</b> <b>bodies,</b> such as Transport for Greater Manchester, are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. On 3 November 2014, the Devolution to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority agreement was signed to pass further powers and responsibilities, as well as the establishment of an elected Mayor of Greater Manchester with the first election to be held in 2017. From April 2016, Greater Manchester will be the first part of England to [...] "get full control of its health spending" [...] with a devolution deal which aims to unite the region's health and social care systems under one budget under the control of local leaders, including Greater Manchester's new directly elected mayor.|$|E
