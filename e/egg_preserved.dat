5000|$|Originally, oviraptorids {{were thought}} to be {{specialized}} egg raiders, based on a Mongolian find showing Oviraptor on top of a nest erroneously attributed to the ceratopsian dinosaur Protoceratops. However, discoveries in the 1990s, including Citipati specimens clearly brooding (rather than preying on) the same types of nests, and a Citipati embryo inside the same type of <b>egg</b> <b>preserved</b> in these nests, showed that the [...] "specialized egg thief" [...] idea was incorrect. Still, some scientists have suggested that oviraptorids may have fed on shelled food items like eggs or shellfish. However, animals specialized for eating shelled food typically have broad, crushing beaks or teeth. In contrast, the jaws of oviraptorids had thin, sharp edges probably supporting shearing beaks, ill-suited for cracking shells. Among other known animals, the beaks of oviraptorids most closely resemble those of herbivorous dicynodont synapsids, which are usually considered herbivorous. Their beaks also share similarities with the beaks of herbivorous parrots and tortoises.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to learn the effect of lime duration and storage duration on quality of salted egg. The research was a factorial experiment (2 x 4) using Randomized Block Design with three replication. The first factor was preservation of two levels, i. e. : without soaking in lime solution (P 0) and with soaking in lime solution (P 1). The second factor was storage duration, i. e; 0 (L 1), 12 (L 2), 24 (L 3), and 36 (L 4) days. The variable measured were the microbial load, protein content and organoleptic properties, i. e : the colour, flavor, taste and texture of salted egg. Data were subjected to analysis of variance followed by Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The conclusion was that the interaction between soaking in lime solution and storage duration had no different effect on protein content, microbial load, flavour and taste but it had different effect on texture and colour of salted egg. The soaking in lime solution gave a lower result of microbial load i. e : 6, 55 x 107 cfu/g but the organoleptic quality on texture, colour and flavour of salted egg gave a lower degree of preference score by panelist. It is suggested to keep salted <b>egg</b> <b>preserved</b> with lime solution at room temperature not more than 24 days to produce good quality salted egg base on protein content, microbial load, flavor and taste...|$|E

40|$|The materiasl {{used were}} duck eggs and curing agent. The {{research}} method used was factorial experiment (2 x 4) Randomized  Block Design with two treatment factors. The first factors was preservation {{which consisted of}} two levels namely : with (P 1) and without (Po) dipping in water glass as preservative. The second factor was the length of storage which consisted of four levels namely : 0 day (L 0), 14 days (L 14), 28 days (L 28) and 42 days (L 42). Each treatment was devided into three groups based {{on the time of}} salting. The variables measured were microbial load, protein content and organoleptic qualities (flavour, colour of yolk and texture) of salted eggs. The result of statistical analysis showed that a highly significant different effect (P< 0. 01) of the length of storage on the microbial load, preservation and the length of storage on protein content and a significant effect (P< 0. 05) of the preservation and the combination treatments on the microbial load, the flavour and colour of yolk of salted eggs.

The conclusion that the dipping in water glass as preservative and the different length of storage in room temperature affected on  microbial load, protein content and organoleptic qualities (flavour, the colour of yolk and the texture). Dipping in water glass as preservative would make salted egg's microbial load lower than the ones without preservative. A longer storage could increase the microbial load and decrease protein content.

40|$|<b>Preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> are {{a special}} Asian food. Traditionally, the gelling of <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs</b> is tested {{intuitively}} by feeling the slight vibrations that {{occur when the}} <b>preserved</b> <b>egg</b> is tapped with a finger. However, the effects of extended tapping and individual subjectivity lead to inaccurate results. This study thus attempts to devise a scientific method for inspecting the gelling of <b>preserved</b> <b>eggs.</b> Regression analysis of the peaks of the time response starting at 50 ms following the trigger yielded an exponential tendency line that indicates the decay rate of vibration theory. Distinct vibration analysis revealed that a decay below 80 represents complete gelling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis reveals an area under curve of 0. 963, a cut-off point at 0. 000 (x axis) and 0. 882 (y axis), and a decay rate of 84. 7995. The accuracy was 96. 7 %.

5000|$|Megaloolithid {{eggs with}} {{multiple}} layers of eggshell have been preserved in the fossil record. Multilayered fossil eggs resemble those of modern forms in sometimes having incomplete extra layers and pore canals that don't properly align. The misalignment of the pore canals can prevent oxygen from getting to the embryo and cause it to suffocate. [...] The term ovum in ovo {{has been used for}} multilayered dinosaur eggs although this is inaccurate use of the term. The greater abundance may indicate that these eggs were more prone to such pathologies, but are most likely due to a larger sample size of them.

50|$|Ammonite eggs in well-aerated sea bottoms {{probably}} would have quickly been broken down by scavengers and aerobic bacteria. Fossil evidence supports this general idea since swarms of hatchling ammonitellae fossils are known {{although there are no}} associated egg fossils. One of the <b>eggs</b> <b>preserved</b> in the Kimmeridge Clay ammonite egg cluster K1486 bears crystalline phosphate on its surface. Since phosphate is mobile only in organic form this suggests the eggs were already decaying before fossilization. The fact that the ammonite eggs survived decomposition to become fossilized suggests two possibilities. The first is that the eggs were transported from the well-aerated location they were originally laid in to low-oxygen waters near the sea floor. The second possibility is that the eggs were laid in waters whose oxygen abundance varied, possibly by season.|$|R

Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species.

50|$|Multiple {{instances}} of fossil ammonite eggs {{have been observed}} in the fossil record. However, prior to 2009 only two credible examples of ammonite eggs had been reported to the scientific literature. The first was an apparent clutch of <b>eggs</b> <b>preserved</b> in the sediment that filled in the living chamber of a harpoceratid {{dating back to the}} Toarcian age of the Jurassic period. This specimen was discovered in a concretion incorporated into glacial drift that came from the Baltic region. The ammonite itself was a fully grown individual with a macroconch shell. The second possible example was another adult macroconch of Ceratites from the Muschelkalk of Germany, which dated to the Upper Anisian of the Triassic period. An additional less plausible case has been reported from Kamchatka where an egg clutch was purportedly associated with a Desmophyllites dating back to the early Triassic. However a later summary of ammonite embryos from the same age and location does not mention any eggs being known and Desmophyllites is a Late Cretaceous genus, so this report is not reliable.|$|R

The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew in Mongolia. Since then many new nesting sites have been found {{all over the world}} and a system of classification based on the structure of eggshell was developed in China before gradually diffusing into the West.
