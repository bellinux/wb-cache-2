40|$|In seismic {{reflection}} shooting, some of {{the traces}} correspond to relatively large angles of incidence, especially when the method of common <b>depth</b> <b>point</b> is used. In an effort to observe {{the effect of the}} angles of incidence on traces with common <b>depth</b> <b>point,</b> approximations of synthetic seismograms at oblique incidence with and without multiples were constructed. The theory of constructing a synthetic seismogram is briefly explained, under the assumption that S waves do not exist. After obtaining three approximations of synthetic seismograms for assumed shot point to geophone distances of 400, 800, and 1200 feet respectively, the effects of initial suppression, filter, and automatic gain control were simulated. The three synthetic seismograms so obtained were staked together to obtain a single seismogram for various comparisons. It is concluded that as the angles of incidence of the shot traces increase, so do the differences with respect to a trace shot at normal incidence. From the comparison of the stacked traces it is proved that the common <b>depth</b> <b>point</b> stacking process leads to a better definition of the character of the reflections, in comparison with the conventional process...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method to obtain amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) and amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) curves at {{selected}} <b>depth</b> <b>points</b> using the three attributes generated by the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) stack, the emergence angle and the two hypotetical wavefront curvatures associated to each zero-offset ray simulated. Our approach combines the CRS stack/inversion process applied to multicoverage data {{and the use of}} a kinematic Kirchhoff migration to achieve true-amplitudes (TA) at assigned <b>depth</b> <b>points</b> in the mi-grated images. The proposed method consists of the following steps: (i) apply the CRS process to the given multicoverage data; the obtained CRS attributes are then used to produce a simple macro-velocity depth model; (ii) perform an unweighted Kirchhoff mi-gration for imaging purposes only; for selected points on target reflectors in the migrated image, we use ray tracing within the macro-velocity model to determine, by ray tracing, common-reflection-point (CRP) gathers that belong to the input data; for these rays, we compute the incident angles and the geometrical spreadings; (iii) go back to CRP gathers and compensate the amplitudes for geometrical spreading. The whole process permits to construct AVA curves on the assigned CRP’s. In summary, our method is designed to aggregate amplitude information on selected points of a reflector, after a purely kinematic image (migration) has been obtained. The method is tested on a synthetic inhomogeneous layered model with encouraging results. ...|$|R

The basic assumptions made from the approximation (Eq.  4) are that the earth has approximately horizontal layers at each common <b>depth</b> <b>point</b> and that each layer is described by both acoustic and shear impedances. Once acoustic impedance Zp and shear impedance Zs volumes have been created, they can be easily used to create other useful volumes, such as Poisson impedance, PI and lambda-rho, λρ and mu-rho, µρ, which are the product of density and the Lamé elastic constants λ and µ (Goodway et al. 1997).|$|E

The method requires no prior bathymetric map and only assumes that the autonomous underwater vehicle {{has the ability to}} sparsely sense the local water column depth, such as with a bottom-looking Doppler velocity log.

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} (RT) {{problems in}} which the source function includes a scattering-like integral are typical two-points boundary problems. Their solution via differential equations implies to make hypotheses on the solution itself, namely the specific intensity I(tau;n) of the radiation field. On the contrary, integral methods require to make hypotheses on the source function S(tau). It looks of course more reasonable to make hypotheses on the latter because one can expect that the run of S(tau) with depth be smoother than that of I(tau;n).

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we describe}} an image-based framework for 3 D surface reconstruction {{by a combined}} analysis of reflectance, polarisation, and sparse depth data. An error functional consisting of several error terms related to the measured reflectance and polarisation properties and the depth data is minimised in order to compute a dense surface gradient field and in a subsequent step a dense 3 D surface profile. The error terms related to reflectance and polarisation directly depend on the surface gradients, while the depth-related error term describes the deviation between the 3 D surface profile implied by the surface gradient field and the measured <b>depth</b> <b>points.</b> Hence, we suggest an optimisation scheme that simultaneously adapts the surface gradients to the measured reflectance and polarisation data and to the surface slopes implied by depth differences between pairs of <b>depth</b> <b>points.</b> To increase the robustness of the optimisation scheme it is implemented as a multi-scale approach, thus providing a result largely independent of the provided initialisation. In our system the sparse depth data are provided by a correlation-based stereo vision algorithm, but in principle arbitrary sources of depth data are possible. We evaluate the algorithm based on synthetic ground truth data, demonstrating that the combined approach increases the accuracy of 3 D surface reconstruction, compared to the result obtained by applying either of the techniques alone. Furthermore, we report 3 D reconstruction results for a raw forged iron surface and compare them to ground truth depth data obtained {{by means of a}} laser focus profilometer. This evaluation yields a depth accuracy (root-mean-square deviation) of our approach of 62 µm, which is of the same order of magnitude as the intrinsic roughness of the metallic surface. ...|$|R

3000|$|The {{effect of}} {{anisotropy}} on AVO synthetic modelling in Niger delta Derby field has been attempted. The {{objective of the}} study is to determine if anisotropic synthetic model can improve amplitude versus offset (AVO) analysis of CDP gathers by comparing them with isotropic synthetic model over shale-gas sand boundaries. Well logs and common <b>depth</b> <b>point</b> (CDP) processed gathers were used for the analysis. The result of the present study revealed that reservoirs in Derby field are overlain by intrinsically anisotropic shale and as such, anisotropic synthetic modelling yields the best fit to CDP gathers than the isotropic synthetic model. However, in conventional processing for AVO analysis, isotropic rather than anisotropic earth models are usually assumed, which could possibly affect the outcome of an AVO-based analysis at large offsets. Therefore, the effect of anisotropy should be incorporated and properly accounted for using the anisotropic synthetic modelling in the processing and interpretation workflows for quantitative AVO analysis in Niger delta to optimise hydrocarbon recovery.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} angle {{dependent}} reflectivity is retrieved {{in the presence}} of dip by means of prestack migration. We start with reviewing the downward extrapolation process and show how angle dependent reflectivity can be extracted via the generalized imaging principle. Next, in a simple example with a constant-dip reflector, we demonstrate hat the angle dependent reflection curves are shifted over a distance qual to the magnitude of the dip. In practice, local dip-angle information should be extracted from the structural image by using the conventional imaging principle. This dip information should be taken into account in the final result, yielding a correctly positioned angle dependent reflection coefficient curve for each grid point of interest. Imaging angle dependent reflectivity via prestack migration appears a rigorous alternative to AVO related methods, particularly in geologically complex structures. Amplitude information for each grid point (<b>depth</b> <b>point),</b> directly obtained as a function of angle (AVA) or ray parameter, can be used for subsequent seatigraphic and lithologic inversion in a target zone...|$|E

In this survey, a total of ca. 552  km of seismic reflection records with very-high vertical-resolution were collected using two GI guns (with a total volume of 12  L). As a receiver, a 5100 -m streamer cable was used. The shot, receiver and common <b>depth</b> <b>point</b> (CDP) intervals were 50, 25 and 12.5  m, respectively. The GI guns and the streamer cable were towed at depths of 5 and 8  m below sea level, respectively; these towing depths are shallower than those of conventional Kairei seismic reflection surveys (10 and 15  m) and provide broader frequency bandwidth because of higher ghost-notch frequencies. Broader frequency bandwidth is advantageous for not only analyzing fault characteristics with high resolution but also estimating seismic attenuation, especially for methods in the frequency domain such as the spectral ratio method.|$|E
