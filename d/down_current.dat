2500|$|During {{the periods}} of glacial retreat, there were periods of stability. [...] During these times, glacial lakes formed along the {{southern}} borders of the glaciers, bound into the Lake Michigan Basin by the recessional moraines. [...] Four major glacial lake periods created the Indiana Dunes. [...] They are the glacial Lake Chicago (14,000 YBP), Glacial Lake Algonquin (9,000 YBP), glacial Lake Chippewa (7,000 YBP), and Lake Nipissing stage (4,000 YBP). [...] Once the glaciers had fully retreated from the Lake Michigan basin, post Lake Nipissing stage, the same factors that created the dunes south of the current shoreline, expanded the existing shoreline. [...] The littoral currents or Longshore drift transport sand southward along {{the eastern shore of}} Lake Michigan. [...] As they encounter streams bringing water from inland, sandbars are created, pointing <b>down</b> <b>current,</b> either southward if the shore is north to south or westward {{along the southern}} shore itself. [...] If the currents are strong enough as they were when the Glenwood Shoreline was created, shallow inland bays would be formed with a wide sand spit between it and the open lake. [...] Over time, the sand spits would merge with the far shoreline forming interdunal ponds. [...] Each sand spit would become a dune ridge. [...] As the ponds filled in and wind built the outer sand ridges higher, the ponds would dry up and only a stream would remain, as the Little Calumet River does today, just south the state and national parks. [...] As the shoreline moved northward, new ridges formed, additional streams, now slower and less powerful formed and the process duplicated itself. [...] To the west of the Indiana Dunes, Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana forms a western border to the dunes. [...] Here the same process is at work, only the littoral drift is again south, but along the western shore, pushing the sand and sand spits eastward. [...] Today, it is the remnants of the marsh lands and inter-dunal or inter-sand spit lakes that have formed this region over 40,000 years.|$|E

50|$|A boost {{converter}} (step-up converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter that steps up voltage (while stepping <b>down</b> <b>current)</b> from its input (supply) to its output (load). It is {{a class of}} switched-mode power supply (SMPS) containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor) {{and at least one}} energy storage element: a capacitor, inductor, or the two in combination. To reduce voltage ripple, filters made of capacitors (sometimes in combination with inductors) are normally added to such a converter's output (load-side filter) and input (supply-side filter).|$|E
5000|$|Shots {{are more}} {{difficult}} to use in strong currents. The weight may drag along the seabed especially if the divers pull on the line as they descend. To avoid this the shot is often positioned upstream of an obstruction at the dive site so the obstruction prevents it dragging. A further problem is caused by diving at slack water; the direction of the current reverses during slack, so although the weight may be securely up current of the obstruction before slack, after the tide turns the weight is <b>down</b> <b>current</b> of the obstruction and may drag.|$|E

5000|$|Constructional {{margins are}} the [...] "classic" [...] mode of passive margin {{sedimentation}}. Normal sedimentation {{results from the}} transport and deposition of sand, silt, and clay by rivers via deltas and redistribution of these sediments by longshore currents. The nature of sediments can change remarkably along a passive margin, due to interactions between carbonate sediment production, clastic input from rivers, and alongshore transport. Where clastic sediment inputs are small, biogenic sedimentation can dominate especially nearshore sedimentation. The Gulf of Mexico passive margin along the southern United States {{is an excellent example}} of this, with muddy and sandy coastal environments <b>down</b> <b>current</b> (west) from the Mississippi River Delta and beaches of carbonate sand to the east. The thick layers of sediment gradually thin with increasing distance offshore, depending on subsidence of the passive margin and the efficacy of offshore transport mechanisms such as turbidity currents and submarine channels.|$|E

50|$|The rapid {{transition}} from a non-conducting to a conductive state produces a brief emission of light and a sharp crack or snapping sound. A spark is created when the applied electric field exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the intervening medium. For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level. At the beginning stages, free electrons in the gap (from cosmic rays or background radiation) are accelerated by the electrical field. As they collide with air molecules, they create additional ions and newly freed electrons which are also accelerated. At some point, thermal energy will provide a much greater source of ions. The exponentially-increasing electrons and ions rapidly cause regions of {{the air in the}} gap to become electrically conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown. Once the gap breaks <b>down,</b> <b>current</b> flow is limited by the available charge (for an electrostatic discharge) or by the impedance of the external power supply. If the power supply continues to supply current, the spark will evolve into a continuous discharge called an electric arc. An electric spark can also occur within insulating liquids or solids, but the breakdown mechanisms are significantly different than for sparks in gases.|$|E
