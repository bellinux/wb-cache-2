Recentemente, foram introduzidos no Brasil novos materiais genéticos para avaliação da adaptação em relação ao potencial de rendimento e composição do óleo essencial. No presente trabalho, foram comparadas essas características em cultivares das espécies Mentha x piperita L. (cv. Grapefruit Mint <b>e</b> <b>cv.</b> Persian Mint Field), M. suaveolens Ehrh. (cv. Hillarys Sweet Lemon Mint), M. spicata L. (cv. Mentol Mint), M. aquatica L. (cv. Common Mint) e M. arvensis L. (cv. Banana Mint), durante o verão e inverno em Curitiba (PR). O rendimento médio das cultivares no verão foi aproximadamente o dobro do rendimento observado no inverno. Duas cultivares de Mentha x piperita L. (cv.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the inter-day reproducibility of cutaneous thermal hyperaemia, as assessed using integrating-probe laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), in young and older men. A secondary objective was to identify the most reproducible form of data expression. Cutaneous thermal hyperaemia was assessed on the forearm in 14 young (25 ± 1 years) and 14 older (65 ± 1 years) men, using integrating-probe LDF. The test was repeated 7 - 14 days later. The baseline, initial peak, and plateau phases of the data traces were identified and expressed as raw cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC), CVC normalised to baseline (%CVCBL), and CVC normalised to 44 °C vasodilatation (%CVCMAX). Reproducibility was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics. The inter-day reproducibility was dependent on how the data were expressed. The reproducibility of the initial peak and plateau was equally acceptable in both young and older adults when data were expressed as %CVCMAX (<b>e.</b> g., <b>CVs</b> ranging from 4 - 11 %). However, the baseline phase was poorly reproducible in both groups irrespective of the data presentation method used (<b>e.</b> g., <b>CVs</b> ranging from 25 - 35 %). Furthermore, expressing data as raw CVC or as %CVCBL generally showed poor reproducibility for both groups and all phases of the test (<b>e.</b> g., <b>CVs</b> ranging from 15 - 39 %).

By eliminating components with long startup times such as a phaselocked loop, all the blocks in a pulsed-UWB transceiver can be disabled during the interval between pulses.

Participants were presented with written words matched for the number of syllables and comprising either one vowel cluster less than the number of syllables (hiatus words, e. g. création) or the same number of vowel clusters (control words, e. g. crépiter). Participants were slower and less accurate for hiatus than control stimuli, be it words (Experiments 1, 3) or pseudowords (Experiment 2). More importantly, this hiatus effect was present even when the stimuli had a morphemic boundary falling within the hiatus (e. g. ré-agir).

Live attenuated viruses have been demonstrated to induce very efficient protective immune responses, albeit most of the time protection was circumscribed to homologous ASFV challenges. However, their use in the field is still far from a reality, mainly due to safety concerns. In this study we compared the course of the in vivo infection caused by two homologous ASFV strains: the virulent E 75 and the cell cultured adapted strain <b>E</b> 75 <b>CV</b> 1, obtained from adapting E 75 to grow in the CV 1 cell-line.

40|$|When social {{influence}} {{plays a key}} role in the diffusion of new product, the value of a customer often goes beyond her own product purchase. We posit that a customer’s value (CV) comes not only from her purchase value (PV) but also from her influence value (IV) (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>CV</b> = PV + IV). Therefore, a customer’s value can be far greater than her purchase value if she exerts a considerable influence on others. Building on a two-segment influential–imitator asymmetric influence model, we develop a model framework to derive closed-form expressions for PV, IV, and CV by customer segment as well as time of adoption, and we examine their comparative statics with respect to the diffusion parameters. A key parameter of our model framework is the social apportioning parameter, �, which determines the credit a customer receives by influencing other potential adopters. We develop an endogenous method for determining � as a function of the new product diffusion parameters.

The rheological properties of these mixtures, when hydrated, were studied at small deformations in shear and at large deformations in biaxial extension.

The assay Is simple and precise, with IntrabatchCV of < 10 % downto 0. 1 mull-mt. unlt/L. When compared with free thyroxin, totalthyroxin,and trilodothyronine measurements In 142 patIents, the present assay most sensitively Indicated hyperthyroldismand, in conjunctionwith free thyroxin,most sensitively indicated hypothyroidism. Free thyroxinwas the most specificassay (lowest number of falsely Increased or decreased results) in detecting thyroid disorders, with a specificIty of 93. 6 % as compared wIth 85. 1 % forTSH, 81. 9 % for thyroxin, and 77. 6 % for trllodothyronine. Recently, several sensitive assays {{have been developed}} for measuring thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSII) with use of monoclonal antibodies. ’ In most of the commer-daily available assays inimunoradiometric techniques are used (1 - 7), for which assay sensitivities down to 0. 08 miii-mt. unitlL are claimed. However, these assays have poor precision for the lower TSH concentrations, and their maxi-mum practical working sensitivity (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>CV</b> 10 %) is 0. 5 mu-mt. unitfL (8), which is within the euthyroid range. Sensitivity can be improved by using a chemiluminescent (9) or a modified fluorescent label, such as the europium label used in the dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoro-immunoassay (DKInA) system of LKB-Wallac, P.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{overlapping}} spheres (OS) {{was applied for}} the estimation of stability constants (β 2) of sets of (binary) copper(II) bis-complexes with 1, 2 -diaminoethanes (N = 14), aliphatic amino acids and their N-alkylated derivatives (N = 11), and naturally occurring amino acids (N = 9), along {{with a set of}} 16 mixed (ternary) copper(II) bis-complexes with naturally occurring amino acids. The central sphere, with the radius, Rv, 300 or 400 pm, was situated at the copper atom. The OS volumes (V*) of the central sphere and the van der Waals spheres of the surrounding atoms were calculated from the structures of bis- or corresponding mono-complexes and correlated with the log β 2 values. Both approaches yielded similar results, differing in the reproduction of stability constants by less than 20 %. Bivariate linear regression was performed for mixed complexes, using (V* 1 + V* 2) and (V* 1 – V* 2) as independent variables (V* 1 and V* 2 correspond to the OS values for the two constituting chelate rings). The bivariate linear regression gave r = 0. 961 and the reproduction of experimental data from 0. 00 to 0. 16 log β units (S. <b>E.</b> <b>cv</b> = 0. 08 log β units) ...|$|E
40|$|Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT 2 i) are a novel {{category}} of oral antidiabetic drugs that suppress renal glucose reabsorption and increase renal glucose excretion, thus lowering plasma glucose levels. This unique mechanism of SGLT 2 i action is insulin independent, thus improving glycemic control without promoting hypoglycemia {{in the absence}} of exogenously administered insulin. The present narrative review addresses the impact of SGLT 2 i on several cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels, lipids, blood pressure, body weight, serum uric acid and arterial stiffness. These drugs may also favorably modulate cardiac and renal function via their effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, diuresis, fluid and sodium retention, myocardial function, vascular resistance and ‘fuel’ metabolism. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, the first published large CV outcome SGLT 2 i trial, empagliflozin significantly reduced the primary composite outcome (i. <b>e.</b> <b>CV</b> death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) and all-cause death as well as hospitalization for heart failure. In addition, empagliflozin was associated with a slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events than was placebo when added to standard care in patients at high CV risk. Ongoing CV outcome trials involving other SGLT 2 i will help establish whether the reported CV and microvascular risk benefits are compound-specific or drug class effects...|$|E

A normal-leafed (<b>cv.</b> <b>E.</b> F. B. 33) and a semi-leafless winter pea (cv. James) were grown as sole crops and in intercrops with oilseed rape or triticale. The two ploughing depths were short-term shallow ploughing to a soil depth of 8 - 10 cm and deep ploughing to 25 - 27 cm. The normal leafed winter pea <b>cv.</b> <b>E.</b> F. B. 33 showed a better weed suppressive ability than James. Moreover, winter pea-triticale intercrops were more effective than winter pea-oilseed rape intercrops in suppressing weeds.
