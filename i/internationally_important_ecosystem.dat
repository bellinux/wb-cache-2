25|$|The {{county has}} three major rivers running through it: the Barrow, the Liffey and the Boyne. The Grand Canal crosses the county from Lyons {{on the east}} to Rathangan and Monasterevin on the west. A {{southern}} branch joins the Barrow navigation at Athy. The Royal Canal stretches across {{the north of the}} county along the border with Meath. Pollardstown Fen is the largest remaining calcareous fen in Ireland, covering an area of 220 hectares and is recognised as an <b>internationally</b> <b>important</b> fen <b>ecosystem</b> with unique and endangered plant communities, and declared a National Nature Reserve in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|A haor ( [...] হাওর) is a wetland {{ecosystem}} {{in the north}} eastern part of Bangladesh which physically is a bowl or saucer shaped shallow depression, {{also known as a}} backswamp. In a country where one third of all area can be termed as wetlands, the haor basin is an <b>internationally</b> <b>important</b> wetland <b>ecosystem,</b> which is situated in Sunamganj, Habiganj and Moulvibazar districts and Sylhet Sadar Upazila, as well as Kishoreganj and Netrokona districts outside the core haor area. It is a mosaic of wetland habitats, including rivers, streams and irrigation canals, large areas of seasonally flooded cultivated plains, and hundreds of haors and beels. This zone contains about 400 haors and beels, varying in size from a few hectares to several thousand hectares.|$|R
40|$|Groundwater in Chalk {{catchments}} {{is a major}} {{resource that}} also helps support <b>internationally</b> <b>important</b> habitats and <b>ecosystems.</b> Its dual porosity and dual permeability properties, coupled with large-scale structural features (such as hard rock layers and marls), produce a highly complex hydrogeological system. Recent impacts from groundwater flooding as well as vulnerability to drought have raised questions over the ability of traditional approaches to model these aquifers. Current work on near-surface hydrological processes has highlighted {{the importance of the}} soil and weathered zone for controlling recharge rates. In addition, karst-like features, sedimentary deposits and valley bottom processes govern stream–aquifer interaction and present a challenge in their representation in any modelling system. Methods that have, and are being, developed to incorporate these features, and their use in modelling Chalk catchments, are described. These are required in order to address major challenges, such as groundwater flooding and drought impacts, both of which could become more frequent and intense as a result of climate change. ...|$|R
