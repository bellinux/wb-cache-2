I hoped to create a space that was both familiar and strange, both welcoming and suffocating, {{as it was for}} me during my childhood. However, the stories and characters resisted my pigeonholing, and as a result, the majority of the thesis is not set in the agrarian small town I thought it would be. Instead, it follows characters that carry this landscape with them. ^ Many stories in this collection shadow a protagonist as he or she lives away from a tightknit community and searches for belonging in an urban setting. Others engage with those who stay put, exploring how they grapple with the unique blend of financial poverty and communal richness of their towns. Regardless of place, though, each protagonist is at a pivotal moment in his or her life, poised on the brink of discovery. In this way, the stories read like coming of age tales. ^ These stories are thematically linked as well, obsessing on, among other things, religious conservatism, sexual taboo, physical violence, and family trauma. These themes place this collection alongside the work of rural noirists such as William Gay, Bonnie Jo Campbell, and Frank Bill. However, not every story in How Savagely They Loved is driven by drugs, danger, and crime. Some explore the quieter struggles of the contemporary rural – relying on natural resources, handling illness in close families, and keeping the bills paid. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in avian {{community}} ecology is an understanding of diversity patterns. The diversity of birds is especially important in endangered ecosystems because birds are good indicator species, and their presence could give conservation biologists and wildlife managers clues about the overall health of these systems. I studied the richness, abundance, and community composition of songbirds in two endangered ecosystems in temperate North America, riparian willow habitat of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), and in a restored tallgrass prairie in central Iowa, Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge (Neal Smith NWR). I was especially interested in the habitat variables across time and space that influenced avian diversity patterns in these two areas. It was also my goal to offer wildlife biologists and managers {{advice on how to}} maximize diversity in both endangered ecosystems. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the importance of analyzing flyover data (swallows used as a case study) in order to elucidate further questions about diversity in avian community and landscape ecology. Vegetation height and density were two important variables that help predict avian diversity in both the GYE and at Neal Smith NWR. The age of a restored prairie habitat and litter depth was also very important in shaping the community composition of birds in tallgrass prairies. However, birds respond to different variables in their habitat based on the varying life history characteristics across species (e. g. nesting and foraging preferences), and this makes it difficult to offer general suggestions on how to maximize avian diversity in any natural system. I recommend offering a variety of habitat types and structures in order to attract as many species as possible. It is also critically important to consider the habitat needs of the most endangered birds in each of these ecosystems. Avian biologists should continue to study diversity trends in various systems, and come to a clearer understanding of the specific habitat variables that most influence the richness, abundance, and community composition of birds (habitat features, climate change, patch size etc.) ...|$|R

The result of my work is {{the evaluation of the}} cooperation between educational care center and families and to identify the limits of this cooperation. Marginally I also gained insight into the family cooperation with non-profit organizations, which {{are an important part of}} helping children with behavioral disorders. The theoretical part consists of three major entities that play a vital role in the area of behavioral disorders in children. Firstly, children with behavioral disorders are the first entity. In the first part I have tried thus shed light on the developmental aspects of adolescence and to identify the typical manifestations of this age. Also, I didn´t forget to identify specific behavioral disorders of children. The parents of these children are equally important because they take a primary role in education. I defined characteristic, basic aspects and functions of the family with these children and I described the classic characters of the family in modern times. And last but not least, I have dealt with a center of educational care - which is involved in the prevention of behavioral disturbance. This section will be interesting especially for those who don´t know this institution and have no awareness of its work. The empirical part presents the results of qualitative research, within which we addressed five employees educational care center in Domažlice and thirty parents of children with behavioral disorders.

40|$|A {{child in}} his early years, soon realizes the fact, that a pen leaves a trail. He learns that the created line {{is a result of}} his work. His {{knowledge}} is created through the transformation of previous experiences. As a child has a desire to explore, through exploration he learns and develops his skills. His expression is therefore, not limited by a line on a piece of paper, but he continues to seek new ways and that is how he discovers new learnings. The complex process by offering different artistic fields, allows children to connect various elements of the environment into a new – for him – meaningful whole. Therefore, the child's artistic expression is much more than just a product, it is an insight into his perception of the world, thinking and feeling (Lowenfeld, Brittain, 1947). In the theoretical part of the thesis, I focused on a specific segment of the artistic development of pre-school children – it is their ability to transform three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional form, and vice versa. Art is a natural development, but it is crucial that the environment is supportive and that it allows the child a variety of (art) experiences, which will provide a wide range of new challenges, findings and knowledge. Meaningful and careful preparation of the learning environment, through the use of various artistic fields, is crucial for the child’s process of thinking and his enrichment of new knowledge. I focused on the most represented art area in preschools, drawing and seemingly the contrary, sculpturing. I highlighted the characteristics of both art fields and found their connections. Drawing of the child requires a two-dimensional imaging of a three-dimensional world, while children in sculpturing get the opportunity of feeling the matter. It is the differences between drawing and sculpturing that complement each other. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the spontaneity and flexibility that art has. I have endeavored to present the process of teaching, where children have opted a free and spontaneous process, where they discover the artistic material presented to them {{and at the same time}} allow them, as individuals, to express their abilities and creativity in our society. ...|$|R
40|$|Nutrition of {{children}} of each age has its particular aspects. For the new born and infantile age it is mainly breast-feeding that is very significant. Nutrition with breast milk is ideally balanced, ensures the intake of high-quality nutrition that is well tolerated by the young organism and ensures the optimal growth and psychological development of the child. Thanks to its composition, breast milk increases the protective impact on the child with respect to infections and creates a natural bond between {{the mother and the}} child. In the Thesis, I was trying to look up decisive moments in the infantile nutrition concept both in this country and worldwide and to map the issue of breast feeding and formula feeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War up to the present. Also, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the irreplaceability of breast milk as wel as supplementing of artificial milks with probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and their importance in the nutrition {{of children}}. Objective No. 1 of the Thesis has been to look up the key points in the infantile nutrition concept in the world since the beginning of the nineteenth century and since 1945 until this day in the Czech Republic. Objective No. 2 has been to prove that infantile formula nutrition has been focusing also on the immunological aspect apart from the nutritional ones. Objective No. 3 has been to create and aducational program proposal, which can serve as a practical guide for the application of theoretical data in clinical practice. Data necessary to achieve the determined objectives have been acquired by studing, analyses and comparison of available written documents relating to the natural and formula nutrition of infants. Most of these documents have been intended for the educational purposes at secondary school and universities in the Czech Republic. Also, data heve been taken from publications for parents and broad public published since 1945 until this day. By way of illustration, certain charts containing schemes of artificial nutrition corresponding to the time of creation have been used.

We may find out, nay, we will find out before very long the essential mechanisms of mammalian kidney function, but the general problem of excretion can be solved only when excretory organs are studied wherever we find them and in all their essential modifications. Such studies will be sure, moreover, to expand and deepen our insight into problems of the human kidney and will prove of value also from the narrowest utilitarian point of view.For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied. Many years ago when my teacher, Christian Bohr, was interested in the respiratory mechanism of the lung and devised the method of studying the exchange through each lung separately, he found that a certain kind of tortoise possessed a trachea dividing into the main bronchi high up in the neck, and we used to say as a laboratory joke that this animal had been created expressly for the purposes of respiration physiology. I have no doubt that there is quite a number of animals which are similarly [...] "created" [...] for special physiological purposes, but I am afraid that most of them are unknown to the men for whom they were [...] "created," [...] and we must apply to the zoologists to find them and lay our hands on them."August Krogh The Progress of Physiology, The American Journal of Physiology, 1929. 90(2) pp. 243-251 ...|$|E

[...] Moe points out that Roosevelt, [...] "an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector." [...] Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was:All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters. Particularly, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> my conviction that militant tactics have no place in the functions of any organization of government employees. Upon employees in the Federal service rests the obligation to serve the whole people, whose interests and welfare require orderliness and continuity in the conduct of government activities. This obligation is paramount. Since their own services {{have to do with the}} functioning of the Government, a strike of public employees manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of Government until their demands are satisfied.

In general population the prevalence reaches 30 %. But smoking prevalence among general practitioners for children and adolescents is the same as smoking prevalence in general population. The results of the research indicate the fact that teachers set a better example for their social surroundings than physicians. Physicians, on the contrary, use more preventive activities, provide information about possibilities of quitting smoking support and cooperate with institutions dealing with prevention and quitting smoking. The views of teachers (doctors) smokers and non-smokers on prevention administration are different. Lifelong non-smokers are most concerned in smoking reduction, former smokers take a lesser share and current smokers bring the least contribution to smoking reduction...|$|R

In this paper I am arguing that female rappers have a distinct way of creating space for themselves in the rap game.

However, there is a steady growing pool of hungry female rappers that refuse to compromise their identity in order to be fully accepted. <b>I</b> also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> that female rappers are never fully accepted into the rap game, but that is part of the reason for their large impact. Some one that completely blends in makes for an element of normal and commonplace that most rappers strive to surpass. By the mere fact of being female rappers, they are not commonplace or ordinary and this allows them to enter Hip Hop from a unique position. They are at once both insiders and outsiders. That is why I am here to analyze lyrics to see how they make sense of being spectators and performers in the same community...|$|R
40|$|The {{emotions}} {{that come with}} death and dying, such as grief, sadness and anger are experienced by everyone {{at some point in}} their lifetime. Because death is such a sensitive subject, many people are hesitant to explain the process to children. Children, like adults, experience loss and it is important that they understand how to cope with the issue if and when it affects them. Soon after the death, mourning begins. The mourning process serves as an opportunity for individuals to express their emotions after a loss through their own traditions and rituals. For many individuals, it is an important part of saying good-bye and it helps them adapt to life-changing events. These traditions and rituals can sometimes correlate with cultural beliefs and values. Because of the correlation, one’s culture and social support systems play an important role in the mourning phase as many of the mourning traditions rely on cultural beliefs and values. Culture is an important concept because it encompasses attitudes, beliefs and values that people use to define themselves. During the mourning period, specific ceremonies, customs, and religious traditions serve as guides for people to help deal with the loss of a loved one. Culture is the foundation that many people rely on during a time of tragedy because it brings families, friends and acquaintances together. In Cambodian (Khmer) culture, after the death of a loved one, there is an elaborate process for the funeral rituals and traditions. Similar to other Asian cultures, Cambodians are collectivists and identify themselves with a group which often consists of family members. Many Cambodians are Buddhists who, unlike the Western culture, view death as the end of a cycle and not the end of life. Buddhists believe that all living things evolve in a cycle of birth, illness, old age, death, and reincarnation. This cycle is also known as Samsara. Buddhist monks play a significant role when mourning a death. More importantly, they play a more critical role by helping to guide the soul after death. My project, involved creation of a fictional children’s book designed to help children and adolescents learn how to cope with the passing of a parent. The main character, a Khmer-American girl, must learn to cope with the loss of her parents, specifically the death of her mother from a chronic illness. The book is designed to reflect many of my own personal experiences during a time in my life when I had to cope with similar losses. After these losses, I was encouraged to learn more about my own culture and traditions. It has helped me to view loss, grief, spirituality and bereavement from a different perspective. I also believe it is important that children and adolescents to learn how to cope with the passing of a parent, or a special person. Growing up with a bicultural background (Khmer-American), <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the importance of one’s culture and the significant role it plays during a time of tragedy. The purpose of the project is to aid children who have suffered through similar tragedies as they journey through the healing process. To my knowledge no similar book has been published...|$|R
