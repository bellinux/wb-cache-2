5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he died at}} a {{relatively}} early age and his wife died shortly after him, his orphaned children were forced to live with other relatives or <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Martha married Judge Charles H. Constable; together they looked after many of her younger siblings until they married or found work. Her brother Charles Hinde became a successful businessman and riverboat captain. One of Captain Hinde's accomplishments was investing in the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California. Hinde's grandson, Frederick Zimmerman, built the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel near the Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of mankind, food was important simply {{for the purpose of}} nourishment. As primates walked the Earth, they solely consumed food for a source of energy as they had to hunt and forage because food was not easily on hand. By early humans <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> they had figured out that they needed a high energy diet to keep going on a daily basis to survive.|$|R
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but usually only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing {{to be left behind}} to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E
50|$|They breed {{all year}} round but egg laying usually peaks in January, tow months on from {{the onset of the}} rains in {{southern}} Africa. The clutch size is between 2-7, incubation is carried out by both sexes and takes 11-12 days. Both parents feed the chicks on green grass seeds and termites, until they fledge after 17-21 days. They are capable of <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> a week after fledging, becoming fully independent a week later.|$|R

50|$|Female {{southern}} leaf-tailed geckos usually lay {{one or two}} soft-shelled eggs in late spring. These {{eggs are}} up to 28 mm in length. The eggs are buried in moist soil or leaf litter to prevent their drying out. Left to develop unattended, 3 months later the offspring hatch and begin <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> catching insects within {{only a few days}} of birth. They take up to two years to fully mature and then can survive for up to eight more years.|$|R
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> as the Turkish army approached the capital of Yerevan. At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of Yerevan. Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army. The opposing armies met on May 28, 1918, near Sardarapat. The battle was a major military success for the Armenian army as it was able to halt the invading Turkish forces. The Armenians also stood their ground at the Battle of Kara Killisse and at the Battle of Bash Abaran. The creation of the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party. However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E
50|$|The most common, unorganized water fight; {{everyone}} <b>fends</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> {{and there}} are no particular rules apart from no intentional physical contact between players. In general, players are allowed as many refills as available and gameplay continues for as long as players are willing. There are no clear winners in a soakfest, though group consensus may declare an individual or group of players 'leaders' based on general ability to deliver more water onto others as opposed to receiving it themselves.|$|R
50|$|The sand {{flounder}} feeds off a yolk-sac attached to its under surface {{until they are}} capable of <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> As an adult it is adapted to feed best at night on sand or mud. They are ambush predators, going unnoticed by camouflage and then attacking their prey when it comes near. They eat a variety of bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as crabs, brittlestars, shrimps, worms, whitebait, shellfish and tiny fishes located by touch and vision. They also ingest mud detritus and seaweed while feeding.|$|R

5|$|Hinde {{attended}} {{elementary and}} middle school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town his father founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle {{for a year and a}} half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother. Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an {{emigration}} office there, Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E
50|$|Vaquitas are {{estimated}} to live about 20 years in ideal conditions. They mature sexually at 1.3 m long, as early as 3 years old, but more likely at 6. Reproduction occurs during late spring or early summer. Their gestation period is between 10 and 11 months. They have seasonal reproduction, and usually have one calf in March. The inter-birth period, or elapsed time between offspring birth, is between 1 and 2 years. The young are then nursed for about 6 to 8 months until {{they are capable of}} <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
50|$|World War I saw the {{introduction}} of new style of fighting on the battlefields, trench warfare. Soldiers fighting in the trenches were given hot meals, when possible, under the cover of darkness, during the day they <b>fended</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and ate bully beef and biscuits and contrary to all the stories being passed down, they were also provided cheese, jam and bread. When relieved from the trenches soldiers were fed hot meals in the rest areas at the rear. The legend of Bully Beef and Biscuits was born.|$|R

50|$|TNR {{programs}} {{improve the}} welfare of the cats involved in many ways. They prevent the birth of kittens, who would be at risk of an early death in the wild. Adult female cats are no longer burdened with cycles of repeatedly giving birth to and caring <b>for</b> kittens while <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Medical conditions such as infections, dental issues, and flea treatments are attended to when the cats are neutered. Spaying and neutering also increases their life expectancy; the cats are no longer subject to certain cancers, and the chances of being hit by a car or injured in a fight drop a great deal.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the annual}} death rate {{gradually}} {{dropped from a}} high of 29,000 in 2003 to 18,000 in 2007, the number of PLWHA remained at 320,000 from 2004 through 2007 [...] The impact of the disease extended to the children of those affected and the plight of orphaned and abandoned children demanded attention. In the first quarter of 2005, the Centre reported finding almost 300 OVC residing in the 39 villages attended by home based caregivers; that number more than doubled by early 2007. The caregivers reported an increasing number of child headed households; children were <b>fending</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and often taking care of younger siblings. Sister Juliana and the Centre responded by implementing programs to meet their special needs.|$|R
25|$|The Acadians, who had mostly <b>fended</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> on the {{northern}} and eastern shores since {{they were allowed to}} return after 1764, were traditionally isolated from the English speakers that dominated the rest of the province. Government services were often not available in French, and the infrastructure in predominantly francophone areas was noticeably less evolved than {{in the rest of the}} province. This changed with the election of premier Louis Robichaud in 1960. He embarked on the ambitious Equal Opportunity Plan in which education, rural road maintenance, and health care fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage of all areas of the province. Teachers were awarded equal rates of pay regardless of enrollment.|$|R
