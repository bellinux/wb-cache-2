It is usually far from being respected in practice, even in the case of structures situated in areas dislocated and full of conflict up to areas endangered by slides, as can be supported by an example from the construction of a gas <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipeline</b> (GHPP) leading from T#inec to Jablunkov.

40|$|The {{demand of}} natural gas has been increasing. To meet the growing demand {{of natural gas}}, new gas fields must be developed. The {{transportation}} cost of gas to market {{is an important factor}} for the development of new gas fields, which are located in remote area. <b>High-pressure</b> gas <b>pipelines</b> by high strength steel pipes have been focused to find the solution of it. API grade X 100 and X 120 line pipes for <b>high-pressure</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> have been successfully developed and the application technologies have been studied to construct safe and economical pipelines.

But the theory of pipeline transportation of the paste has rarely been reported. Industrial-scale transportation experiments with diameter of 75 mm, 100 mm, and 125 mm were conducted, respectively. The results show that the pipe pressure is linearly distributed along the pipeline, but it is piecewise linear. The pipe pressure in the front end drops faster than that in the back end of the pipeline. The pipe pressure is proportional to the flow rate of calcium carbide paste.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} flow-rate in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipelines</b> {{of fluid}} power {{systems can be}} predicted by means of refined numerical models, the performance of which should be validated extensively against experimental pressure transients. However, such an approach in complex hydraulic systems can require an advanced modelling of the hydraulic, mechanical and electronic components and can therefore be cumbersome and ineffective. Experimental analysis is valuable to support the fast and complete evaluation of integrated electronic-hydraulic power systems, i. e., reciprocating pumps equipped with sophisticated regulation devices, gasoline and diesel fuel injection apparatus, anti-lock braking systems and traction-control systems. However, {{the state of the}} art only allows the unsteady high-pressure liquid flows in these systems to be characterized in terms of the pressure time-history measured at fixed locations. The situation is particularly critical for volumetric pumps, since the main mission of these components is the high-pressure instantaneous delivered flow-rate and one main aspect concerning the final judgement of their performance is related to the flow-rate ripple, which can only be evaluated approximatel. The selection of the operating principle for the flow-rate measurement in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipelines</b> can be considered challenging because miniaturized devices, capable of operating at high-pressure levels and characterized by a superior dynamic performance, are required. Obstruction meters, which relate the fluid velocity to the measured pressure drop across a calibrated orifice, offer steady measurements and are therefore not suitable for transients. On the other hand, positive displacement, turbine, and Coriolis flowmeters cannot generally be used because of their relatively low dynamic response (the cut-off frequency can reach 1 kHz) and their excessive overall sizes. As far as magnetic induction based flowmeters is concerned, they are characterized by high dynamic performance, but these meters require fluids with electrical conductivity as low as 0. 1 S/cm, and diesel oil and gasoline both have much lower conductivity than this threshold. Finally, laser Doppler velocimetry-based techniques, which have been applied to the analysis of fluid dynamic transients in gasoline injection systems ([12]), imply a high initial setup cost, and are only applicable for laminar flows. Furthermore, these measurements require a pipe section made of quartz glass and this technique cannot therefore be applied when the pressure is higher than 100 bar. Flow-rate estimations, based on instantaneous pressure measurements, seem to be the most attractive opportunity, due to the superior dynamic response and the miniaturized sizes of the pressure transducers. Having assessed that pressure wave propagation occurs along a single direction, a mathematical relation exists between the pressure and flow-rate time-histories at any pipe section. On the other hand, the flow rate time-distribution cannot be inferred from the pressure time-history, measured at a single location, when the pressure waves travel back and forth through the pipeline, as usually occurs in engineering systems. An innovative methodology has been developed to evaluate the unsteady flow-rate in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipelines,</b> on the basis of the signals from two piezoelectric pressure transducers. A first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation was derived from Euler's momentum balance and mass conservation equations, and was numerically solved to compute the instantaneous mass flow-rate. The flowmeter working principle was validated successfully through a comparison with numerical flow-rate data, which were predicted by means of a reliable one-dimensional model of a CR fuel injection system, and satisfactory accuracy and repeatability of the measurements were proved. However, the flowmeter algorithm required knowledge of the initia...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technique requires {{an understanding of the}} hazards posed by the operation of <b>high-pressure</b> CO 2 <b>pipelines.</b> To allow the appropriate safety precautions to be taken, a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of unplanned CO 2 releases is essential before the deployment of CO 2 pipelines. In this paper, we present models for the predictions of discharge rate, atmospheric expansion and dispersion due to accidental CO 2 releases from <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipelines.</b> The GERG- 2008 Equation of State (EOS) was used in the discharge and expansion models.

25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipelines</b> between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} solve the problem of water {{shortage}} in agriculture, it’s necessary to develop water-saving irrigation. Drip Irrigation is a method of applying uniform and precise amount of water directly to the root zone of the plants as per the requirement, through emitters at frequent intervals over a long period of time, via pressure pipe network. As the key device in drip irrigation systems, the emitter is to drip the pressured water in the pipeline to the root of the crops evenly and steadily, so as to guarantee the water demand for crop growth. The quality of the emitter has an important effect on the reliability, life span of the drip irrigation system and irrigation quality. Usually, the structure of the emitter channel is very complex with a dimension. Emitter’s intricate inner channel makes the flow of water have turbulent behavior. In the design of emitter structure, we use 3 D parametric CAD software SolidWorks 2012 to design labyrinth emitter. According to emitter’s hydraulic performance and its requirement for anti-clogging, we can design new channel structures by changing those dimensions. The irrigation quality of drip irrigation system is verified by emitter’s hydraulic performance. In the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipeline,</b> the water energy may dissipate after flowing through the labyrinth channel and the flow rate can be controlled to meet the water need of the crops.
