50|$|It {{was in this}} {{turbulent}} {{period of}} De la Court's life that he published almost all of his books about {{the political economy of}} Holland and the larger Dutch Republic. In the preface to the Interest van Holland, the most renowned of these books, he explicitly ascribed this publishing frenzy to the need to distract his mind from the tragedy that had hit him. The centerpiece of this body of work was the Interest of Holland, published in 1662. It contained a critical analysis of the economic success of the Dutch Republic and demonstrated how this success had been brought about by the combined effects of free competition and free (i.e. republican) government. It became a bestseller overnight. In Holland the Interest van Holland gained notoriety and infamy as a republican manifesto. Abroad the Interest was widely translated and read as an <b>explanatory</b> <b>guide</b> to the miraculous economic success of the Dutch.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{systematic}} review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing platelet (PLT) transfusion therapy identified {{gaps in the}} descriptions of trial design, variables of the PLT products transfused, and outcomes. We aimed to systematically develop a reporting guideline to aid in designing, reporting, and critiquing PLT trials. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With the use of expert opinion, a preliminary checklist of 23 items was created. The Delphi method, an iterative forecasting method, was used to achieve consensus among experts to systematically improve upon the preliminary checklist. Items were ranked for inclusion using a 7 -point Likert scale from "definitely should not" to "very important to" include. Criteria were established a priori based on the mean score: at least 5. 5 accept, 2. 6 to 5. 4 intermediate, and not more than 2. 5 eliminate. Intermediate items were edited and sent out in subsequent rounds for review. Three rounds were undertaken to determine the final checklist. RESULTS: Initially 33 experts participated, decreasing to 25 by the third round. The preliminary checklist consisted of 23 items spread over four sections: methods and intervention, PLT-specific outcomes, PLT-specific results, and PLT-specific adverse events. After three rounds of the Delphi method, the checklist was expanded and refined to include 30 items. The final checklist was further enhanced by adding an <b>explanatory</b> <b>guide.</b> CONCLUSION: Use of the Delphi method was successful in finding consensus on items to include in reports of a clinical PLT transfusion study.

40|$|Abstract) Niklas Luhmann's {{theory of}} autopoietic social systems {{challenges}} traditional social science by dissolving {{the individual as}} an analytical category {{and replacing it with}} the functional structures of social systems. The opaque complexity of this model of thought has rendered it extremely difficult to understand and apply, which has obstructed its reception on the part of empirically oriented scholars. This paper investigates the political and military strategy of Guatemala's armed forces during the 1960 s- 1990 s civil war {{from the perspective of the}} theory of autopoietic social systems. It thereby illustrates and illuminates Luhmann's highly abstract theoretical framework and demonstrates its scope and limits as an <b>explanatory</b> model <b>guiding</b> empirical research in the social sciences. By the same token, it lends moderate support to the universality claim Luhmann makes for his radical systems perspective and proposes new avenues of thought tha...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} enquiry is a positional {{paper that}} locates {{the context in}} which sports coaching research is undertaken. Embracing a physical cultural studies sensibility, the research enquiry raises critical questions about the <b>explanatory</b> framework <b>guiding</b> sports coaching research and presents a new conceptualisation for research in the ‘field’. Deploying the theory and method of articulation (Hall, 1996) and Foucault’s (1969) genealogical method, this research enquiry maps out the critical history of the sports coaching present through consideration of the social forces that comprise our conjunctural moment (Grossberg, 2006). By doing so, the impact of the liberal capitalist order prevalent in higher education in the United Kingdom – termed the ‘proto-fascist / pernicious present’ (Giroux, 2005 a; Silk and Andrews, in press) – is unpacked. Within this context, the research enquiry explicates how these various social forces congeal at, meet at, and frame the practice of sports coaching research. Through mapping sports coaching research within a corporatised higher education, the dominant or legitimate forms of sports coaching knowledge are problematised.

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} {{study is}} a work of missiology and aims to formulate a model of partnership for mission in the Anglican Communion which {{can be used as a}} critical tool in order to understand the failures of the past and enable planning for the future. Throughout the thesis a consistent method of modelling is applied. This consists of the formulation of explanatory models from the examination of real instances, and their application as exploratory models in other contexts. It is argued that the <b>explanatory</b> models <b>guiding</b> the development of mutual responsibility and interdependence between the provinces of the Anglican Communion have been insufficient. Evidence is given of their inadequacy as exploratory models. It is further argued that models developed in response to crises in the Anglican Communion do not take seriously The Anglican Way of “discerning the mind of God. ” An alternative explanatory model is distilled from the relationship between Paul and his community and the community of Christians in Philippi.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide a causal {{explanation}} of a new curriculum model (NCM) within a university college {{with a view to}} examining the changing nature of governance in higher education. Critical realist <b>explanatory</b> frameworks <b>guide</b> the structure of the thesis. Accordingly, the thesis first explores the 'efficient causes' behind the NCM, arguing that it evolved from within a broader political, economic, managerial and institutional relational network. This was to give rise to a series of significant structures and mechanisms leading to reforms in Higher Education including widening participation, decreased per capita funding, the centrality of economy and efficiency and a 'lifelong learning' agenda. This thesis also argues, using the theory of integrated institutionalism (Scott, 1995) that the legitimation of these new demands would be felt through one or more of coercive (through rules and sanctions), normative (through 'appropriateness') or mimetic (through reference to other organisations) means. Testing of the theorised demands and the nature of legitimation was undertaken through semistructured 'realist interviews' (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) with nine members of academic staff from the college. Analysis utilising NViv 07 suggests perceived demands of 'changing mission', 'college demands', 'enforcement and monitoring', 'nature of the world' and 'student population'. There exists a high degree of confirmatory evidence for the theorised demands, most especially in terms of economy, efficiency, effectiveness, widening participation and the commodification of HE. The testing of the legitimation mechanisms suggests a high degree of coercion within governance of HE...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ethics {{has been}} part of health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) from its beginning in the 1970 s, and is currently part of HTA definitions. Several methods in ethics have been used in HTA. Some approaches have been developed especially for HTA, such as the Socratic approach, which has been used {{for a wide range of}} health technologies. The Socratic approach is used in several ways, and there is a need for harmonization to promote its usability and the transferability of its results. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to stimulate experts in ethics and HTA to revise the Socratic approach. Methods: Based on the current literature and experiences in applying methods in ethics, a panel of ethics experts involved in HTA critically analyzed the limitations of the Socratic approach during a face-to-face workshop. On the basis of this analysis a revision of the Socratic approach was agreed on after deliberation in several rounds through e-mail correspondence. Results: Several limitations with the Socratic approach are identified and addressed in the revised version which consists of a procedure of six steps, 7 main questions and thirty-three <b>explanatory</b> and <b>guiding</b> questions. The revised approach has a broader scope and provides more guidance than its predecessor. Methods for information retrieval have been elaborated.

40|$|My aim in {{this thesis}} is to explain how a non-reductionist metaphysics can {{accommodate}} the causal relevance of the psychological and of the special sciences generally. According to physicalism, all behavior is caused by brain-states; given "folk-psychology", behavior (such as the waving of my hand) is caused by some psychological state. If psychological states are distinct from brain states (event dualism), then our behavior is overdetermined and this, it is claimed, is unacceptable. I argue that this consequence is not unacceptable. I claim that our <b>explanatory</b> practice should <b>guide</b> our ontological commitment. If we can offer true explanations that appeal {{to more than one}} event (or property), then we are committed to overdetermination for the event explained. I argue that accepting overdetermination is not absurd and that we can give an adequate account of causal relevance for psychological and other supervenient properties. The result is a partial defense of both property and event pluralism. Recent work by Davidson, Fodor, Jackson, Kim, Pettit and Yablo receives explicit and critical discussion...|$|R
40|$|User {{resistance}} to information system (IS) change {{is an important}} issue in the IS literature. However, despite a large body of user adoption literature, there is far less literature addressing user {{resistance to}} IS change, especially in organisational contexts. Moreover, there are still left a number of open questions regarding the why and how resistance takes place. Particularly, previous research failed to explain these questions for two reasons. First, none of the previous research explained the reasons for IS resistance from a multilevel perspective. Second, previous research, with few exceptions, was empirically conducted after IS had been implemented in organisations. Hence, it can be considered to be observations made on downstream results of the upstream resistance process. The two reasons above were used as drivers for this research at the AlphaBank during the preliminary phases of its core banking system (CBS) upgrading project. The ultimate {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a framework which will be of use to practitioners for understanding and managing resistance to IS change. Given the complexity of the resistance, <b>explanatory</b> theories <b>guiding</b> the study were argued, discussed, and developed. These guiding theories were based on the open system theory, the political variant of the interaction theory, and the status quo bias theory. The study employed an interpretivist philosophical standpoint and a collaborative practice research (CPR) was adopted. During the study, different methods were designed and conducted including informal discussions, documentation, semi-structure interviews, staff meetings and workshop. In total, twenty eight participants covering different levels of the bank’s hierarchy were involved in the study. Based on the findings, it was concluded that comprehending resistance from a multilevel lens helped the AlphaBank’s managers move beyond a search for a simple explanation of this phenomenon and enabled them to create more meaningful and actionable solutions. The findings contribute to knowledge in a multilevel model for understanding and managing resistance to IS change...|$|R
40|$|Background: As one of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} diseases globally and as an important cause of disability, depressive disorders are responsible for as many as one in every five visits to primary care. However, the true figures are unknown, as many do not seek help or know how to access help. Women suffer more than men according to surveys in Iran and other countries. Cultural variations in clinical presentation sometimes make it difficult to recognize the disorder, resulting in patients not being diagnosed and not receiving appropriate treatment and follow up. Purpose: This thesis explores how women s depression is conceptualized among Iranian people in three cities located in north-west (Tabriz), west (Ilam) and central (Tehran, capital city) Iran, representative of three major ethnic groups (Fars, Kurds, and Turks) and how this conceptualization may contribute to the help-seeking behaviour of depressed women. Methods: The thesis consists of four exploratory papers employing qualitative methods including individual interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). Paper 1 reports a pilot study using a case vignette and <b>explanatory</b> interview <b>guides</b> on Iranian people (including depressed women, clinicians and lay people). Forty three adults participated in three focus group discussions (25 participants) and 18 individual interviews in the three ethnic groups. Paper II presents an explanatory model of the community (lay people) in the three ethnic groups in Iran concerning women's depression. Thirty eight men and thirty eight women from the general population, classified by level of education participated in twelve FGDs in the aforementioned cities by using a case vignette describing a woman with major depression without psychotic features. Paper III reports interview results (25 depressed women and 14 relatives) regarding how these women and their families conceptualize the patients conditions and how their conceptualization shaped the patients help-seeking process. Paper IV reports individual interview results from 24 clinicians (six general practitioners [using case vignette], 14 psychiatrists and four psychologists [interview guide, both]) exploring the explanatory model of depressed women. Results : There were more similarities than differences in the models proposed by Iranian people in the three ethnic groups. Among most of the study participants depressive symptoms were perceived as a transient reaction to external stressors. Most participants named the depressive symptoms as distress of nerve/ soul narahati asabi/narahati rohi, problem of nerve/soul moshkel asabi/rohi, sadness and depression afsordegi. Other names were darikhma (deep sadness with anxiety, Turkish participants only), and tarjoman (sadness and nerve problems due to external events, Kurdish participants only). All connected the illness with an external stressor caused by loss (death of relatives, job loss, etc.), environmental causes (including family conflict), gender-linked stressors and internal factors caused by emotional factors, cognition distortion and hormonal factors. Coping mechanisms involved two strategies: (1) solving problems by seeking help from family and friends, especially ones husband and neighbours, religious practice, and engaging in pleasurable activities, and (2) seeking professional support mostly from general practitioners, psychologists, family counsellors, and traditional support from herbalists and amulets (written prayer notes). The choice of medical treatment depended on the type of somatic or psychological complaints. The important barriers to seeking help from professional (psychiatrists or psychologists) were stigma and fear of dependency on medication. Conclusion and implications: Rather than having a biological model, in this study participants tended to have a psychosocial explanatory model linked with preferred seeking help from informal healers (family and friends, religious practices and traditional healers) as the first treatment step. The inter-ethnic similarities could stem from common cultural and social elements, such as a common official language, legal, structural, educational and political structures, mass media, and religion in the three major ethnic groups in Iran. This finding could be useful for integrating a gender approach to health service delivery and linking gender and culture sensitivity to training of health workers, and also for education society to reduction of the stigma related to depression...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the educational processes of graduate nurses followed anecdotal reports from stakeholders in Malawi on low levels of clinical performance and poor patient management skills among graduate nurses. Stakeholder observations pointed to issues around the educational preparation of graduate nurses. Learning for practice in nursing education is an absolute requirement for positive client outcomes in healthcare delivery. If graduate nurses’ level of performance is in question the educational processes must be examined because the educational level makes a difference on how nurses practice, the stakeholders’ observations of and concerns around graduate nurses {{must be taken into}} account and explored in terms of the educational processes deployed. This requirement gave an impetus to a two-phased, cross sectional, sequential <b>explanatory</b> mixed study, <b>guided</b> by pragmatic philosophical assumptions. Pragmatism emphasizes the fact that knowledge as social reality is based on beliefs and habits that are socially constructed. The study population consisted of nurse educators (N= 50) from the Kamuzu College of Nursing (KCN) and graduate nurses (N= 235) from various clinical settings in Malawi who were invited to participate. In phase one all educators and graduate nurses were invited to complete questionnaires that aimed at determining the teaching styles of educators, learning styles and approaches, and critical thinking levels among graduate nurses. In phase two purposive sampling was used to select nurse educators and graduate nurses for in- depth interviews to determine their perceptions of the educational process and learning experiences respectively. Qualitative evaluation of twenty-one subjects (n= 21) in the BSN curriculum provided evidence of curriculum quality in accordance with the Malawi Nurses and Midwives Council standards. Data analysis, in phase one was conducted using the statistical package SPSS Version 16. 0. Descriptive statistics were run for frequencies, means and standard deviation. Content analysis was used for the qualitative data analysis in phase two. The results of the study indicate that there in no diversity in the use of teaching styles among the educators; the Expert Teaching Style is the most preferred teaching style (xˉ = 4. 02 and SD = 1. 06). The Facilitator Teaching Style was the least preferred method indicating lesser use of facilitative skills among the educators. The lecture method is the dominant and most preferred teaching method among educators; graduate nurses indicated that interactive teaching strategies had enhanced their learning and that they learnt most from those teachers who taught with passion and used examples. The Personal Model Teaching Style was not preferred despite graduates’ preference for this style. Learning diversity was also lacking among the learners where the Competitive Learning Style was the most preferred learning style (xˉ = 3. 93 and SD 0. 54). The Independent Learning Style was the least preferred learning style (xˉ = 2. 84 and SD= 0. 80). This result concurs with the findings on learner dependence from the qualitative results. Curriculum evaluation showed that there were no small group teaching methods embedded in the BSN curriculum to reinforce interactive teaching methods. Despite educators stating that their teaching tasks were well planned there was no learner involvement in the teaching activities. The perceived challenges in the teaching tasks were in the form of information access, interconnectivity and physical resources that educators indicated influenced their choices of teaching methods. Despite the mismatch of the teaching and learning styles, a deep approach to learning was reportedly prevalent among graduate nurses (xˉ = 3. 98 and SD 0. 77) while surface approach was low at (xˉ = 3. 24 and SD= 1. 00).

40|$|In the 1980 s Patrick McAuslan {{identified}} the three grundnorm ideologies {{of land use}} planning namely: the ideology of Private Property; of the Public Interest and of Public Participation. From at least ancient Roman times until very recently the ideology of private property governed land use transactions. Whilst building regulation has a long historical tradition, formal land use planning laws were not enacted until the early twentieth century. With the advent of such laws the ideology of public interest dominated land use policy until the 1980 s when it was challenged by the neo-liberal movement. Since that time {{there has been an}} ideological power struggle between the protagonists. The guardians of the ideology of public interest have railed against the neo-liberal agenda to ‘devalue’ the institution of planning in seeking to reduce it to being a mere siphon for development. The guardians of the ideology of private property, in turn, have disparaged calls for greater state intervention questioning whether there is any case for government intervention given that cities are such complex social systems. It seems that as society moves beyond the neo-liberal paradigm in land use planning in search of a new <b>explanatory</b> theory to <b>guide</b> its way the very notion of planning is being questioned. Yet, in this debate the function of public participation has been largely ignored; it has been an island in the flux of power. The ideology of public participation remains the untried path in land use planning. In March 2011, the New South Wales opposition political party went to an election and won government with a policy to reform the land use planning system pledging to empower the people by returning ‘planning controls to local residents’ through their councils. Empowerment is emblematic of democratic principles. But to implement democratic processes in land use planning decision-making would require the government to depart from McAuslan’s ideology of public interest and to embrace the ideology of public participation. It is argued in this research that to change the status quo the government must overturn one hundred years of planning law history. It requires the enactment of legislative mechanisms that elevate the voice of the people to the status of power. The purpose of this research is to consider the nature and role of public participation in the land use planning system of NSW. The research undertakes a synoptic traverse of the historical narrative relying on an array of secondary sources to understand the dynamic of participation in the context of Patrick McAuslan’s land use planning ideologies. Presently, s 5 (c) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) elevates participation to the status of an objective of the Act; but the mechanism by which the objective is to be attained is absent in the Act. By framing the thesis as a call to repeal the provision places the government’s dilemma into sharp relief. The conclusion of the research is that despite the call to reform the NSW land use planning system creating an opportunity for planning to become more participatory and democratic, it is unlikely that any reform will actually achieve that end. If that conclusion is correct, then s 5 (c) should be repealed. If participation remains and objective of any new planning legislation without an effective legislative mechanism it will only lead to a perpetuation of the confusion and disarray that presently exists in the land use planning system...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on Leadership & Accountability in {{managing}} the Constituency Development Fund (CDF), the case of Yei River County (YRC) of Central Equatoria State, Republic of South Sudan (RSS). CDF {{is one of the}} initiatives of the government of South Sudan created by a legislation of Parliament to compliment development of the community needs as they expect more from the government of the day. The CDF Act 2007 which was passed by the parliament stipulated structures that govern the operation of the fund in terms of management, leadership and accountability to enhance effective and efficient provision of services to the people. The CDF Act provided that fund allocated to the MPs is to address the challenges that face the communities such as construction of schools, health facilities, water, roads and government facilities but not for personal interest or individual use. The problem that motivated the researcher to explore the performance of the CDF was inadequate service to the community although the government has allocated funds to each constituency channeled through the members of parliament to improve the socio-economic status of the community. The research looked at how the CDF roles, functions, and procedure were applied in the utilization of the funds to ensure efficiency. It analysed and evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of management of CDF to promote service delivery in the constituencies of Yei, Ottogo, Tore and Mugwo Payams. The study investigated the following questions: How is the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) been managed and utilized by the Members of Parliament (MPs) to promote development in their constituencies? To what extent is the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) used in accordance with the provisions of the CDF Act (2007) ? To what extent does the CDF achieve its objective in promoting development to meet the aspirations of the people within the constituencies? And, {{what is the nature of}} the relationship between the MPs, the community and the County Local Authority in relation to the CDF? The study also examined the linkage between the various committees formed by the CDF Act 2007 to guide the implementation of the fund as well as the projects at grass-root levels in regards to monitoring and evaluation process. The study used both descriptive and <b>explanatory</b> techniques to <b>guide</b> the researcher in gathering information required on the best of CDF practice in Yei River County which were carried out using interviews, focus group discussion and observation. Twenty (20) respondents comprising of head of departments, women, youth, MPs of both parliaments - the National and the State, chiefs, councilors, CDF committees from the four constituencies mentioned above were interviewed about the use of the CDF. The study reveals that there are no clear linkages between the various committees formed by the CDF Act 2007 to guide the implementation of the fund as well as the projects at the grass-root level in regards to monitoring and evaluation process. In addition to this, less participation of the community in identification, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the CDF community projects was one of the contributing factors that affected the effectiveness and efficiency of the result. Although creation of CDF has effect in some of the areas of the county, it requires more improvement in the implementation process to increase development in other areas. Based on these findings, the study argues that for the best of the CDF utilization, leadership and accountability which are components of the Public Administration Discipline that enhances efficiency in the public institutions need to be put into practice. Hence, rigorous application of the CDF rules, regulations and procedures is paramount in managing the utilization of the fund allocated for the purpose of development...|$|R
