6000|$|In one of {{the most}} notable of these {{attempts}} Michelson devised a method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system be at rest with respect to the æther. It is found by calculation, however, that a slightly different time T1 is required for this process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively to the æther. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity v with reference to the æther, this time T1 is different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these planes. Although the <b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result -- a fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the æther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a [...] " [...] specially favoured [...] " [...] (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the æther-idea, and hence there can be no æther-drift, nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.|$|E

DOI: 10. 1093 /cid/ciu 898 Background.  It is unclear whether metabolic or body composition effects may differ between protease inhibitor-based regimens recommended for initial treatment of HIV infection. Methods.  ATADAR is a phase IV, open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial. Stable antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected adults {{were randomly assigned to}} atazanavir/ritonavir 300 / 100 mg or darunavir/ritonavir 800 / 100 mg in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine daily. Pre-defined end-points were treatment or virological failure, drug discontinuation due to adverse effects, and laboratory and body composition changes at 96 weeks. Results.  At 96 weeks, 56 (62 %) atazanavir/ritonavir and 62 (71 %) darunavir/ritonavir patients remained free of treatment failure (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 8. 2 %; 95 %CI - 0. 6 to 21. 6); and 71 (79 %) atazanavir/ritonavir and 75 (85 %) darunavir/ritonavir patients remained free of virological failure (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 6. 3 %; 95 %CI - 0. 5 to 17. 6). Seven vs. five patients discontinued atazanavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir due to adverse effects. Total and HDL cholesterol similarly increased in both arms, but triglycerides increased more in atazanavir/ritonavir arm. At 96 weeks, body fat (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 2862. 2 gr; 95 %CI 726. 7 to 4997. 7; P= 0. 0090), limb fat (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 1403. 3 gr; 95 %CI 388. 4 to 2418. 2; P= 0. 0071), and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 28. 4 cm 2; 95 %CI 1. 9 to 55. 0; P= 0. 0362) increased more in atazanavir/ritonavir than in darunavir/ritonavir arm. Body fat changes in atazanavir/ritonavir arm were associated with higher insulin resistance. Conclusions.  We found no major differences between atazanavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir in efficacy, clinically-relevant side effects, or plasma cholesterol fractions. However, atazanavir/ritonavir led to higher triglycerides and total and subcutaneous fat than darunavir/ritonavir and fat gains with atazanavir/ritonavir were associated with insulin resistanceThis is an Investigator Sponsored Research study.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} effects of each {{traditional}} cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and smoking), including the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to assess the degree of carotid plaque occurrence. Methods: A total of 553 outpatients (216 men and 337 women; mean age 67. 06  ±  12. 44  years) who underwent a carotid artery ultrasound were screened for carotid plaque and CIMT measurements. Results: The CIMT medians were higher in males (P < . 001) and in patients with hypertension (P < . 001). A linear increase occurred in mean CIMT of 0. 0059  mm for each year of increase in age. The presence of plaque indicated a tendency to correlate with CIMT (P = . 067). The presence of hypertension associated with diabetes (P = . 0061; <b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 0494  mm) or dyslipidemia (P = . 0016; <b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 0472  mm) or CAD (P = . 0043; <b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 0527  mm) increased the mean CIMT measurements. The probability of plaque occurrence in carotid arteries {{is influenced by the}} age (P < . 001) and is higher in patients with dyslipidemia (P = . 008) and CAD (P < . 001). Conclusions: Hypertension is the strongest cardiovascular risk factor that increases CIMT, followed by age and male sex. Age and dyslipidemia increase the probability of carotid plaque. Increased CIMT and plaque could be present in the same patient caused by different risk factors and with independent effects on the artery wall and different clinical prognoses...|$|E

METHODS: A double blind, randomised placebo controlled study comparing cyclic etidronate and placebo during two years in 37 postmenopausal women receiving long term corticosteroid treatment, mainly for polymyalgia rheumatica (40 % of the patients) and rheumatoid arthritis (30 %). Bone density was measured in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and femoral trochanter. RESULTS: After two years of treatment {{there was a significant}} difference between the groups in mean per cent change from baseline in bone density in the spine in favour of etidronate (p = 0. 003). The estimated treatment difference (mean (SD)) was 9. 3 (2. 1) %. Etidronate increased bone density in the spine (4. 9 (2. 1) %, p < 0. 05) whereas the placebo group lost bone (- 2. 4 (1. 6) %). At the femoral neck there was an <b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> of 5. 3 (2. 6) % between the groups (etidronate: 3. 6 % (1. 4) %, p < 0. 05, placebo: - 2. 4 (2. 1) %).

We attempt to use sampling techniques {{to address the problem}} of maintaining discovered association rules. Some studies have been done on the problem of maintaining the discovered association rules when updates are made to the database. All proposed methods must examine not only the changed part but also the unchanged part in the original database, which is very large, and hence take much time. Worse yet, if the updates on the rules are performed frequently on the database but the underlying rule set has not changed much, then the effort could be mostly wasted. In this paper, we devise an algorithm which employs sampling techniques to estimate the difference between the association rules in a database before and after the database is updated.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic low-grade {{inflammation}} and immune activation may persist in HIV patients despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). These abnormalities {{are associated with}} increased oxidative stress (OS). Bilirubin (BR) may have a beneficial role in counteracting OS. Atazanavir (ATV) inhibits UGT 1 A 1, thus increasing unconjugated BR levels, a distinctive feature of this drug. We compared changes in OS markers in HIV patients on ATV/r versus efavirenz (EFV) -based first-line therapies. Materials and Methods: Cohort of the Spanish Research Network (CoRIS) is a multicentre, open, prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients naïve to ART at entry and linked to a biobank. We identified hepatitis C virus/hepatitis B virus (HCV/HBV) negative patients who started first-line ART with either ATV/r or EFV, had a baseline biobank sample and a follow-up sample after at least nine months of ART while maintaining initial regimen and being virologically suppressed. Lipoprotein-associated Phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA 2), Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) were measured in paired samples. Marker values at one year were interpolated from available data. Multiple imputations using chained equations were used to deal with missing values. Change in the OS markers was modelled using multiple linear regressions adjusting for baseline marker values and baseline confounders. Correlations between continuous variables were explored using Pearson's correlation tests. Results: 145 patients (97 EFV; 48 ATV/r) were studied. Mean (SD) baseline values for OS markers in EFV and ATV/r groups were: Lp-PLA 2 [142. 2 (72. 8) and 150. 1 (92. 8) ng/mL], MPO [74. 3 (48. 2) and 93. 9 (64. 3) µg/L] and OxLDL [76. 3 (52. 3) and 82. 2 (54. 4) µg/L]. After adjustment for baseline variables patients on ATV/r had {{a significant decrease in}} Lp-PLA 2 (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> − 16. 3 [CI 95 %: − 31. 4, − 1. 25; p= 0. 03]) and a significantly lower increase in OxLDL (<b>estimated</b> <b>difference</b> − 21. 8 [− 38. 0, − 5. 6; p< 0. 01] relative to those on EFV, whereas no differences in MPO were found.
