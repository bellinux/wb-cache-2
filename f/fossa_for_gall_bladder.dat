40|$|Variant {{vascular}} pattern {{affecting the}} hepatic artery is well documented. We here report {{a case of}} trifurcated hepatic artery proper associated with abnormal course, branching and termination of right hepatic artery. In the present case, hepatic artery proper trifurcated into right, middle and left branches about 2 cm before reaching porta hepatis. Left and middle braches entered the liver through the porta hepatis as normal but, the right hepatic artery took an unusual course towards the <b>fossa</b> <b>for</b> <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and passed between portal vein behind and common hepatic duct, anteriorly. Just before its termination, it gave an additional hepatic branch to the liver and a cystic branch to the gall bladder. The rare course, branching pattern and abnormal termination of the right hepatic artery as reported here, are vulnerable to damage during intraoperative procedures if not carefully observed. Hence, prior knowledge of its variant anatomy is imperative during segmental resection of the liver and any intraoperative procedures performed in this region...|$|E
40|$|Celiac artery shows {{frequent}} {{variations in}} its branching pattern. Knowledge of its possible variations {{is useful in}} gastric, pancreatic and hepato-biliary surgeries. During our dissection classes, we observed a rare variation of the branching pattern of celiac trunk. It divided normally into its three branches; left gastric, splenic and common hepatic arteries. Left gastric and splenic arteries were normal in their course and distribution. The common hepatic artery trifurcated to give hepatic artery proper, gastroduodenal artery and an additional right hepatic artery. The branching pattern of hepatic artery proper and gastroduodenal arteries was normal. The additional right hepatic artery gave origin to a right gastric artery and a large pancreatic branch {{to the head of}} the pancreas. It coursed parallel to the bile duct, being on its right side, passed through the Calot’s triangle and entered the right lobe of liver through the <b>fossa</b> <b>for</b> <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> In the Calot’s triangle, it gave a cystic branch to the gall bladder.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} decade, laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} has gained worldwide acceptance and {{considered to be}} as "gold standard" in the surgical management of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. However, the incidence of bile duct injury in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still two times greater compared to classic open surgery. The development of bile duct injury may result in biliary cirrhosis and increase in mortality rates. The mostly blamed causitive factor is the misidentification of the anatomy, especially by a surgeon {{who is at the}} beginning of his learning curve. Biliary tree injuries may be decreased by direct coloration of the cystic duct, ductus choledochus and even the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> Methods <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> fundus was punctured by Veress needle and all the bile was aspirated. The same amount of fifty percent methylene blue diluted by saline solution was injected into the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>for</b> coloration of biliary tree. The dissection of Calot triangle was much more safely performed after obtention of coloration of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder,</b> cystic duct and choledocus. Results Between October 2003 and December 2004, overall 46 patients (of which 9 males) with a mean age of 47 (between 24 and 74) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with methylene blue injection technique. The diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis (the thickness of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> wall was normal) confirmed by pre-operative abdominal ultrasonography in all patients. The diameters of the stones were greater than 1 centimeter in 32 patients and calcula of various sizes being smaller than 1 cm. were documented in 13 cases. One patient was operated <b>for</b> <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> polyp (our first case). Successful coloration of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder,</b> cystic duct and ductus choledochus was possible in 43 patients, whereas only the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and proximal cystic duct were visualised in 3 cases. In these cases, ductus choledochus visibility was not possible. None of the patients developed bile duct injury.

One of the fundamental step in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to visualize Calot's triangle to obtain the critical view described by Strasberg et al. 1995 [3]. This can be easily done in the conventional 4 ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the ancillary ports. However, in order to minimize the number of ports, there are few methods available <b>for</b> <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> (GB) retraction in SILC that can substitute the usage of ancillary ports imitating retraction from conventional technique, e. g. trans-parietal stitch [4, 5], mini-loop retractor [6], a Kirschner wire [7].

40|$|Background: Cholecystectomy is {{becoming}} a common operation in Africa. The right upper quadrant is regarded {{by many as the}} most difficult area of the abdomen because of the variable anatomy, small sized ducts and the irritant nature of bile. The fact that patients present late also adds to the difficulty with identification of structures in this area. A good working knowledge of the incidence and types of anatomical variations is key to a safe cholecystectomy. About 50 % of patients presenting with gallbladder pathology show a significant anatomical variations.

We conducted this study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, advantages and complications of single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the conventional laparoscopic instruments. Methods and patientsEighty patients (68 females and 12 males) with uncomplicated symptomatic <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy via single trans-umbilical incision using the conventional laparoscopic instruments. ResultsThe mean operative time was 61. 75  min (range: 40 – 105  min) and the mean estimated blood loss was 17. 21  ml (range: 5 – 90  ml). <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> perforation occurred in five cases (6. 25 %) with calculi spillage in four of them. It was managed by using laparoscopic stone removal forceps. Troublesome cystic artery bleeding occurred in 2 cases (2. 5 %) while <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bed bleeding happened in one case (1. 25 %) with liver cirrhosis and managed by argon beam coagulation. An intraoperative cholangiography was performed in 3 cases and a drain was inserted in one case. There was no conversion to the open technique in any of the cases. 49 patients (94. 2 %) discharged on the 1 st postoperative day and 3 patients (5. 8 %) discharged on the 2 nd postoperative day.

Among the 165 patients, 113 had choledochal stones (53 with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones, 50 had had a cholecystectomy, 10 with a normal <b>gall</b> <b>bladder),</b> 35 had <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones without choledochal stones, 17 had cholecystectomy <b>for</b> <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones. Pancreatograms were analysed by measuring {{the diameter of the}} pancreatic duct in the head, the body, and the tail of the pancreas, and evaluating the regularity of the main pancreatic duct and the presence of stenosis, the regularity or the dilatation of secondary ducts, and the presence of cysts. In addition, we established a score, based on the above parameters, by which pancreatograms were classified as normal or with mild, intermediate, moderate or severe abnormalities. A multivariate analysis (stepwise multiple discriminant analysis) was performed for age, sex, presence of gall stones, presence of choledochal stones. Patients were comparable with controls for sex, alcohol consumption but were younger (55 v 68 years, p < 0. 01). In patients and in controls, the frequency of pancreatographic abnormalities increased significantly with age. The pancreatographic features of patients and controls were not significantly different. In the multivariate analysis, age was the only factor with significant predicting value for pancreatographic abnormalities. In conclusion, biliary lithiasis in itself is not an aetiological factor for chronic pancreatitis, older age being responsible for the abnormalities seen by pancreatography of patients with biliary lithiasis...|$|R

Conclusions: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> retrieval from umbilical port is associated with lower port site pain than GB retrieval from epigastric port in Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We recommend umbilical port <b>for</b> <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> retrieval...|$|R
