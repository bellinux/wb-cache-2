40|$|PURPOSE: The present {{follow-up}} study {{was carried out}} to evaluate the performance of Class II Cerec <b>inlays</b> after 10 years of clinical service. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six Class II CAD/CAM ceramic <b>inlays</b> were placed in 27 patients. Each patient received at least one <b>inlay</b> luted with a dual-cured resin composite and one <b>inlay</b> luted with a chemically cured resin composite. At the 10 -year recall, 25 (93 %) patients with 61 (92 %) <b>inlays</b> were available for evaluation using a slight modification of the USPHS criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-four (89 %) of the 61 <b>inlays</b> reevaluated still functioned well at the 10 -year recall. During the follow-up period, seven (11 %) of the <b>inlays</b> required replacement because of: four <b>inlay</b> fractures, one cusp fracture, endodontic problems in one case, and postoperative symptoms in one case. All the replaced <b>inlays</b> had been luted with the dual-cured resin composite. The fractured <b>inlays</b> were all placed in molars. The estimated survival rate after 10 years was 89 %, 77 % for the dual-cured resin composite-luted <b>inlays</b> and 100 % for the chemically cured resin composite-luted ones. The difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction with and acceptance of the Cerec <b>inlays</b> were high, and the performance after 10 years of clinical service was acceptable, especially regarding the <b>inlays</b> luted with the chemically cured resin composite.

Three types of restorations involved chairside procedures using a commercial CAD-CAM apparatus: {{one type of}} <b>inlay</b> restoration was milled from preformed glass ceramic blocks, the other two <b>inlay</b> types were milled from preformed porcelain blocks. The fourth system {{was based on an}} experimental indirect composite <b>inlay</b> system. Each <b>inlay</b> type was luted with its respective dual-curing luting composite, which was supplied with the system. After 6 months of clinical service, all four systems revealed a significant percentage of submargination indicating occlusal wear of the luting composite. The porcelain <b>inlays</b> and the composite <b>inlays</b> luted with their respective experimental luting composite showed the best marginal adaptation. Luted glass ceramic <b>inlays,</b> in particular, suffered from a significantly higher percentage of <b>inlay</b> margin fractures (9 per cent) and marginal openings (4 per cent) than the other systems. A possible explanation is that the glass ceramic subsurface structure at the inlay-lute interface was weakened by etching with ammonium bifluoride. status: publishe...|$|R

[...] Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese had produced inlaid celadon, which was unique to Goryeo wares. William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of England, who after World War II wrote, [...] "The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, {{they are the most}} gracious and unaffected pottery ever made.

The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BCE the practice of <b>inlaying</b> stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) on porcine eyes implanted with a Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> and to describe how the <b>inlay</b> may change {{the effect of the}} femtosecond laser on the lens. Methods: FLACS was performed on six porcine eyes and a Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> had been implanted, exploring the lens under the surgical microscope. Another Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> was attached to {{the upper part of the}} transparent hemisphere used for calibration of the femtosecond laser. Capsulorhexis, arcuate incisions, and phacofragmentation were carried out. The Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> was compared with a nontreated one using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the hemisphere was analyzed with a surgical microscope. Results: Capsulorhexis and phacofragmentation were completed in all the porcine eyes, although accuracy to determine the exact effect on the lens was not possible to achieve. The effect of the femtosecond laser on the PMMA hemisphere through the Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> showed the capsulorhexis was placed outside the outer margin of the <b>inlay</b> and a sharply sculpted fragmentation pattern with a three-dimensional (donut-shaped) annulus untreated beneath it. SEM images of the nontreated and the treated <b>inlays</b> were comparable. No ultrastructural changes were found in the treated Kamra corneal <b>inlay.</b> Conclusions: FLACS can be performed with a Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> for surgical compensation of presbyopia without the risk of damaging the <b>inlay.</b> The Kamra corneal <b>inlay</b> acts as a screen that avoids the laser to reach the areas beneath its shadow, but not the exposed areas of the lens...|$|R

Results: The vertical marginal gap data showed no significant difference between full coverage FPDs, the tub-shap- ed <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs and the proximal box-shaped <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs. While there was a difference between these three designs and the <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs.
