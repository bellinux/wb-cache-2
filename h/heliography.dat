50|$|The {{simple and}} {{effective}} instrument that Mance invented {{was to be}} an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of heliographs was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, but they were the most powerful type of visual signalling device known. In pre-radio times <b>heliography</b> was often the only means of communication that could span ranges of as much as 100 miles with a lightweight portable instrument.|$|E
5000|$|The 1946 {{model was}} the [...] "Mirro-Flash" [...] unit, the first postwar Code-O-Graph, {{and the last}} in badge form. Since the war had ended, the new badge was made of stamped sheet brass, and the plastic [...] "dial" [...] element had a small {{circular}} mirror for signaling by <b>heliography.</b> It used the same cipher-key setting methodology as its immediate predecessor. This practice {{was used for the}} 1947 and 1949 models as well.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909, {{the use of}} <b>heliography</b> for {{forestry}} protection {{was introduced}} in the United States. By 1920 such use was widespread in the US and beginning in Canada, and the heliograph was regarded as [...] "next to the telephone, the most useful communication device that is at present available for forest-protection services". D.P. Godwin of the US Forestry Service invented a very portable (4.5 lb) heliograph of the single-tripod, shutter plus mirror type for forestry use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heliography</b> (in French, héliographie) is the {{photographic}} process invented by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce around 1822, {{which he used}} to make the earliest known surviving photograph from nature, View from the Window at Le Gras (1826 or 1827). The process used Bitumen of Judea, a naturally occurring asphalt, as a coating on glass or metal. It hardened in proportion to its exposure to light. When the plate was washed with oil of lavender, only the hardened areas remained.|$|E
5000|$|Among other things, Löwy became {{know for}} his {{industrial}} photographs, {{starting from the}} 1880s, made using <b>heliography.</b> In 1885, he founded a dry plate production business with the amateur photographer Josef Plener. He also became internationally known for his photographic reproductions business. The main subjects of his photography were portraits, Viennese architecture, art and nude photography. His company was continued by his widow Mathilde Löwy and then in 1908 by nephew Gustav Löwy under the name [...] "Kunstanstalt J. Löwy".|$|E
50|$|Niépces early {{experiments}} had {{derived from}} {{his interest in}} lithography and centered around capturing the image in a camera (then called a camera obscura) to result in an engraving that could be printed somehow by lithography. The asphalt process, or <b>heliography</b> required exposures that were so long that Arago {{said it was not}} fit for use. Nevertheless, without Niépces experiments, it is unlikely that Daguerre {{would have been able to}} build on them to adapt and improve what turned out to be the daguerreotype process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heliotrope}} {{was limited}} to use on sunny days and was further limited (in regions of high temperatures) to mornings and afternoons when atmospheric aberration least affected the instrument-man's line of sight. [...] The heliotrope operator was called a [...] "heliotroper" [...] or [...] "flasher" [...] and would sometimes employ a second mirror for communicating with the instrument station through <b>heliography,</b> a signalling system using impulsed reflecting surfaces. The inventor of the heliograph, a similar instrument specialized for signaling, was inspired by observing the use of heliotropes in the survey of India.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase {{the birth}} of {{photography}} {{has been used by}} different authors to mean different things: - either the publicizing of the process (in 1839) as a metaphor to indicate that previous to that the daguerreotype process had been kept secret; or, the date the first photograph was taken by or with a camera (using the asphalt process or <b>heliography</b> thought to have been 1822, but Eders research indicates that the date was more probably 1826 or later. and Fox Talbots first photographs had been made [...] "in the brilliant summer of 1835" ...|$|E

50|$|Nicéphore Niépce (born Joseph Niépce; 7 March 1765 - 5 July 1833) was a French inventor, now usually {{credited}} as {{the inventor}} of photography and a pioneer in that field. Niépce developed <b>heliography,</b> a technique he used to create the world's oldest surviving product of a photographic process: a print made from a photoengraved printing plate in 1825. In 1826 or 1827, he used a primitive camera to produce the oldest surviving photograph of a real-world scene. Among Niépce's other inventions was the Pyréolophore, the world's first internal combustion engine, which he conceived, created, and developed with his older brother Claude.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heyday of}} the {{heliograph}} was probably the Second Boer War in South Africa, where it was much used by both the British and the Boers. [...] The terrain and climate, {{as well as the}} nature of the campaign, made <b>heliography</b> a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large Aldis lamps, brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with leaf-type shutters for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During {{the early stages of the}} war, the British garrisons were besieged in Kimberley, Ladysmith, and Mafeking. With land telegraph lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and Aldis lamps at night.|$|E
5000|$|Photo {{manipulation}} {{dates back}} {{to some of the}} earliest photographs captured on glass and tin plates during the 19th Century. The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed <b>heliography</b> and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate. Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing. [...] Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.|$|E
5000|$|Niépce {{called his}} process <b>heliography,</b> which {{literally}} means [...] "sun drawing". In 1822, {{he used it}} to create what {{is believed to have}} been the world's first permanent photographic image, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving of Pope Pius VII, but it was later destroyed when Niépce attempted to make prints from it. The earliest surviving photographic artifacts by Niépce, made in 1825, are copies of a 17th-century engraving of a man with a horse and of what may be an etching or engraving of a woman with a spinning wheel. They are simply sheets of plain paper printed with ink in a printing press, like ordinary etchings, engravings, or lithographs, but the plates used to print them were created photographically by Niépce's process rather than by laborious and inexact hand-engraving or drawing on lithographic stones. They are, in essence, the oldest photocopies. One example of the print of the man with a horse and two examples of the print of the woman with the spinning wheel are known to have survived. The former is in the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris and the latter two are in a private collection in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Curso: Teoría y técnica de la fotografíaFor times immemorial, {{people have}} tried to {{reproduce}} their surroundings into pictures of their own. They have used techniques of paintings, carving and sculpturing and for years images have been projected onto surfaces. Photography {{is the result of}} combining several technical discoveries. Long before the first photographs were made, Chinese and Greek philosophers described a pinole camera. But it was until Ibn [...] al [...] Haytham (965 [...] 1040) a Muslim scientist made significant contributions to the principles of optics and invented the camera obscura which is a prototype of today's modern camera. While this early prototype may have had modest usage in its time, it was an important step {{in the evolution of the}} invention. Earliest Known Photograph [1825] Earliest known, surviving heliographic engraving in existence, made by Nicéphore Niépce in 1825 by the <b>heliography</b> process. His illustration is of an etching printed from a metal plate that was etched following alteration of the ground by sunlight; the image is of a 17 th Century Flemish engraving showing a man leading a horse. The First Photograph Ever Taken "View from the Window at Le Gras" [Circa, 1826] The first permanent photograph (later accidentally destroyed) was an image produced in 1822 by the French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. His photographs were produced on a polished pewter plate covered with a petroleum derivative called bitumen of Judea. View from the Window at Le Gras (La cour du domaine du Gras) was the first successful permanent photograph, created by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 at Saint-Loup-de-Varennes. Niépce captured the photo with a camera obscura focused onto a sheet of 20 × 25 cm oil-treated bitumen. As a result of the 8 -hour exposure, sunlight illuminates the buildings on both sides. The First Photograph of a Human "Boulevard Du Temple" [Paris, 1838] Boulevard du Temple, taken by Louis Daguerre in late 1838, was the first-ever photograph of a person. It is an image of a busy street, but because exposure time was over ten minutes, the city traffic was moving too much to appear. The exception is a man in the bottom left corner, who stood still getting his boots polished long enough to show up in the picture. The First Light Picture and Human Potrait Ever Taken [1839] Robert Cornelius, self-portrait, Oct. or Nov. 1839, approximate quarter plate daguerreotype which is a procedure invented in 1839 using silver on a copper plate. The back reads, "The first light picture ever taken. " This self-portrait is the first photographic portrait image of a human ever produced. The Photo of the first Photographic Studio [1893] First Color Photograph [1861] Although color photography was explored throughout the 19 th century, initial experiments in color resulted in projected temporary images, rather than permanent color images. Moreover until the 1870 s the emulsions available were not sensitive to red or green light. The first color photo, an additive projected image of a tartan ribbon, was taken in 1861 by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. First High Speed Photograph [1878] In 1887, using a series of trip wires, Eadweard Muybridge created the first high speed photo series which can be run together to give the effect of motion pictures. High speed photography is the science of taking pictures of very fast phenomena. In 1948, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) defined high-speed photography as any set of photographs captured by a camera capable of 128 frames per second or greater, and of at least three consecutive frames. First Motion Picture [1888] This film is the first celluloid film created and it gives us a true look at how people looked and, more importantly, carried themselves. The film only lasts for two seconds but it is enough time to see the characters walking. It was recorded at 12 frames per second by French inventor Louis Le Prince. It was filmed at the home of Joseph and Sarah Whitley, in Roundhay, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England on October 14 and the people who appear are Adophe Le Prince (Louis's son), Sarah Whitley, Joseph Whitley, and Harriet Hartley. First Digitally Scanned Photograph [1957] The first image scanner ever developed was a drum scanner. It was built in 1957 at the US National Bureau of Standards by a team led by Russell Kirsch. The first image ever scanned on this machine was a 5 cm square photograph of Kirsch's then-three-month-old son, Walden. The black and white image had a resolution of 176 pixels on a side. Technically, this is the very first digital photograph [...] all these years later, digital cameras are only just beginning to have the full capabilities of film cameras. Más información...|$|E
