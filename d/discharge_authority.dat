5|$|If the Spanish monarch ever refused in {{conscience}} {{to grant}} royal assent, a procedure {{similar to the}} Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection {{would not be possible}} under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of <b>discharging</b> royal <b>authority,</b> his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet, pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} demonstrated by direct experiment in subsonic jets that an instability wave in jet shear layer generated by pure-tone acoustic ex-citation could be suppressed by another acoustic excitation, which gener-ates an instability wave {{with the same}} properties. It was suggested that instability waves could be generated by any oscillating ¦eld near the noz-zle exit. This paper {{presents the results of}} experimental investigations of instability wave suppression by other types of periodic excitation. Three types of plasma actuators are considered: (i) high-frequency (HF) dielec-tric barrier discharge (DBD); (ii) slipping discharge; and (iii) corona <b>discharge.</b> Control <b>authority</b> of the plasma actuators over instability waves is demonstrated. For high-speed hot jets where instability waves are the dominant noise source, instability wave control is equivalent to noise control. ...|$|R

However, the kingdom was dissolved by the French, who imposed their mandate on Syria in July 1920 and exiled Faisal (see Sykes-Picot Agreement and San Remo conference). Ulshi remained behind and participated in successive pro-French and French-appointed puppet governments, occupying several high posts in the cabinet, becoming acting Prime Minister on 6 September 1920. He rapidly gained a reputation for subservience to the French and nepotism, appointing several family members to high government posts. The French mandate authorities subdivided Syria into independent and semi-independent zones and annexed large areas to Lebanon, enraging Syrian nationalists, and several revolts broke out across the country.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the epidemiology {{and the status}} of open and endovascular aortic surgery for aortic aneurysm in Hong Kong. METHODS: Three separate data sources were obtained: (1) the Hong Kong Hospital <b>Authority</b> <b>discharge</b> statistics for 1999 and 2000; (2) a survey on aortic aneurysms in public hospitals conducted by the working group of vascular surgery; and (3) the department of surgery, University of Hong Kong Medical Center aortic aneurysm database. The disease pattern, distribution as well as audit of operative mortality was determined. RESULTS: Aortic aneurysm ranked tenth as the leading causes of death in Hong Kong, and the incidence is increasing. Almost 800 new cases were diagnosed each year, with 10 % presenting as rupture, but the death rate for ruptured aneurysms was 80 %. About half of all operations on aortic aneurysms was performed for rupture, and a significant number of newly diagnosed patients were not receiving surgery. In experienced centers, the operative mortality for elective and ruptured aneurysm have improved to 2 % and 38 % in recent years. A growing interest and number of endovascular repair operations were performed which has led to some concerns on patient selection and follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to a worldwide trend, aortic aneurysm in Hong Kong is diagnosed more frequently. With the relatively high mortality for ruptured aneurysms, effective diagnosis and elective surgery on patients with aortic aneurysms in experienced vascular centers remained the best treatment. Since a majority of aneurysms remained untreated, patient and physician education is of paramount importance. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Utilization of Indigenous Knowledge as {{a source}} of {{sustainable}} development has become an increasingly discussed topic in past couple of years. Among many areas of indigenous knowledge, the attention given to “Organizational Management ” is considerably low, even though the concept of management is acknowledged around the world as a means of achieving efficiency and effectiveness with scarce resources. Despite the Universal acceptability of the concept of management on “What” to do, the distinction of practices based on unique circumstances of different socio cultural backgrounds or “How ” to do is strongly recognized in the contemporary management field. Being a developing country, Sri Lanka also needs a closer attention on sustainability of its development investments. With a heritage of a strong culture and deeply rooted shared values, there will be a potential of utilizing indigenous values of organizational management in ensuring a sustainable rural development. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} do a deep investigation on indigenous values embedded in organizational management practices existed in ancient Sri Lanka, with special reference to the geographical area of Nuwarakalaviya. Method adopted in this study associates with comprehensive review of primary and secondary data with qualitative data analysis tools. Strong and unique set of shared values could be identified with regard to work management, <b>authority</b> <b>discharge</b> and resource deployment; the main elements considered under organizational management. With the findings, some implications are proposed as appropriate to consider in contemporary rural development efforts for assuring sustainability through managing organizations successfully...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reviews the}} biophysical attributes, {{socio-economic}} usage and environmental {{problems of the}} coastal zone in England and Wales, and evaluates current resource management policies for the coastal environment. This policy assessment reveals some deficiencies in the present fragmentary system of coastal zone management. In the light of these findings, a detailed case study of the Newhaven-Eastbourne sector in East Sussex is presented. After an initial analysis of the historical interplay between physiographic change and human use requirements in the chosen area, a statement of contemporary resource use and management problems is assembled. A detailed analysis of three leading problems serves to show that effective coastal management must focus on broad 'issue areas' rather than on single problems, acknowledging the interdependency between many coastal policy issues. Using a sample three year period, a content analysis of local newspaper coverage identifies a distinct spatial concentration of resource use problems on developed coastal frontage. A social survey of local residents is employed to measure community awareness of coastal problems and the agencies responsible for their resolution. This survey shows {{a high degree of}} community self-interest in the perception of problems, and suggests a local authority focus for public concern over coastal issues. A full description of the coastal management system in the study area demonstrates that the national fragmentation of responsibilities is fully replicated at local level, although the local <b>authorities</b> <b>discharge</b> a group of key management functions. The technical and institutional requirements for more effective coastal zone managementare discussed, and the potential of a coastal resource evaluation system and selected operations research techniques are tested with reference to the study area. Finally, the prospects for a reform of existing management arrangements are examined, and three outline models for a revised system are presented. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine epidemiology and mortality statistics for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in Hong Kong. Data from three sources were obtained and analyzed: (1) Hong Kong Hospital <b>Authority</b> <b>discharge</b> statistics for 1999 and 2000; (2) a survey on aortic aneurysms in public hospitals conducted by the Working Group of Vascular Surgery; and (3) the Department of Surgery, University of Hong Kong Medical Center aortic aneurysm database. The disease pattern, distribution, and operative mortality were determined. The annual incidence of AAA in Hong Kong is 13. 7 per 100, 000 population and 105 per 100, 000 for those aged 65 and above. About 10 % of the AAAs that presented were ruptured. The mean age of the AAA patients was 74 years, with 84 % of them over age 65. The operative repair rate for AAAs was low, being only 8 % for intact aneurysms and 54 % for ruptured ones. Overall, 45 % of all aneurysm repairs were performed for a ruptured AAA. There is diverse practice between major vascular centers and smaller regional hospitals. The territorywide operative mortality rates for intact and ruptured aneurysms were 10 % (range 4 - 24 %) and 70 % (range 38 - 100 %), respectively. There was no gender bias in the rupture and operative rates. The overall mortality was 17 % for intact AAAs and 78 % for ruptured AAAs. The average length of hospital stay was 19 days for elective AAA surgery and 13 days for ruptured AAAs. The number of operations in high-volume centers is increasing with a concomitant decrease in operative mortality. There are no definitive data to indicate that the incidence of AAAs is rising, but a trend toward an increasing number of operations in referral centers is noted. The low repair rates for intact AAAs and the high proportion of repairs for ruptured aneurysms suggest that AAAs are undertreated in Hong Kong. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
