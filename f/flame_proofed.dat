30|$|The same {{design for}} the solar {{reflector}} {{was used as the}} reflector in our previous publication [17]. However, the heating block heat sink was removed. To use the reflector without the aluminum heating block as a heat sink, round bottom flasks were painted black up to approximately half-way up the flask using VHT® <b>Flame</b> <b>Proof</b> paint, which can withstand intermittent temperatures up to 1093 °C (Figures 1 and 2). The round bottom flasks were painted to prevent photochemical side reactions and allow for a more efficient heating process.|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the project, there was no sufficient knowledge about possible chemical emissions of electronic instruments. The project was intended to develop and test a standardized method for the investigation of such emissions on the basis of test chamber investigations. With the exemplary examination of 10 TVs and video records each in new condition and after artificial aging, we established extensive knowledge about chemical emissions. The evident emissions were very varied in substance, ranging from very volatile solvents to less volatile <b>flame</b> <b>proofing</b> agents. Some of the emissions were of substances that cause health hazards. The results and conclusions from the project can be used for future reducing actions for developing 'low-emission' instruments.

40|$|Microencapsulation is {{a process}} in which tiny {{particles}} or a coating to give small capsules with many useful properties surrounds droplets. There are many methods to impart various end use applications like antimicrobial property, <b>flame</b> <b>proof</b> and many more functional properties to the various substrates like polyester, nylon, polypropylene etc., {{and it may be that}} most of the application methods may be durable or temporary. The microencapsules can introduce important new qualities to garments and fabrics, such as enhanced stability and the controlled release of active compounds. Microencapsulation technique is a unique one where a controlled release of these properties as and when required are possible and also regarding the durability it can withstand for a longer duration. The present work was carried out with an objective to study the effect of clove oil, neem oil, aloe Vera powder, Benzalkonium Chloride (BKC) with certain physical and performance properties on woven fabrics like cotton, P/C blend fabric and Non-woven Polypropylene fabric by the imparting antimicrobial finish by microencapsulation techniqu...|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} conditions {{are based on}} {{a modified version of the}} Huang-Minlon Wolff-Kishner reduction reaction [18]. A solution of recovered biodiesel glycerol and KOH was placed into a 100 mL 24 / 40 round bottom flask that had been painted black using VHT® <b>Flame</b> <b>Proof</b> paint. No stir-bar is placed into the flask since the refluxing liquid was sufficient to thoroughly mix the solutions. The flask was attached to the solar reflector in the position that the feed horn of the satellite dish was located to provide the best location for the directed focal point of sunlight. A modified Baum et al. Allign-type condenser was filled with propylene glycol and capped with pipet bulbs to insure that the propylene glycol stayed in the condenser [19]. The solar heat source was then moved into a position in which it was reflecting sunlight such that the sunlight was directed at the bottom of the round bottom flask. The solution was allowed to heat until the KOH dissolved into the solution. Once the KOH was dissolved the apparatus was moved out of the focal point and the solution was allowed to cool until it reached a temperature of 80 °C. After the solution had cooled, isobutyrophenone and hydrazine hydrate was added to the reaction flask and the solar reflector was moved back into position in which the focal point was directed at the bottom of the round bottom flask. Reflux was initiated for a period of three hours. After acid work-up, glycerol went into the water phase and the reduction product was separated and purified through vacuum distillation.|$|R
5000|$|Gas fever {{swept the}} state and {{thousands}} of gas wells were created. Explorers found that the gas field was the largest of natural gas fields found up to that date, covering an area of 5120 sq mi. The belt {{came to be called}} the Trenton Gas Field. Drillers found large quantities of oil in addition to the natural gas. The Trenton Gas Field was almost completely interconnected, so a well at any one location lowered pressure across the entire field. Whenever new holes were bored, a pipe was created off the main line. It was lit with a constant <b>flame</b> as <b>proof</b> that the gas was flowing. Although burning such a flame wasted massive amounts of the resource, the practice became common. The constant burning gas flare was called a [...] "flambeau".|$|R

International audienceThe aim of this work is to prove existence results and derive asymptotic limits for some nonlinear elliptic problems arising in flame propagation and set in unbounded cylinders. These problems are involved in the modelling of burner <b>flames.</b> The existence <b>proof</b> is a combination of topological degree arguments and estimates that are specific to the problems under consideration.

40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} {{the presence}} of explosive gas atmospheres have to be specially designed to prevent them from igniting the explosive gas. Flameproof design implies that electrical components producing incendiary electrical sparks, e. g. relays and switches, be contained in enclosures that not only withstand the maximum pressure of an internal gas explosion. In addition any holes or slits in the enclosure wall have to be designed {{in such a way that}} they will not transmit a gas explosion inside the enclosure to an explosive gas atmosphere outside it. Designs of a variety of flameproof enclosure joints, including plane flanged joints, are specified in detail in international standards (IEC) requiring that the maximum permissible average roughness of any flame gap surface has to be < 6. 3 μm. The standards also require that any damaged joint surface has to be restored to the original quality prescribed in standards (IEC). However, the standards do not provide any guidance as to what level of damage is considered significant. As a result even minor mechanical or corrosive damage of flame path surfaces gives rise to expensive overhaul and repair of <b>flame</b> <b>proof</b> apparatuses. In fact, this is mandatory in spite of the fact that a generous safety factor is included in the requirements to maximum permissible gap widths. For example, for the plane-flange configuration and explosive gas (propane) used in the present investigation, the maximum permissible width in a practical apparatus is only 0. 4 mm, whereas the real limiting value is 0. 92 mm. The purpose of the present investigation has been to obtain some experimental guidance as to what level of damage of flame gap surfaces is required to significantly reduce the flame-proofing effect of flame gaps in flameproof electrical apparatuses. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width between the two parts of a circular plane joint of 25 mm breadth in a standardized test, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to an outside explosive gas mixtures. Normally the purpose of MESG experiments is to compare MESGs of different gases and vapours, using the same smooth flame gap surface in all experiments. However, in the present investigation MESG has been used as a parameter for judging whether various kinds of significant damage of the gap surface had any noticeable effect on the ability of the flame gap to prevent flame transmission. A significant reduction of MESG compared with that obtained with a standard undamaged surface (standard roughness of < 6. 3 μm) would mean that the particular type of damage under test had destroyed the gap efficiency significantly. On the other hand a significant increase of MESG compared with that for the undamaged surface would mean the damage had in fact significantly increased the gap efficiency. In the experiments performed in the present work premixed 4. 2 vol. % propane in air was used as the test gas mixture in all the experiments. Two different apparatuses were used, viz. a plane circular-flange apparatus (PCFA) and a plane rectangular-slit apparatus (PRSA). For both apparatuses the optimal distance between the ignition point and the gap entrance for flame transmission was 14 mm. Consequently this distance was used in all the experiments. The flame gap surfaces were damaged mechanically by [...] ...|$|R
