He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or <b>hyperaesthesia</b> the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

30|$|Neuropathy is {{a common}} {{disorder}} in diabetic patients. It results from several pathways of metabolic insult but also microangiopathy sometimes contributes to its development [35]. Besides the duration of diabetes and poor glycaemic control, other factors such as higher body mass index, smoking, hypertension, and raised plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels {{are associated with the}} incidence of neuropathy [36]. It manifests as polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy and/or autonomic neuropathy. The most common form of diabetic neuropathy is chronic sensorimotor distal symmetric polyneuropathy, which affects 30 - 50 % of diabetic patients [37]. It is often asymptomatic, particularly at the beginning. The most frequent presentation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy is distal sensory loss, while other symptoms include burning pain, paraesthesiae, <b>hyperaesthesiae</b> and deep aching pain. The symptoms are typically located in the feet and lower limbs and neuropathic pain is usually worse at night. Patients suffering from distal symmetric polyneuropathy are at high risk of foot ulceration and subsequent amputation. Another complication associated with the loss of pain sensation, proprioception and muscular reflexes that regulate joint movement is Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) [38]. CN almost exclusively affects the foot and it is characterised by progressive cartilage and bone damage resulted from repeated trauma due to the absence of the above-mentioned protective mechanisms. Initially, Charcot neuroarthropathy presents with a warm, swollen and painful foot, while at a more advanced stage numerous dislocations and fractures lead to severe deformity of the foot accompanied by severe disability. The plain X-ray is often impressive, while radionucleotide imaging and particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help in the diagnosis and the differentiation from osteomyelitis, which is sometimes difficult. Peripheral mononeuropathies occur less frequently and mainly involve medial, ulnar, radial and common peroneal nerves [35]. Cranial neuropathies are extremely rare. Similarly, diabetic neuropathy rarely manifests as polyradiculopathy involving intercostal, truncal, or lumbar plexus, resulting in pain over the thorax, abdomen, or in the thigh and the hip respectively [15]. In the latest cases, a rare manifestation called diabetic amyotrophy can occur, characterised by weakness and atrophy in the proximal thigh muscles.|$|R

60|$|Well, {{from the}} moment when the routine of leave for our {{soldiers}} was established, such novices, accompanied by damsels (called flappers) often as innocent as themselves, crowded the theatres to the doors. It was hardly possible at first to find stuff crude enough to nurse them on. The best music-hall comedians ransacked their memories for the oldest quips and the most childish antics to avoid carrying the military spectators out of their depth. I believe that this was a mistake as far as the novices were concerned. Shakespeare, or the dramatized histories of George Barnwell, Maria Martin, or the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, would probably have been quite popular with them. But the novices were only a minority after all. The cultivated soldier, who in time of peace would look at nothing theatrical except the most advanced postIbsen plays in the most artistic settings, found himself, to his own astonishment, thirsting for silly jokes, dances, and brainlessly sensuous exhibitions of pretty girls. The author {{of some of the most}} grimly serious plays of our time told me that after enduring the trenches for months without a glimpse of the female of his species, it gave him an entirely innocent but delightful pleasure merely to see a flapper. The reaction from the battle-field produced a condition of <b>hyperaesthesia</b> in which all the theatrical values were altered. Trivial things gained intensity and stale things novelty. The actor, instead of having to coax his audiences out of the boredom which had driven them to the theatre in an ill humor to seek some sort of distraction, had only to exploit the bliss of smiling men who were no longer under fire and under military discipline, but actually clean and comfortable and in a mood to be pleased with anything and everything that a bevy of pretty girls and a funny man, or even a bevy of girls pretending to be pretty and a man pretending to be funny, could do for them.|$|E
6000|$|Only {{those who}} have lived through a first-rate war, not in the field, but at home, and kept their heads, can {{possibly}} understand the bitterness of Shakespeare and Swift, who both went through this experience. The horror of Peer Gynt in the madhouse, when the lunatics, exalted by illusions of splendid talent and visions of a dawning millennium, crowned him as their emperor, was tame in comparison. I {{do not know whether}} anyone really kept his head completely except those who had to keep it because they had to conduct the war at first hand. I should not have kept my own (as far as I did keep it) if I had not at once understood that as a scribe and speaker I too was under the most serious public obligation to keep my grip on realities; but this did not save me from a considerable degree of <b>hyperaesthesia.</b> There were of course some happy people to whom the war meant nothing: all political and general matters lying outside their little circle of interest. But the ordinary war-conscious civilian went mad, the main symptom being a conviction that the whole order of nature had been reversed. All foods, he felt, must now be adulterated. All schools must be closed. No advertisements must be sent to the newspapers, of which new editions must appear and be bought up every ten minutes. Travelling must be stopped, or, that being impossible, greatly hindered. All pretences about fine art and culture and the like must be flung off as an intolerable affectation; and the picture galleries and museums and schools at once occupied by war workers. The British Museum itself was saved only by a hair's breadth. The sincerity of all this, and of much more which would not be believed if I chronicled it, may be established by one conclusive instance of the general craziness. Men were seized with the illusion that they could win the war by giving away money. And they not only subscribed millions to Funds of all sorts with no discoverable object, and to ridiculous voluntary organizations for doing what was plainly the business of the civil and military authorities, but actually handed out money to any thief in the street who had {{the presence of mind to}} pretend that he (or she) was [...] "collecting" [...] it for the annihilation of the enemy. Swindlers were emboldened to take offices; label themselves Anti-Enemy Leagues; and simply pocket the money that was heaped on them. Attractively dressed young women found that they had nothing to do but parade the streets, collecting-box in hand, and live gloriously on the profits. Many months elapsed before, as a first sign of returning sanity, the police swept an Anti-Enemy secretary into prison pour encourages les autres, and the passionate penny collecting of the Flag Days was brought under some sort of regulation.|$|E

Most patients present with pain in the lower legs (shins), sore muscles of the legs and back, and <b>hyperaesthesia</b> of the shins.

[...] Her novel A Den of Thieves (1886) is about a newlywed couple who become crusaders in the temperance movement.

5000|$|The {{disease is}} classically a five-day fever of the {{relapsing}} type, rarely exhibiting a continuous course. The incubation period is relatively long, at about two weeks. The onset of symptoms is usually sudden, with high fever, severe headache, pain on moving the eyeballs, soreness {{of the muscles}} of the legs and back, and frequently <b>hyperaesthesia</b> of the shins. The initial fever is usually followed in a few days by a single, short rise but there may be many relapses between periods without fever. The most constant symptom is pain in the legs. Recovery takes a month or more. Lethal cases are rare, but in a few cases [...] "the persistent fever might lead to heart failure". Aftereffects may include neurasthenia, cardiac disturbances and myalgia.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperesthesia (or <b>hyperaesthesia)</b> is a {{condition}} that involves an abnormal increase in sensitivity to stimuli of the sense. [...] "When a non-noxious stimulus causes the sensation of pain the area will be termed hyperaesthetic". [...] Stimuli of the senses can include sound that one hears, foods that one tastes, textures that one feels, and so forth. Increased touch sensitivity {{is referred to as}} [...] "tactile hyperesthesia", and increased sound sensitivity is called [...] "auditory hyperesthesia". Tactile hyperesthesia may be a common symptom of many neurologic disorders such as herpes zoster, peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathies. In 1979, and then in 1994, Merskey, Bogduk, Noordenbos, Devor and others (a subcommittee of International Association for the Study of Pain) proposed, instead of hyperaestheia, the concept of allodynia, meaning [...] "other pain", defined as a pain resulting from a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain.|$|E

(6) The vivid state of the imagination in hypnosis, which instantly invest-ed every suggested idea, or remembrance of past impressions, with theattributes of present realities.(7) Deductions rapidly drawn by the subject from unintentional suggestionsgiven by the operator.(8) The tendency of the human mind, in those with a great love of the mar-vellous, erroneously to interpret the subject's replies in accordance withtheir own desires.(Bramwell, 1903, p.144.) ...|$|E
