In contrast neorealists argue that states <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> relative gains. That <b>is,</b> states <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the advantages they gain versus the advantages of other states in the anarchic system.|$|R

During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{technology}} related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).|$|R

5|$|Evolutionary {{research}} <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{the origin}} and descent of species, and their change over time. It employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines, for example, those with special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, ornithology, botany, or herpetology, but are of use in answering more general questions about evolution.|$|E
5|$|Human ecology {{deals with}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, and to some extent visual sociology. In turn, visual sociology—which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media.|$|E

5|$|Network {{forensics}} <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{the monitoring}} and analysis of computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, {{for the purposes of}} information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection. Traffic is usually intercepted at the packet level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{paleontology}} traces {{the history of}} the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical development has been closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, {{about native}} British saints survive {{from the period}} of the mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at this time <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was compiled in the late 9th century.|$|E
5|$|During Edward's reign, Æthelwig {{worked to}} recover {{some of the}} abbey's estates that had been granted {{to others in the}} past but had not been {{returned}} to the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's possession of a number of these lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the Chronicon <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
