5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a gauge boson, below).|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{coordinate}} the FAA, RAF and Navy dispersed any counterstrike. Confusion owing to {{the weather and the}} lack of any centralised control of British sea and air forces caused each element to work <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> This caused several friendly fire incidents, such as the attack by No. 217 Squadron on HMS Mackay. The most serious failure was Fighter Command’s failure to provide adequate protection to bomber and naval forces. Although the weather also prevented greater German fighter activity by the time the target area was reached, valuable time had been lost by bomber formations searching for their fighter escorts over the rendezvous positions which either never arrived or were given incorrect orders or direction too late to be acted upon. Little communication was enabled between fighter and bomber units, but also between the strike units themselves. Compounding the problems, RAF Bomber Command’s crews, which made up the majority of the strike forces, were not trained for attacks against naval targets. The only anti-shipping torpedo-bomber squadrons were No. 42 and 217 Squadrons of Coastal Command, which owing to logistical issues, were five torpedoes short of their total complement.|$|E

40|$|Universities and {{academic}} couples frequently face {{the dilemma of}} finding two jobs at the same institution for two job candidates who form an academic couple. Universities are increasingly adopting official partner accommodation policies {{to address this issue}} during the hiring process. Little is known about the effect these policies have on recruitment, retention, and productivity. We seek to understand how specific types of policies – such as the one in place at Washington State University – affect the university’s ability to recruit and retain highly productive candidates. We develop a theoretical model that predicts that when couples have a strong desire to work near each other, and universities evaluate members <b>of</b> couples <b>independently</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>another,</b> couple hires will comprise some of an institutions highest quality faculty. We test our prediction using employment data from WSU. Using salary and promotion as indirect measures of productivity, we find that new assistant professors hired under the accommodation policy are 30 % more likely than their peers to gain tenure. We also find that individual’s hired via accommodation have 4. 6 % higher salaries than their peers on average. Thus, partner accommodation policies may be instrumental in the recruitment of top academic candidates...|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, as in the preceding conflict, French privateers operated from the islands, including a fleet of small vessels run by Robert Surcouf. Supplementing these ships were occasional French naval vessels, principally the frigate Piémontaise (captured in March 1808) and the old frigates Sémillante and Canonnière. These ships operated <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and achieved minor successes against smaller British warships and merchant vessels but were not powerful enough to have a serious effect on the Indian Ocean trade routes. In August 1808, Sémillante and Canonnière were downgraded to armed storeships and sent back to France. To replace these ships, four large frigates under Jacques Hamelin were sent to Governor Charles Decaen on Isle de France in the late autumn of 1808. These vessels, Vénus, Manche, Caroline and Bellone were large and powerful ships under orders to operate from Isle de France and Île Bonaparte against British trade in the Indian Ocean. Based on Isle de France, these frigates had access to large numbers of unemployed sailors and several fortified anchorages from which to launch raids on the British trade routes. A fifth frigate, Niémen, was to have joined the force in the summer of 1809, but was intercepted and captured within hours of leaving France at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E
5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E

When properly used, this grip causes no tension on the hand muscles.|$|E

However, during their long history, only the Gathic texts seem to have been memorized (more or less) exactly. The other less sacred works appear to have been handed down in a more fluid oral tradition, and were partly composed afresh with each generation of poet-priests, sometimes with the addition of new material. The Younger Avestan texts are therefore composite works, with contributions from several different authors {{over the course of several}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|Emergent {{structures}} are patterns that emerge via collective actions of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per Aristotle, that emergent {{structures are}} {{other than the}} sum of their parts {{on the assumption that the}} emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> However, there are those who disagree. According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular renormalization are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead {{gradually}} turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> [...] Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{foremost}} among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> which he rejected {{in favor of}} an event-based or [...] "process" [...] ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another. [...] He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience. He used the term [...] "experience" [...] very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental. [...] Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as [...] "philosophy of organism", but it would become known more widely as [...] "process philosophy." ...|$|E
500|$|While delegates bickered in Prague, {{similar to}} the {{situation}} in Rastatt in 1799, the diplomats negotiated throughout the war zone and in the capitals of Europe, to create a new set of alliances.

Unlike previous coalitions in which the participants had organized their armies <b>independently</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> the Allies of the Sixth Coalition created multi-national armies.
