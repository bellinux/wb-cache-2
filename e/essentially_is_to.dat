5000|$|It {{might be}} tempting {{to suggest that}} there is a basic {{distinction}} between two fundamentally different types of procedure within the Member States: a distinction between, broadly speaking, the continental systems {{on the one hand and}} the English, Irish and Scottish systems on the other.

In the English, Irish and Scottish systems, on the other hand, the court has a less active, or even a passive, role: the procedure is generally based on the assumption that the court has no independent knowledge of the law, that it is dependent upon the submissions advanced by counsel for the parties, and that its function <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> adjudicate on the exclusive basis of their submissions.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{technique}} that improves the robustness and accuracy in computing dense optical-flow fields. We propose a global formulation with a regularization term. The regularization expressions are derived based on tensor theory and complex analysis. It is shown that while many regularizers have been proposed (image-driven, flow-driven, homogeneous, inhomogeneous, isotropic, anisotropic), they are all variations of a single base expression ∇u∇uT + ∇v∇vT. These regularizers, strictly speaking, are valid for uniform 2 D translational motion only, because what they do <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> penalize changes in a flow field. However, many flow patterns—such as rotation, zoom, and their combinations, induced by a 3 D rigid-body motion—are not constant. The traditional regularizers then incorrectly penalize these legal flow patterns and result in biased estimates. The purpose of this work is then to derive a new suite of regularization expressions that treat all valid flow patterns resulting from a 3 D rigid-body motion equally, without unfairly penalizing any of them. 1...|$|E

It is discovered that the the MD with quantum coherence or on a lower temperature than that of the heat bath of the particle would enhance the ability of the whole work substance formed by the system plus the MD to do work outside.

The elaborate studies with this model explicitly reveal the effect of finite size off the classical limit or thermodynamic limit, which contradicts the common sense on Szilard heat engine (SHE).

40|$|International audienceWe study {{variants}} of the α -synchronizer by Awerbuch (J. ACM, 1985) within a distributed message passing system with probabilistic message loss. The purpose of synchronizers {{is to maintain}} a virtual (discrete) round structure. Their idea <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> let processes continuously exchange round numbers and to allow a process to proceed to the next round only after it has witnessed that all processes have already started its own current round. In this work, we study how four different, naturally chosen, strategies of forgetting affect the performance of these synchronizers. The variants differ in the times when processes discard part of their accumulated knowledge during execution. Such actively forgetting synchronizers have applications, e. g., in sensor fusion where sensor data becomes outdated and thus invalid after {{a certain amount of}} time. We give analytical formulas to quantify the degradation of the synchronizers' performance in an environment with probabilistic message loss. In particular, the formulas allow to explicitly calculate the performance's asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, all considered synchronizer variants behave similarly in systems with low message loss, while one variant shows fundamentally different behavior from the remaining three in systems with high message loss. The theoretical results are backed up by Monte-Carlo simulations...|$|E

Organizations whose mission encompasses the preservation of information and cultural heritage have very high reliability requirements for their digital preservation systems. The problem <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve given reliability goals with minimal cost. In an on-going project we study the effectiveness of various system configurations for digital preservation by applying analytical modelling techniques to evaluate the reliability of those configurations. The results {{are expected to be}} useful in supporting such decisions as how many copies to retain for each document, how frequently to check these copies for corruptions, what storage schemes are most effective for data preservation, what strategies are most effective for error recovery and repair, how many sites should be used in order to prevent loss from natural disasters such as flood, fire, earthquake. Our work includes sensitivity analysis of a set of reliability criteria with respect to model parameters in representative cases. This can prove especially helpful in identifying dominant factors with respect to the reliability and cost of each configuration. Preliminary results exhibit a certain degree of counter-intuitiveness, which adds value to the model. In this paper we present the main points of the model and outline some policies suggested by the analysis so far...|$|E
40|$|Static {{characteristics}} of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) {{can be directly}} determined from the histogram-based quasi-static approach by measuring the ADC output when excited by an ideal ramp/triangular signal of sufficiently low frequency. This approach requires {{only a fraction of}} time compared to the conventional dc voltage test, is straightforward, is easy to implement, and, in principle, is an accepted method as per the revised IEEE 1057. However, the only drawback is that ramp signal sources are not ideal. Thus, the nonlinearity present in the ramp signal gets superimposed on the measured ADC characteristics, which renders them, as such, unusable. In recent years, some solutions have been proposed to alleviate this problem by devising means to eliminate the contribution of signal source nonlinearity. Alternatively, a straightforward step would be {{to get rid of the}} ramp signal nonlinearity before it is applied to the ADC. Driven by this logic, this paper describes a simple method about using a nonlinear ramp signal, but yet causing little influence on the measured ADC static characteristics. Such a thing is possible because even in a nonideal ramp, there exist regions or segments that are nearly linear. Therefore, the task, <b>essentially,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify these near-linear regions in a given source and employ them to test the ADC, with a suitable amplitude to match the ADC full-scale voltage range. Implementation of this method reveals that a significant reduction in the influence of source nonlinearity can be achieved. Simulation and experimental results on 8 - and 10 -bit ADCs are presented to demonstrate its applicability...|$|E

3000|$|... 19 Pollin et al. (2008) (echoing Brenner et al., 2002) make a {{particularly}} misleading argument about business assistance coverage. They {{assert that the}} Neumark and Adams estimates {{of the effects of}} business assistance living wage laws are flawed because they define “potentially covered workers as all private sector workers (usually about 90 – 95 percent of the workforce)” (p. 240). This is a a mischaracterization. Neumark and Adams (2003 a) tried to substantiate their results indicating that business assistance living wages increased wages of low-wage workers by attempting to distinguish workers who could not be covered from those who could potentially be covered. For business assistance laws, an upper bound estimate would include the entire private sector – upwards of 90 % of the workforce. They clearly stated that they “chose the broadest definitions of potential coverage, so as not to exclude those that are potentially affected. At best, we identify those workers who could in principle be covered; actual coverage rates should be much lower than those we report” (Neumark and Adams, 2003 a, p. 509). Pollin et al. report results reclassifying workers as covered by business assistance living wage laws only if they work in service industries likely to be covered by contractor provisions. They then report as an independent finding that the Neumark and Adams results were reversed, with positive wage effects for the uncovered. The empirical finding is meaningless, however; what Pollin et al. have done, <b>essentially,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> flip the classifications of workers as potentially covered by business assistance versus uncovered, by removing from the potentially covered group all those outside the services industry. Not surprisingly, then, the original results also flip.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Two new {{concepts}} have been explored {{in solving the}} neutron diffusion equation in one and two dimensions. At the present time, the diffusion equation is solved using source iterations. These iterations are performed in a mathematical form which {{has a great deal}} of physical significance. Specifically, the neutron production term is on the right-hand side, while the absorption and leakage terms are on the left side. In performing a single source iteration, a distribution for the neutron flux is assumed so that the production term can be calculated. This provides a "known" right-hand side. Solving the difference equation for the flux, which corresponds to this assumed source distribution, gives the next estimate for the flux distribution. This type of iteration has the physically significant characteristic of finding directly, for each iteration, a flux which corresponds to an assumed source distribution. In this thesis it was found that by subtracting the absorption term from both sides of the diffusion equation, and performing "source iterations" with both absorption and production terms on the right-hand side (and only the leakage term on the left-hand side), improved convergence rates were attained in many cases. In one neutron energy group, this new idea of putting the absorption term on the right-hand side worked best with only one region, and where reactor dimensions were large compared to the thermal neutron diffusion length (a>>L). In small reactors, where a=L, convergence behavior was similar for both forms of iteration. This new idea was also found to work quite well in one-group multiregion problems. However, due to problems with numerics (inherent asymmetric treatment of the scattering terms), the method does not work at all in a multi-energy group formulation. Secondly, in two dimensions, a closed-form solution to a single source iteration has been found. At this time, the standard method of solution for a two-dimensional source iteration is to perform "inner iterations" to approximately solve for the flux that corresponds to an assumed source. The alternative, up until now, was to solve a giant matrix of the order (N² x N²). This is a sparse matrix, but it has always been considered as highly undesirable to work with a solution (even though it may be closed-form) where the matrix to be solved increases in order roughly as the fourth power of the number of mesh intervals. The new algebraic form for this closed-form solution involves a matrix of order (N x N), not (N² x N²). The matrix is, however, a full matrix. What is done, <b>essentially,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> solve simultaneously for all the flux values along the vertical centerline of the two-dimensional problem, and then use a reflective boundary condition across the core centerline, and then the difference equation itself (in vector form) as a set of flux-vector generating equations to generate the entire flux field, line by line. In solving for the first flux vector (at the x = o, or z = o, core centerline), the right-hand side of the matrix problem incorporates all of the source values in the entire problem space. The initial inversion of the full (N x N) matrix algebraically guarantees that the (M+ 1) th flux vector (on the problem space boundary) will go to zero. This matrix method for two-dimensional neutronic analysis was shown to work well in both cartesian and cylindrical coordinates...|$|E
