HeadGum includes 11 podcasts, {{many of which are}} hosted by comedians who were involved with CollegeHumor, including Streeter Seidell and Josh Ruben. Some of the notable program that {{can be found on the}} network includes Blumenfeld's very own If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> podcast, The Talk of Shame, and Gilmore Guys.|$|E

25|$|In May 2013, Jake and Amir {{started the}} podcast If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> as an advice show where they take {{listener}} questions {{and try to}} answer them in a helpful but funny way. Hurwitz said that If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> was partially inspired by the NPR show Car Talk, in that their audience listens for the banter between the two hosts, not necessarily the questions themselves.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Jake and Amir {{started the}} podcast, If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> an advice show where {{listeners}} email in question which they answer in a comedic way. In 2015, Jake and Amir left CollegeHumor {{to focus on}} producing their own content.|$|E
25|$|The {{play was}} written in January 2006, {{initially}} with the title If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of Intimate Exchanges and Woman in Mind. However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of Intimate Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, {{and the production of}} Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> in July.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> is part of a trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking {{inspiration}} from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and My Very Own Story.|$|E
25|$|King Lear {{has been}} {{performed}} by esteemed actors since the 17thCentury when men played all the roles. From the 20thcentury, {{a number of}} women have played male roles in the play; most commonly the Fool, who has been played (among others) by Judy Davis, Emma Thompson and Robyn Nevin. Lear himself has been played by Marianne Hoppe in 1990, by Janet Wright in 1995, by Kathryn Hunter in 1996–67, by Clare Coulter in 2013, by Glenda Jackson in 2016, and by Diane D'Aquila in 2017. Marcia Gay Harden plays Lear in a few scenes from the play in the 2012 Canadian film If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
500|$|On May 13, 2013, Hurwitz and Blumenfeld {{announced}} their first new project since Jake and Amir: a comedy audio podcast called If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> {{in which they}} give advice to listeners who submit questions. New episodes have been released every Monday since then, and the show has featured several guest stars, including Schwartz, Middleditch, Van Veen, Seidell and Williams. [...] Kayla Culver of The Concordian lauded the podcast as [...] "comfortable to listen to" [...] and [...] "genuinely funny" [...] and said [...] "It's like listening to two best friends having a hilarious conversation on the couch next to you." [...] The Guardian Miranda Sawyer called If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> [...] "a typical example of a comedy podcast" [...] and [...] "amiable enough", but said it contained [...] "far too much laughing", commenting that [...] "New Yorkers Jake and Amir laugh and laugh, giggle and chortle their way around a topic" [...] and [...] "if I wanted stream-of-consciousness waffle with the occasional funny line, I'd listen to [...]" ...|$|E

Noticing Coward's eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers, she murmured to him: [...] "I wouldn't if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> Noël; they count them before they put them out." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> get too far from the original, as the President likes it. [...] Perhaps you can make him like it better." ...|$|E
500|$|Amir {{first came}} to {{national}} prominence in 2004 {{when he was a}} semi-finalist during Yahoo's inaugural national IM Live contest, losing to the eventual champions. [...] Now, he is best known for appearing in the web series Jake and Amir with Jake Hurwitz, in which he plays an annoying and exaggerated version of himself. Originally made by Hurwitz and Blumenfeld in their spare time, the series was then produced by CollegeHumor. Blumenfeld's acting in the series gained him a Webby Award for Best Individual Performance in 2010. In 2011, CollegeHumor released Jake and Amir: Fired, a 30-minute special that is the company's first paid content. Episodes of Jake and Amir average over 500,000 views; by 2012, over 500 had been produced. [...] The pair have also hosted numerous live shows, and started the advice podcast If <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> in 2013. In December 2013, it was announced that Jake and Amir would be adapted into a TBS television comedy with Ed Helms as an executive producer. TBS never filmed the pilot, despite a fan-created #GreenlightJakeAndAmir Twitter campaign that garnered tens of thousands of tweets. Instead, sister network truTV picked up the pilot and filmed it, though it was never aired.|$|E

500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice what is best for me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} {{or cutting}} of some characters sparked speculation from fans {{as to the}} importance of the characters in the final book of the series, which was released just ten days after the film. In April 2006, representatives of Jim McManus said he would be playing Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' brother and the barman of the Hog's Head, in which Harry and his friends found Dumbledore's Army. A week later WB announced that the role was [...] "very minor", allaying some of the speculation to the significance of the role, which, before the final book, was not even a speaking part. MTV reported in October 2006 that Dobby the house elf, who appeared in the second film, Chamber of Secrets, and in the fifth book, would be cut, opening up [...] "plot questions" [...] as to how the role of the elf would be filled. MTV also reported about a month before the release of the final book that Kreacher, the Black family's house-elf, was cut from the film in one draft of the script. However, after Rowling prodded the filmmakers to include him, saying, [...] "You know, I wouldn't [...] if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>you.</b> Or you can, but if you get to make a seventh film, you'll be tied in knots", he was added back into the script.|$|E
