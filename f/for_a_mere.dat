5|$|It {{appears that}} St Peter's church, {{the remains of}} which stand in modern Castle Park, may have been another minster, {{possibly}} with 8th-century origins. By the time of Domesday the church held three hides of land, which was a sizeable holding <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> parish church. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1052 Harold Godwinson took ship to Brycgstow and later in 1062 he took ships from the town to subdue the forces of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Wales, indicating {{the status of the}} town as a port.|$|E
5|$|Muggsy Bogues, Amaker's ACC rival, was {{his roommate}} during the July 1986 FIBA World Championship. He played {{in at least}} two games in the tournament, the first <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> two minutes against Puerto Rico, but he played a {{prominent}} role in the USA's win over Italy. Amaker won a gold medal while serving on the US national team in the FIBA World Championship, which served as the basketball tournament for the 1986 Goodwill Games.|$|E

In August 1847, she was floated free {{at a cost of}} £34,000 and taken back to Liverpool, but this expense exhausted the company's remaining reserves. After languishing at the North Dock for some time, she was sold to Gibbs, Bright & Co., former agents of the Great Western Steamship Company, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> £25,000.|$|E

5|$|A {{whole week}} passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, {{starting}} with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl them out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 {{to give him}} his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E
5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> three pence.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

25|$|In 1926, {{dismantling}} of the incline's machinery began, and it was sold for scrap in 1928 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> £250. That year the chimney on the engine house was demolished and its bricks used for various canal repairs.|$|E
25|$|Papua New Guinea {{put up a}} good {{performance}} in the other match, making 174 despite 4–30 for Young Ken Sen and then reducing Singaporeans to 15/5, a position from which they never recovered; Singapore were eventually bowled out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 87 to lose by 87 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{house was}} {{purchased}} {{by the city of}} Ponce from the Serrallés heirs. While the castle was valued at $17–$25 million, it was purchased <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> $400,000 and included much of the furniture in the sale. The city's initial intent was {{to turn it into a}} museum of Puerto Rican music. The Museum of Puerto Rican Music, however, was eventually established elsewhere in the city.|$|E

Piero capitulated to all Charles' demands, and upon arriving back in the city in November, he was branded as a traitor. He was forced to flee the republic with his family.|$|E

50|$|We are, therefore, to {{understand}} historical happenings as the stern, reluctant working of reason towards the full realization of itself in perfect freedom.

25|$|Darras {{could not}} entirely escape penalty when in 1406 he and Roger Willey bought two {{properties}} held in capita without obtaining royal approval: a quarter carucate of land at Worfield and a moiety of the forestership of Morfe. However, a pardon was granted on 15 November <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 6s. 8d. Darras and Willey then resold both properties to Richard Parlour, a burgess of Bridgnorth, again without asking permission: Parlour {{was compelled to}} sue and pay for pardon in 1408, after Darras's death.|$|E
25|$|England {{subsequently}} {{collapsed and}} finished all out for 159 with Warne taking a further four wickets. England {{had lost their}} final eight wickets <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 58 runs. When Australia commenced batting it appeared that Langer and Hayden might run away with the match, and England's frustration was compounded by the rejection {{of a number of}} creditable LBW appeals. However, Flintoff restored considerable confidence when he had Langer and (nightwatchman) Lee caught behind on successive deliveries in the 10th over. Australia finished the day at 2/48.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2003, {{after being}} on WJFK {{exclusively}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> few months, Ron and Fez agreed {{to host a}} one-hour midday show entitled The Fastest Hour in Radio, scheduled between Howard Stern and commentator Bill O'Reilly. This timeslot would supplement their evening duties, {{and would not be}} caller driven. Instead, Ron and Fez emphasized their own witty social commentary. When the nighttime show was syndicated in Baltimore, Maryland and Tampa, Florida in the summer of 2004, Ron and Fez focused on their evening show, with the Fastest Hour in Radio scheduled 7:00–8:00 pm.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, as {{the city}} {{steadily}} grew as a ski town, the Jerome declined. It was closed for several years.

Many of the younger people who were increasingly drawn to Aspen sneaked in to take showers on the third floor. He tried to interest investors in rehabilitating the building, but could not.

25|$|Himself a protege of Vice President of the United States John Nance Garner, Rayburn was a {{close friend}} and mentor of Lyndon B.

Rayburn was {{instrumental}} to Lyndon Johnson's ascent to power, particularly his rapid rise to the position of Minority Leader. Johnson had been in the Senate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> four years when he assumed the role. Johnson also owed his subsequent elevation to Majority Leader to Rayburn.
