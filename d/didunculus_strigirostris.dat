500|$|In 2002, American {{geneticist}} Beth Shapiro {{and colleagues}} analysed the DNA of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire {{for the first}} time. Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome b and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from the femur of a Rodrigues solitaire and the tarsal of a dodo confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. The genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian Nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) to be their closest living relative, followed by the crowned pigeons (Goura) of New Guinea, and the superficially dodo-like tooth-billed pigeon (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris)</b> from Samoa. This clade consists of generally ground-dwelling island endemic pigeons. The following cladogram shows the closest relationships of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire within Columbidae, based on Shapiro et al., 2002: ...|$|E
50|$|The Tongan {{tooth-billed pigeon}} (Didunculus placopedetes) is only known from subfossil remains in several archaeological sites in Tonga dating 2700-2850 BP and now extinct. The tooth-billed pigeon (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris)</b> from Samoa is {{critically}} endangered.|$|E
50|$|Nu'ulua has a {{land area}} of 25 {{hectares}} {{and is a}} habitat for locally and regionally endemic birds including the endangered tooth-billed pigeon, (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris),</b> also known as Samoan pigeon, and an endemic bat (Pteropus samoensis).|$|E
50|$|The {{tooth-billed pigeon}} (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris)</b> feeds {{mainly on the}} fruits of the Dysoxylum trees growing in its native Samoa. Foliage of D. mollissimum {{provides}} food for caterpillars of the Hercules moth (Coscinocera hercules). Among the better-known pathogens affecting this genus is Pseudomonas syringae pv. dysoxylis which often initiates frost damage in Kohekohe.|$|E
50|$|The {{tooth-billed pigeon}} (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris),</b> {{also known as}} the manumea, is a large pigeon found only in Samoa. It is the only living species of genus Didunculus. A related extinct species, the Tongan tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus placopedetes), is only known from subfossil remains in several archeological sites in Tonga. The tooth-billed pigeon is the {{national}} bird of Samoa and featured on the 20 tālā bills and the 50 sene pieces of the 2008/2011 series.|$|E
50|$|C. nicobarica is a quite {{singular}} columbiform (though less autapomorphic {{than the}} flightless Raphinae), as are {{for example the}} tooth-billed pigeon (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris)</b> and the crowned pigeons (Goura), which are typically considered distinct subfamilies. Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-monotypic subfamily. And while any of the semi-terrestrial pigeons of Southeast Asia and the Wallacea cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of imperial-pigeons and fruit-doves, {{which seems to be}} part of the same radiation.|$|E
50|$|The Tafua Rainforest Preserve was {{established}} in 1990 as a covenant between the village chiefs (matai) and funds from Seacology, model Christie Brinkley and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency to protect native rainforests. The preserve includes walking tracks in the rainforest and a path to the Tafua volcanic crater where there are rare Samoa flying-fox bats.The forest {{is also one of}} the few habitats for the endemic and endangered tooth-billed pigeon (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris),</b> called Manumea, the national bird of Samoa. Seacology also funded two fishing boats for the village to help generate local income and livelihoods.|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} area is ancestral land {{owned by the}} families of Uafato. The conservation zone includes the village and Fagaloa Bay and approximately 1,300 hectares of forestlands. Fauna includes two varieties of bat and 22 bird species including the endangered tooth-billed pigeon (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris),</b> also known as Samoan pigeon which are confined to undisturbed forests. It is the national bird of Samoa and is called the Manumea. The initiative for a {{conservation area}} came from the chiefs and the village following cyclones in 1991 which destroyed much of the village. The council of chiefs approached a private environmental group, O Le Siosiomaga Society, for assistance. A year later, the Uafato Conservation Area was established with funding from the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (formerly SPREP).|$|E
50|$|Animal species include fruit bats {{such as the}} Samoa flying-fox (Pteropus samoensis), {{land and}} seabirds, skinks and geckos. The birdlife of Samoa {{includes}} a total of 82 species, of which 11 are endemic, found only in Samoa. Endemic birdlife found only on Savai'i include species such as the Samoan white-eye (Zosterops samoensis) which is only found in the high cloud forests and alpine scrub around Mt Silisili, and Samoan moorhen (Gallinula pacifica), which was last recorded in 1873 near Aopo with possible sightings in 1984 and 2003. The tooth-billed pigeon, (<b>Didunculus</b> <b>strigirostris),</b> {{also known as the}} manumea is also endemic and now increasingly rear leading to the current proposition to upgrade it to critically endangered. It is the national bird of Samoa and is found on some of the local currency. It is likely that the extensive loss of lowland forest, hunting and invasive species are responsible for the decline of this stunning species.|$|E

The following cladogram shows the closest relationships of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire within Columbidae, based on Shapiro et al., 2002:A similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E

The DNA used in these studies was obtained from the Oxford specimen, and since this material is degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, these findings still need to be independently verified.
