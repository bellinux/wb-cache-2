25|$|On 24 September 2008, Georgian police {{detained}} a Russian military truck {{near the}} village of Odzisi in the Mtskheta Municipality. The truck contained ammunitions and explosives. The Russian <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> he had lost his way. He was handed over to OSCE observers.|$|E
25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E
500|$|Kovalainen's {{failure to}} score, {{combined}} with the two Ferraris making the top three, meant that Ferrari extended their lead over McLaren in the Constructors' Championship from seven to 11points. Massa said Ferrari had succeeded in the race: [...] "I think for the Drivers' Championship it was not fantastic but for the Constructors' it was very good." [...] Kubica's sixth place at the Grand Prix ruled out any chance of claiming the Drivers' Championship. The BMW <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> his focus would now be on getting as good a result as possible in Brazil, saying [...] "There is now one race left, and I shall try hard to defend my third place." ...|$|E
30|$|Our driving {{patients}} lived both {{in urban}} and rural areas and half of the <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> they would have had no one else to help them with driving if they stopped.|$|R
25|$|Before the test, <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> they {{expected}} range and charging time limitations to be a problem, however, during the actual trials these issues were only {{felt to be}} limitations in very few specific cases.|$|R
2500|$|... 84% of the <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} severe low {{temperatures}} during both {{phases of the}} field trial affected the distance that could be driven between charges, but despite that, {{four out of five}} participants told the researchers they thought the Mini E was suitable for winter use.|$|R
500|$|Third-placed Kubica {{said that}} his {{strategy}} allowed him to capitalise on the changing track conditions, as his only stop seemed {{the best time to}} change to intermediate tyres. The Polish <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> that racing in Italy was particularly special for him, having lived in the country for fiveyears: [...] "That is why we divided the helmet into two pieces. One was Italian colours, one was Polish colours." [...] Alonso, who used a similar strategy, said [...] "the result today is very good because Monza {{was supposed to be the}} race that we were looking forward to the least." [...] Toyota's failure to score at the race meant that they were tied with Renault on 41points.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Marketing Communication, Richard J. Varey used the product range {{as an example}} of a company capitalising on a form of product {{placement}} or [...] "stealth advertising", writing that [...] "Viewers don't realize that they are, in effect, watching an advertisement". Betty <b>Driver</b> <b>said</b> of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it. Then one day, they served hot pot on the menu and everyone thought it was mine!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is one of}} the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and [...] Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in Coronation Street's history. In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty <b>Driver</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E
50|$|In a 2014 US {{telephone}} survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> they {{would at least}} consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% {{said they would not}} continue to drive once an autonomous car was available instead.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 July 2012, Turkish truck <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> {{that they}} had their trucks stolen {{by members of the}} FSA when it {{captured}} a border post. They said that some of the trucks were burnt and others sold back to their drivers after the goods were looted.|$|R

500|$|The {{morning after}} the shootings, the {{officers}} argued that they acted in self defense, stating that they ordered the activists to surrender, at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire. Initially, the taxi <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> he was under the dashboard of his cab when the shooting started and could not see who shot first, although he contradicted his statement {{a few days later}} {{in an interview with the}} San Juan Star, a local newspaper, stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men (the two activists and the undercover agent) left the car, and that he saw [...] "10 heavily armed men" [...] approaching. When he emerged from the car, he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men, who were later identified as policemen. Then-Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them “heroic”, stating that they acted in self-defense and stopped a terrorist attack.|$|E
500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, <b>Driver</b> <b>said,</b> [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
500|$|The bus <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} crash {{was caused by}} the bus hitting a patch of black ice on the road, but James Hetfield later stated that he first {{believed}} the bus flipped because the driver was drunk. Hetfield also stated that he walked long distances down the road looking for black ice and found none. When local freelance photographer Lennart Wennberg (who attended the crash scene the following morning), was asked in a later interview about the likelihood that black ice caused the accident, he said it was 'out of the question' because the road was dry and the temperature around , above the freezing point of [...] This was confirmed by police who – like Hetfield – also found no ice on the road. Ljungby detective Arne Pettersson was reported in a local newspaper to have said the tracks at the accident site were exactly like ones seen when drivers fall asleep at the wheel. However, the driver stated under oath that he had slept during the day and was fully rested; his testimony was confirmed by the driver of a second tour bus that was carrying the band's crew and equipment. The driver was determined not at fault for the accident and no charges were brought against him.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> Duggan {{ran toward}} him with outstretched arms. The car, a BMW, clipped {{him with the}} wing mirror. He appears to have fallen, but got up and {{continued}} running toward the traffic that was heading into town. Both drivers reported the incidents to police.|$|R
30|$|<b>Drivers</b> <b>said</b> in {{the focus}} groups {{that the amount of}} time they got to rest between two train {{journeys}} had a bearing upon their fatigue and stress levels. During peak hours of operation, this rest period was ten to fifteen minutes between two subsequent trips, as opposed to 25  min during non-peak hours.|$|R
30|$|The <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> {{in focus}} groups that the {{security}} threat from a suspicious item on the train was conditional on its being an actual explosive device—the likelihood of which they rated as extremely low. At the same time, they felt that the perceived impact from carrying out certain security tasks, such as panic amongst passengers, was both more immediate and probable.|$|R
2500|$|Acting Police Commissioner Moses <b>Driver</b> <b>said</b> the {{military}} action was unlawful and unnecessary. Military commander Bainimarama {{was quoted as}} saying that {{the military}} had taken this action as [...] "we would not want to see a situation whereby the police and the military are opposed in an armed confrontation".|$|E
2500|$|Car and <b>Driver</b> <b>said</b> in August 1973: [...] "Cosworth Vega 16-Valve. More than an engine. A taut-muscled GT coupe to devastate the smugness of BMW 2002tii's and 5-speed Alfa GTV's. A limited run of 4000 machines, {{each one}} built {{away from the}} tumult of the {{assembly}} line to precision tolerances, as a show of technical force by Chevrolet. All {{of them will be}} collector's items." ...|$|E
2500|$|A dark warrior strong {{with the}} Force, {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Knights of Ren, and a high ranking member of the First Order. He is the son of Han and Leia. <b>Driver</b> <b>said</b> the team tried [...] "not to think of him as being bad, or evil, or a villain. Something that was more three-dimensional. He's more dangerous and unpredictable, and morally justified in doing what he thinks is right." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, the Daily Telegraph noted [...] "10 purported crashes in just 48 hours" [...] on {{what they}} regard as arguably [...] "Britain’s most {{dangerous}} roundabout." [...] Derbyshire County Council removed wrecked vehicles from the roundabout which <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> was poorly lit and badly signed. The council said that Barratts {{were responsible for the}} design though it had been checked by their engineers.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the bridge {{had begun to}} decay. In September 1989 debris from the bridge {{impacted}} cars, injuring three. By this point nets had been placed under the bridge.

2500|$|Near St. Stephen's Basilica {{people started}} to muster again in the morning. Some of them made anti-government signs in English and wanted {{to take part in}} the {{official}} celebration on Kossuth Square with them, but policemen prohibited it. Finally, the crowd began to march into Corvin Street, because there they could hold a minor, preannounced (and therefore [...] "legal") celebration. The crowd grew, so Hír TV (News Television) reported ten thousand protesters according to [...] "non-official police sources." [...] The crowd could not decide what to do. Most of them shouted [...] "Kossuth Square" [...] and [...] "Let's go, let's go," [...] and after the celebration started off. On Alkotmány Street they clashed with police forces, which made them retreat to the Cathedral. At about 15:00, police started to dissipate the crowd with tear gas. Protesters acquired an unarmed T-34 tank (a part of the occasional local open-air exhibition) and used it in a charge. After only a few hundred meters the tank ran out of fuel and its <b>driver</b> (<b>said</b> to be a veteran of 1956) was arrested, no serious damage was done.|$|E
2500|$|HIT {{dismissed}} {{claims that}} workers were being paid less {{now than they}} were in 1997. [...] "It's also wrong that their pay is now lower than in 1997 or during SARS," [...] HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. Several long-serving stevedores working for Lem Wing Transportation and Everbest dismissed the strikers' claims as exaggeration. A 7-year veteran crane <b>driver</b> <b>said</b> [...] "It's not that we can't go to the toilet or don't have time for a meal... In fact, we have short breaks of two to three minutes between vessels berthing at the terminals. Very rarely can I get 15 to 30 minutes. We also take turns to have meals so that we have around 15 to 20 minutes for mealtimes." [...] He said that he enjoyed a pay increase in 2011. Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.|$|E
2500|$|During My Life, Stark Hesseltine told Reeve that he {{had been}} asked to {{audition}} for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big budget film, Superman (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve's picture and résumé {{on the top of the}} pile three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmaster's persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was set in January 1977 at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Richard Donner's motto was verisimilitude. Reeve immediately flew to London for a screen test, and on the way was told that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve still did not think he had much of a chance. Though standing , he was a self-described [...] "skinny WASP." [...] On the plane ride to London, he imagined how his approach to the role would be. He later said, [...] "By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability. I felt that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image." [...] He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant in his role in Bringing Up Baby. After the screen test, his <b>driver</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've got the part." ...|$|E

25|$|Most drivers {{reported}} initial {{difficulties in}} mastering the MINI E aggressive regenerative braking system which is {{integrated into the}} accelerator pedal. However, all <b>drivers</b> <b>said</b> that once they learned to like the system, they discovered that they could travel more smoothly, and learned to control almost all acceleration and braking events with one pedal.
