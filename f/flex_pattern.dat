5000|$|The lay-up {{construction}} of the boards is almost identical to the classic snowboard, the significant difference is the thickness profile, which {{is commonly known as}} the <b>flex</b> <b>pattern.</b> The following four board parameters are presented as the variations from the classic parameters: ...|$|E
50|$|A freeride board {{usually has}} a {{directional}} shape and <b>flex</b> <b>pattern</b> with a nose that is softer than the tail - this helps with turn initiation and with handling cruddy/choppy snow conditions. Overall a freeride board is stiffer tip to tail and {{edge to edge}} for a more precise and stable ride. Boots and bindings are usually stiffer than their freestyle snowboarding counterparts as well.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extensible highly compact fiber-optic system for multi-segment flex sensing. This fiber-optic arrangement is 7. 5 mm {{in diameter and}} is comprised of a flexible and stretchable Steiner chain (n= 12) housing at the top which accommodates passive cables used for sensing, followed by a basal rigid fiber-optic sensing unit. The U-shape loopback design of the sensing system allows integration of electronics {{on one side and}} away from the sensing region. A low-friction retractable distance modulation array is designed and implemented to reduce the hysteresis and recover reference sensor values when the arm returns to its original straight configuration. This sensing system is able to measure the dynamic <b>flex</b> <b>patterns</b> of the actuation system to which it conforms. This sensing system can also be embedded inside soft robotic manipulators for multi-segment flex sensing independent of actuation systems, temperature or external load from the environment. This arrangement can also be used as a complete manipulation system when actuating tendons are attached...|$|R
50|$|Much {{like the}} shaft's <b>flex,</b> a blade's <b>pattern</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} characteristic of a stick's performance. There are three primary variables in blade design: curve, face angle, and toe.|$|R
5000|$|Hockey stick - Made of wood or {{composite}} materials, {{hockey sticks}} come in various styles and lengths. Stick dimensions vary {{based on the}} size of the player. Traditionally, all sticks were wooden up until the late 1990s; wood is inexpensive and tough, but the characteristics of each stick will be subtly different due to small changes in the grain structure. They also allow less flex before breaking. The most advanced ice hockey sticks are made from graphite and are manufactured with precise <b>flex</b> <b>patterns</b> that allow for more accuracy and power when hitting the puck; however these advantages come with a flip side of increased cost and somewhat lower overall durability. Graphite sticks come in one-piece and two-piece varieties; a two-piece stick (composed of shaft and blade) allows for greater customization with reduced parts stock required of retailers, and allows for a damaged shaft or blade to be replaced without replacing the entire stick. One-piece sticks generally have better flex characteristics towards the bottom of the shaft, but if the stick breaks or becomes unusable, it is discarded entirely.|$|R
5000|$|A {{separate}} {{piece of}} elastic fabric was added {{at the top}} of the leg cuff, sealing it around the leg and preventing snow from entering on the top. Separate pieces of neoprene could be inserted between the cuff and foot in order to adjust the forward <b>flex</b> <b>pattern</b> of the boot, and the hinges could be adjusted to modify the [...] "cant", the lateral angle between the foot and leg.|$|E
50|$|In the {{traditional}} front-entry boot design, forward flex is resisted by the friction {{of the lower}} section of the leg cuff moving over the vertically extended top of the foot section, which rises above the ankle. This sliding movement can occur until the upper cuff reaches the flat part of the foot area, where further flex requires the plastic to press down on the skier's foot. Shaping the two parts offers some control over the <b>flex</b> <b>pattern.</b> Some designs have a lip moulded into the foot section that controls this stopping point.|$|E
50|$|This ski {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2010. It was notable for its firm powerful <b>flex</b> <b>pattern,</b> a 92 mm waist and its g-cut geometry. There is reverse camber to promote reliable handling on groomed terrain, {{and it has a}} fatty base/edge for skiing in fresh snow. This ski provides uncompromised versatility, stability and control. This ski is innovative in the Line collection for being an all mountain ski; it provides great usage when skiing in both the park (freestyle terrain), and all over the rest of the mountain—anywhere from groomed trails to fresh snow.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Hayden Cox {{broke his}} {{favourite}} surfboard {{and did not have}} the money at the time to purchase a new one so he decided that he'd learn to make one instead. At the age of 16 he coded his first website and began to sell surfboards under his new business [...] "Haydenshapes Surfboards" [...] to friends, locals and teachers at school. After a short-lived attempt at university to study a degree in business, Hayden decided to focus solely on his budding surfboard business and opened his first factory in Mona Vale, New South Wales at the age of 20. Determined to reinvent the design and construction of the traditional 'wooden stringer' surfboard, he began experimenting with unique materials and construction techniques to test new <b>flex</b> <b>patterns</b> and how it affected performance. Former world champion surfer and fellow Sydney Northern Beaches local Tom Carroll {{was the first person to}} road test Cox's newly created prototype [...] "FiberFlex" [...] (now known as FutureFlex), which was later refined and launched into the market in 2006. Following the success of the brand launch into the global market and worldwide best selling Haydenshapes design [...] "Hypto Krypto", Cox relocated to Los Angeles where set up a second custom factory and office facility.|$|R
5000|$|Typically the top (also {{known as}} the belly or table, in the U.K.) -- the instrument's soundboard) is made of quarter-sawn spruce, bookmatched at a {{strongly}} glued joint down the center, with two sound-holes (or [...] "f-holes", from their resemblance to a stylized letter [...] "f") precisely placed between the C-bouts and lower corners. The sound-holes affect the <b>flex</b> <b>patterns</b> of the top, or table, and allow the box to breathe as it vibrates. A decorative inlaid set of three narrow wooden strips, usually a light-colored strip surrounded by two dark strips, called purfling, runs {{around the edge of}} the top, and is said to give some resistance to cracks originating at the edge. It is also claimed to allow the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Some instruments have two lines of purfling, or have knot-work type ornaments inlaid in the back. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. A slab-sawn bass bar fitted inside the top, running lengthwise under the bass foot of the bridge, gives added mass and rigidity to the top plate. Some cheaper mass-produced violins have an integral bass bar, carved from the same piece as the top. Ideally the top is glued to the ribs and linings with slightly diluted hide glue, to allow future removal with minimal damage.|$|R

50|$|Elan SCX {{changed the}} world ski {{industry}} by inventing sidecut skis, which made carve turns possible at low speeds and with a short turn radius. They were first developed in 1988 by Jurij Franko (not {{to be confused with}} the skier Jure Franko), who calculated a suitable <b>flex</b> <b>pattern</b> for new kind of skis with his colleague Pavel Škofic. They organized a project dubbed SideCut Extreme (SCX) and set out to build prototypes. Introduced in 1993, the concept was initially ridiculed by other companies, but in secret they quickly started working on similar designs and such shaping was common by the 1995/96 model year.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{closely resembles}} a {{conventional}} front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the overlapping flaps of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening {{running down the}} front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening {{on the front of the}} boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the [...] "throat") makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed <b>flex</b> <b>pattern</b> from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft.|$|E
5000|$|Banana Technology (BTX), like Magne-Traction before it, {{begins with}} the premise that a {{snowboard}} is not a ski. Banana Technology replaces camber with rocker [...] "Banana" [...] between your feet. When you stand on your board, pressure is now applied inward to the edge area at the between your feet. As your weight presses out the rocker, tips and tails still make full contact for control and stability but edge pressure is reduced in tip and tail allowing them to float, climb and deflect like never before. The Banana Technology <b>flex</b> <b>pattern</b> is slightly stiffened at the tip and tail to increase pop and stability on big landings. Magne-Traction is incorporated into the Banana Technology to improve edgehold and put even more control underfoot at your balance point. The end result is a board that is loose and catch-free, presses boxes, rails and jibs extremely well with the preset rocker, maintains pop with a stiffened tip and tail, and turns easily on hardpack and ice when the built-in rocker is put on edge. The built-in rocker curve makes the board float naturally in powder and the firm nose and tail prevent the board from folding in chunky conditions.|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} posture on the range of axial rotation of the thorax and the range {{and direction of the}} coupled lateral flexion. Methods The ranges of mid thoracic axial rotation and coupled lateral flexion were measured in 52 asymptomatic subjects (aged 18 - 43 years) using an optical motion analysis system. To examine the influence of posture on primary and coupled motion, we initiated axial rotation from a neutral sitting posture and from end-range thoracic flexion and extension. Results There was a significant decrease in the range of thoracic rotation in flexion compared with the neutral and extended postures (P <. 001). The mean range of coupled lateral flexion was 8. 9 % of the axial rotation range in the neutral posture and increased to 14. 3 % and 23. 2 % in the extended and <b>flexed</b> postures, respectively. <b>Patterns</b> of coupled motion varied between subjects, but an ipsilateral pattern was more common in the flexed posture, whereas a contralateral pattern was more common in the neutral and extended postures. Conclusions The ranges and patterns of coupled motion of the thorax appear to be strongly influenced by the posture from which the movement is initiated. This has important implications in relation to the interpretation of clinical tests of thoracic motion and in consideration of mechanisms of development of thoracic pain disorders. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that the <b>flex</b> <b>pattern</b> and camber of a snowboard are crucial to its perceived "feel", or the physical and psychological feedback given to the rider whilst snowboarding. These features are the primary cause of variation in snowboard performance for different riding styles. Consequently, this article deals with the identification of stiffness and camber characteristics for freestyle, freeride and versatile test boards, and their statistical correlation to a comprehensive list of qualitative feel-based performance requirements. It has been determined that the test boards spanning the major styles all possessed similar bending profiles, that were highly representative of each snowboard's respective thickness distribution. The torsional stiffness curves however appeared to be driven by the composite architecture used in construction. Unsurprisingly, the freeride test board showed the greatest level of overall stiffness. The versatile board exhibited the greatest fluctuation in bending stiffness along the chord, whereas the freestyle profile was far more even throughout, with less variation from tip to tail. All of the subjective performance parameters except forgiveness showed positive associations to the body stiffness and camber, with manoeuvrability exhibiting the strongest correlations. The forgiveness showed the exact opposite trend, implying that higher levels of flex and less camber promotes a forgiving snowboard...|$|E
