40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the collapse and blow-out face pressures of a circular tunnel driven by a pressurized shield. The analysis is performed in the framework of the kinematical approach of the limit analysis theory. Two rotational failure mechanisms are proposed for the active and passive cases. These mechanisms have two significant advantages with respect to the available ones: (i) they take into account the entire circular tunnel face instead of an inscribed ellipse to this circular area, and (ii) they are more consistent with the rotational rigid-block movement observed in the experimental tests. For both the active and passive cases, the three-dimensional failure surface was generated 'point by point' instead of simple use of the existing standard geometric shapes such as cones or cylinders. This was achieved by employing a spatial discretization technique. The numerical results have shown that the present rotational mechanisms provide, in the case of <b>frictional</b> <b>soils</b> (with or without cohesion), a significant improvement with respect to the translational mechanisms.

To characterize anchorage mechanisms during tree uprooting, we developed a generic finite element model where real three-dimensional (3 D) root system architectures were represented in a 3 D soil.

These trees were winched sideways until failure, and uprooting force and root architecture measured. The uprooting force was higher for P. deltoides than P. trichocarpa, probably due to its higher root volume and thicker lateral roots. Results from the model showed that soil type influences failure modes. In frictional soils, e. g., sandy soils, plastic failure of the soil occurred mainly on the windward side of the tree.

Larger values of initial earth pressure coefficient K 0 led to enhanced values of and the mechanisms for this was further investigated by analysing the soil stresses mobilised around the pile as the soil was pushed with the pile. Limit equilibrium pile failure mechanisms were developed from conditions of force and moment equilibrium for the pile based on failure in the soil. Pile limit equilibrium conditions were determined for three failure modes to understand the relationships between pile shear force, bending moment and pile embedment length ratio. Three-dimensional numerical (FLAC 3 D) models were used to verify the limit equilibrium failure mechanisms. The limit equilibrium equations were found to provide unconservative predictions for the force that the pile can provide to stabilise a slope, compared with the FLAC 3 D analysis. The program Alp (which models the pile as a beam on springs) gave results that were close to the limit equilibrium calculations. Three-dimensional FLAC 3 D models were modified to investigate the conditions over which the derived limit equilibrium pile failure mechanisms could reasonably be applied. The centre-to-centre pile spacing was varied from 1 d to 10 d, where d is the diameter of the pile, to understand the pile-soil interaction for a row of piles using the FLAC 3 D model.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} the upper bound limit analysis in combination with finite elements and linear optimization for solving different stability problems in geomechanics under plane strain conditions. Although the nonlinear optimization techniques are becoming quite popular, the linear optimization has been adopted due to its simplicity in implementation and ease in attaining the convergence while performing the analysis. The objectives of the present research work are (i) to reduce the computational effort while using an upper bound finite element limit analysis with linear programming in dealing with geotechnical stability problems, and (ii) to obtain solutions for a few important geotechnical stability problems associated with reinforced earth, unsupported tunnels and a group of anchors. It is also intended to examine the developments of the failure patterns in all the cases. For carrying out the analysis for different stability problems, three noded triangular elements have been used throughout the thesis. The nodal velocities are treated as basic unknown variables and the velocity discontinuities are employed along the interfaces of all the elements. The soil mass is assumed to obey the Mohr-Coulomb’s failure criterion and an associated flow rule. The Mohr-Coulomb yield surface is linearized by means of an exterior regular polygon circumscribing the actual yield circle so that the finite element formulation leads to a linear programming problem. A simple technique has been proposed for reducing the computational effort while solving any geotechnical stability problem by using the upper bound finite element limit analysis and linear optimization. In the proposed method, the problem domain has been discretized into a number of different regions in which a particular order (number of sides) of the polygon has been specified to linearize the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion. A greater order of the polygon needs to be chosen only {{in that part of the}} domain wherein the rate of the plastic strains becomes higher. The computational effort required to solve the problem with this implementation reduces considerably. By using the proposed method, the bearing capacity has been computed for smooth as well as rough strip footings and the results obtained are found to be quite satisfactory. The ultimate bearing capacity of a rigid strip footing placed over granular, cohesive-frictional and purely cohesive soils, reinforced with single and a group of two horizontal layers of reinforcements has been determined. The necessary formulation has been introduced to incorporate the inclusion of reinforcement in the analysis. The efficiency factors, and, to be multiplied with Nc and Nγ for finding the bearing capacity of reinforced foundations, have been established. The results have been obtained (i) for different values of soil friction angles in case of granular and cohesive-frictional soils, and (ii) for different rates at which the cohesion increases with depth for purely cohesive soil under undrained condition. The optimum positions of the reinforcements' layers corresponding to which and becomes maximum, have been established. The effect of the length of the reinforcements on the results has also been analyzed. As compared to cohesive soil, the granular soils, especially with greater values of frictional angle, cause much more predominant increase in the bearing capacity. The stability of a long open vertical trench laid in a fully cohesive and cohesive-frictional soil has been determined with an inclusion of single and a group of two layers of horizontal reinforcements. For different positions of the reinforcement layers, the efficiency factor (ηs), has been determined for several combinations of H/B, m and where H and B refer to height and width of the trench, respectively, and m accounts for the rate at which the cohesion increases linearly with depth for a fully cohesive soil with = 0. The effect of height to width of the long vertical trench on the stability number has been examined for both unreinforced and reinforced soils. The optimal positions of the reinforcements layers, corresponding to which becomes maximum, have been established. The required length of reinforcements to achieve maximum efficiency factor corresponding to optimum depth of reinforcement has also been determined. The magnitude of the maximum efficiency factor increases continuously with an increase in both m and. The effect of pseudo-static horizontal earthquake body forces on the stability of a long unsupported circular tunnel (opening) formed in a cohesive <b>frictional</b> <b>soil</b> has been determined. The stability numbers have been obtained for various values of H/D (H = tunnel cover, D = diameter of the tunnel), internal friction angle of soil, and the horizontal earthquake acceleration coefficient The computations revealed that the values of the stability numbers (i) decreases quite significantly with an increase in, and (ii) become continuously higher for greater values of H/D and. The failure patterns have also been drawn for different combinations of H/D, and. The geometry of the failure zone around the periphery of the tunnel becomes always asymmetrical with an inclusion of horizontal seismic body forces. The interference effect on the stability of two closely spaced parallel (twin) long unsupported circular tunnels formed in fully cohesive and cohesive-frictional soils has been evaluated. The variation of the stability number with S/D has been established for different combinations of H/D, m and; where D refers to the diameter of each tunnel, S is the clear spacing between the tunnels, and is the internal friction angle of soil and m accounts for the rate at which the cohesion increases linearly with depth for a soil with = 0. On account of the interference of two tunnels, the stability number reduces continuously with a decrease in the spacing between the tunnels. The minimum spacing between the two tunnels required to eliminate the interference effect increases with (i) an increase in H/D and (ii) a decrease in the values of both m and. The failure patterns have also been generated for a few cases with different values of S/D. The size of the failure zone is found to become smaller for greater values of m and. The horizontal pullout capacity of a group of two vertical strip anchors embedded, along the same vertical plane in sand, at shallow depths has been determined. At collapse, it is assumed that the anchor plates are subjected to the same uniform horizontal velocity without any bending or tilt. The pullout resistance increases invariably with increases in the values of embedment ratio, friction angle of the sand mass and anchor-soil interface friction angle. The effect of spacing (S) between the anchors on their group collapse load is examined in detail. For a given embedment ratio, the total group failure load becomes maximum corresponding to a certain optimal spacing (Sopt). The values of Sopt increases with an increase in the value of, but the changes in the value of H/B and do not have any significant effect on Sopt. The vertical uplift capacity of a group of two horizontal strip plate anchors with the common vertical axis buried in purely cohesive as well as in cohesive <b>frictional</b> <b>soil</b> has been computed. The variation of the uplift factors Fc, Fq and F, due to the contributions of soil cohesion, surcharge pressure and unit weight, respectively, has been evaluated for different combinations of S/B and H/B. As compared to a single isolated anchor, the group of two anchors generates significantly greater magnitude of Fc. On the other hand, the factors Fq and F, for a group of two anchors are found to become almost equal to that of a single isolated anchor as long as the levels of the lower plate in the group and the single isolated anchor are kept the same. For the group of two horizontal strip plate anchors in purely cohesive soil, an increase of cohesion of soil mass with depth and the effect of self weight of the soil have been incorporated. The uplift factor Fcy both due to cohesion and unit weight of the soil has also been computed for the anchors embedded in clay under undrained condition. For given embedment ratios, the factor Fcy increases linearly with an increase in the normalized unit weight of soil mass upto a certain value before attaining a certain maximum magnitude.

Historically, {{much of the work}} completed to relate mobility to vehicle and terrain characteristics has been empirical in nature, and has therefore been susceptible to errors caused by the inherent variability of naturally occurring soils. This thesis addresses the off-road mobility of wheeled vehicles, and in particular the use of a finite element (FE) based approach to predict performance metrics such as rolling resistance, drawbar pull and tractive efficiency. Tools to predict these measures of performance have a wide range of applications, including military, agricultural and leisure vehicles, aircraft operating from temporary airfields and planetary landing craft. The current study extends the virtual proving ground (VPG) concept, where a single vehicle model can be subjected to a series of virtual test conditions, to include the assessment of off-road mobility. Throughout, modelling has been carried out using LS-DYNA, a commercially available non-linear dynamic analysis code. Unlike previous studies using FE techniques to investigate wheel / soil interaction, an Eulerian representation of the soil has been employed, which permits a consistent approach to be applied to both purely cohesive and purely <b>frictional</b> <b>soils,</b> as well as those displaying a combination of cohesive and frictional behaviour. At each stage of the research, the validity of the FE-based modelling approach has been assessed using data from controlled experimental testing at Cranfield University’s off-road dynamics facility. A key finding of the work completed is that rate sensitivity in moisture containing soils can significantly affect the accuracy of (empirical, analytical and numerical) model predictions, even at low translational speeds (less than 0. 1 m/s). This finding highights the adverse impact of simplifications in many previous experimental and modelling studies, which have assumed that rate effects may be ignored providing the translational speed of the vehicle is low...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} Distinct Element Analysis of Cundall and Belytschko {{and their}} respective co-workers are prone to vibrations which must be damped out artificially if numerical problems are to be avoided. An alternative approach to this method is developed which eliminates such problems by allowing the elements to consolidate without gain in velocity. In the method employed here the contact forces, together with body forces due to gravity give rise to accelerations of the elements which in turn cause them to change position. Normally this change in position will produce {{an increase in the}} contact forces. Once these new contact forces have been calculated the elements are then returned to their original positions prior to the next iteration. The contact forces, therefore, increase during the analysis to counter the effects of gravity. Two methods using this new approach are described, for which computer programs have been written. The first program, SLICES, is designed to analyse slopes divided in to slices with a predetermined failure arc. During the analysis the program generates the stress profile acting on the failure arc and predicts the stability or otherwise of the slope. Program SLICES is compared with a traditional slice method under conditions of total and effective stress with cohesive and <b>frictional</b> <b>soils.</b> An analysis using a non-linear failure criterion is also carried out with program SLICES. The second program, CIRCLES, uses circles as the distinct element type and does not require a predetermined failure arc. It is shown that edge effects cause an incorrect stress regime to be set up that masks the failure process. However a sliding type failure is demonstrated where the edge effects do not mask the analysis. Submitted in accordance with the regulations for the degree of Ph. D. of the University of Durham.
