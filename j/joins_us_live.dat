Carnifex is now retreating into the obscurity we once came from. Be certain that us as individuals and as band-mates have a true love for this band. Our desire to create our brand of art and music has never been about trends or money. These things will not decide our future.

We will be making these select dates as memorable as possible and look forward to seeing you there." ...|$|R
