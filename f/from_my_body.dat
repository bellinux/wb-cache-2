2500|$|Discussing sexual perversion, Scruton {{argues that}} its [...] "major {{structural}} feature" [...] is the [...] "complete or partial failure to recognise, {{in and through}} desire, the personal existence of the other", {{which in turn is}} [...] "an affront, both to him and oneself." [...] Scruton calls perversion, [...] "narcissistic, often solipsistic". In his chapter on perversion, Scruton considers masturbation, bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, sado-masochism, homosexuality, incest, and fetishism. Scruton argues that there are two forms of masturbation, and only one is perverted. Scruton argues that homosexuality is significantly different from heterosexuality, and that this helps to explain the traditional judgment that homosexuality is a perversion. Heterosexuality involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, whereas homosexuality does not: [...] "Desire directed towards the other gender elicits not its simulacrum but its complement." [...] Scruton writes that, [...] "In the heterosexual act, it might be said, I move out <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> towards the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own." [...] Scruton dismisses the classical scholar Kenneth Dover's Greek Homosexuality (1978) as [...] "trivialising" [...] and faults Michael Levin's arguments for the abnormality of homosexuality, calling them absurd. In Scruton's view, normal sexuality involves not only giving recognition to the other's person in and through desire for him or her, but also according them accountability and care in the process. Scruton argues that sex is morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy.|$|E

40|$|My work {{examines}} {{the idea of}} distortion of the human face. Many of my drawings focus on the nose, the element of the face that I find most structural. The idea of the face as a flat object and the nose protruding out, almost looking {{as if it is}} placed on the face, is very interesting to me, perhaps connecting back to my fascination with architectural structures. I have used the nose as the main focus of distortion, oversized and often asymmetrical. These exaggerations should make the viewer feel as if they could crawl into this opening and explore its interior. Drawing on a large scale allows me to move around the surface with <b>my</b> whole <b>body,</b> using <b>my</b> arms to create gestural marks. I begin the construction of forms on some sort of charcoal-covered surface that I render prior to the constructing process. I don’t consider my work to have started until I have covered most of the paper’s surface with some sort of charcoal mix: this becomes my blank page, where I can begin drawing. The marks left by <b>my</b> <b>body</b> 2 ̆ 7 s gestures provide the framework from which each arrangement emerges. Process is extremely visible in my work; bodily structures emerge <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>body’s</b> movement, revealing both the early gestures and secondary rendering. Older drawings are torn or cut up and collaged onto the surface of new drawings, complicating and interrupting the continuity of forms. Moving between multiple types of mark making, I want the viewer to feel the duality of scale and style, creating a connection and relationship to recognizable facial features, familiar yet made strange. These drawings are not intended to portray a specific emotion or elicit a certain feeling in the viewer. Instead I aim to interest the viewer by creating a feeling of uncertainty, and to invite him or her to form a personal understanding of each individual work, both visually and emotionally...|$|R
