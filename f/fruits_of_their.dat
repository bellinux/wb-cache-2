5|$|In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford {{published}} The True History of the Elephant Man, {{presenting the}} <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> detailed archival research. Howell and Ford {{brought to light}} {{a large amount of}} new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E
5|$|We {{believe that}} it is the {{inalienable}} right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
25|$|The grape clusters, {{vines and}} wine cups that adorn Greek coins from {{classical}} times {{bear witness to}} the importance of wine to the ancient Greek economy. With every major trading partner, from the Crimea, Egypt, Scythia, Etruria and beyond, the Greeks traded their knowledge of viticulture and winemaking, as well the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own production. Millions of amphora pieces bearing the unique seals of various city-states and Aegean islands have been uncovered by archaeologists, demonstrating the scope of Greek influence.|$|E

25|$|Some Cubans jubilantly left Tampa {{for their}} homeland, eager {{to enjoy the}} <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> long-fought revolution. However, most of these would {{eventually}} return. The main factors in their decision {{was the lack of}} economic opportunities and general devastation resulting from years of conflict, and the realization that Spanish colonial control had simply been replaced by American neo-colonial control. As a group, they overwhelmingly choose to put down roots and settle in Ybor City for the long term, though some migration for family and work reasons continued.|$|E

25|$|Upon the French {{surrender}} the Luftwaffe supply system was breaking down. For example, on 8 July only 20 of the 84 railway tanks with aviation fuel {{had reached the}} main depot at Le Mans. The transportgruppen (transport groups) could not cope and barely kept their own units running. Preparations continued at a glacial pace, since the men responsible for the organisation of German air power and its efficient transfer to the Channel, were enjoying the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> new assignments in Paris. Senior staff members were distracted by victory parades and promotions, including Göring who was promoted to Reichsmarschall. During the Kanalkampf the Germans assembled powerful air forces to attack convoys in the Channel but it took about forty days after the French capitulation, for the Luftwaffe to begin its assault on the Britain.|$|E

25|$|Capitalism is decried in Petals of Blood, {{with the}} new Kenyan elite portrayed as {{controlled}} by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked {{to the success of}} their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} these events can be {{attributed}} to the parties and celebrations held by the richest classes of the island, who would gather to venerate their patron saints, to which they attributed good harvests, fertile lands, plentiful rainfall, the curing of sicknesses and ending of epidemics, etc. They would thus give homage to these saints by consuming and sharing the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> harvest, which included the locally cultivated wines. These have developed into processions to mark festivals dedicated to Saint Mark in Tegueste, where the wagons are decorated with the fruits of the earth (seeds, cereals, flowers, etc.); to Saint Isidore the Laborer in Los Realejos; to Saint Isidore the Laborer and Maria Torribia (Saint Mary of the Head) in La Orotava; the Romería Regional de San Benito Abad in La Laguna; Virgin of Candelaria in Candelaria; Saint Roch in Garachico; Saint Augustine in Arafo; and the Romería del Socorro in Güímar.|$|E
25|$|Economist {{and social}} {{reformer}} Henry George opposed sales taxes and protective tariffs for their {{negative impact on}} trade. He also believed in the right of each person to the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own labour and productive investment. Therefore, income from labour and proper capital should remain untaxed. For this reason many Geoists—in particular those that call themselves geolibertarian—share the view with libertarians that these types of taxation (but not all) are immoral and even theft. George stated there should be one single tax: the Land Value Tax, which is considered both efficient and moral. Demand for specific land is dependent on nature, but even more so {{on the presence of}} communities, trade, and government infrastructure, particularly in urban environments. Therefore, the economic rent of land is not the product of one particular individual and it may be claimed for public expenses. According to George, this would end real estate bubbles, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency for financing public goods because those raise land value.|$|E

500|$|Dean Childers of TV Geek Army {{applauded the}} episode, {{noting that the}} episode shows off the Ice King’s “best traits when trying to help monster princess”, and that “you see the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bond {{near the end of}} the episode.” Childers was also {{complimentary}} towards Ice King’s “Something Special” song, writing that it was “sweet in a disturbing, Frankenstein-dating-his-creature kinda [...] way.” He felt that the ending was “cliché [...] also undeniably charming”, and that the episode overall “proves that even the most disturbing of foes can have their moments.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] compare {{football}} (soccer) players to soldiers on a battlefield {{and encourage them}} to fight for their goals. Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music Chart Blog described them to be [...] "about an undisclosed event which is about to happen for Africa, in which everyone gets together and enjoys the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hard work, even though there have been many hardships along the way." [...] The Spanish version of the song does not contain a war metaphor and instead [...] "talks about walls coming down." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{differences}} in perspective between East and West are set forth {{early in the}} first act, and underscored musically: [...] while the Chinese of the chorus see the countryside as fields ready for harvest, the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> labor and full of potential, the Nixons describe what they saw from {{the windows of the}} Spirit of '76 as a barren landscape. [...] This gap is reflected in the music: [...] the chorus for the workers is marked by what Johnson terms [...] "a wide-ranging palette of harmonic colors", the Western perspective is shown by the [...] "quick, descending, dismissive cadential gesture" [...] which follows Nixon's description of his travels.|$|E

500|$|Some Poor Law Unions {{opted to}} send {{destitute}} {{children to the}} British colonies, in particular to Canada and Australia, where it was hoped the <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> labour would contribute to the defence of the empire and enable the colonies to buy more British exports. Known as Home Children, the Philanthropic Farm school alone sent more than 1000 boys to the colonies between 1850 and 1871, many of them taken from workhouses. In 1869 Maria Rye and Annie Macpherson, [...] "two spinster ladies of strong resolve", began taking groups of orphans and children from workhouses to Canada, {{most of whom were}} taken in by farming families in Ontario. The Canadian government paid a small fee to the ladies for each child delivered, but most of the cost was met by charities or the Poor Law Unions.|$|E
500|$|Despite Sire's {{high hopes}} for it, Ramones was not a {{commercial}} success, reaching only number 111 on the Billboard album chart. [...] The two singles issued from the album, [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", failed to chart. At the band's first major performance outside of New York, a June date in Youngstown, Ohio, members of Cleveland punk legends Frankenstein aka the Dead Boys were present and struck up a friendship with the band. It wasn't until they made a brief tour of England that they {{began to see the}} <b>fruits</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> labor; a performance at the Roundhouse in London on July 4, 1976, second-billed to the Flamin' Groovies, organized by Linda Stein, was a resounding success. T-Rex leader Marc Bolan was in attendance at the Roundhouse show and was invited on stage. Their Roundhouse appearance and a club date the following night—where the band met members of the Sex Pistols and the Clash—helped galvanize the burgeoning UK punk rock scene. The Flamin' Groovies/Ramones double bill was successfully reprised at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles the following month, fueling the punk scene there as well. The Ramones were becoming an increasingly popular live act—a Toronto performance in September energized yet another growing punk scene.|$|E

2500|$|Helots did {{not have}} voting rights, {{although}} compared to non-Greek chattel slaves {{in other parts of}} Greece they were relatively privileged.
