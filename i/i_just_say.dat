500|$|Remi Aubuchon {{was hired}} as the showrunner for the second season in May 2011 before the first season premiere. Once Aubuchon entered the writer's room, he began {{speaking}} of the cliffhanger [...] "it became a really fun challenge." [...] Out of that cliffhanger, says Aubuchon, [...] "came some really positive things that propel {{a lot of the}} storytelling in the second season. And the writers came up with a pretty cool way for Tom Mason to get off that spaceship again." [...] "You'll always catch people after a huge trauma saying, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad.' Or, 'It was fun,' Or, 'It was cool falling off that cliff,'" [...] says Aubuchon. [...] "The truth is, at first it was like, 'Oh my God, should <b>i</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> I can't do this job?' Ultimately, though, I think it turned out cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|Silverman {{spoke at}} the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Hillary Clinton. She urged other Sanders {{supporters}} to back Clinton and later, amid some boos from some Sanders supporters, said, [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say?</b> To the 'Bernie or Bust' people, you're being ridiculous." [...] The Washington Post and Politico called {{this one of the}} most memorable moments of the night. The New York Times called her speech [...] "the perfect breath of fresh air." [...] Michael Grunwald of Politico coined the term [...] "Silverman Democrats" [...] for Sanders supporters who followed Silverman's advice to support Clinton in the general election.|$|E

About {{six or seven}} they was, all in swallowtails, and these silk hats that don't shine. One of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk. I hadn't had a scrap in three days, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>says,</b> 'De-light-ed!' and hits him back of the ear.|$|R

2500|$|In May 2011, {{the climate}} {{scientist}} James Hansen visited New Zealand for a speaking tour. Hansen drew huge crowds for his public talks which {{emphasized that the}} likely global warming catastrophe from increased fossil fuel sourced CO2 emissions could be avoided {{as long as the}} world's coal resources, including seams of Southland lignite, were not used. Hansen said he did not agree with cap and trade schemes, like the NZETS that included forestry offsets. [...] "In my opinion {{you have to have the}} simplest, transparent scheme so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> it should be a flat fee proportional to the amount of carbon in the fuel. And the money, I say, has to go to the public." [...] New Zealand Herald economics editor Brian Fallow described Hansen as [...] "authoritative on the science and compelling on the ethics".|$|E
2500|$|If one is then {{to look at}} the {{interpretation}} (or, meaning), which inheres at the particular time period, the question becomes: why is that reading the essential one?. Or, restated, an essential reading, then, is owing to whom? Is it owing, then, to the meaning derived by the average person at that time? The collective intent of the voters who passed it? Or is it possible that they indeed entrusted the framers with the authority to draft the constitution; i.e., that the intent of the drafters should remain relevant? [...] Originalism faces hermeneutic difficulties in understanding the intentions of the Founding Fathers, who lived 200 years ago (original intent), or the context of the time in which they lived (original meaning). Justice Scalia accepted this problem: [...] "It's not always easy {{to figure out what the}} provision meant when it was adopted…I do not say [...] is perfect. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> it's better than anything else".|$|E
2500|$|Kelly's athleticism {{gave his}} moves a {{distinctive}} broad, muscular quality, {{and this was}} a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: [...] "There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete...I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman." [...] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, [...] "tragically" [...] stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: [...] "Dancing does attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies." [...] In his view, [...] "one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine." [...] He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as Dancing: A Man's Game (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.|$|E

I know you believe what you say, and that you think it happened; but it don't buy nothing with me.

"No; that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> to you two, {{seeing that}} we are here, talking {{together}} in a friendly way; but a man needn't be ashamed to say it anywhere, for it's a religious truth. But I says to him, Newcome, says I, you, who has been living so long on {{the property of the}} Littlepages, ought to be ashamed to wish to strip them of it; but you're not satisfied with keeping gentlemen down quite as much out of sight as you can, by holding all the offices yourselves, and taking all the money of the public you can lay your hands on for your own use, but you wants to trample them under your feet, I says, and so take your revenge for being what you be, says I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{if you say}} a third you may {{consider}} {{that part of the}} business is done. You won't be able to apply for claims in the names of Sam and Ben, and if you did it would be no good, because they could not assign them over to the company. There are eight claims without them, and the one you have put down in my name is nine. Well, I can get say eleven men in this place, who will give you an assignment of their claims for five dollars apiece. That is done every day. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> to them, I am registering a share in your name in the Tom Cat Mine, write an assignment to me of it and I am good for five dollars' worth of liquor, take it out as you like.

6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} that after all your life looking at the captain as your father, and after {{he and his wife}} being everything to you, you would find it mighty hard to regard me in that way. I don't expect it, and I don't want it. If he is not your father by blood, he is your father in right of bringing you up and caring for you and educating you, and it is quite right and quite proper that you should always regard him so. You can look upon me, lad, just as a foster-father--as the husband of the woman who was for a time your nurse, and who would gladly repair the wrongs he did to you. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> this, lad, to make things straight between us. I want us to be friends. I am an old soldier, and you a young one. We are comrades in this expedition. We have taken to each other, and would do each other a good turn if we had a chance. I don't want more than that, lad, and I don't expect you to give more. If I can lend you a helping hand on or off duty, you know I shall do so. So let us shake hands on it, and agree to let the matter drop altogether until this campaign is over. Then we will talk over together what had best be done. A few months longer of this life will do you no harm, and you will make all the better officer for having had two or three years in the ranks. But I will say at once that I think that you are wrong, now you know how the matter stands, in not writing at once to the captain and letting him know the truth. Still there is no harm in its standing over for the present. You must go through the expedition as you are now, and they would be no easier for knowing that you are exposed to danger out here than they are at present when they know nothing of your whereabouts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw Mrs. Meredith {{down at the}} store," [...] said Susan, [...] "and {{she tells}} me that they are really troubled over Bruce, he takes things so much to heart. He has cried himself to sleep for a week, over the {{starving}} Belgians. 'Oh, mother,' he will say to her, so beseeching-like, 'surely the babies are never hungry--oh, not the babies, mother! Just say the babies are not hungry, mother.' And she cannot say it because {{it would not be}} true, and she is at her wits' end. They try to keep such things from him but he finds them out and then they cannot comfort him. It breaks my heart to read about them myself, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I cannot console myself with the thought that the tales are not true. When I read a novel that makes me want to weep <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> severely to myself, 'Now, Susan Baker, you know that is all a pack of lies.' But we must carry on. Jack Crawford says he is going to the war because he is tired of farming. I hope he will find it a pleasant change. And Mrs. Richard Elliott over-harbour is worrying herself sick because she used to be always scolding her husband about smoking up the parlour curtains. Now that he has enlisted she wishes she had never said a word to him. You know Josiah Cooper and William Daley, Mrs. Dr. dear. They used to be fast friends but they quarrelled twenty years ago and have never spoken since. Well, the other day Josiah went to William and said right out, 'Let us be friends. 'Tain't any time to be holding grudges.' William was real glad and held out his hand, and they sat down for a good talk. And in less than half an hour they had quarrelled again, over how the war ought to be fought, Josiah holding that the Dardanelles expedition was rank folly and William maintaining that it was the one sensible thing the Allies had done. And now they are madder at each other than ever and William says Josiah is as bad a pro-German as Whiskers-on-the-Moon. Whiskers-on-the-moon vows he is no pro-German but calls himself a pacifist, whatever that may be. It is nothing proper or Whiskers would not be it and that you may tie to. He says that the big British victory at New Chapelle cost more than it was worth and he has forbid Joe Milgrave to come near the house because Joe ran up his father's flag when the news came. Have you noticed, Mrs. Dr. dear, that the Czar has changed that Prish name to Premysl, which proves that the man had good sense, Russian though he is? Joe Vickers told me in the store that he saw a very queer looking thing in the sky tonight over Lowbridge way. Do you suppose {{it could have been a}} Zeppelin, Mrs. Dr. dear?" ...|$|E
