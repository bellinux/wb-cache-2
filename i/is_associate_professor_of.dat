2500|$|In her book, Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices, Jenell Williams Paris, who <b>is</b> <b>associate</b> <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> {{anthropology}} at Bethel College in St. Paul, reviews {{the benefits and}} uncertainties of various birth control methods, and decidedly favors the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM), {{which is similar to}} NFP but is different. (Paris is a FAM instructor.) The main difference is that FAM is not tied to Roman Catholic teaching. [...] Regarding hormonal methods and abortion, Paris explains that both assertions that the hormonal methods are necessarily acting as abortifacients and the counter claim that they never do are impossible to substantiate from data, and that the probability of the hypothesized scenarios are so small such that the collection of data seems infeasible.|$|E
