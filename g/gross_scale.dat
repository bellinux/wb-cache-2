5000|$|The log scaler is an {{occupation}} in the timber industry. The Log Scaler measures the cut trees {{to determine the}} scale (volume) and quality (grade) of the wood {{to be used for}} manufacturing. When logs are sold, {{in order to determine the}} basis for a sale price in a standard way, the logs are [...] "scaled" [...] which means they are measured, identified as to species, and deductions for defects assigned to produce a net volume of merchantable wood. There are several different scales or rules that are used to determine the volume of wood. Scribner Decimal C rule is based on diagrams of circles that show the amount of boards that will be utilized from diameters of logs. Cubic rule, often called Metric in Canada, determines the cubic volume of the log material. The logs are recorded as <b>gross</b> <b>scale</b> (actual log measurements, length and diameter) and net scale (volume after deductions for defects are taken out). This occupation is usually performed by a third party organization qualified to [...] "scale" [...] government timber. Since internal defects are determined by external indications, scaling is not an exact science and is subject to interpretation of log scaling rules. The log scaler is subject to random [...] "check scales" [...] in which another scaler rescales exactly the same logs and the results are compared. The log scaler must be within + or - 1% of the <b>gross</b> <b>scale</b> and + or - 2% of the net scale to keep their certification to scale. The scale is used for payment, quality control and inventory purposes.|$|E

It is shown that the general drift pattern of these auroral structures correspond, on a <b>gross</b> <b>scale,</b> to magnetospheric convection, namely westward in the evening sector and eastward in the morning sector. The drift velocity ranges from 50 to 2000 m/s, corresponding to the electric field intensity from 3 to 120 mV/m at the ionospheric level and from 0. 1 to 4 mV/m in the magnetospheric equatorial region at an L value of about 6. 5. The general drift pattern locally fluctuates, when new magnetic (and auroral) activities occur. Temporal and spatial changes in the drift of the patches are related to the evolution of a substorm.

These mice expressed desmoglein 3 with the same distribution in epidermis as found in normal oral mucous membranes, while expression of other major differentiation molecules was unchanged. Although the nucleated epidermis appeared normal, the epidermal stratum corneum was abnormal with <b>gross</b> <b>scaling,</b> and a lamellar histology resembling that of normal mucous membrane.

Objective To evaluate the adverse effects of hyperbilirubinemia {{on the development of}} healthy term infants. Methods This was a prospective cohort study on healthy term infants born in Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. Mullen Scale Tests were performed at the ages of 3 and 6 months to assess subjects’ development. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} several dependent variables and developmental outcomes. Results One hundred and twelve infants were enrolled in this study [56 with hyperbilirubinemia, 56 without hyperbilirubinemia; 58 (52 %) male, 54 (48 %) female]. Mean birth weight was 318. 3 grams (SD 342. 26) vs 3162. 5 grams (SD 338. 61). At the age of 3 months, below average category according to Mullen Scale Test was higher in infants with history of hyperbilirubinemia compared to those with- out hyperbilirubinemia, which was statistically significant for fine motor scale (17. 9 % vs 5. 4 %; respectively; P= 0. 039; RR 1. 66; 95 % CI 1. 15; 2. 39).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} quality investing; more specifically how <b>gross</b> profitability <b>scaled</b> by book assets can generate abnormal returns in the U. S market, as previously illustrated by Novy-Marx (2012). Our contribution is to explain these abnormal returns through a sector betting effect, which occurs while constructing portfolios on the gross profitability metric. In {{the first part of}} the analysis, we replicate Novy-Marx (2012). We utilize return- and accounting data from 1963 to 2016 and firstly investigate whether gross profitability predicts the cross section of returns. Our Fama-Macbeth regression show that <b>gross</b> profitability <b>scaled</b> by assets has roughly the same prediction power as book-to-market in terms of t-values. Furthermore, we construct a univariate portfolio sort using the same accounting metric. Our results yield a significant monthly alpha of 0. 48 % in the Fama French three-factor model. These results are very similar to what Novy-Marx (2012) finds. Next, we analyse the effect of sector betting within this portfolio sort. We complete three individual strategies to achieve this. Firstly, we demean <b>gross</b> profitability <b>scaled</b> by assets by the yearly sector average. This nearly eliminates under- or overweighting the respective sectors. Demeaning also leads to a reduction in portfolio performance in all our different performance measures. Secondly, we continue to complete the same portfolio sort within the sectors. Our results show that gross profitability to assets, does not generate abnormal returns in seven out of nine sectors. Thirdly, we complete a strategy where we are long low profitability stocks in high profitability sectors, and short high profitability stocks in low profitability sectors. This strategy yields a significant alpha of 0. 48. Our results provide strong evidence that sector components of stock returns account for much of the individual gross profitability anomaly. Lastly, we combine gross profitability and book-to-market in two different strategies and test for performance. Our results suggests that controlling for profitability in a book-to-market sorted portfolio increases performance. Additionally, a combination portfolio of straight profitability and straight book-to-market displays less sector betting and reduced volatilit...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of chronostratigraphic units such as geological Systems and Series depends upon {{an ability to}} equate succession in rock strata {{with the passage of}} time, and upon a pervasive Law of Superposition. These assumptions hold true at a <b>gross</b> <b>scale.</b> But, at fine scales of stratigraphic resolution, they commonly break down. Thus, bioturbation in Phanerozoic marine deposits typically homogenizes sedimentary packages spanning millennia, affecting biostratigraphic, isotopic and paleornagnetic signals, and post-burial mass transport phenomena such as large-scale sedimentary slumps and intra-stratal diapirs locally disrupt superpositional relationships on a larger scale. Furthermore: the multi-stage transport of microfossils prior to final burial complicates the relationship between depositional and biostratigraphic ages; paleomagnetic signals, imposed at shallow burial depths, may be distinct from depositional ages; and high precision zircon U-Pb dates from tuff layers determine time of crystallization in the magma, rather than depositional age. In such circumstances, depositional units cannot be unambiguously equated with time units: because they include multiple temporal components, they cannot be subdivided precisely into time-rock units. By contrast, the different phenomena which have contributed to constructing sedimentary deposits, pre-, syn- and post-depositional, may be effectively accommodated within a unitary geological time framework...|$|E

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 3 health centers serving a semirural area in Benin. Three hundred fifty-seven children aged 12 months and their mothers were enrolled in 2011. Infant development was assessed at local health centers followed by a home visit to collect information on socioeconomic status, maternal Raven score, maternal depressive symptoms, and mother-child interactions (Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment [HOME] Inventory), and to administer the TQ. Results: The infant's gender (female), the HOME, and maternal education were associated with a higher Early Learning Composite score in multivariate analyses (p =. 02, p =. 004, p =. 007, respectively). The HOME and family wealth were also associated with the <b>Gross</b> Motor <b>Scale</b> (p =. 03 and p =. 03, respectively).

Since the interpretation of LDA signals in bubbly flows is not straight forward also experiments on a single bubble train are reported. It is discussed that {{in the latter case}} when using seeding the backscatter LDA measures predominantly the liquid velocity. No improvement from thresholding on the discrimina-tion between gas and liquid was found. The bubble column experiments show that the radial averaged liquid velocity profile represents the well known <b>gross</b> <b>scale</b> circulation present in the column. More interesting, it is also seen that the fluctuating velocity field can be studied in great detail. The velocity probability density functions directly indicate high turbulence intensity. Low frequency fluctuations are observed in agreement with visual observations. The data rate is an exponential function of the distance from the column wall. This limits the possibilities of spectral analysis in {{the central part of the}} flow. However, close to the wall the mean data rate is sufficient to study the frequency contents of the signal.

E 864 at BNL has measured the production of ten stable light nuclei with nuclear number of A = 1 to A = 7 at rapidity y ≃ 1. 9 and pT /A ≤ 300 MeV/c. Data were taken with a Au beam of momentum of 11. 5 A GeV/c on a Pb or Pt target with different experimental settings. The invariant yields show a striking exponential dependence on nuclear number over ten orders of magnitudes with a penalty factor of about 50 per additional nucleon.

40|$|Retrotransposons like L 1 are silenced in {{somatic cells}} {{by a variety}} of {{mechanisms}} acting at different levels. Protective mechanisms include DNA methylation and packaging into inactive chromatin to suppress transcription and prevent recombination, potentially supported by cytidine deaminase editing of RNA. Furthermore, DNA strand breaks arising during attempted retrotranspositions ought to activate cellular checkpoints, and L 1 activation outside immunoprivileged sites may elicit immune responses. A number of observations indicate that L 1 sequences nevertheless become reactivated in human cancer. Prominently, methylation of L 1 sequences is diminished in many cancer types and full-length L 1 RNAs become detectable, although strong expression is restricted to germ cell cancers. L 1 elements {{have been found to be}} enriched at sites of illegitimate recombination in many cancers. In theory, lack of L 1 repression in cancer might cause transcriptional deregulation, insertional mutations, DNA breaks, and an increased frequency of recombinations, contributing to genome disorganization, expression changes, and chromosomal instability. There is however little evidence that such effects occur at a <b>gross</b> <b>scale</b> in human cancers. Rather, as a rule, L 1 repression is only partly alleviated. Unfortunately, many techniques commonly used to investigate genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer cells are not well suited to detect subtle effects elicited by partial reactivation of retroelements like L 1 which are present as abundant, but heterogeneous copies.

Three falling - logging treatments were observed: Conventional falling, Cable-assist falling, and Conventional falling with streamside buffer strips. Streamside environmental impact was evaluated in terms of the potential for damage due to the addition of organic logging residues to stream channels. Economic considerations included stream debris removal, timber volume left unharvested in buffer strips, timber falling labor and equipment, and timber breakage. H Stream debris was quantifie& for ten headwater streams in western Oregon prior to logging, after falling, and after yarding. To determine timber falling breakage and direct falling costs for both conventional and cable-assist methods, over 1. 6 million board feet of timber was observed during falling operations. Results show that buffer strips were most effective in preventing logging debris from reaching stream channels. A 160 foot wide buffer strip allowed no debris penetration. During falling operations, 1. 8 and 2. 0 tons of debris per 100 feet of stream penetrated buffers with widths of 36 and 15 feet respecttively. Conventional falling added an average of 47 tons of debris per 100 feet of stream. Cable-assist falling added only 14 tons per station, thus demonstrating its applicability as a stream protection technique. Stream debris removal costs were found to be quite low for the observed buffer strip units. Estimated clean-up costs for the conventional falling treatment averaged 400 per station compared to only 154 per station for cable-assist falling. Timber falling production rates averaged 9. 3 MBF per hour for conventional falling, and 6. 3 MBF per hour for cable-assist falling. Due to lower production rates, larger falling crews, and additional machinery costs, direct falling costs for cableassist falling averaged 8. 02 per NBF (<b>gross</b> <b>scale)</b> compared to 3. 33 per MBF for conventional failing. Timber breakage averaged 7. 35 percent of <b>gross</b> <b>scale</b> for conventional falling compared to 5. 92 percent for cable-assist falling, a difference. of 1. 43 percent. For both methods, breakage increased as trees became larger and more defective. The total cost of the economic factors evaluated was applied to a hypothetical 40 acre setting of 2, 800 MBF. The analysis showed that of all treatments, the narrow 15 foot wide buffer strip treatment was most economical, total cost being only 6. 12 per MBF. Due to the high cost of leaving 285 NBF of timber the 160 foot wide buffer strip treatment was most expensive at 13. 18 per MBF. For the conventional falling - logging treatment, the total cost per MEF was 7. 93. This compares with 10. 96 per MBF for cable-assist falling; savings of breakage and stream debris removal costs were offset by much higher direct falling costs. Although not included as a cost consideration in this analysis, cable-assist falling produced a greater average log length than did conventional falling. Consideration of log length relationships, and use of higher stumpage values would have altered the outcome of this analysis. The cable-assist treatment would have become more economically desirable compared to the conventional and buffer strip treatments...|$|E
40|$|This {{short report}} {{provides}} an update {{to the earlier}} LLNL paper entitled ''Preliminary Definition of Geophysical Regions for the Middle East and North Africa'' (Sweeney and Walter, 1998). This report {{is designed to be}} used in combination with that earlier paper. The reader is referred to Sweeney and Walter (1998) for all details, including definitions, references, uses, shortcomings, etc., of the regionalization process. In this report we will discuss only those regions in which we have changed the boundaries or velocity structure from that given by the original paper. The paper by Sweeney and Walter (1998) drew on a variety of sources to estimate a preliminary, first-order regionalization of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), providing regional boundaries and velocity models within each region. The model attempts to properly account for major structural discontinuities and significant crustal thickness and velocity variations on a <b>gross</b> <b>scale.</b> The model can be used to extrapolate sparse calibration data within a distinct geophysical region. This model can also serve as a background model in the process of forming station calibration maps using intelligent interpolation techniques such as kriging, extending the calibration into aseismic areas. Such station maps can greatly improve the ability to locate and identify seismic events, which in turn improves the ability to seismically monitor for underground nuclear testing. The original model from Sweeney and Walter (1998) was digitized to a 1 {sup o} resolution, for simplicity we will hereafter refer to this model as MENA 1. 0. The new model described here has also been digitized to a 1 {sup o} resolution and will be referred to as MENA 1. 1 throughout this report...|$|E
50|$|Jamaican {{history from}} the 1930s-70s {{certainly}} is covered, but while those {{ought to be the}} limiting dates a series of devices and observations blurs the issue, and forces time to be more advanced than it chronologically should be. In <b>gross,</b> the <b>scale</b> of the cocaine trade reported and the annual murder-rates implicit in it point to a date in at least the later 1980s, while in fine, references to computerisation in journalism and the use of a personal photo as a screensaver implies a date at least in the 1990s. What Thompson in effect manages is to keep the first half of his story in historical time, but thereafter to subsume into the violence and social problems of the 1970s all later, generically similar events of the 1980s-2000s, so that {{in the second half of}} the story time is foreshortened, and the verse novel made much wider-reaching as a contemporary national diagnosis than it may at first seem.|$|R
500|$|On December 24, 2008, Judge Gary A. Feess granted 20th Century Fox's {{claim to}} a {{copyright}} interest in the film. An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of Watchmen. Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered {{the chance to make}} Watchmen. Fox passed on the project while Warner Bros. made a deal to acquire the movie rights and move forward with development. An internal Fox email documented that executives at Fox felt the script was [...] "one of the most unintelligible pieces of shit they had read in years". On January 15, 2009, the trade press reported that Fox and Warner Bros. had reached a settlement. Fox would receive a share of the box office, but no future ownership of the film. The settlement awarded Fox up to $10 million in development costs and legal fees, plus worldwide <b>gross</b> participation <b>scaling</b> from 5 to 8.5 percent.|$|R
40|$|Despite intense efforts {{during the}} last 25 years, the physics of {{unconventional}} superconductors, including the cuprates with a very high transition temperature, is still a controversial subject. It is believed that superconductivity {{in many of these}} strongly correlated metallic systems originates in the physics of quantum phase transitions, but quite diverse perspectives have emerged on the fundamentals of the electron-pairing physics, ranging from Hertz style critical spin fluctuation glue to the holographic superconductivity of string theory. Here we demonstrate that the <b>gross</b> energy <b>scaling</b> differences that are behind these various pairing mechanisms are directly encoded in the frequency and temperature dependence of the dynamical pair susceptibility. This quantity can be measured directly via the second order Josephson effect and it should be possible employing modern experimental techniques to build a `pairing telescope' that gives a direct view on the origin of quantum critical superconductivity.
