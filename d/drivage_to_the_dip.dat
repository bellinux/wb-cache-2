Diurnal and latitudinal variations in the horizontal and vertical components are shown <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> Chapman model of EEJ. The horizontal component vector due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ionospheric current aligned itself close to magnetic north, with a mean Declination of 10 °W (ranging from 9 °W to 14 °W). There was a significant counter-electrojet effect before sunrise at stations close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator, suggesting late reversal of solar-quiet (Sq) electric field in the morning hours. The observed variations in the magnetic meridional current did not seem to be associated with EEJ currents.

40|$|Introduction A {{horizontal}} coupled bunch instability ("anomalous antidamping"), {{in which}} the growth rate is a strongly nonlinear function of beam current, is observed in CESR 1. This instability is present only when the distributed ion pumps (DIPs) are powered. It disappears immediately when <b>the</b> <b>DIPs</b> are turned off. The growth rate is proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>DIPs</b> powered and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>DIP</b> anode voltage 2. CESR contains DIPs in all bending magnets. A series of slots allows gas <b>to</b> flow from <b>the</b> beam chamber <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pump chamber.

30|$|The {{reason why}} the strongest {{amplitude}} is seen around 8 ° in the dipole latitudes may be interpreted as follows. In our model, {{the value of the}} FACs is approximately proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conductivities. The conductivity becomes larger as latitude decreases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator. On <b>the</b> other hand, in less than around 8 ° in the dipole latitude, because the apparent period gets longer, the amplitude gets attenuated by the high-pass filter. In the region, the effect of the attenuation is steeper than that of <b>the</b> amplification due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conductivity enhancement toward <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator. Therefore, <b>the</b> strongest amplitude of the objective magnetic fluctuation is located at about 8 ° in latitude from <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> equator.|$|R
