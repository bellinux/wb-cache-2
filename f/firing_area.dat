5|$|Mantou kiln: The mantou kiln was {{the most}} common type of pottery kiln in north China, in {{historical}} periods when the dragon kiln dominated south China; both seem to have emerged in the Warring States period of approximately 475 to 221 BC. It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese mantou bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the ground plan resembles a horseshoe. The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central <b>firing</b> <b>area,</b> and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370°C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear.|$|E

On 29 April, Texas, , and [...] relocated to Belfast Lough, Northern Ireland. There, final preparations were made, including {{the removal of the}} airplane catapult and the ship's OS2U Kingfisher observation planes. The three pilots who flew Texass Kingfishers during this period were temporarily transferred to a newly formed squadron, VOS-7, that was composed of the pilots who flew observation and scouting planes from the cruisers , , and [...] and the battleships Arkansas, Nevada, and Texas. VOS-7 received training in defensive fighter tactics, aerobatics, navigation, formation flying and spotting procedures in Royal Air Force Spitfires; they flew spotting missions in the Spitfires because of the threat from German fighters. The pilots of VOS-7 would fly spotting missions for the US warships off Omaha and Utah Beaches during D-Day. Also, during this time additional radio equipment was added, including a device to detect and jam radio-guided missiles. Final exercises were carried out to the south in Dundrum Bay and Belfast Lough. During the final preparations, General Eisenhower came aboard on 19 May to speak to the crew. On 31 May, the ship was sealed and a briefing given to the crew about the upcoming invasion. For the invasion, Texas was designated Bombardment Force Flagship for Omaha Beach, in the Western Taskforce. Her <b>firing</b> <b>area</b> of Omaha was the western half, supporting the US 29th Infantry Division and the US 2nd Ranger Battalion at Pointe du Hoc, and the US 5th Ranger Battalion, which had been diverted to Western Omaha to support the troops at Pointe du Hoc.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "shooting machine" [...] was {{designed}} to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a blank cartridge, each connected to a coiled spring mechanism. The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the <b>firing</b> <b>area</b> and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: [...] "I much obligated to you. You be good man to me." [...] Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant’s heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said [...] "I die like a soldier" [...] before he was shot to death.|$|E

40|$|Jharia {{coalfield}} is a {{major source}} of prime coking coal in India. This coalfield has witnessed unparallel fire problems since 1916 affecting seams IV to XVII. At present there are as many as 65 active mine fires spread over 17. 32 sq. km areas affecting the micro and macro environment adversely. The impact of mine fires has been noticed on all segments of environment viz. air, water and land. This paper discusses the variations in trace elements concentration in top soil and soil infiltration rates in some fire affected coal mines vis-a-vis areas not affected by fire. Soil pollution index was also calculated for each of the study areas taking into consideration the critical concentration of different trace elements in the soil. The soil in <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> showed higher concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni and lower values of B and Mo compared to non-fire and intermediate <b>fire</b> <b>areas.</b> As, Hg and Se were absent in soil of all the stations. Based on the trace element study and soil pollution index, it can be concluded that non-fire areas are slightly polluted, whereas intermediate and active <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> are moderately polluted. In addition, the soil infiltration rates are higher in <b>fire</b> <b>areas</b> compared to non-fire and intermediate <b>fire</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
