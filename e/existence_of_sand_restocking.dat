TGA/DSC data of both oil and oil sands were obtained. The results indicates that both heavy oil and its sands exhibited similar patterns which can be characterized as three distinctive regions: low temperature oxidation, fuel deposition and high temperature oxidation. Further investigation of oil quartz and man-made sand with different amount of montmorillonite show that the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> and clays enhance the exothermic behavior of oxidation reactions in fuel deposition and high temperature oxidation regions...|$|R

The failure mechanism for the Industrial Canal (east side south and west side) was overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge. The primary mechanism of failure for levees protecting eastern New Orleans was the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> in 10% <b>of</b> places instead of thick Louisiana clay. The primary mechanism of failure for the levees protecting St. Bernard Parish was overtopping due to negligent maintenance of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel, built and maintained by the Corps of Engineers.|$|R

The chief investigator, John J. Holtz of the Pennsylvania State Police, later admitted having accepted $50,000 from author Wambaugh. Smith sued the police for collusion to falsely convict him, but lost after a federal appeals court concluded that, despite his release, evidence of his guilt remained overwhelming. The earlier murder conviction of Smith's alleged co-conspirator, William Bradfield, remained undisturbed. Bradfield died in prison.|$|R

40|$|The {{motion of}} {{turbulent}} Stokes waves on a finite constant depth fluid with a rough bed is considered. First and second order {{turbulent boundary layer}} equations are solved numerically {{for a range of}} roughness parameters, and from the solutions are calculated the mass transport velocity profiles and attenuation coefficients. A new mechanism of turbulent mass transport is found which predicts a reduction and reversal of drift velocity in shallow water in agreement with experimental observations under turbulent conditions. This transpires because the second order Stokes wave motion, in a turbulent boundary layer, can directly influence the mass transport velocity by mode coupling interactions between different second order Fourier modes of oscillation. It is also found that the Euler contribution due to the radiation stress of the first order motion is reduced to half of it's corresponding laminar value {{as a consequence of the}} velocity squared stress law. The attenuation is found to be of inverse algebraic type with the reciprocal wave height varying linearly with either distance or time. The severe wave height restriction applicable to the Longuet-Higgins [4] solution is shown not to apply to progressive waves on a finite constant depth <b>of</b> fluid.

40|$|In {{studying}} the problems on sediment transport {{in a stream}} and stabilities of astream channel, the criterion for mvement <b>of</b> <b>sands</b> and gravels by action of fljw, theso-called critical tractive force, becomes generally important. The present paper dealswith the hydraulic approach to solve the mechanism of the critical tractive force ofgraded sand gravels. In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force <b>of</b> graded <b>sand</b> gravels, especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical condition for movement and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> gravels proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the critical tractive force <b>of</b> graded <b>sand</b> gravels, and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand gravels.

It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the critical tractive force <b>of</b> graded <b>sand</b> gravels expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation <b>of</b> graded <b>sand</b> gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two.

40|$|Over {{the life}} of an oil and gas reservoir, it is likely to {{encounter}} sand production. In offshore production fields, as there are lack of processing facilities nearby, gas, liquid and sand are often transported together in long distance pipelines. The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> could accumulate in the pipelines under inappropriate operation condition and eventually will lead to a blockage. Thus, to design such systems requires knowledge on how sand is transported, when and where it will accumulate. This thesis summarizes the experimental work undertaken using the 2 inch, 3 inch and 4 inch multiphase facilities. Generally, the main objectives of the experiments were to i) observe and enhance the understanding <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> transport characteristics in water and air-water flows; ii) investigate sand concentration effect and pipe diameter effect on sand minimum transport condition (MTC); iii) investigate the effect of pipeline orientation (0, + 5, + 10 and + 20 degrees) and viscosity effect (Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC) solution with viscosity of 7, 20 cP; Oil with viscosity of 105, 250 and 340 cP) on sand MTC; iv) validate the equivalent pressure drop concept for predicting sand MTC in sand-air-water flow and v) extend current MTC prediction model for sand-water flow to account for different sand concentrations. Similar sand behaviour was observed in horizontal sand-water flow in all pipe sizes tested. At minimum transport velocity, sand particles were observed transporting in form <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> streaks. For horizontal sand-air-water flow, sand transport characteristics and MTC were strongly dependent on the air-water flow regime. Sand was found to be transported more efficiently within slug or roll wave body, where turbulence is generated intensively. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the factors affecting sand MTC in water and air-water flows in pipeline. It was found that the MTC will increase as sand concentration and pipe diameter increase. Pipeline orientation was found having little effect on sand behaviours and MTC in upwardly inclined water flow. However, in upwardly inclined air-water flow, although sand particles were observed sometime moving backward with the liquid film, the superficial gas and liquid velocities required to transport sand were less than those in the horizontal pipeline {{due to the fact that}} slug flow regime was found more prevailing in inclined pipeline. In addition, the liquid viscosity effect on sand MTC in single phase liquid flow was investigated due to the increase of concerns relating to solids transport in high viscosity crudes. It appeared that, in turbulent flow, sand MTC increased slightly as the fluid viscosity increased. However, when the bulk flow became laminar, the MTC decreased as the fluid viscosity increased. After visually obtained the sand MTC in air-water flow, the measured pressure gradients were compared between MTC condition for sand-water flow for different sand concentrations, the results indicate that the equivalent pressure gradients concept is a valid approach to extend the sand MTC prediction from water flow to air-water flow conditions for the purpose of pipeline design. Two concentration correction correlations (dual range and single range) were proposed. The modified model could account for a wider range <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> concentration (from 0. 000005 to 0. 3 volume fraction) in water flow. The predicted MTC velocities showed good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

Meanwhile the purpose of this research was to know the governmental efforts to protect water catchments area from sand mining in Sleman Regency, in particularly in Cangkringan Subdistrict. In addition the method used for collecting data was direct interview to the source person and respondent. From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards water catchments area has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising water catchments area in Sleman Regency. For the surrounding society and the sand miners, they should have consideration and maintain the function of water catchments area in order to decrease environmental destruction of which is resulted by the mining activity in water catchments area...|$|R

The parasite manipulates the sand fly via production of promastigote secretory gel (PSG), leading to the "blocked sand fly" phenotype, persistent feeding attempts, and feeding on multiple hosts. PSG is injected into the mammalian host with the parasite and promotes the establishment of infection. Animal models demonstrate that sand flies with the highest parasite loads and percent metacyclic promastigotes transmit more parasites with greater frequency, resulting in higher load infections that {{are more likely to}} be both symptomatic and efficient reservoirs.
