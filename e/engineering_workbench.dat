40|$|Abstract—Automating the {{functional}} testing of reactive systems requires {{to provide a}} formal specification of the system environment which defines the admissible test inputs. It also requires a specification of the expected properties of the system in order to decide whether a test succeeds or fails. Engineering these formal specifications is a difficult task, as it {{is not part of}} the usual manual testing process. In this paper, we report some experiments that have been conducted within a project in collaboration with industrial developers of nuclear power plant control systems. In this project, automatic testing tools have been used for checking the correctness of reactive systems developed incrementally, using heterogeneous industrial <b>engineering</b> <b>workbenches.</b> But these tools appeared to be useful also for elaborating and refining formal, consistent, and accurate functional requirements.

40|$|In this project, {{we aim to}} {{implement}} an environment that supports the process of modelling, simulation, performance assessment and execution of business processes. Our Enterprise Design and Execution Environment will be called ProMAX (Process Modelling, Assessment and Execution Environment). ProMAX embodies four properties that seem decisive {{for the success of}} modelling business processes and corresponding process implementations. 1. ProMAX comes with a concept taxonomy to represent enterprises, their objectives and business processes. Equipped with accompanying simulation, performance assessment and optimization tools ProMAX allows the engineering of business processes. ProMAX can be used to engineer all kinds of processes, for example, administrative or manufacturing processes. Processes are represented within a process description framework. 2. ProMAX deploys a repository that manages standardized models and entities available for enterprise engineering. In the process of implementing business processes, these entities have to be considered for reuse. In order {{to implement}} processes as specified, predefined entities can be plugged into ProMAX's process description framework. 3. ProMAX will assist designers to evaluate process performance and provide heuristic guidelines to improve process with respect to a set of performance criteria. 4. ProMAX avoids gaps between process design and execution by connecting the enterprise design environment with operational environments, e. g. work flow management systems. This paper presents the design of the overall ProMAX architecture anddescribes the accompanying enterprise <b>engineering</b> <b>workbenches</b> to be offered by ProMAX. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Continuous {{optimization}} {{of business}} process execution in-cluding its adaptation to changes within the market environment or the company itself becomes increasingly important. Therefore, business per-formance related decision support {{needs to be}} an integral part of Business Process Management (BPM) Environments. We experienced that such a support is especially useful when dealing with complex and resource intensive business processes, such as business processes with layered use of resources or with very complex workflows. Also the statistical distri-bution of the history data or the plan data related to a process might be a reason for such support. In this paper we present our generic Model-Driven Performance <b>Engineering</b> (MDPE) <b>Workbench,</b> which seamlessly integrates different kinds of existing Performance Analysis Tools, such as discrete event simulation tools and optimization tools, with the design-time and runtime of different BPM Environments. In more detail, the MDPE Workbench allows a push-button performance related decision support based on existing process models and process instance data with-out requiring deep performance expertise of BPM users. ...|$|R

The workbench supports an incremental process of corpus analysis starting from a rough automatic extraction and organization of lexico-semantic regularities and ending with a computer supported analysis of extracted data and a semi-automatic refinement of obtained hypotheses. For doing this the workbench employs methods from computational linguistics, information retrieval and knowledge <b>engineering.</b> Although the <b>workbench</b> is currently under implementation some of its components are already implemented and their performance is illustrated with samples from engineering for a medical domain.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{has been}} {{creating}} a special-purpose software-engineering tool to support {{research and development}} of spectrum-output-type [chemical] sensors. The modular software system is called SAGE, the Sensor Algorithm Generation Environment and includes general-purpose signal conditioning algorithms (GP/SAGE) as well as intelligent classifiers, pattern recognizes, response accelerators, and sensitivity analyzers. GP/SAGE is an implementation of an approach for delivering a level of encapsulated intelligence {{to a wide range of}} sensors and instruments. It capitalizes on the genene classification and analysis needed to process most profile-type data. The GP/SAGE native data format is a generalized one-dimensional vector, signature, or spectrum. GP/SAGE modules form a computer-aided software <b>engineering</b> (CASE) <b>workbench</b> where users can experiment with various conditioning, filtering, and pattern recognition stages, then automatically generate final algorithm source code for data acquisition and analysis systems. SAGE was designed to free the [chemical] sensor developer from the signal processing allowing them to focus on understanding and improving the basic sensing mechanisms. The SAGE system's strength is its creative application of advanced neural computing techniques to response-vector and response-surface data, affording new insight and perspectives with regard to phenomena being studied for sensor development...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{high-end}} aerospace components is {{a complex}} and highly competitive business. Hence methods for decreasing lead-time, while still providing the same quality and at a lower cost, has to be developed. This thesis is conducted at Research & Technology - GKN Aerospace in Trollhättan Sweden. A multidisciplinary analysis system known internally as <b>Engineering</b> <b>Workbench,</b> forms the base for implementation of the methods and tools developed in this thesis work. The system applies set-based engineering approach to develop new components. The evaluation of the design space is performed through parametric studies to find relations between the design parameters and performance metrics of the design.

40|$|In this study, we {{had used}} a cam-linkage {{mechanism}} to construct a simulated spot spraying system. The nozzles of sprayer mounted on couplers of the mechanism were driven by a servo-motor and the sprayings were controlled by PC. Using cam-linkage mechanism, at any position of coupler curve that is near straight line the nozzle can spray while the traditional sprayer only can apply at fewer certain positions. Therefore, fewer nozzles are used and more spots can be applied in our approach. The software-matlab-had been {{used to analyze the}} camlinkage mechanism. The relation between the rotation of cam and the position of linkage had been studied. The software-LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument <b>Engineering</b> <b>Workbench)</b> -had been applied on writing the control program for the simulated spot spraying system. In this study, water instead of chemical had been applied in the experiments. The camlinkage was oscillating while measurement cups mounted on belt conveyer was moving that was to simulate a spraying system applying chemical on the field. According to the results, it took about 124 sec in each experimental run, and 93. 4 % of spraying was successfully completed in ten experimental runs. 本研究運用凸輪與連桿複合機構組成定點噴灑模擬裝置。以伺服馬達驅動凸輪與連桿機構，PC控制設於連桿耦點的噴嘴進行噴灑動作。以凸輪與直線連桿機構之結合，將固定式噴嘴改變為可移動直線式噴嘴，可減少噴嘴數目，同時維持施噴範圍，並增加靈活性以及實用性。首先使用matlab軟體模擬機構動作，探討凸輪轉角相對於各連桿位置之關係。在控制部分，以LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument <b>Engineering</b> <b>Workbench)</b> 圖控軟體撰寫控制程式，建立定點噴灑模擬系統。本研究以噴水取代噴藥，凸輪與連桿複合機構在固定位置轉動與擺動噴嘴，而輸送帶移動量杯方式進行試驗，檢測水噴入量杯是否準確，藉此模擬在田間噴藥作業情形。根據試驗結果，每次試驗平均需 124 sec，定點噴灑成功率可達 93. 4 %...|$|E
