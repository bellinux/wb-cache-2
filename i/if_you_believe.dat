5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then you will have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E
500|$|Hayes, {{voice of}} Chef in the film, responded to conservatives urging prudishness as {{a cure for}} society's ills: [...] "If we give in to that and allow [...] to become a scapegoat, you might wind up living in who-know's-what kind of state.... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in [...] and you've got a moral conviction, take it to 'em!" [...] The rating of film later brought {{comparisons}} to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, released in theaters in a digitally altered and censored version {{just two weeks after}} South Park. Kubrick's original cut was given an NC-17 rating, but Warner Bros. then blocked out characters in an orgy scene so the film could be rated R. In response to these debates and controversy, Stone called the MPAA a [...] "bumbling, irresponsible organization".|$|E
500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] {{published}} in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E

500|$|If one is {{interested}} in making something {{for the public to}} view—be it a painting, a book, an album, a film, or a video game, should the POSSIBLE harm that may come out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society? This is, in a sense, pre-crime. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in what you're doing and you want to express yourself, the expression should be primary and any interpretations that come after must always remain of secondary importance {{to the creation of the}} work itself. On another level, the entire correlation between the Dawson College shooting and my game is unfounded. [...] What else did Kimveer like? Black clothes? Goth music? Pizza? [...] If anything, the Dawson College shooting is proof positive that games like [...] should be made; until video games are no longer among the [...] "usual suspects" [...] for homicidal rampages, the public needs to more carefully consider why interactive electronic media is somehow the manufacturer of Manchurian Candidates.|$|E
500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to myself that I was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was.

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} distributed under the title Cop Killer, named for {{the song of the}} same name, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song [...] "KKK Bitch" [...] to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count, but did not remove the song. In an article for the Washington Post, Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like [...] "Cop Killer," [...] writing that [...] "Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right." [...] The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written {{from the point of view}} of a fictional character, and told reporters that [...] "I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But I never did it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," [...] in reference to Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".|$|E
