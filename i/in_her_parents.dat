60|$|So Anna {{was only}} easy at home, where {{the common sense}} and the supreme {{relation}} between her parents produced a freer standard of being than she could find outside. Where, outside the Marsh, could she find the tolerant dignity she had been brought up <b>in?</b> <b>Her</b> <b>parents</b> stood undiminished and unaware of criticism. The people she met outside seemed to begrudge her her very existence. They {{seemed to want to}} belittle her also. She was exceedingly reluctant to go amongst them. She depended upon her mother and her father. And yet she wanted to go out.|$|E

60|$|Nelly Hardy {{had been}} unfortunate <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents,</b> for both drank, {{and she had}} grown up without care or supervision. She had neither brother nor sister. At school she was always either at the top or bottom of her class {{according}} as a fit of diligence or idleness seized her. She was a wild passionate child, feeling bitterly the neglect with which she was treated, her ragged clothes, her unkempt appearance. She was feared and yet liked by the girls of her own age, for she was generous, always ready to do a service, and good-tempered except when excited to passion. She was fonder of joining with the boys, when they would let her, in their games, and, when angered, was ready to hold her own against them with tooth and nail.|$|E
60|$|This was not {{the sort}} of love that {{finished}} Amelia's education; {{and in the course of}} a year turned a good young girl into a good young woman--to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come. This young person (perhaps it was very imprudent <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>parents</b> to encourage her, and abet her in such idolatry and silly romantic ideas) loved, with all her heart, the young officer in His Majesty's service with whom we have made a brief acquaintance. She thought about him the very first moment on waking; and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers. She never had seen a man so beautiful or so clever: such a figure on horseback: such a dancer: such a hero in general. Talk of the Prince's bow! what was it to George's? She had seen Mr. Brummell, whom everybody praised so. Compare such a person as that to her George! Not amongst all the beaux at the Opera (and there were beaux in those days with actual opera hats) was there any one to equal him. He was only good enough to be a fairy prince; and oh, what magnanimity to stoop to such a humble Cinderella! Miss Pinkerton would have tried to check this blind devotion very likely, had she been Amelia's confidante; but not with much success, depend upon it. It is in the nature and instinct of some women. Some are made to scheme, and some to love; and I wish any respected bachelor that reads this may take the sort that best likes him.|$|E
