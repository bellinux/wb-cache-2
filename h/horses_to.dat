50|$|Sacking out is {{a method}} used by <b>horse</b> {{trainers}} <b>to</b> desensitize a <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> potentially frightening situations or objects. It is a process that, done properly, teaches a <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> not fear certain objects or situations, and, over time can be used <b>to</b> teach a <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> stop and listen to its handler in any potentially frightening situation, thus, in effect, to assess the situation instead of immediately acting upon its fight or flight instinct.|$|R

5|$|Displaced Native Americans {{from the}} Californian coast {{moved to the}} Sierra Nevada during the early-to-mid-19th century, {{bringing}} with them their knowledge of Spanish food, technology, and clothing. Joining forces with the other tribes in the area, they raided land grant ranchos on the coast and drove herds of <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the horse collar removed the previous physical restrictions the old harness had on the animal, and allowed the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> be able to exert its full strength in plowing. Originally, {{the structure of the}} old harness forced the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> literally pull its workload, the horse collar’s development instead allowed the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> push its workload, increasing the efficiency of its labor output.|$|R
25|$|Direct rein: {{a squeeze}} and release {{on the line}} {{backwards}} helps <b>to</b> keep the <b>horse</b> from moving out on the circle, causes the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend inward, or asks the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> make the circle smaller.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>horse</b> manages <b>to</b> rear {{while under}} saddle, the rider {{has the best}} chance of {{bringing}} the <b>horse</b> back <b>to</b> the ground by leaning forward, keeping the reins slack and, in some cases, reaching around the neck of the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> distribute as much weight as possible to the forehand. Once on the ground, the rider can prevent further rearing by asking the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> move, either forward or in circles.|$|R
5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings might only be {{as old as the}} early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|In Fáfnismál, {{the dying}} wyrm Fafnir tells the hero Sigurd that, during {{the events of}} Ragnarok, bearing spears, gods will meet at Óskópnir.

5|$|In a {{great many}} —indeed in most— localities there are wild <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> be found, which, {{although}} invariably of domestic descent, being either themselves runaways from some ranch or Indian outfit, or else claiming such for their sires and dams, yet are quite as wild as the antelope on whose domain they have intruded.|$|E
50|$|Improper {{adjustment}} of side reins {{can cause a}} <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> go behind the bit, spoil the horse's training, and even cause the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> feel trapped, leading to rearing {{and the possibility that}} the horse will flip over.|$|R
50|$|Desensitization, {{sometimes}} called sacking out, {{the process of}} introducing a <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> flapping objects such as blankets, teaching the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> allow itself to be touched by an object and not to fear things that people move about a horse.|$|R
50|$|To ask for {{the turn}} on the haunches, the rider must {{coordinate}} several aids at once. The outside leg prevents the hindquarters from swinging out, the outside rein maintains a correct bend to the inside, and helps to regulate the driving aids, telling the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> turn rather than walk forward. The inside leg asks the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend to the inside, pushes the energy into the outside aids, and keeps {{the activity of the}} hindquarters. The inside seatbone should be engaged, again <b>to</b> ask the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend {{in the direction of the}} turn, and the inside rein should help lead the forehand around and also remind the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend in the direction of the turn.|$|R
5|$|In {{recent years}} Portland {{residents}} have started tethering model <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> the rings, sparking interaction, and {{drawing attention to}} part of the city's history.

The rings and art installations have become a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Kiger Mustangs {{are most}} often dun in color, {{although}} they are found in other solid colors. Compact and well-muscled in appearance, their coloration and phenotype make them {{some of the most}} desired by private buyers when horses are removed from the feral herds. The BLM rounds up the horses from the two herd management areas every three to four years, and auctions excess <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> the public, returning <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> public lands that meet the desired coloration and phenotype and sometimes exchanging horses between the two herds to maintain genetic diversity. Horses in private ownership may be registered in several breed associations, the largest and oldest being the Kiger Mesteño Association, established in 1988.|$|E

5|$|After their {{expulsion}} from Mecca, the Muslims fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624, {{and at the}} Battle of Uhud in 625. Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, {{he was unable to}} prevent the Meccan one.|$|E

5|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{flying over}} the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn {{on the morning of}} 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, blocking the road, causing many <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> bolt over a precipice {{on one side of the}} road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E
5|$|Around 1935, {{despite the}} Depression, a few breeders started to linebreed and inbreed cream-colored <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> fix their color and type. In particular, C.T. Rierson began buying cream-colored mares sired by Silver Lace and {{developing}} the American Cream breed in earnest. In 1944, a breed association, the American Cream Association, {{was formed by}} 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter {{in the state of}} Iowa. In 1950, the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture, based on a 1948 recommendation by the National Stallion Enrollment Board.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
50|$|Bitting, {{the process}} of accustoming a <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> a bit and bridle, {{sometimes}} {{with the addition of}} side reins that attach to a saddle, harness, or surcingle (a wide leather or nylon band that goes around the horse's barrel) and accustom the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> the feel of pressure on the bit.|$|R

50|$|By {{weighting}} {{one seat}} bone or the other, one can encourage bend in that direction. This {{should always be}} used with the inside leg asking for the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend around it, and the outside leg providing impulsion for the bend. The hands also ask the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend, with a slight direct or indirect rein. A more advanced form of this set of aids {{is seen in the}} half-pass, where the outside leg asks the <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> step over, the inside opening rein encourages that movement, and the inside seatbone and leg maintain the bend in the direction of travel.|$|R
