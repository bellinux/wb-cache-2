25|$|The {{simplest}} (put) moneyness is fixed-strike moneyness, where M=K, and {{the simplest}} call moneyness is fixed-spot moneyness, where M=S. These are {{also known as}} absolute moneyness, and correspond to not changing coordinates, instead using the raw prices as measures of moneyness; the corresponding volatility surface, with coordinates K and T (tenor) is the absolute volatility surface. The simplest non-trivial moneyness is the ratio of these, either S/K or its reciprocal K/S, which {{is known as the}} (spot) simple moneyness, with analogous forward simple moneyness. Conventionally the <b>fixed</b> <b>quantity</b> is in the denominator, while the variable quantity is in the numerator, so S/K for a single option and varying spots, and K/S for different options at a given spot, such as when constructing a volatility surface. A volatility surface using coordinates a non-trivial moneyness M and time to expiry τ is called the relative volatility surface (with respect to the moneyness M).|$|E

25|$|Some smaller estates failed, {{but others}} were saved from {{collapse}} by a scheme first adopted by one large owner, The British Central Africa Company Ltd. Instead using of direct labour, it issued seeds to tenants {{so they could}} grow cotton and tobacco under supervision, and sell their crops to the planters at low prices. This system was formalised in legislation, the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, which modified thangata by allowing rents to be paid in cash, in a <b>fixed</b> <b>quantity</b> of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The true value of the crop, usually tobacco, given in lieu of rent greatly exceeded the cash rent. Estate landlords also benefited from restrictions on smallholders growing tobacco. Although the estates now largely acted as brokers for their tenants’ produce, and the name thangata, sometimes “tobacco thangata” after its commonest form was applied to rent in kind, the older form of labour thangata persisted on tea estates, and elsewhere if the owner wished to grow crops through direct labour.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{imposition}} of a royal dictatorship, Carol II reconfirmed Gigurtu {{as a member of}} the Superior Economic Council in April 1938. He then made him Public Works and Communications Minister (November 1939June 1940), Foreign Minister (June 1June 28, 1940) and state secretary with ministerial rank (June 28July 4, 1940) in successive cabinets led by Gheorghe Tătărescu. This coincided with a dire situation, in which the Soviet Union pressured Romania into ceding the regions of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (see Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina). As a member of the specially-convened Crown Council, Gigurtu himself participated in the decision to accept Soviet demands. As the country was left isolated when its alliance with the United Kingdom and France crumbled, and came under increasing pressure from Nazi Germany, Carol dismissed Tătărescu. Earlier, Gigurtu's appointment as Foreign Minister had marked a turn toward Germany: he was replacing the Western-oriented Grigore Gafencu, who favoured a continuation of Romania's policy of official neutrality, and this immediately led to a treaty committing delivery of a <b>fixed</b> <b>quantity</b> of Romanian petroleum to Germany in exchange for military equipment.|$|E
25|$|Following the First World War, a Land Commission {{was set up}} in 1920 to {{determine}} how much of the land in Nyasaland should be made available for future European settlement and what existing rights of estate tenants should be preserved and what new ones given. The Commission recommended that all permanent rent-free tenancies under non-disturbance clauses should end, but that tenants-at-will should be given some security of tenure. Apart from the elderly or widows, all should pay rents in cash, in kind or by providing labour. The owners should also have the right to evict surplus tenants to stop their estates becoming overcrowded. The Colonial Office opposed abolishing rights under non-disturbance clauses without a long fixed tenancies, and a five-year term was agreed. By the time legislation was prepared in 1928, there was little demand for more plantations, as the existing estates were ending direct production in favour of marketing tenants’ produce. The legislation enacted in 1928 therefore emphasised that rents could be satisfied by delivering a <b>fixed</b> <b>quantity</b> of acceptable crops to the owner as well as by direct labour or in cash. It met some of the estate owners’ demands but also gave some protection to tenants from the worst excesses of thangata.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} estate {{agriculture}} in Nyasaland {{for much of}} the colonial period was the system of thangata which, in the early colonial period, meant that African on estates had to perform agricultural labour in lieu of the rent for a plot of land on which they could grow food. At first, estates usually required two months’ labour a year from adult men, one month for rent, the second for Hut tax. However, on some estates the obligations of labour tenants were extended, and abuses such as requiring 30 days work (five weeks of six days) for each month of thangata or requiring that women heading households should work were introduced. The demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, and British Central Africa Company was the first estate owner to modify thangata. The company issued seed to African tenants so that they could grow cotton or tobacco under supervision, and then sell their crops to the company at low prices. The Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928 formalised this arrangement by allowing landlords to receive rents in cash, in a <b>fixed</b> <b>quantity</b> of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The term thangata applied both to rent in kind, common on tobacco and cotton estates, and to the older form of labour thangata, which persisted on the tea estates that required direct labour.|$|E

Most tobacco was now grown by smallholders on Crown land. As {{the demand for}} estate labour declined in the 1920s, the owners had insufficient work for their tenants to meet their thangata obligations and claimed that they had become rent-free squatters who should be evicted if they refused to grow economic crops. Larger estates were saved from collapse by replacing direct labour with the scheme of tenants growing cotton and tobacco and selling these to the planters at low prices.
