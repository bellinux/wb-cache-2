40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the distributions of droplet size and charge along with, for selected droplets, the variation of droplet size and charge with time for electrosprays of methanol, acetonitrile, and water, {{as well as for}} methanol at different polarities and electrolyte concentrations. These measurements are performed using a new technique for measuring droplet size and charge that uses phase Doppler interferometry for obtaining droplet size and inferring droplet charge from comparison of measured and calculated droplet mobility in a constant electric field. For selected droplets, multiple {{measurements of}} the size and charge are performed by repeated reversal of the drift field. This “ping-pong” experiment tracks droplet size and charge for loss of up to 99. 9 % of the initial droplet volume. We observe that droplet instability, referred to as a discharge event, mainly occurs near or above the Rayleigh limit of charge, resulting in a charge loss of 15 − 20 % for methanol and acetonitrile and 20 − 40 % in the case of water. Each discharge event is accompanied by a small mass loss, and droplet size evolution is dominated by <b>evaporation.</b> <b>Discharge</b> dynamics for negatively charged droplets are similar to those observed for positively charged droplets. The addition of up to 10 ^(- 4) M of NaCl to the solution does not significantly alter discharge dynamics. Measured size−charge correlations for droplets from electrosprays of methanol at low electrolyte concentrations (< 10 ^(- 5) M), and to a lesser degree acetonitrile with similar electrolyte levels, fall into discrete groupings of size and charge that can be attributed to an initially monodisperse distribution of size and charge, followed by discharge events in which a nearly constant fractional charge loss occurs {{as a result of the}} Rayleigh instability...|$|E
40|$|Assimilating Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) {{data into}} land {{hydrological}} models provides a valuable opportunity {{to improve the}} models’ forecasts and increases our knowledge of terrestrial water storages (TWS). The assimilation, however, may harm the consistency between hydrological water fluxes, namely precipitation, <b>evaporation,</b> <b>discharge,</b> and water storage changes. To address this issue, we propose a weak constrained ensemble Kalman filter (WCEnKF) that maintains estimated water budgets in balance with other water fluxes. Therefore, in this study, GRACE terrestrial water storages data are assimilated into the World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W 3 RA) hydrological model over the Earth’s land areas covering 2002 – 2012. Multi-mission remotely sensed precipitation measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and evaporation products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as well as ground-based water discharge measurements are applied to close the water balance equation. The proposed WCEnKF contains two update steps; first, it incorporates observations from GRACE to improve model simulations of water storages, and second, uses the additional observations of precipitation, evaporation, and water discharge to establish the water budget closure. These steps are designed to account for error information associated with the included observation sets during the assimilation process. In order to evaluate the assimilation results, in addition to monitoring the water budget closure errors, in situ groundwater measurements over the Mississippi River Basin in the US and the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia are used. Our results indicate approximately 24 % improvement in the WCEnKF groundwater estimates over both basins {{compared to the use}} of (constraint-free) EnKF. WCEnKF also further reduces imbalance errors by approximately 82. 53 % (on average) {{and at the same time}} increases the correlations between the assimilation solutions and the water fluxes...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} studies different hydrological {{models in the}} catchments with various climates in the USA, and MODIS snow cover maps are introduced to assess and improve the models. In this research, assessment {{of the value of}} MODIS snow cover data in the hydrological modeling process is the main objective. Nine MOPEX catchments in the continental US are studied in this research and for each catchment three types of models are used: (1) a basic, lumped 3 -box version of the HBV model, (2) a lumped version with snow reservoir, and (3) a semi-distributed formulation of HBV with snow reservoir. MODIS snow cover maps are used for assessing and improving the model snow component. In the models with snow reservoir, snow water storage is reduced to its binary information content: snow/no snow (i. e. 1 or 0), which is then directly linked with spatial pattern in MODIS snow cover data without the need for further assumptions, such as snow densities; the coincidence of snow water storage in the model and observed MODIS snow cover is used as additional calibration/evaluation metric to condition and test the realism of the respective models. In this research, daily meteorological and hydrological data (precipitation, <b>evaporation,</b> <b>discharge,</b> temperature) and maximum eight-day MODIS snow cover maps for the study catchments are used. In calibration, in each time step, the modelled maximum binary 8 -day snow reservoir value is compared with MODIS snow cover data for the respective model or its sub-units (in the semi-distributed formulation). Model 03 is semi-distributed, by discretizing each study catchment into individual 200 m elevation bands. The results show a large difference of model performance in the catchments with various climates. It is shown that MODIS snow cover data can be valuable to assess the degree to which spatial snow accumulation and ablation dynamics are represented in models, thereby increasing model realism, while not necessarily improving the calibrated performance of models.

40|$|We report {{studies of}} the <b>evaporation</b> and <b>discharge</b> {{dynamics}} of highly charged droplets generated by electrospray ionization from n-heptane, n-octane, and p-xylene doped with Stadis- 450, a conductivity-enhancing agent. A phase Doppler anemometer (PDA) characterizes individual droplets moving through the uniform electric field within an ion mobility cell according to size, velocity, and charge. Repeated reversal of the electric field allows multiple PDA measurements on selected droplets with diameters ranging from 3 to 60 μm and up to 10 ^ 7 elementary positive charges. This “ping-pong” technique provides individual droplet histories from which we determine the dynamics of solvent evaporation and charge loss. On average, n-heptane discharges at 101 % of the Rayleigh limit of charge, while n-octane and p-xylene droplets discharge at 87 % and 89 % of their respective limits. Discharge events release an average of 19 % of the charge in n-heptane and 17 % of the charge in both n-octane and p-xylene. Within {{the limits of the}} measurements, no detectable change in droplet diameter accompanies observed discharge events, indicating the loss of a relatively small fraction of the total volume. We compare these results to previous experiments, theoretical models for droplet <b>evaporation</b> and <b>discharge,</b> and predictions from the Rayleigh model.

40|$|In {{order to}} control {{stormwater}} runoff engineers and hydrologists have used various techniques {{to attempt to}} reduce or delay the volume of water which reaches the sewer system. Recently, international approaches have favoured the idea of "source control" or "on-site" retention. This technique stores water in areas close to {{the point at which}} precipitation lands. Permeable pavements and similar stormwater control devices have not been exploited in the United Kingdom. Their adoption has been hindered by a lack of knowledge of their hydrological performance. This research aims to produce information on the hydrological performance of a car park surface and to produce a model which can predict the hydrological response to varying rainfall inputs. The objective of this thesis is to examine the hydrological behaviour of a model car park surface under varying rainfall conditions. The study has involved the construction of full-scale permeable pavement model car park structures and a rainfall simulator for use in the laboratory. A monitoring procedure was developed in order to measure inputs and changes in drainage, storage and evaporation over short (less than 2 hours) and long (up to 3 months) time scales. A range of rainfall simulations were applied to the model car park surfaces which differed in intensity, duration and volume. Hydrological processes were monitored over an 18 month period. Results suggest that <b>evaporation,</b> <b>discharge</b> and retention in the structures were strongly influenced by the particle size of the bedding material and the surface blocks. In general an average of 55 % of a 15 mm 11 - 1 rainfall event could be retained by an initially dry structure. Subsequent simulations suggest that approximately 30 % of a 15 mm rainfall event could be stored by an initially wet structure (with a minimum time interval of 72 hours). Sediments were also applied to the car park structures in order to monitor the effects of clogging on hydrological performance and to quantify the ability of the structures to act as a primary screening site for sediments. The application of sediments to the structure showed that evaporation from the structure increased by as much as 25 - 30 %. Laboratory simulation of clogging effects was also compared to data gathered from field sites and the results suggested that laboratory simulations provided a good approximation of the migration of sediments in the structure. A model of the hydrological performance of the structure has been developed {{to be used as a}} predictive tool. The model relates rainfall inputs to water retention and discharge output over consecutive rainfall events. It also allows evaporation and long-term retention by the structure to be estimated over differing lengths of dry periods. The model results indicate that discharge was predicted to an accuracy of 78 % (based on a percentage difference between the observed and predicted values), and evaporation and retention were predicted to an accuracy of 80 %...|$|E
40|$|Management {{of a large}} {{river basin}} {{requires}} information regarding the interactions of variables describing the system. A method has been developed to determine these interactions so that the resources management within a given river basin can proceed in an optimal way. The method {{can be used as}} a planning tool to display how different management alternatives affect the behavior of the river system. Direct application is made to the Colorado River Basin. The Colorado River has a relatively low and highly variable streamflow. Allocated rights to the consumptive use of the river water exceed the present long-term average flow. The naturally high total dissolved solids concentration of the river water continues to increase due to the activities of man. Current management policies in the basin have been the products of compromises between the seven states and two countries which are traversed by the river or its tributaries. The anticipated use of the scarce supply of water in the extraction and processing of energy resources in the basin underwrites the need for planning tools which can illuminate many possible management alternatives and their effects upon water supply, water quality, power production, and the other concerns of the Colorado River water users. A computer simulation model has been developed and used to simulate the effects of various management alternatives upon water conservation, water quality, and power production. The model generates synthetic sequences of streamflows and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations. The flows of water and TDS are then routed through the major reservoirs of the system, Lakes Powell and Mead. Characteristics of system behavior are examined from simulations using different streamflow sequences, upstream depletion levels, and reservoir operating policies. Reservoir <b>evaporation,</b> <b>discharge,</b> discharge salinity, and power generating capacity are examined. Simulation outputs show that the probability with which Lake Powell fails to supply a specified target discharge is highly variable. Simulations employing different streamflow sequences result in probabilities of reservoir failure which differ by as much as 0. 1. Three levels of Upper Colorado River Basin demands are imposed on the model: 3. 8 MAF/yr (4. 7 km^ 3 /yr), 4. 6 MAF/yr (5. 7 km^ 3 /yr), and 5. 5 MAF/yr (6. 8 km^ 3 /yr). Two levels of water demand are imposed below Lake Mead: 8. 25 MAF/yr (10. 2 km^ 3 /yr) and 7. 0 MAF/yr (6. 8 km^ 3 /yr). Although the effects of reservoir operations upon water quality are made uncertain by a lack of knowledge regarding the chemical limnology of Lake Powell, two possible lake chemistry models have been developed, and the predicted impacts of changes in reservoir operation upon water quality are presented. The current criteria for the operations of Lakes Powell and Mead are based upon 75 years of compromises and agreements between the various water interests in the Colorado River Basin. Simulations show that Lake Powell will be unable to conform to these operating constraints at the higher levels of water demand. An alternative form of reservoir operation is defined and compared to the existing policy on the basis of reliability of water supply, conservation of water, impact upon water quality, and the effect upon power generation. Ignoring the current institutional operating constraints, and attempting only to provide a reliable supply of water at the locations of water demand, is shown to be a superior management policy. This alternate policy results in the conservation of as much as 0. 25 MAF/yr (0. 3 km^ 3 /yr) of water. The impact of the alternate operating policy upon hydroelectric power generation and the potential use of the conserved water for development of energy resources is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} <b>evaporation</b> and Rayleigh <b>discharge</b> {{dynamics}} of highly charged micron-sized droplets and explores new methodologies for extracting ions for mass analysis from neutral droplets using strong electric fields in a technique termed field-induced droplet ionization. A phase Doppler anemometer characterizes individual highly charged droplets moving through a uniform, mild electric field within an ion mobility cell according to size, velocity, and charge. Repeated reversals {{of the electric}} field allow multiple characterizations on selected droplets. This "ping-pong" technique provides droplet histories that determine the solvent <b>evaporation</b> and Rayleigh <b>discharge</b> behavior. The ping-pong experiment characterizes volatile droplets of the hydrocarbon solvents n-heptane, n-octane, and p-xylene as well as two-component droplets of either 2 -methoxyethanol, tert-butanol, or m-nitrobenzyl alcohol with methanol. On average, hydrocarbon droplets eject 18 % of their net charge into progeny droplets with an undetectable loss in mass. Rayleigh discharge events in the polar, binary droplets release between 20 and 35 % of the net charge with a correspondingly undetectable loss in mass. In other experiments, strong electric fields elongate neutral droplets along the field axis. Field-induced droplet ionization (FIDI) occurs at sufficient field strengths as the droplets eject opposing jets of positively and negatively charged progeny droplets. Images of droplets from a vibrating orifice aerosol generator illustrate this phenomenon, and mass spectrometric sampling of the progeny droplets demonstrates {{that they are a}} viable source of desolvated gas-phase ions. Switched electric field experiments relate the timescale of droplet elongation and progeny droplet formation in FIDI to the timescale of oscillations of droplets in sub-critical field strengths. FIDI mass spectra are presented for several species, including tetraheptyl ammonium cation, deprotonated benzene tetracarboxylic acid, and multiply protonated cytochrome c.

40|$|A key {{component}} of the climate system is the global water cycle. The complex interactions between the land-ocean-atmosphere are inherently linked through the water cycle. The global water cycle is known to influence global atmospheric circulations by controlling the global energy cycle through latent heat exchanges associated with evaporation and cloud condensation and also the carbon, nutrient and sediment cycles. Changes to this balance has far reaching climatic effects, especially considering {{that over the past}} century human activities have altered not only the land surface but also the atmospheric composition (Stute et al. 2001; Karl and Trenberth 2003). A change to the atmospheres’ composition is the primary way that humans have altered the natural flow of energy through the global climate (Karl and Trenberth 2003). That temperatures are increasing globally is unequivocal, as reported in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. (IPCC 2007). Observations in recent decades of air and ocean temperatures show the climate system is warming, with hot days, hot nights and heat waves becoming more frequent in the past 50 years (IPCC 2007). One direct consequence of a warmer world is an increase in water vapour contained in the atmosphere, indeed for every one decree increase in temperature there is a seven percent increase in the water vapour content of the atmosphere (Karl and Trenberth 2003).

However, modelling efforts over large spatial domains are fraught with problems of data scarcity, uncertainties and inconsistencies between forcing and evaluation data. Model-independent methods to screen and analyse data for such problems are needed. This study aims at identifying data inconsistencies in global datasets using a pre-modelling analysis, inconsistencies that can be disinformative for subsequent modelling. The consistency between different hydrographic datasets, and between climate data (precipitation and potential <b>evaporation),</b> and <b>discharge</b> data was examined in terms of how well basin areas were represented in the flow networks and the possibility of water-balance closure. It was found that: (i) most basins could be well represented in both gridded basin delineations and polygon-based ones, but some basins exhibited large area discrepancies between flow-network datasets and archived basin areas, (ii) basins exhibiting too-high runoff coefficients were abundant in areas where precipitation data were likely affected by snow undercatch, and (iii) the occurrence of basins exhibiting losses exceeding the energy limit was strongly dependent on the potential-evaporation data, both in terms of numbers and geographical distribution. These results emphasise the need for pre-modelling data analysis to identify dataset inconsistencies as an important first step in any large-scale study.

Kirchner's (2009) approach of inferring rainfall and <b>evaporation</b> from <b>discharge</b> fluctuations by “doing hydrology backward” {{is based on the}} assumption that catchment behavior can be conceptualized with a single storage-discharge relationship. Here we test Kirchner's approach using a densely instrumented hydrologic measurement network spanning 24 geologically diverse subbasins of the Alzette catchment in Luxembourg. We show that effective rainfall rates inferred from discharge fluctuations generally correlate well with catchment-averaged precipitation radar estimates in catchments ranging from less than 10 to more than 1000 km 2 in size. The correlation between predicted and observed effective precipitation was 0. 8 or better in 23 of our 24 catchments, and prediction skill did not vary systematically with catchment size or with the {{complexity of}} the underlying geology.

While model-dependent evaporative losses are critical for modelling mean discharge, multiple physical processes at many time scales influence the variability and timing of discharge. Here we advocate the use of cross-spectral analysis to measure how the average amplitude, and independently the average phase, of modelled discharge differ from observed discharge at daily to decadal time scales. Simulation of the spectral properties of the model discharge via numerical manipulation of precipitation confirms that modelled transformation involves runoff generation and routing that amplify the annual cycle, while subsurface storage and routing of runoff between grid boxes introduces most autocorrelation and delays. Too {{much or too little}} modelled <b>evaporation</b> affects <b>discharge</b> variability as do the capacity and time constants of modelled stores. Additionally the performance of specific models would improve if four issues were tackled: a) non-sinusoidal annual variations in model discharge (prolonged low baseflow and shortened high baseflow, 3 models), b) excessive attenuation of high frequency variability (3 models), c) excessive short-term variability in winter half years but too little variability in summer half years (2 models) and d) introduction of phase delays at the annual scale only during runoff generation (3 models) or only during routing (1 model).

Water resources studies revealed that inflow waters to the wetland include rainfall, agricultural drainage discharges, groundwater contribution, and effluents resulted from human activities, while <b>evaporation</b> and <b>discharges</b> to the sea through Boughaz Al-Borg represent the total outflow term in the flood routing equation. To define {{the interaction between the}} wetland and the Mediterranean Sea water, reservoir hydrologic routing has been implemented. Furthermore, a diagram that represents the relation between the change in storage within the lake and outflow to the sea has been developed. The values of outflow discharges and the change in water stored in the lake have been estimated. Furthermore, typical inflow-outflow hydrographs have been initiated for the wetland. Results of flood routing indicate that inflow waters represented mainly by agricultural drainage waters dominate the fluctuation of water level in the lake. Analyses also demonstrate that water level fluctuates between 28 and 61 cm above mean sea level. That means water in the lake is in continuous movement toward the sea. Results of water balance indicate that rainfall represents about 2 %, groundwater contributes about 0. 8 % to the system, human activities represents about 0. 2 % while agricultural drainage waters represent 97 %. On the other hand, evaporation losses consume 16 % of the total annual water volume in the wetland. Outflow to the sea represents 80 % while the change in storage represents 4 % of the annual water balance in the wetland. ...|$|R

Nine {{distributed}} hydrological models, forced with common meteorological inputs, simulated naturalized daily {{discharge from the}} Thames basin for 1963 - 2001. While model-dependent evaporative losses are critical for modeling mean discharge, multiple physical processes at many time scales influence the variability and timing of discharge. Here the use of cross-spectral analysis is advocated to measure how the average amplitude- and independently, the average phase-of modeled discharge differ from observed discharge at daily to decadal time scales. Simulation of the spectral properties of the model discharge via numerical manipulation of precipitation confirms that modeled transformation involves runoff generation and routing that amplify the annual cycle, while subsurface storage and routing of runoff between grid boxes introduces most of the autocorrelation and delays. Too {{much or too little}} modeled <b>evaporation</b> affects <b>discharge</b> variability, as do the capacity and time constants of modeled stores. Additionally, the performance of specific models would improve if four issues were tackled: 1) nonsinusoidal annual variations in model discharge (prolonged low base flow and shortened high base flow; three models), 2) excessive attenuation of highfrequency variability (three models), 3) excessive short-term variability in winter half years but too little variability in summer half years (two models), and 4) introduction of phase delays at the annual scale only during runoff generation (three models) or only during routing (one model). Cross-spectral analysis reveals how reruns of one model using alternative methods of runoff generation-designed to improve performance at the weekly to monthly time scales-degraded performance at the annual scale. The cross-spectral approach facilitates hydrological model diagnoses and development...|$|R
40|$|Peening {{provides}} {{compression of}} component (6, 46, 56) surfaces {{in order to}} create residual surface compressions to resist crack propagation in components such as aerofoils. Previously peening techniques have had problems with respect to achieving adequate treatment depths, speed of treatment and with respect to effectiveness. By the present method arrangement an electrical conductor (1, 41, 51) {{in the form of a}} wire is subject to electrical pulses to cause evaporation and subsequent breakdown with high power ultrasound (HPU) propagation in a volume of dielectric fluid towards a component and so peening. The electrical conductor (1, 41, 51) ensures that there is limited possibility of electrical discharge to the component (6, 46, 51) surface whilst the positioning of the wire (1, 41, 51) relative to the surface can be adjusted to achieve best effect particularly if reflector (5) devices are utilised to concentrate (HPU) pulse presentation to the component (6, 46, 56). Furthermore, the component (6, 46, 56) can be surface treated in order to provide protection from potentially damaging emissions from <b>evaporation</b> and electrical <b>discharge</b> to the wire (1, 41, 51) ...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{reservoir}} volume fluctuation {{is important for}} the operation of dam reservoir, design of hydraulic structures; determine pollution in reservoir and the safety of dams. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) approach provides a common basis for quantitative modeling in this respect. In this study, {{reservoir volume}} was estimated using average monthly precipitation, monthly total volume of <b>evaporation,</b> dam spillway <b>discharge</b> volume, released irrigation water amount and periodicity. The data were collected on a monthly basis over the 29 years for Tahtaköprü Dam in the southeast Mediterranean region of Turkey. For this purpose, three well known methods, artificial neural networks, support vector and multiple linear regressions were employed for estimating the reservoir volume. In this paper, a multi layer perception (MLP) methodology is used as the ANN approach. Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm is used for optimization of the network. MLP and SVR results are compared to multi-linear regression (MLP) model results. The results show that reservoir volume was successfully estimated using ANN and SVR with low mean square error and high correlation coefficients...|$|R
40|$|The springs of the Cuatro Ciénegas bolson (Four Marshes basin), Coahuila, México, support {{more than}} 70 endemic species of biota. The {{specifics}} of the groundwater flow regime, however, remain a mystery. Water samples were collected {{from a series of}} springs and pools and one canal in the Cuatro Ciénegas bolson and analyzed for field parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, alkalinity) and stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in an attempt to begin a systematic study of the hydrogeology of the region. Groundwaters discharging directly along a fault-controlled spring line in Cretaceous carbonate rocks of the Cupido-Aurora aquifer are the most dilute (lowest conductivities) and warmest of those sampled. Cuatro Ciénegas waters are characterized by circumneutral pH (6. 9 – 7. 7) and reasonably low alkalinity (160 – 215 mg/kg as HCO 3). The d 18 O values of Cuatro Ciénegas waters range from 28. 2 to 25. 7 ‰, with a mean of 26. 5 ^ 0. 82 ‰, whereas dD ranges from 252 to 243 ‰, with a mean of 246. 6 ^ 3. 2 ‰. The majority of the water samples plot subparallel and beneath the local meteoric water line; those samples collected farthest from the spring line exhibit the most enriched d 18 O and dD values. The stable isotope data indicate that isotopic enrichment of groundwaters by <b>evaporation</b> following <b>discharge</b> and subsequent surface flow is an important process within the Cuatro Ciénegas bolson. The isotope data also suggest that a fraction of Cuatro Ciénegas groundwater originates with local recharge in mountains surrounding the bolson. Those springs that issue from the western base of the Sierra de San Marcos mountain range are recharged in part in these mountains, whereas groundwaters discharging from Laguna Anteojo in the norther...|$|R
40|$|Major ion {{and stable}} isotope {{geochemistry}} allow groundwater/surface-water interaction associated with saline to hypersaline lakes from the Willaura region of Australia to be understood. Ephemeral lakes lie {{above the water}} table and locally contain saline water (total dissolved solids, TDS, contents up to 119, 000 mg/L). Saline lakes that lack halite crusts and which have Cl/Br ratios similar to local surface water and groundwater are throughflow lakes with high relative rates of groundwater outflows. Permanent hypersaline lakes contain brines with TDS contents of up to 280, 000 mg/L and low Cl/Br ratios due {{to the formation of}} halite in evaporite crusts. These lakes are throughflow lakes with relatively low throughflow rates relative to <b>evaporation</b> or terminal <b>discharge</b> lakes. Variations in stable isotope and major ion geochemistry show that the hypersaline lakes undergo seasonal cycles of mineral dissolution and precipitation driven by the influx of surface water and evaporation. Despite the generation of highly saline brines in these lakes, leakage from the adjacent ephemeral lakes or saline throughflow lakes that lack evaporite crusts is mainly responsible for the high salinity of shallow groundwater in this region...|$|R

Historical precipitation and lake water levels were acquired from literature, local agencies and from global databases in order to compile a coherent dataset. The net lake inflow was modelled using a soil water balance model and the water levels were reconstructed using a parsimonious lake water balance model. The soil water balance shows that 370 mmyr− 1 (25 %) of the precipitation in the catchment contributes to the runoff and baseflow whereas 1100 mmyr− 1 (75 %) contributes to the evapotranspiration. A review of the lake water balance resulted in the following estimates of hydrological contributions: 55 %, 25 %, and 20 % of the overall inputs from precipitation, surface inflows, and subaquatic groundwater discharge, respectively. The overall losses were 58 % and 42 % for lake surface <b>evaporation</b> and outflow <b>discharge,</b> respectively.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) were serendipitously discovered as {{a byproduct}} of fullerenes by direct current (DC) arc discharge; and today this is the most-wanted material in the nanotechnology research. In this brief review, I begin {{with the history of}} the discovery of CNTs and focus on CNTs produced by arc discharge in hydrogen atmosphere, which is little explored outside my laboratory. DC arc <b>discharge</b> <b>evaporation</b> of pure graphite rod in pure hydrogen gas results in multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) of high crystallinity in the cathode deposit. As-grown MWCNTs have very narrow inner diameter. Raman spectra of these MWCNTs show high-intensity G-band, unusual high-frequency radial breathing mode at 570 cm− 1, and a new characteristic peak near 1850 cm− 1. Exciting carbon nanowires (CNWs), consisting of a linear carbon chain in the center of MWCNTs are also produced. Arc evaporation of graphite rod containing metal catalysts results in single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the whole chamber like macroscopic webs. Two kinds of arc method have been developed to produce SWCNTs: Arc plasma jet (APJ) and Ferrum-Hydrogen (FH) arc methods. Some new purification methods for as-produced SWCNTs are reviewed.

30|$|A way to {{increase}} metallic nanoparticle production up to an industrial scale is being studied in the European Commission 7 th Framework Program “BUONAPART-E” [1]. The goal is to develop the selected electrical arc <b>discharge</b> <b>evaporation</b> and condensation technique {{to be able to}} produce several kilograms of nanoparticles per day [1]. In order to evaluate the environmental impact of the electrical discharge method it needs to be compared with other methods for nanoparticle production. The studied method is a non-chemical route to produce the particles, and chemical synthesis routes were selected for comparison. To compare the environmental effects of the different methods life cycle assessment, LCA, was chosen as a tool. SimaPro 7.3 software using the Ecoinvent v 2.2 database is used to calculate the life cycle impact, LCI, of the different nanoparticle production routes using the IMPACT 2002 + method. In this paper the production of nanoparticles of four, copper, silver, zinc and aluminum, out of six metals and two alloys studied in the BUONAPART-E project, is evaluated, with the goal of assessing the environmental impact of the process and to compare the process with chemical synthesis routes for producing the same nanoparticles.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} changes and shorter-term variability in monthly, seasonal, and arL' 1 ual discharge between 1882 and 2004 of two rivers, the Severnaya Dvina (SD) and the Sukhona (SU), draining north-western Russia, and links these changes to climatic variability. The Severnaya Dvina {{is one of}} the largest rivers of the lUetic Ocean basin and changes in its discharge can potentially affect the Thermohaline Circulation. The SU is a tributary to SD and results have been used to corroborate findings obtained for SD. It has been suggested by previous studies that discharge of the rivers draining the Eurasian sector of the Arctic basin has significantly increased. However, these studies started during one afthe warmest and driest periods on record in the 930 s. Analysis of the discharge records of the SD and the SU has shown that that there has been no long-term, linear change in discharge. Strong interdecadal variability characterises both records and a number of significant shifts from lower to higher discharge occurs. The early part of the records (1882 - the early 1930 s) is characterised by high annual discharge with many strong positive anomalies. A period of low discharge started in the dry 1930 s and continued until the early 1970 s. The last decades were characterised by average annual discharge. The main implication from this study is that freshwater inflow trom European Russia into the Arctic Ocean has not changed since 1882. Oscillations in regional climate and large-scale atmospheric circulation (telecop [...] nection patterns) drive discharge variability. There are close causal links between variability in regional precipitation, air temperature, snow cover, <b>evaporation,</b> and <b>discharge.</b> Variability in teleconnection indices (most importantly North Atlantic Oscillation, Scandinavian and East Atlantic Jet pattern) explains between 13 % (summer) and 48 % (winter) variance in seasonal discharge.
