30|$|The {{validation}} {{and repair}} pattern {{is based on}} models that allow transforming infeasible <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> into feasible profiles. Already feasible profiles either remain unchanged when the model is applied or are filtered beforehand, e.g. through pattern A. In addition to allowing the generation of feasible <b>load</b> <b>profiles,</b> the validation and repair pattern can simplify the directed search for feasible <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> if the transformed, i.e. repaired, <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> {{is similar to the}} profile given to the model.

30|$|A {{malicious}} utility may {{attempt to}} provide one single template <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> per day and change it on a daily basis.

In order to prevent this, the third party can enforce |L_u|> 1 for all utilities u.|$|R
30|$|In the {{classification}} pattern the pattern specific {{model is a}} classifier. The DSMgr generates <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> either randomly or according to a given algorithm and validates them, i.e., classifies whether the <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> {{are likely to be}} feasible. By memorizing the discovered feasible profiles, a set of feasible <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> is generated. This set is used for determining the best <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> in terms of the DSMgr’s goals and the resulting profiles are transmitted to the respective building’s EMS.|$|R

40|$|<b>Load</b> <b>profiles</b> play an {{important}} role in electricity industry. They are widely used in tariff design and system operation planning. In the UK, the <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> currently used by the industry were developed in 1990 s. Although they have served the industry well for decades, the increasing number of low carbon customers may cause the actual <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> to deviate from the original benchmarks. Thus, these existing <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> may not be able to appropriately reflect the energy usage patterns nowadays. Therefore, it is necessary to test the accuracy and applicability of the existing classic <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> and further refine them to better mimic the actual power consumption patterns. Theoretically, it is more accurate to obtain <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> by measuring the power consumption of all customers in each class; however, the reality is that it is often too expensive or impractical to collect and analyze the load data for an entire area. This report proposes a power synthesis approach to testify and analyze the representativeness of the existing <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> in the new power environment. The <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> currently used by the UK's industry are first introduced and they are further tested with the recorded data taken from Dowlishford substation in Southwest England. Obtained results show that the current <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> are out of date, and the corresponding errors are identified and the causes are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a {{top-down}} approach to generating <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of end-consumers is described. The {{focus is on}} small consumers connected to the low voltage (LV) grid, e. g. a single household. The algorithm is based on either given measurements or synthetically generated bottom-up <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> {{as well as a}} known average <b>load</b> <b>profile.</b> The data are statistically analysed and described in cumulative probability functions (CDF). By employing random numbers that conform to the CDF, both active and reactive power high resolution <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> can be generated. The presented method is fast-acting and is therefore appropriate for generating large numbers of <b>load</b> <b>profiles.</b> In contrast to a bottom-up approach, it is also applicable if no or only little information about the consumer is available.

30|$|Template <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> allow each {{utility to}} control demand and {{response}} in a fine-grained manner, e.g., by rewarding customers with atypical <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> so that peak loads are avoided. Although the tariffs {{need to be}} known to the customers for billing and transparency, the template <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> {{are considered to be}} private to the respective utility. Therefore, no details are shared with competing utilities. In practice, template <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> and tariffs may be significantly more complex than the example described above, with privacy on the utility side being a much more pressing issue.|$|R
30|$|The {{necessity}} of the quantization {{operation in the}} embedding calculation can be demonstrated {{for this kind of}} collusion. If quantization is omitted, even the distance of the <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> forecast to a single template <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> leaking from TP to U may be enough information for U to reconstruct the <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> forecast. Without quantization, the embedding calculation is a linear transformation of the input profile. Especially for a high embedding dimension m>k, this then forms an overdetermined system of m equations that enables U to calculate the k values of the <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> forecast.|$|R

Since the utility only communicates with the third party, it does not get access either to the <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> forecast or to template <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of other utilities. The tariff the smart meter receives {{at the end of the}} protocol is not revealed to the utility due to the properties of the oblivious transfer.|$|R

40|$|A proper {{estimation}} of the residential <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> in the LV network is an important aspect for distribution system design, planning and operation. However, the currently used approaches to characterize the LV residential <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> are not comprehensive enough for a thorough evaluation of the operational conditions in the LV network, as highlighted in [1]. Therefore, in this paper, an approach for LV residential customers' <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> characterization is proposed together with a methodology for applying it to generate more realistic synthetic load data. Based on comprehensive measurements conducted in a typical LV network, real <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> from residential customers were obtained. These <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> have been analyzed and characterized to enable {{estimation of}} synthetic load data, {{which can be used}} for more accurate network simulations. The proposed characterization method of LV <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> can be generally applied to improve the current network analysis and can be also updated to apply for the future LV loading patterns with new measured data...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} {{become more and}} more popular among {{residential}} electricity customers in Germany due to the state funding and low rates. The integration of the renewable sources into the low voltage grid requires the grid planning process which involves using the household <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> with high time resolution (e. g., 15 s). Only a small number of households have smart meters installed and that is why methods for modeling realistic household <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> with high time resolution are required. There are not a lot of such methods available and all of them require a lot of the data as an input which can be hard to obtain. This thesis is focused on developing a model which can be used for simulating realistic mean <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of a small number of households and which does not require any specific data for each household. A mean <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> of 13 households was analyzed and stochastic model based on this analysis was developed. This model allows to generate annual mean <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of a different number of households with 15 s time resolution using the Standard <b>Load</b> <b>Profile</b> (SLP) for the region under consideration. By comparing the generated <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> with the real ones it was concluded that the model is capable to generate realistic mean <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of the different number of households.

40|$|Electrical <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of a {{particular}} region are usually {{required in order to}} study the performance of renewable energy technologies and the impact of different operational strategies on the power grid. <b>Load</b> <b>profiles</b> are generally constructed based on measurements and load research surveys which are capital and labour-intensive. In the absence of true <b>load</b> <b>profiles,</b> synthetically generated <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> can be a viable alternative to be used as benchmarks for research or renewable energy investment planning. In this paper, the feasibility of using publicly available load and weather data to generate synthetic <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> is investigated. An artificial neural network (ANN) based method is proposed to synthesize <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> for a target region using its typical meteorological year 2 (TMY 2) weather data as the input. To achieve this, the proposed ANN models are first trained using TMY 2 weather data and <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> data of neighbouring regions as the input and targeted output. The limited number of data points in the <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> dataset and the consequent averaging of TMY 2 weather data to match its period resulted in limited data availability for training. This challenge was tackled by incorporating generalization using Bayesian regularization into training. The other major challenge was facilitating ANN extrapolation and this was accomplished by the incorporation of domain knowledge into the input weather data for training. The performance of the proposed technique has been evaluated by simulation studies and tested on three real datasets. Results indicate that the generated synthetic <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> closely resemble the real ones and therefore can be used as benchmarks...|$|R
30|$|The utility cannot {{intercept}} the {{submission of}} template <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> {{of any other}} utility (due to encryption as described above). In addition, the utility may, theoretically, provide one tariff for every possible template <b>load</b> <b>profile.</b> This would allow the utility to associate perfect matches and thereby reveal <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> forecasts. However, in a practical setting like in Section 5, with 96 values of 16 bits size, this would require the utility to provide a total of i̇ 2 ^ 16 ^ 96 > 10 ^ 10 ^ 115 different template <b>load</b> <b>profiles,</b> which is clearly infeasible.|$|R
30|$|In the {{generation}} pattern, the models {{are used to}} generate valid <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> from arbitrary representations. An intuitive type of representation is, for example, a control sequence specifying how a DER operates. By processing the commands in the control sequence the model can generate a <b>load</b> <b>profile.</b> Another type of (latent) representation, usually used in Generative Adversarial Networks, is a vector of random variables. Given a model, the DSMgr creates representations either randomly or according to an algorithm and generates a feasible <b>load</b> <b>profile</b> from each representation. In this pattern, like in pattern A, <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> are selected and transmitted.|$|R
30|$|For retailors, {{although}} {{monthly average}} electricity price forecasting {{can help them}} set the rate plan, the contribution of monthly average price to the retailors is very limited. The reason is as follows. Monthly average price is the load weighted price of system <b>load</b> <b>profile.</b> If the <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of the customers of the retailor {{are different from the}} system <b>load</b> <b>profile,</b> the average cost per KWh of the retailor may be different from the monthly average electricity price due to the significant price difference between peak and off-peak hours. Therefore, if a month ahead average daily electricity price profile can be forecasted, retailors can set the month-to-month variable rate plan based on the <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> of the customers. The rate can even be customized for each consumer based on his/her <b>load</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|R
