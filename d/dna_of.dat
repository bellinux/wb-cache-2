40|$|The 31 human {{adenovirus}} (Ad) serotypes form five {{groups based}} upon DNA genome homologies: group A (Ad 12, 18, 31), group B (Ad 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 21), group C (Ad 1, 2, 5, 6), group D (Ad 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22 - 30), and group E (Ad 4) (M. Green, J. Mackey, W. Wold, and P. Rigden, Virology, in press). Group A Ads are highly oncogenic in newborn hamsters, group B Ads are weakly oncogenic, and other Ads are nononcogenic. However, {{most or all}} Ads transform cultured cells. We have studied the homology of Ad 5, Ad 7, and Ad 12 transforming restriction endonuclease DNA fragments with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> 29 Ad types. Ad 5 HindIII-G (map position 0 - 7. 3), Ad 7 XhoI-C (map position 0 - 10. 8), and Ad 12 (strain Huie) EcoRI-C (map position 0 - 16) and SalI-C (map position 0 - 10. 6) fragments were purified, labeled in vitro (nick translation), and annealed with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> Ad 1 to Ad 16, Ad 18 to Ad 24, and Ad 26 to Ad 31. Hybrids were assayed by using hydroxylapatite. Ad 5 HindIII-G hybridized 98 to 100 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> group C Ads, but only 1 to 15 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> other types. Ad 7 XhoI-C fragment hybridized 85 to 99 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> group B Ads, but only 6 to 21 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> other types. Ad 12 (Huie) EcoRI-C hybridized 53 to 68 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> five other Ad 12 strains, 53 % with Ad 18 DNA, 56 % with Ad 31 DNA, but only 3 to 13 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> other types. In vitro-labeled Ad 12 (Huie) SalI-C hybridized 35 to 71 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> 6 other Ad 12 strains, 44 % with Ad 18 DNA, 52 % with Ad 31 DNA, but only 2 to 7 % with DNAs Ad 7, Ad 2, Ad 26, or Ad 4. When assayed using S- 1 nuclease, SalI-C annealed 17 to 44 % with <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> group A Ads. The melting temperatures of the hybrids of Ad 5 HindIII-G with all group C Ad DNAs were 84 °C in 0. 12 M sodium phosphate (pH 6. 8).

However, after re-cloning to the binary vector pCAMBIA 1305.1 this applied only to the <b>DNA</b> clone <b>of</b> GVA P 163 -M 5. For the <b>DNA</b> clone <b>of</b> this variant, among 65 colonies of E. coli tested by PCR, 17 were positive for the virus, and 5 had correct predicted EcoRI pattern for full <b>DNA</b> copy <b>of</b> the variant genome. On the contrary, for DNA clone GVB 953 - 1, testing of total 229 E. coli colonies, 28 were found virus-positive in PCR, and only 4 had the correct, predicted XbaI pattern <b>of</b> the full <b>DNA</b> copy <b>of</b> the variant. Purified plasmids containing full <b>DNA</b> copies <b>of</b> GVA P 163 -M 5 and GVB 953 - 1, respectively, under Ca 35 S promoter were combined and transformed to A. tumefaciens C 58.C 1.

To uncover {{the reason for the}} lack <b>of</b> infectivity <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> clones <b>of</b> GVB 953 - 1, the mixture <b>of</b> the full <b>DNA</b> copies <b>of</b> this virus under Ca 35 S promoter released from pGEM-T vector, used earlier in cloning to pCAMBIA 1305.1, stored in − 30  °C, was used to clone the virus to pCB.LB. 35 ST-NosT.RB. The same was done with a similar mixture <b>of</b> the full <b>DNA</b> copies <b>of</b> GVA P 163 -M 5. For each virus, among 10 randomly selected E. coli colonies which were PCR positive for virus sequences, 6 and 8 colonies contained full <b>DNA</b> copies <b>of</b> GVA P 163 -M 5 and GVB 953 - 1, respectively. Plasmids with full <b>DNA</b> copies <b>of</b> viruses under Ca 35 S promoter were mixed and transformed to A. tumefaciens C 58.C 1. Brief PCR testing of respectively 4 and 25 A. tumefaciens colonies, 2 and 5 were virus-positive.

These results suggest that the lack <b>of</b> infectivity <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> clones <b>of</b> GVB 953 - 1 variant in pCAMBIA 1305.1 observed earlier, was caused not by lethal mutations, which could be introduced to virus genome in RT-PCR or toxicity of the variant to E. coli, but was apparently caused by instability <b>of</b> the <b>DNA</b> copy <b>of</b> this variant under Ca 35 S promoter in this binary vector. The relatively easy cloning <b>of</b> infectious <b>DNA</b> copies <b>of</b> both GVA and GVB to pCB.LB. 35 ST-NosT.RB, suggest that this binary vector is superior to pCAMBIA 1305.1 in cloning of the full cDNA copies of members of the Vitivirus genus.|$|R
