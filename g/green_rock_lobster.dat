40|$|Length {{frequency}} distributions {{obtained from}} the FIMS of the west coast <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> constitute one of data inputs into the assessment {{as well as an}} estimate of the percentage of females. The length composition of the catch for each station and leg is obtained from measurements of a sub-sample of the catch, or sometimes the whole catch is measured. Nominal length frequencies (un-weighted frequencies pooled across stations) for males and females have been used previously as inputs to the assessment model of the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> resource. The same is the case for the percentage of females. If the sampling of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> for measurement represents a random sample from a station and the sample is representative of the size composition of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> then no weighting of the data is necessary. However if this is not the case, then the length frequencies should be weighted before pooling. This paper investigates length frequency distributions of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> by sex obtained in various ways. A method is suggested that should be used in constructing length frequency distributions to be used as an input to the assessment model. Annual estimates of the female percentage of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster,</b> weighted in a similar way to that of the length frequency distributions, are also given.

Of the 124 <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> caught, 20. 9 % were in a soft shell state. Female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> constituted 43. 5 % of the catch, but only one was carrying eggs.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} the potential impacts {{of climate change}} on the Tasmanian <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery, and identifies several options and opportunities for adaptation.

As water temperatures increase it is also expected that the range of a damaging sea urchin will be extended. The study found that the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery is reasonably well placed to adapt to the challenges of climate change but identified several possible measures that will assist with this adaptation including improved catch modelling, long-term monitoring, better risk assessment, and effective education and communication with the industry. Understanding the impacts of climate change on the Tasmanian <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> industry is important because this fishery is ideally placed to be an ‘early warning signal’ for Australian fisheries generally. ...|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies of}} rock-lobster diet have {{included}} analyses of mature females or juveniles of either sex. This {{study focused on}} the diet {{of male and female}} West Coast <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Jasus lalandii) in three size classes (viz. : 10 - 35 mm CL (carapace length) - small, 40 - 59 mm CL - medium and 70 - 85 mm CL - large), using visual analyses of stomach contents. The principle aims were to examine potential differences in diet between: (1) male and female rock lobsters; (2) changes in diet with size and (3) a comparison of rock-lobster diet between areas of known fast- and slow-growth rates. The primary prey items of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> are shown to be the black mussel (Choromytilus meridianalis), ribbed mussel (Aulacomya ater), barnacle (Notomegabalanus algicola), sea urchin (Parechinus angulosus), sponge and crustacean remains. There was no difference in diet between male and female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> within any size class. Bray-Curtis similarity dendograms and Multi-Dimensional scaling plots revealed differences between small, medium and large rock-lobster diets. Small <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> consumed mainly ribbed and black mussels, whereas medium <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> consumed higher percentages of barnacle and sponge. Sea urchins comprised a substantial percentage of large rock-lobster diet. ANOSIM (Primer v 4. 0) established significant differences (p < 0. 05) among diets of the three size classes. Differences in diet were also observed between areas of fast- and slow-growth rates, but these were limited to the small and medium size classes. Key prey items responsible for this difference in diet were black mussel and rock-lobster remains. The gut fullness index decreased with increasing rock-lobster size. In conclusion, {{there appears to be no}} difference in diet between male and female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> regardless of their size. However, rock-lobster diet does appear to vary with size. The inverse relationship between gut fullness indices and size, suggests that small <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> which have a higher moult frequency, feed relatively more frequently than larger <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Diet composition plays a role in determining the growth rate of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> from different areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of {{indicators of the}} indirect effects of fishing is often an issue for fisheries management, particularly if just commercial catch data are available. Complex, intermediate, and simplified qualitative models were produced for a fishery case study off Western Australia to identify potential indicators of ecosystem change attributable to western <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> (Panulirus cygnus) extraction and bait input. Models of intermediate complexity were used to identify indicators because they produced the least aggregation error. Structural uncertainty was considered {{through a series of}} structurally different intermediate models. These alternate models consistently predicted that extraction of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> may positively impact small fish of low economic value, such as old wife (Enoplosus armatus), footballer sweep (Neatypus obliquus), and king wrasse (Coris auricularis). These small fish were therefore identified as potential indicators of the effects of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> extraction. Small crustaceans (amphipods and isopods) also displayed positive impacts attributable to bait input from the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> fishery and were identified as potential indicators of bait effects.

40|$|The {{formation}} of sea urchin 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However {{there has been}} much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to sea urchin barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult sea urchins experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where sea urchin predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) sea urchins was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of sea urchins was exposed to three sizes of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> in a caging experiment, juvenile sea urchins were eaten more frequently than larger sea urchins by all sizes of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster,</b> but only the largest <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> (N 120 mm CL) were able to consume large adult sea urchins. Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult sea urchins in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult sea urchins experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of sea urchins to <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult sea urchins in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult sea urchins are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations...|$|R
