25|$|In 2015, the UK Government {{introduced}} a new law intended to penalise Google and other large multinational corporations' artificial tax avoidance. Google is accused of avoiding paying {{tens of billions of}} dollars of tax through a convoluted scheme of <b>inter-company</b> licensing <b>agreements</b> and transfers to tax havens. Schmidt was also criticised for his inaccurate use of the term 'capitalism' to describe billions of dollars being transferred into tax havens where no economic activity was actually taking place.|$|R
5000|$|Google {{has been}} accused {{by a number of}} {{countries}} of avoiding paying {{tens of billions of dollars}} of tax through a convoluted scheme of <b>inter-company</b> licensing <b>agreements</b> and transfers to tax havens. For example, Google has used highly contrived and artificial distinctions to avoid paying billions of pounds in corporate tax owed by its UK operations. On May 16, 2013, Margaret Hodge, the chair of the United Kingdom Public Accounts Committee, accused Google of being [...] "calculated and ... unethical" [...] over its use of the scheme. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has claimed that this scheme of Google is [...] "capitalism", and that he was [...] "very proud" [...] of it.|$|R
50|$|The Pembroke & Tenby Company {{obtained}} {{powers in}} 1866 {{to extend their}} standard-gauge line from Whitland to Carmarthen. This would have enabled the Pembroke & Tenby to link up with the standard-gauge network through the Llanelly Railway, the Vale of Towy Railway and the Central Wales line. Through a series of <b>inter-company</b> working <b>agreements,</b> this {{would have had the}} effect of giving the London & North Western Railway unrestricted access to west Wales. Within the Act for the extension to Carmarthen was a Schedule which allowed either party (the Pembroke & Tenby or the Great Western) to request the Great Western for running powers to the Pembroke company. In doing this the cost of adding a rail to mix the gauge and installing the necessary junctions at Whitland and Carmarthen was Â£20,000 to be paid to the Great Western within 18 months of the request. The request was made by the Pembroke company and consequently the Great Western converted the up line to standard gauge leaving the down line purely as broad. This was not what the Pembroke company was wanting but had to live with it. The Great Western maintained a crossing loop at St Clears for the broad gauge and this caused some hindrance to the Pembroke company. The conversion is noted as the first pure broad to standard gauge for the Great Western.|$|R
