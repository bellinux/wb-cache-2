25|$|Tartikoff {{felt there}} had been strong {{elements}} to Good Morning, Miss Bliss and wanted to try the show again with a different time slot and a different approach. The elements featuring the <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> been well-received, so Tartikoff wanted to drop Miss Bliss from the show altogether and focus entirely on the teens. NBC had been losing {{the high end of}} their animated audience, kids from ten to twelve, so the idea was to create a live action comedy to air on Saturday mornings, a new idea at the time.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, in 1996, member {{countries}} of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed {{to a number of}} exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many {{children under the age of}} 13 do work, even in the most developed {{countries of the}} EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> a job, the most common being babysitting.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E
500|$|Stead drew {{inspiration}} from many sources {{in order to create}} the novel. As a child growing up in a big city, she was interested in the small towns which made her think [...] "that in smaller places, everybody, even the <b>kids,</b> <b>had</b> special identities, where as in a city people are pretty anonymous". An idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town.|$|E

500|$|As Glee initial success {{pulled in}} a large audience, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the early shows [...] "felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> a kind of square naïveté." [...] Doyle notes that the early success took Glee away from its {{original}} characters and plot, focusing more on celebrity guests. [...] "The gaiety is gone from Glee. You should have set it in its prime, mere months ago". Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe similarly wrote that [...] "It has become a powerful, promotional machine, long on hype and short on the human feeling--the glee--that once made it so addictive".|$|E
500|$|Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald {{revealed}} that the film was from [...] "the John Hughes playbook of high-school comedies but lack the heart and insight Hughes invested in his pictures.", but still praised the teenage cast saying [...] "The performances in Bandslam are uniformly strong – {{good enough to make}} you wish this bunch of charismatic, talented <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> been given better material." [...] Time Out reviewer Derek Adams said that Bandslam is far from exceptional, but is saved by decent character development, a cluster of engaging performances and several amusing deadpan moments. Canada's The Globe and Mail reviewer's conclusion follows: [...] "Bandslam offers some nice observational and comedy moments, and director and co-writer Todd Graff deftly deliver the coming-of-age goods for the three main characters." [...] The Daily Telegraphs reviewer Leight Paastch says that the film gives the genre a right old spin thanks to some lively performances and sharp pacing.|$|E
500|$|... "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] {{initially}} {{earned a}} Nielsen rating of 1.3, translating to 980,000 viewers, {{which is considered}} high for a cable program in the United States. In April 2007, The New Zealand Herald called the first episode [...] "a huge success"; however, reviews {{at the time of}} the episode's broadcast were generally negative, most focusing on the low, obscene comedy. Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters, stating that [...] "If only the kids' jokes were as fresh as their mouths" [...] and [...] "It might help if the South Park <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> personalities, but they're as one-dimensional as the show's cut-and-paste animation". Tim Goodman of The San Francisco Examiner acknowledged that many viewers will find South Park [...] "vile, rude, sick, potentially dangerous, childish and mean-spirited". He argued that viewers [...] "have to come into 'South Park' with a bent for irony, sarcasm, anger and an understanding that cardboard cut-out animation of foul-mouthed third-graders is a tragically underused comic premise." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", {{the first}} episode of the series, {{received}} generally negative reviews after airing. Brent Bozell, founder and then-president of the Parents Television Council, gave an unfavorable review to the episode, stating that the show [...] "is so offensive that it shouldn't have been made. It doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters, lampooning that [...] "if only the kids' jokes were as fresh as their mouths" [...] and that [...] "it might help if the South Park <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> personalities, but they're as one-dimensional as the show's cut-and-paste animation." [...] Calling the series [...] "sophomoric, gross, and unfunny," [...] Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel reckoned that the episode made [...] "such a bad impression that it's hard {{to get on the}} show's strange wavelength." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post considered that [...] "most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self-conscious and self-congratulatory in its vulgarity: flatulence jokes, repeated use of the word 'dildo' (in the literal as well as pejorative sense), and a general air of malicious unpleasantness." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up <b>Kids</b> <b>had</b> previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident {{that we were going to}} kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the teenaged rock bands, such as Second Sex and the Plastiscines, {{that emerged}} in France c. 2006 and were known collectively as les bébés rockers ("baby rockers"), were {{initially}} derided in some sections of the press because of their bobo backgrounds: as Kate Spicer observed in the Sunday Times, [...] "it's as if a bunch of privileged Islington <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> picked up their guitars and proclaimed themselves the new Sex Pistols". By 2010 bobos – [...] "free-thinkers at the weekend, but bankers Monday to Friday" [...] – {{were said to be}} squeezing out young, genuinely creative Parisians from their traditional neighborhoods, with Porte de Bagnolet, in the 20th arrondissement, cited as an alternative base for [...] "the next generation of diverse Parisian voices".|$|E
2500|$|The Phillies, as {{the last}} team in the National League to integrate, {{exhibited}} racist behavior on several occasions. When Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line in 1947, Chapman instructed his players to spike Robinson and pitch at his head. These activities and attitudes continued through the Whiz Kids era and beyond. Carpenter tended to pass by African-American players; his Whiz <b>Kids</b> <b>had</b> won the pennant while fielding an all-white team, and he, as other owners, tended to pass over any non-white players {{who did not have}} superstar-level talent. The Phillies did not integrate until 1957, a decade after Robinson's entry, and did not have their first true African-American star until the arrival of John Kennedy. [...] When Kennedy made his major league debut (April 22, 1957 at Roosevelt Stadium), he became the first black player in Philadelphia Phillies history.|$|E

2500|$|A {{day after}} the Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999, Stern's comments regarding the incident drew criticism from some listeners. [...] "There were some really good looking girls running out with their hands over their heads...Did [...] try {{to have sex with}} any of the good looking girls?...At least {{if you are going to}} kill yourself and kill all the kids, why wouldn't you have some sex?...If I was going to kill some people, I'd take them out with sex." [...] Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show's affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. [...] "I dared to ask if <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> sex. So what? That's how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn't know anything about motives [...] and were trying to consider all possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent label Vagrant Records signed several {{successful}} late-1990s and early-2000s emo bands. The Get Up <b>Kids</b> <b>had</b> {{sold over}} 15,000 copies of their debut album, Four Minute Mile (1997), before signing with Vagrant. The label promoted them aggressively, sending them on tours opening for Green Day and Weezer. Their 1999 album, Something to Write Home About, reaching number 31 on Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Vagrant signed and recorded {{a number of}} other emo-related bands over the next two years, including The Anniversary, Reggie and the Full Effect, The New Amsterdams, Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional, Hey Mercedes and Hot Rod Circuit. Saves the Day had developed a substantial East Coast following and sold almost 50,000 copies of their second album, Through Being Cool (1999), before signing with Vagrant and releasing Stay What You Are (2001). The latter sold 15,000 copies in its first week, reached number 100 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 200,000 copies. Blink-182, not otherwise known as an emo band, recorded [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in 1999. The song, from Blink-182's multi-platinum album Enema of the State, was number two on the Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people were}} sceptical about mass citizen {{training}} in CPR; indeed, many felt {{the potential for}} harm was too great to allow such a procedure {{in the hands of}} laypersons. The skeptics also had the support of national medical organizations. The alarmist voices were stilled by some fortunate saves. Cobb recalled one resuscitation soon after the citizen training program began. [...] "In March 1973 there were these kids playing golf at Jackson Park. They came across a victim {{a quarter of a mile}} from the clubhouse." [...] The man was unconscious and not breathing; later it was confirmed that he was in ventricular fibrillation. [...] "But these <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> taken the [...] course over at the local high school. Two or three of them started doing CPR and the other kid ran off and phoned the fire department. Shortly they came with the aid car and Medic 1 screaming over the fairways." [...] Cobb concluded, [...] "They got him started up again.
