5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath that he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced {{to turn back the}} same way they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> only four men surviving.|$|E
5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 February, 'C' Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion, {{under the command of}} Major John Frost, parachuted into France {{a few miles from the}} installation. The force then {{proceeded}} to assault the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief fire-fight. A technician that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> the force partially dismantled the Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces to take back to Britain, the raiding force then retreated to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had failed to do so, however, and another brief fire-fight was required to eliminate the Germans guarding the beach. The raiding force was then picked up by a small number of landing craft and transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which brought them back to Britain. The raid was entirely successful. The airborne troops suffered only a few casualties, and the pieces of the radar they brought back, along with a German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand German advances in radar and to create counter-measures to neutralise those advances.|$|E

25|$|With Kei {{car sales}} {{shrinking}} overall and the Cervo losing market share, sales were dropping precipitously. In February 1987 the second-generation Cervo received its {{third and final}} update. The Turbo was discontinued and the lineup rationalized to two versions, the sporty CS-G with a 5-speed manual and the lower grade CS-D with either a 4-speed manual or the 2-speed automatic. As further rationalization, all models now had roll-type safety belts (hitherto, CS and CS-D versions <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> fixed belts), front disc brakes and air conditioning.|$|E
25|$|Scaroni {{attended}} the Schneider Trophy air races in November, 1926 {{as part of}} his duties as Italy's Air Attache to the United States. The race was held just outside Washington, D.C., in the Chesapeake Bay. Italy had a racing team entered; they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> such expectation of victory that they had smuggled celebratory Chianti in their seaplane floats in violation of America's Prohibition. When they had engine problems, Scaroni suggested switching American spark plugs and gasoline into the Italian planes. That solved their engine woes.|$|E
25|$|Catiline {{was born}} in 108 BC {{to one of the}} oldest patrician {{families}} in Rome, gens Sergia. Although his family was of consular heritage, they were then declining in both social and financial fortunes. Virgil later gave the family an ancestor, Sergestus, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> Aeneas to Italy, presumably because they were notably ancient; but they had not been prominent for centuries. The last Sergius to be consul had been Gnaeus Sergius Fidenas Coxo in 380 BC. Later, these factors would dramatically shape Catiline's ambitions and goals as he would desire above all else to restore the political heritage of his family along with its financial power.|$|E

25|$|The growing MiG {{threat against}} Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber attacks along the Yalu River caused the Fifth Air Force {{to create a}} second Sabre wing by {{converting}} the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing from F-80s to F-86s in a 10-day period. Gabreski was transferred to K-13 (Suwon) Air Base, accompanied {{by most of the}} former 56th FIW pilots who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> him to Korea, and took command November 6, 1951. During its first seven months as an F-86 wing, the 51st, with only two operational squadrons, scored 96 MiG kills, comparing favorably to the 125 of the veteran 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which operated three. Gabreski himself scored 3½ more kills to become a jet ace.|$|E
25|$|No heavy {{fighting}} occurred in 25–28 April, but on 28 April the Reds launched another {{attack against the}} German lines. The fighting lasted for two days but despite their overwhelming strength, the Reds could not beat the experienced and well-armed German troops. The Germans had only about 800 men in Lahti as the Reds had up to 10,000 armed men from Western Finland and Helsinki region who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> the refugee column. The problem for Reds {{was that there was}} no order of battle and nobody commanded the force. There were only a couple of organized units, like the Turku Women's Guard and the squad composed of the youth section of the sports club Jyry Helsinki.|$|E
25|$|In July the statholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, {{seized the}} moment and marched into {{northern}} Barbant in command of an army of 18,000 soldiers determined to besiege Breda. On 21 July 1637 some Dutch cavalry under Henry Casimir I of Nassau-Dietz attempted to surprise the garrison of Breda, but the gates were closed in time and the Dutch skirmishers driven back. From 23 July the Dutch captured a number of villages around the city and then started to dig a double line of circumvallation that would eventually reach a circumference of 34km. An outer contravallation defended the besiegers from outside interference, and outside this area the low-lying countryside was inundated by damming a few rivers. The Cardinal-Infante, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> his army to Breda, found no way to relieve the city and decided to open an offensive against the Dutch in the Maas valley.|$|E

25|$|Thursday May 9, 1968, strike leaders, {{including}} sanitation {{crew chief}} Joe Savage, encouraged sanitation workers {{to return to}} work. That morning, over 100 sanitation workers reported to the sanitation department. 35 workers <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> the anticipation to work, while others showed up to protest. Police Sergeant Ray Stewart had also come to the sanitation compound along with other officers equipped with riot gear. At approximately 7:10a.m., the first of five garbage trucks attempted to leave the compound under police escort, but was met with a human blockade of protesters barricading the exit. At the advice of attorney James Sanderlin and crew chief Joe Savage, the protesters allowed three trucks to exit. A fourth and fifth truck were eventually able to leave without further incident at 7:28a.m. The five garbage trucks collected garbage from businesses, schools, and hospitals while most residential trash continued to go uncollected.|$|E
25|$|Despite strong {{sales of}} the M20, Mooney was short of cash. The {{development}} of the M22 Mustang had cost more than expected, and was ultimately unsuccessful. The collaboration with Mitsubishi <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> substantial financial assistance but proved {{too much for the}} company to handle. It went into chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 1969; American Electronics Laboratories quickly acquired Mooney in March of that year and invested US$600,000 to keep it operating. Sales that year were {{less than half of the}} previous year's figures, although a new model, the M20E Chapparal, was released with electrically-operated flaps and landing gear. AEL was unable to turn the company around and sold Mooney to Butler Aviation International in December 1969. AEL owned Mooney for just over 9 months and lost nearly a million dollars during that time. Butler Aviation also acquired the troubled Aerostar company and combined it with Mooney in an attempt to save both. The Mooney name was dropped in 1970, as was the M20 designation; the planes were called Aerostars.|$|E
500|$|Cuthbert was an Anglo-Saxon, {{perhaps of}} a noble family, {{born in the}} Kingdom of Northumbria in the mid-630s, some {{ten years after the}} {{conversion}} of King Edwin to Christianity in 627, which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people. [...] The politics of the kingdom were violent, and there were later episodes of pagan rule, while spreading understanding of Christianity through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert's lifetime. [...] Edwin had been baptised by Paulinus of York, an Italian who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> the Gregorian mission from Rome, but his successor Oswald also invited Irish monks from Iona to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life. [...] This was around 635, about the time Cuthbert was born.|$|E

500|$|However, Montagu did not {{profit from}} the new regime as he {{probably}} expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> his Marquessate to the newly returned Earl of Devon. Montagu had no active role in government, and {{does not seem to}} have sat in Council, although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King's Household. Although he was confirmed in command of the new King's forces in the north and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471, he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspect by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward. [...] Montagu even had to pay cash for the king's pardon, which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear.|$|E

[...] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no. Reed told Brown that {{there was no one in}} the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.", but it was again declined. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, [...] "Those who have committed no fault want no pardon." [...] Patterson departed soon after. Washington's performance during the meeting was praised in parts of the colonies.|$|E
