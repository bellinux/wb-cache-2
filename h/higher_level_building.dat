Although such structures have been replicated, designed, and fabricated, {{they are often}} inferior to naturally occurring analogues. Apart from the complexity and multiple functionalities developed by the biological systems, the controllable and scalable production of hierarchically porous structures and building blocks remains a technological challenge. Herein, a facile and scalable approach is developed to fabricate hierarchical hollow spheres with integrated micro-, meso-, and macropores ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm (spanning five orders of magnitude). (Macro) molecules, micro-rods (which {{play a key role}} for the creation of robust capsules), and emulsion droplets have been successfully employed as multiple length scale templates, allowing the creation of hierarchical porous macrospheres. Thanks to their specific mechanical strength, these hierarchical porous spheres could be incorporated and assembled as <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>building</b> blocks in various novel materials. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Proteins {{are highly}} {{flexible}} and large amplitude deformations of their structure, also called slow dynamics, are often decisive to their function. We present a two-level rendering approach that enables visualization of slow dynamics of large protein assemblies. Our approach is aligned with a hierarchical model of large scale molecules. Instead of constantly updating positions of {{large amounts of}} atoms, we update the position and rotation of residues, i. e., <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>building</b> blocks of a protein. Residues are represented by one vertex only indicating its position and additional information defining the rotation. The atoms in the residues are generated on-the-fly on the GPU, exploiting the new graphics hardware geometry shader capabilities. Moreover, we represent the atoms by billboards instead of tessellated spheres. Our representation is then significantly faster and pixel precise. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new approach {{in the context of}} our collaborative bioinformatics project. Index Terms—Molecular visualization, hardware acceleration, protein dynamics. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the ever {{increasing}} complexity of todays application specific integrated circuits, a building block based design methodology is established. The system is composed of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>building</b> blocks of which some are reused from previous designs while others might have been created by behavioral synthesis. In data flow oriented designs, these blocks usually have complex non-matching interface properties, making it necessary to generate ad-ditional interfacing and controlling hardware to integrate them into an operable system. In this paper, an RTL-HDL code generation from a syn-chronous data flow representations is introduced, that effi-ciently automates the generation of the required additional hardware. While existing code generation approaches pro-vide strong limitations concerning the building block in-terfacing properties, our method enables the integration of components that access their ports periodically with arbi-trary patterns. In order to reduce interface register cost, a minimum-area retiming approach is taken to determine optimum building block activation times, which is known to have polynomial time complexity. The code generation methodology is compared to an existing approach using a simple case study. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} building dynamics {{is a major}} task and still an open issue for many researchers. In this work, {{the goal is to}} achieve energy e ciency improvement through application of soft computing techniques on real case applications. The pattern followed is based on Smart Cities paradigm, aiming to actively involve citizens increasing cities energy e ciency, their well-being and self-knowledge. Developing methodologies applied to real world problems is challenging, since in many cases the knowledge of the dynamics is incomplete, uncertainty is high and signals are noisy. Soft Computing techniques are well suited for coping those problems: as they are based on human mind pattern, they provide good generalisation, iterative learning and self adaptation.

40|$|The {{building}} industry is urged {{to improve its}} production processes on different aspects. Building is to become: less expensive, more qualitative, less damaging {{to the environment and}} less exhaustive for construction workers. The use of robot technology is one of the possibilities {{that can be used to}} improve production on these aspects. However the current commercial robots have short comings that make them difficult or impossible to use in today's construction processes. One of the problems is the programming of robots. Because of the lack of repetition in construction processes, robot programs are often single use programs that have to be rewritten for each robot task. The costs of robot programming using today's programming methods are too high. This paper describes how an approach called task instruction can be used for construction robots. Task instructions are <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>building</b> instruction such as 'build garage' or 'spray ceiling coating'. The hypothesis is that robot operation plans can be generated from generic task knowledge together with project specific design and engineering information.
