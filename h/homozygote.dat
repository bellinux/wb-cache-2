5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (<b>homozygote)</b> causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation. Over 1000 different mutations are known.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and <b>homozygote,</b> and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

Here, {{we set out to}} investigate whether this LPL variant is also associated with enhanced apoB 48 clearance. Therefore, we evaluated apoB 48 kinetics in X 447 <b>homozygotes</b> in the fed state by infusion of isotope L-[1 -(13) C]-valine and subsequent compartmental modeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoB 48 metabolism was assessed in five X 447 <b>homozygotes</b> (X/X genotype) and five S 447 <b>homozygotes</b> (S/S genotype). Subjects were continuously fed and received infusion of stable isotope L-[1 -(13) C]-valine. Results were analyzed by SAAM II modeling. Fasting (2. 4 -fold, p= 0. 02) as well as non-fasting (1. 6 -fold, p= 0. 09) apoB 48 concentration was increased in the X 447 <b>homozygotes</b> compared to S 447 <b>homozygotes.</b> In addition, the X 447 <b>homozygotes</b> exhibited a 1. 7 -fold higher apoB 48 poolsize (p= 0. 04). Interestingly, apoB 48 fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was 1. 9 -fold higher (p= 0. 007) and apoB 48 synthesis was more than two-fold higher (p= 0. 006) in the X 447 <b>homozygotes</b> compared to S 447 <b>homozygotes.</b> CONCLUSION: In the present study, we show that X 447 <b>homozygotes</b> exhibit enhanced apoB 48 clearance.

40|$|Abstract Background Interpreting the erythroid lineage in populations {{with high}} {{frequency}} of α + thalassemia allele is challenging {{due to the}} high prevalence of α + thalassemia <b>homozygotes.</b> For such populations, separate reference values for normal and α + thalassemia <b>homozygotes</b> are needed. Methods We studied the erythroid lineage in 1, 079 citizens of United Arab Emirates (UAE). Subjects with abnormal hemoglobin (39), iron deficiency (136) or erroneous entries (8) were excluded. MCV distribution in the remaining individuals (896) was visibly bimodal. Statistical mixture analysis with Normix program was used to separate subpopulations with normal and small red cells. Hardy-Weinberg equation was used to estimate genotype frequencies. Results MCV of 78. 0 fl separated phenotype-derived normal <b>homozygotes</b> (715) from phenotype-derived α + thalassemia <b>homozygotes</b> (181). The erythrocyte indices were significantly different {{between the two groups}} (p + thalassemia <b>homozygotes</b> (-α/-α) was 0. 20 and markedly varied among tribes, 0 to 0. 31 (Mean = 0. 15). The frequency of phenotype-derived α + thalassemia allele was 0. 44; when accounting for tribal population structure and inbreeding, the calculated frequency was 0. 34. These values were very similar to those found in the same population by genotyping and other phenotyping methods. The erythrocyte reference values for phenotype-derived normal <b>homozygotes</b> in Emiratis closely overlapped with those for Caucasians and normal <b>homozygotes</b> defined by genotyping. The reference values for phenotype-derived α + thalassemia <b>homozygotes</b> in Emiratis also closely overlapped with those for α + thalassemia <b>homozygotes</b> defined by genotyping.

25|$|The moth {{is known}} to be {{polymorphic}} in its colony at Cothill, about five miles (8km) from Oxford, with three forms: the typical homozygote; the rare <b>homozygote</b> (bimacula) and the heterozygote (medionigra). It was studied there by Ford and later by Sheppard and their co-workers over many years. Data is available from 1939 to the present day, got by the usual field method of capture-mark-release-recapture and by genetic analysis from breeding in captivity. The records cover gene frequency and population-size for much of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|A key fact, not {{realised}} initially, is {{the advantage}} of the heterozygotes, which survive better than either of the homozygotes. This affects the caterpillars as well as the moths, in spite of the caterpillars being monomorphic in appearance (they are twig mimics). In practice heterozygote advantage puts a limit to the effect of selection, since neither <b>homozygote</b> can reach 100% of the population. For this reason, {{it is likely that the}} carbonaria allele was in the population originally, pre-industrialisation, at a low level. With the recent reduction in pollution, the balance between the forms has already shifted back significantly.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a balance}} is seen more simply in sickle-cell anaemia, which is found mostly in {{tropical}} populations in Africa and India. An individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin, HgbS, has a short expectancy of life, whereas {{the life expectancy}} of the standard hemoglobin (HgbA) <b>homozygote</b> and also the heterozygote is normal (though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems). The sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills {{a huge number of}} people each year. This is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism, balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. The heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) so long as malaria exists; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time. Because the heterozygote survives, so does the HgbS allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate (see and refs in Sickle-cell disease).|$|E

However, when <b>homozygotes</b> were compared with heterozygotes from larger birthplaces, <b>homozygotes</b> showed significantly smaller family distances in the grandparental generation.

50|$|Male {{and female}} animals {{underwent}} a standardized phenotypic screen {{to determine the}} effects of deletion. Twenty five tests were carried out on mutant mice and six significant abnormalities were observed. Female <b>homozygotes</b> had a decreased respiratory quotient, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase level and increased leukocyte cell number. Male <b>homozygotes</b> showed an increased susceptibility to Salmonella infection, while <b>homozygotes</b> of both sex had decreased IgG1 and decreased regulatory T cell and NK cell numbers.|$|R
30|$|The two {{tails of}} the RILs were scored {{according}} to the parental banding pattern as IR 64 <b>homozygotes</b> (1), Apo <b>homozygotes</b> (2) or heterozygotes (3). When no banding pattern or non-parental bands were observed, they were treated as missing values (0).|$|R
25|$|Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{was also}} {{put into practice}} during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a polyacrylamide gel using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by silver staining the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a <b>homozygote)</b> or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together {{at the top of}} the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{reasonable}} assumption that until modern treatment was available {{three quarters of the}} SS homozygotes failed to reproduce. To balance this loss of sickle-cell genes, a mutation rate of 1:10.2 per gene per generation would be necessary. This is about 1000 times greater than mutation rates measured in Drosophila and other organisms and much higher than recorded for the sickle-cell locus in Africans. To balance the polymorphism, Anthony Allison estimated that the fitness of the AS heterozygote would have to be 1.26 times than that of the normal <b>homozygote.</b> Later analyses of survival figures have given similar results, with some differences from site to site. In Gambians, it was estimated that AS heterozygotes have 90% protection against P. falciparum-associated severe anemia and cerebral malaria, whereas in the Luo population of Kenya it was estimated that AS heterozygotes have 60% protection against severe malarial anemia. These differences reflect the intensity of transmission of P. falciparum malaria from locality to locality and season to season, so fitness calculations will also vary. In many African populations the AS frequency is about 20%, and a fitness superiority over those with normal hemoglobin of the order of 10% is sufficient to produce a stable polymorphism.|$|E

Patients with colorectal adenoma (n = 149) and controls (n = 286) with folate intake in the upper or lower tertile with the CC or TT genotype were selected from a case-control study. Methylation-specific PCRs were conducted on colorectal adenoma specimens. The percentages of promoter methylation ranged from 15. 7 % to 64. 2 %. In case-case comparisons, folate was inversely associated with promoter methylation, especially among TT <b>homozygotes.</b> Case-control comparisons suggested that folate was not associated with the occurrence of adenomas with promoter methylation, and increased the risk of unmethylated adenomas, especially in TT <b>homozygotes.</b> The interactions between folate and MTHFR genotype were most pronounced for O- 6 -MGMT: compared with CC <b>homozygotes</b> with low folate intake, the adjusted odds ratios (95 % confidence interval) of having a methylated O- 6 -MGMT promoter were 3. 39 (0. 82 - 13. 93) for TT <b>homozygotes</b> with low folate intake and 0. 37 (0. 11 - 1. 29) for TT <b>homozygotes</b> with high folate intake (P interaction = 0. 02); the odds ratios for the occurrence of adenomas without methylation were 0. 57 (0. 16 - 2. 11) for TT <b>homozygotes</b> with low folate intake and 3. 37 (1. 17 - 9. 68) for TT <b>homozygotes</b> with high folate intake (P interaction = 0. 03).

Some alleles, such as sash produce white spotting alone, while others affect the health of the animal even in the heterozygous state.

2500|$|Humans metabolize ethanol {{primarily}} through NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) to acetaldehyde and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) to acetic acid. [...] Eastern Asians reportedly have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching 50%) of their populations. [...] The {{issue has been}} most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese where persons with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant allele of the ALDH2 gene were found; the variant allele, encodes lysine (lys) instead of glutamic acid (glu) at amino acid 487; this renders the enzyme essentially inactive in metabolizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. The variant allele is variously termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2, and ALDH2*504lys. In the overall Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are heterozygous for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys. Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive (i.e. the variant allele behaves as a dominant negative), <b>homozygote</b> individuals for glu487lys have undetectable while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity.

Methods: We compared mean ln SF in 171 <b>homozygotes</b> (60 men, 111 women) who reported taking and not taking PPIs and H 2 RAs.

Results: Eleven <b>homozygotes</b> (6. 4 %) took PPIs; twelve (6. 7 %) took H 2 RAs. Mean ln SF values of male and female <b>homozygotes</b> who took PPIs were ~one-half those of <b>homozygotes</b> without PPI reports, but the differences were not significant.

Methods We screened 41 038 individuals attending a health appraisal clinic in the USA for the 845 G→A and 187 C→G HFE mutations, and analysed laboratory data and data on signs and symptoms of haemochromatosis as elicited by questionnaire. Findings The most common symptoms of haemo-chromatosis, including poor general health, diabetes, arthropathies, arrhythmias, impotence, and skin pigmentation were no more prevalent among the 152 identified <b>homozygotes</b> than among the controls. The age distribution of <b>homozygotes</b> and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls: there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during ageing. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or “liver trouble ” among <b>homozygotes</b> and in the proportion of <b>homozygotes</b> with increased concentrations of serum aspartate amino-transferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only one of the 152 <b>homozygotes</b> had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of haemochromatosis. Interpretation The normal age distribution of people with the haemochromatosis genotype, and the lack of symptoms in patients of all ages, indicate that the penetrance of hereditary haemochromatosis is much lower than generally thought. The clinical penetrance of a disorder is an essential consideration in screening for genetic disease; disorders with low penetrance are more expensive candidates for screening than disorders with high penetrance. Our best estimate is that less than 1 % of <b>homozygotes</b> develop frank clinical haemochromatosis. Lancet 2002; 359 : 211 – 1...|$|R
