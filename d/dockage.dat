2500|$|Initial landing {{operations}} {{were carried out}} under cover of night and construction of the [...] of road between the port and Dobodura Airfield was begun by Australian units later augmented by U.S. Army units and equipment with completion within months.

2500|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of New York City, and New Amsterdam before it, the East River has been the {{receptacle}} for the city's garbage and sewage. [...] "Night men" [...] who collected [...] "night soil" [...] from outdoor privies would dump their loads into the river, and even after the construction of the Croton Aqueduct (1842) and then the New Croton Aqueduct (1890) gave rise to indoor plumbing, the waste that was flushed away into the sewers, where it mixed with ground run off, ran directly into the river, untreated. [...] The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing <b>dockage,</b> after which the outfalls were moved {{to the end of the}} piers. [...] The [...] "landfill" [...] which created new land along the shoreline when the river was [...] "wharfed out" [...] by the sale of [...] "water lots" [...] was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrement [...] human and animal. [...] The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of eutrophication where the increase in nitrogen from excrement and other sources lead to a decrease in free oxygen, which in turn lead to an increase in phytoplankton such as algae and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area's established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.|$|E
