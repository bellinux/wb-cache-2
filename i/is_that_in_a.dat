2500|$|The {{conceptual}} {{difference between}} uniform and topological structures <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> uniform space, one can formalize certain notions of relative closeness and closeness of points.

2500|$|Botox (botulinum toxin) {{is a new}} and {{versatile}} tool {{for the treatment of}} synkinesis. Initially used for reducing hyperkinesis after facial palsy, Botox was later attempted on patients with post-facial palsy synkinesis to reduce unwanted movements. The effects of Botox have shown to be remarkable, with synkinetic symptoms disappearing within 2 or 3 days. The most common treatment targets are the orbicularis oculi, depressor anguli oris (DAO), mentalis, platysma and the contralateral depressor labii inferioris muscles. Due to the short span of Botox effects though, patients must come back to the doctor for re-injection approximately every 3 months. More notable <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> majority of patients, various synkinetic movements completely disappeared after 2-3 sessions of trimonthly Botox injections.|$|E
2500|$|A republic, Madison writes, is {{different}} from a democracy because its government {{is placed in the}} hands of delegates, and, as a result of this, it can be extended over a larger area. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large republic, there will be more [...] "fit characters" [...] to choose from for each delegate. Also, the fact that each representative is chosen from a larger constituency should make the [...] "vicious arts" [...] of electioneering [...] (a reference to rhetoric) less effective. For instance, in a large republic, a corrupt delegate would need to bribe many more people in order to win an election than in a small republic. Also, in a republic, the delegates both filter and refine the many demands of the people so as to prevent the type of frivolous claims that impede purely democratic governments.|$|E
2500|$|Yang {{states that}} people's democracy, unlike {{parliamentary}} democracy, realises {{the principle of}} [...] "popular sovereignty". The basis for the argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary democracy, {{a system in which}} ordinary people can vote for different parties, the parties available are in the pockets of the bourgeoisie. Parties can only win, Yang claims, if they have enough money—when parties have money, they get it from the bourgeoisie. This relationship turns the political parties contesting the election to subservient tools of the bourgeoisie, and makes them govern in their interest. While a system with multi-party elections, rotational government and parliaments looks more democratic, it is in fact beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not the people. In contrast, the people's democratic system with People's Congresses realises popular sovereignty through a mixture electoral and consultative democracy. Unlike in parliamentary democracies Yang adds, people standing for elections for seats in people's congresses are financed state, thus giving every candidate an equal chance of getting elected. Yang claims that;All political parties [...] bear the trust of the people, all implement their duties according to the law and under the leadership of the Communist Party, and serve the people.|$|E

2500|$|In the Middle-earth storyverse, Hobbits are [...] tall, Dwarves are taller {{at about}} , and Men and Elves are average human height, about [...] However, the films used two scale sets instead of three by casting taller than average actors to play Dwarves, then {{combining}} Dwarves and Hobbits into one size scale. For example, John Rhys-Davies, who played Gimli, is taller than Elijah Wood, who played Frodo. Thus in the ending {{shot of the}} Council of Elrond scene when all nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring are standing together, Rhys-Davies and the four Hobbit actors were filmed all at once, then the human-sized characters (Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas) were filmed in a second take, then the two shots were composited at different scale to make one image, with the initial Dwarf/Hobbit character shot made smaller. A practical upshot of not creating a third scale for Dwarves <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene in which only Dwarves and Hobbits interact, no scale doubles are needed. For example, when they are entering Lothlórien {{for the first time}} and Gimli claps Frodo on the shoulder and says [...] "stay close, young hobbits", the entire scene employs no size doubles, because Rhys-Davies is naturally the proportionately taller height needed between Dwarves and Hobbits.|$|E
2500|$|Karo {{initially}} {{intended to}} rely on his own judgment relating to differences of opinion between the various authorities, especially where he could support his own view based on the Talmud. But he abandoned this idea because, as he wrote: [...] "Who has the courage to rear his head aloft among mountains, the heights of God?" [...] and also because he may have thought, though he does not mention his conclusion, that he could gain no following if he set up his authority against that of the ancient scholars. Hence Karo adopted the Halakhot of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi (the Rif), Maimonides, and Asher ben Jehiel (the Rosh) as his standards, accepting as authoritative the opinion {{of two of the}} three, except in cases where most of the ancient authorities were against them or in cases where there was already an accepted custom contrary to his ruling. The net result of these last exceptions <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of cases Karo rules in favour of the Catalan school of Nahmanides and ben Adret, thus indirectly reflecting Ashkenazi opinions, even against the consensus of Alfasi and Maimonides. Karo very often decides disputed cases without necessarily considering the age and importance of the authority in question, expressing simply his own views. He follows Maimonides' example, as seen in Mishneh Torah (the Yad Hachazakah), rather than that of Jacob ben Asher, who seldom decides between ancient authorities.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} purgatory, Protestant religious philosopher Jerry L. Walls wrote Purgatory: The Logic of Total Transformation (2011). The book evoked reviews and news stories. It received a positive review in the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews.Historically informed, philosophically competent, and theologically alert, [...] [...] [...] as careful and fair a discussion of the doctrine of purgatory as one is likely to find. The Christian Century suggested that, if Protestants followed Walls’ logic, they might accept his view of an intermediate state without calling it purgatory. Within early Christianity, he finds [...] "biblical hints of Purgatory" [...] and examines them. In a survey of Christian writers whom he calls the [...] "Fathers and Mothers of Purgatory," [...] Walls finds the beginnings of the doctrine of purgatory in their writings. These three sources led up to the [...] "birth of Purgatory" [...] in the 12th century. The 13th century saw the beginnings of Purgatory’s adoption and its adoption as doctrine in 1274. Walls does not base his belief in Purgatory primarily on Scripture, the Mothers and Fathers of the Church, or the Magisterium (doctrinal authority) of the Roman Catholic church. Rather his basic argument <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> phrase he often uses, it [...] "makes sense." [...] For Walls, Purgatory has a logic as in the title of his book. Walls documents the [...] "contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models" [...] of Purgatory. In the satisfaction model, [...] "the punishment of purgatory" [...] is to satisfy God’s justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes that [...] "Purgatory might be pictured [...] [...] [...] as a regimen to regain one’s spiritual health and get back into moral shape." [...] In Roman Catholic theology, Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has [...] "swung" [...] between the [...] "poles of satisfaction and sanctification" [...] sometimes [...] "combining both elements somewhere in the middle." [...] He believes the sanctification model [...] "can be affirmed by Protestants without contradicting their theology" [...] and find that it [...] "makes better sense" [...] than an instantaneous purging of sin at the moment of death.|$|E
