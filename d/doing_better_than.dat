25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} {{that come from}} being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and do better than their predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom is a {{developed}} country with social welfare infrastructure, thus discussions surrounding poverty {{tend to be}} of relative poverty rather than absolute poverty. According to the OECD, the UK is in {{the lower half of}} {{developed country}} rankings for poverty rates, <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Italy and the US but less well than France, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Nordic countries. Eurostat figures show that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty has fallen to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social transfers were taken into account).|$|E
25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers {{to individuals who}} are <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, {{it is not a}} trait or something that some children simply possess. There {{is no such thing as}} an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience is the product of a large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other children do not).|$|E

The journalist and author Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". David Seed, in his examination of spy fiction, disagrees, and writes that while Bond beats Le Chiffre, his [...] "activities are constantly supported by American agencies, financing and know-how".|$|E
500|$|On July 1, Emery {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent as his injury deemed him unable to play until he recuperates.

In November 2010, TSN visited Emery during an on-ice workout and were surprised to see him get down into the butterfly position and play {{for the first time since}} surgery. Emery stated that he did not [...] "care if [...] walk in seven years," [...] and he [...] "just [...] to play." [...] To the surprise of his doctors and trainers, Emery has been <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> expected. In January 2011, Emery began skating with an OHL team, taking shots and training with Eric Lindros, working with personal trainer Matt Nichol and goalie coach Eli Wilson.

500|$|The Bond novels also {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West. In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating [...] "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action". Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". Although Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, he did not focus on it strongly. Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> he".|$|E
500|$|Leiter is Bond's saviour in Casino Royale, {{providing}} {{him with}} 32 million francs when Bond has been cleaned out by SMERSH paymaster Le Chiffre, calling it [...] "Marshall Aid". Media historian James Chapman notes that Bond's relationship with Leiter represented the Special Relationship between Britain and America, although the American Leiter {{is in the}} subordinate position to the British Bond. Academic Jeremy Black agrees, although {{points out that the}} Bond and Leiter relationship suggested [...] "a far smoother working of the Anglo-American alliance than was in fact the case." [...] Academic and writer Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, considered that this view of Leiter was partly because of Fleming's writing, noting that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> he". Bond scholars Bennett and Woollacott note that although the two men share adventures, it is Bond who leads, not Leiter. Leiter's role is to [...] "suppl Bond with technical support and hardware, add... muscle where needed and money".|$|E

[...] The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: [...] "For players of games where character development and campaign continuity are a priority, Paranoia is an absolute no-no. If a character (of which there are six versions - each person in Alpha Complex has six clones) lives through an entire scenario then they're doing well. Hell, they're <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> well, they're probably Jesus Christ reborn (er, no offence intended, all ye Christian types). Suffice to say that Paranoia is, and always will be, a complete laugh - it should be played for nothing more than fun".|$|E

2500|$|Cocteau {{acknowledged}} {{in the introduction}} to the script that the play was motivated, in part, by complaints from his actresses that his works were too writer/director-dominated and gave the players little opportunity to show off their full range of talents. La Voix humaine was written, in effect, as an extravagant aria for Madame Berthe Bovy. Before came Orphée, later turned into one of his more successful films; after came La Machine infernale, arguably his most fully realized work of art. [...] La Voix humaine is deceptively simple — a woman alone on stage for almost one hour of non-stop theatre speaking on the telephone with her departing lover. It is full of theatrical codes harking back to the Dadaists' Vox Humana experiments after World War One, Alphonse de Lamartine's [...] "La Voix humaine", part of his larger work Harmonies poétiques et religieuses and the effect of the creation of the Vox Humana ("voix humaine"), an organ stop of the Regal Class by Church organ masters (late 16th century) that attempted to imitate the human voice but never succeeded in <b>doing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the sound of a male chorus at a distance.|$|E
