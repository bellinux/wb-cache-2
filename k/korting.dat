In 1903 the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel completed the first fully functional German-built submarine, Forelle, which Krupp sold to Russia during the Russo-Japanese War in April 1904. The SM U-1 {{was a completely}} redesigned Karp-class submarine and only one was built. The Imperial German Navy commissioned it on 14 December 1906. It had a double hull, a <b>Körting</b> kerosene engine, and a single torpedo tube. The 50%-larger SM U-2 (commissioned in 1908) had two torpedo tubes. The [...] class of 1912–13 saw the first diesel engine [...] installed in a German navy boat. At the start of World War I in 1914, Germany had 48 submarines of 13 classes in service or under construction. During that war the Imperial German Navy used SM U-1 for training.

5000|$|Ludwig <b>Kort</b> was a German fluid {{dynamicist}} {{known for}} developing the ducted propeller, or <b>Kort</b> nozzle. In an attempt to reduce canal erosion, <b>Kort</b> discovered that directing {{the wake of a}} propeller through a short, stationary nozzle also increased thrust. [...] He submitted a U.S. patent for this technique, which was awarded in 1936. [...] His research showed that the performance of ducted propellers heavily depended on the cross-section and thickness of the duct.|$|R
50|$|A ducted {{propeller}}, {{also known}} as a <b>Kort</b> nozzle, is a propeller fitted with a non-rotating nozzle. It is used to improve the efficiency of the propeller and is especially used on heavily loaded propellers or propellers with limited diameter. It was developed by Luigi Stipa (1931) and Ludwig <b>Kort</b> (1934). The <b>Kort</b> nozzle is a shrouded propeller assembly for marine propulsion. The hydrodynamic design of the shroud, which is shaped like a foil, offers advantages for certain conditions over bare propellers.|$|R
