60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> a momentâ€™s {{amusement}} softening his features.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> to {{see what}} she meant, what she understood.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> And {{instead of}} {{avoiding}} his eyes, she smiled into them.|$|E
60|$|Heyst did {{not turn}} his head; <b>he</b> only <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> out-stretched arm.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> abrupt pause, and she {{was looking}} at the house.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and their}} eyes met, nor could he turn his head away again.|$|R
60|$|Lilian {{smiled a}} little, and Chatterton's eyes twinkled as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> encouragingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{as though}} her {{determination}} to leave Silverdale so soon surprised him.|$|E
60|$|Again Leger stood silent, {{but when}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a little flash showed in Hetty's eyes.|$|E
60|$|He flung {{them out}} of the window into the yard below. <b>He</b> just <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She winced from his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Lingard's eyes {{followed}} her look, and remained gazing expectantly at the house. After {{a minute or}} so <b>he</b> muttered, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> suspiciously-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{from the}} ground, almost as darkly {{as he had}} looked at Tom Pinch; but held his peace.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her. Her beauty seemed to hurt him. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> flower-decked head and frowned.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> swiftly. Their eyes met. Fearlessly {{she held}} his fingers for a moment,--a long, {{wonderful}} moment.|$|E
60|$|Her {{voice was}} firmer than he expected--much firmer. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> quickly, with {{something}} very like admiration in his eye.|$|E
60|$|After pronouncing {{these words}} with immense assurance, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>at</b> once fell a prey to distress, incertitude, and fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come with me," [...] {{said the}} older man, rising. [...] "I suppose," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> ragged frock, [...] "everything {{you have is}} in the wagon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "you {{certainly}} could." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hands. [...] "Those are unusually pretty gloves {{you have}} on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't labored; I {{believe it}} was a flash of insight," [...] Andrew declared. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face and laughed, looking baffled.|$|E
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the wheat, but though Witham smiled again, there was a curious {{expression}} in his face as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> niece.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Dolly," [...] {{he murmured}} at last, {{flushing}} slightly as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "I've been speaking {{to your father}} about--you know what." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> furtively. <b>He</b> {{was certain}} {{now that he}} had played his cards ill. She had read through him easily. He cursed himself for a lout.|$|R
60|$|At this {{mention of}} {{father and brother}} <b>he</b> involuntarily <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face--that same pure {{delicate}} face {{to which he had}} once brought so terrified a look and a pallor as of death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap you have," [...] {{she whispered}} in return, and then, marvelling <b>at</b> <b>her</b> boldness, blushed. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> sharply <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from {{narrowing}} eyes. It {{was not the}} answer he had looked to hear.|$|R
6000|$|She {{leaned over}} towards him. [...] "It made me at first very angry," [...] she said. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> quickly. She {{held up her}} hand.|$|E
60|$|Clara saw {{his mouth}} shut hard. Again <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> It seemed like an agreement. She bent over the cards, coughing, to clear her throat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{but among}} that host is one who, {{if all the}} stories are true," [...] and again <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, [...] "would rather take you than the city." ...|$|E
60|$|Sakon {{knew his}} {{daughter}} well, {{and it did}} not need that <b>he</b> should <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face to learn that she meant her words. Also he loved her, his only child, more dearly than anything on earth.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are welcome}} home, Prudence," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>glancing</b> {{sideways}} <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and his voice}} faltered. [...] "Your mother would have rejoiced to see you, but she has been gone from us these four months." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was passing}} on, {{but as she}} made him no answer <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face. Then all thought of going vanished. There were glistening tears in her dark eyes, and her lips were quivering.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun went pale, and a {{darkness}} {{came over}} her eyes, like shame, {{she looked up}} with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and jerked his head a little.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> quickly. He had {{detected}} the note in her speech: though lightly uttered, it was unmistakably a command. She tried to soften its effect in her next sentence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I meant I {{was glad}} that they had caught my horse, not that I had to ride away on it. Are you sorry, then?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> anxiously.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> him doubtfully. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and she {{questioned}} his eyes. He {{put his arm}} about her, and presently and almost absent-mindedly she obeyed his pressure and bent down and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> quickly <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> shot an even quicker <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> {{the face}} of the injured man, and stood erect. She breathed sharply, {{abruptly}} biting off the respiration with an effort of will. Linday turned to the men.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> obeyed, and <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, {{saw that}} it was very calm and cold as winter ice.|$|R
