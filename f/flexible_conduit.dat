40|$|A novel solar {{concept is}} the {{utilization}} of existing attic spaces as solar collectors. A heat exchanger situated in the attic facilitates {{the utilization of}} the solar-heated attic air to create useful energy products such as heated swimming-pool water and residential hot water. To enhance these products, a method is developed here to increase the energy carried into the heat exchanger by the solar-heated air. The basic idea is to utilize {{all parts of the}} attic as a hot-air reservoir rather than only the immediate neighborhood of the heat exchanger inlet face. In the practical realization of this idea, a <b>flexible</b> <b>conduit</b> attached to the heat exchanger inlet is deployed throughout the attic. The wall of the conduit is made permeable to enable the ingestion of air into the conduit from all neighborhoods along its length. The far end of the conduit is capped. An analytical model is developed which yields a specification of the axial distribution of the permeability needed to achieve axially uniform air ingestion. An apparatus was built to validate the model and its predictions. The measured axial pressure distributions were in very good agreement with that predicted from the analysis. This agreement validates the model and supports its further use as a design tool for enhancing the utilization of attic-collected solar energy.

40|$|Soil-steel {{structures}} are <b>flexible</b> <b>conduits</b> made of corrugated metal sheets and {{buried in a}} well compacted granular media. Classical methods of design for conventional sized <b>flexible</b> buried <b>conduits</b> are simple and not suitable for long span structures, especially under relatively shallow cover. Herein, the live load effect cannot be considered secondary {{as in the case}} of conduits under deep cover. Also, field experience has shown that failure of the structure could be initiated by soil failure. The present codes avoid the problems associated with shallow cover by requiring a minimum depth of cover. This requirement is empirical and does not differentiate between the different shapes of conduits. A plane strain finite element analysis is developed and used to study long span soil-steel structures of different shapes under any depth of cover and loading condition with due consideration given to the soil state of stress. The structure wall is replaced by conventional beam elements. Soil is simulated by a combination of constant strain and linear strain compatible elements. Storage and time requirements for the numerical solution are kept to the lowest level without sacrificing the desired accuracy. Two-noded spring type interface elements are introduced between soil and culvert elements. Nonlinear stress-dependent hyperbolic relationships are used to model the soil and shear behaviour of interface elements. Construction procedure is simulated by automatically generating the finite element mesh layer by layer and by including the effect of compaction in the incremental analyses. Live load is applied concentrically or eccentrically, in increments. Initiation and propagation of soil failure are detected based on a curved Mohr envelope, and applying a stress transfer technique. A finite element program is developed on the basis of the foregoing analytical procedure to predict the state of stresses in the system due to dead and live loads, as well as the live load causing soil failure. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for live load tests conducted on existing long span soil-steel structures under shallow cover. The results of laboratory tests carried out until failure of soil are also compared with the analytically predicted values. Reasonable agreement is found in both cases. An analytical study establishes the parameters governing soil failure above the conduit. These parameters include the depth of cover, magnitude and position of loading, and the size and geometric shape of the conduit. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|Toward a new {{generation}} of improved nerve guidance conduits (NGCs), novel biomaterials are required to address pressing clinical shortcomings in peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR) and to promote biological performance. A dual-component hydrogel system formed by cross-linking reaction between maleic anhydride groups in an oligomeric building block for cross-linking of free amine functionalities in partially hydrolyzed collagen is formulated for continuous processing and NGC fabrication. The influence of the gelation base is optimized for processing from a double syringe delivery system with a static mixer. A hydrophilic low-concentrated base was introduced to control network formation and to utilize highly reactive macromers for gelation. Cross-linking extent and building block conversion were improved and homogenous monoliths were fabricated. Chemically derivatized hydrogels were obtained by conversion of a fraction of anhydride groups in the oligomeric precursor with monovalent primary amine-containing grafting molecules prior to gelation. Network stability in functionalized hydrogels was maintained and cationic moieties were implement to the gel that promoted in vitro cell attachment and spreading irrespective of mechanical stiffness. A molding strategy was introduced that allowed for fabrication of <b>flexible</b> tubular <b>conduits</b> in tunable dimensions and with chemically patterned structures.

40|$|Years of {{dependable}} {{service and}} a multitude of wide ranging installations {{have led to the}} corrugated steel pipe industry {{to play a major role}} in modern engineering technology. <b>Flexible</b> steel <b>conduits</b> play an important role in the form of culverts, storm sewers, subdrains, spillways, underpasses, conveyor conduits and service tunnels; for highways, railways, airports, municipalities, recreation areas, industrial parks, flood and conservation projects, water pollution abatement and many other programs. In recent years developments have been made which allow engineers and contractors the use of conventional corrugated structural plates to design and build structures having larger spans and increased permissible live and dead loads. These structures are generally used for conditions where the depth-of-cover is limited to about 5 to 10 m and the design is constrained by a relatively low, wide-opening. However, in recent years many accidents and sudden failures have been reported on this type of structure. Such failures often originate from large soil settlements, poor soil compacting practices, and frost-thaw cycles. As a result, many different methods have been proposed to eliminate these problems. In this thesis the use of a Geogrid mesh to reinforce the soil surrounding the corrugated metal structure is proposed. It is the belief of the author that this material (Geogrid), which is widely used in the design and construction of retaining walls, will improve the strength and durability of soil-metal structures. The study carried out involved building and testing pipe-arches under shallow depth-of cover. The results obtained from these tests served to compare and document the advantage of using reinforced soil structures in contrast to non-reinforced soil structures.

40|$|Internet service {{provider}} liability and new duties: robo-takedown, policy of termination, notice and take steps The essay — after clarifying {{the outlines of}} the two main “safe harbor” provisions which limit the liability of online {{service provider}}s as regards copyright infringement in the Western Legal Tradition, namely the U. S. section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and articles 12 through 15 of the EU Directive on e-commerce — enquires {{the way in which the}} most recent case-law, respectively that of the U. S. Federal Courts and of the European Court of Justice, is enhancing the standard of protection and the enforcement of intellectual property rights. Indeed, both the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the EU e-commerce Directive provide little guidance on the meaning of the no-liability rule’s various requirements. But in the course of time, Courts have looked at certain recurring features to determine whether or not a service provider satisfies the conditions to be eligible for any of the “safe harbors”. The Author then looks at the significant changes in the use of the Internet over the past decade and focuses attention on the new techniques employed by copyright owners to protect their own rights, such as relying on robo-takedown notifications, seeking the assistance of third-party rights enforcement organizations or asking Courts for broad and <b>flexible</b> injunctions against <b>conduit</b> internet service providers. It is worth noting that each of these practices, individually taken, might jeopardize the free flow of information and cause a severe backlash on the individual’s access to the Internet, which would be unduly restricted as a consequence of a broad enforcement of copyrights. Altogether, robo-takedown, poorer accuracy requirements for notices, the policy of termination and broad and flexible permanent injunctions cast serious doubts over the actual implementation of the due process principle...|$|R
40|$|The 2 m-grating radius, extreme grazing {{incidence}} (1. 5 °) Schwob-Fraenkel spectrograph was {{developed at the}} Racah Institute of Physics (under CEA contract) more than 10 years ago. The first results (using photographie plates) on the TFR tokamak permitted the indentification of the spectrum of highly ionised Mo ions in the 5 - 50 Å spectral region / 1 /. Subsequently, the system was modified by J. L. Schwob into a duochromator, using two channeltron electron multipliers independently movable along the Rowland circle. It was thus possible to obtain radial profiles of the emissivities of the strongest lines of the H-and He-like isoelectronic sequences of light impurities in the 18 - 42 Å spectral range / 2 /. Recently, the duochromator has {{been converted into a}} multichannel spectrometer by equipping it with a microchannelplate (MCP) detector again movable along the Rowland circle. The detector consists of a MgF 2 coated, funneled MCP, associated with a phosphor screen image intensifier and coupled by a <b>flexible</b> fiber optic <b>conduit</b> to a 1024 element photodiode array (controlled and read-out by a commercially available PAR- 1461 EGG Princeton Applied Research optical multichannel analyser system). The first of this type of detector was developed at Princeton for the PLT and TFTR tokamaks and was described by Schwob et al / 3 /. An identical system has been installed on TFR, using a 20 µm entrance slit and a 600 groove mm- 1 Jobin-Yvon holographic grating. This instrument has been routinely used during the last year of TFR operation to monitor spectra of both intrinsic impurities (C, O, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with traces of Mn, Cl, and S) and purposely injected impurity elements in the 10 - 330 Å spectral range. The spectrometer has been used in both the spectrographic and the polychromator modes. In the former mode, spectra of highly-ionized, unstudied, heavy elements (injected either by the laser blow-off technique or as gaseous elements) have been obtained / 4, 5 /. In the latter utilization (in which selected individual pixels are read-out as function of time) line radiance evolutions of several different Fe ions have been simultaneously obtained on a single discharge. This has allowed the impurity transport to be modelled / 6 / even though the system was not absolutely calibrated, since different ionization degrees have different time evolutions...|$|R
