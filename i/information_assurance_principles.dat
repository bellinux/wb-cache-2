40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{have been only}} a small number of attempts at creating a cyber-security curriculum that can be used to teach children the concepts of cyber security and information assurance. There is a significant shortage of attempts at creating a computer-security curricula and cyber-security training for people who have only basic computer skills. Also, the integration of computer-security and <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>principles</b> into formal and accepted primary and secondary education is nearly non-existent. Our research has been aimed at evaluating the current computer-security curricula according to widely accepted educational standards. The objective is to (i) create a set of requirements to analyze the effectiveness of computer-security curricula, (ii) determine the best current disseminated cyber-security curriculum for children, (iii) and make recommendations for a cyber-security curriculum by utilizing the best traits of the surveyed programs. Literature includes studies on previously created computer-security curricula; and the most effective means of teaching children new concepts. Our research questions include: Is it important for a curriculum to be flexible enough to affect a variety of age groups? Is it important for a computer-security education to be interactive and motivational? Is it possible to teach difficult computer-security concepts in a way that children can understand?Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|As a {{field of}} growing importance, <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> is {{dedicated}} to protecting our information systems and related assets. In order for this field to deliver on its promise, effective <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> education, both {{in the classroom and}} beyond, is essential. However, relatively little empirical research has been done on the effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> education in the classroom.

40|$|Abstract â€“ This paper {{describes}} the methodology, implementation and {{results from the}} formation and execution of an undergraduate <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> student group. In February 2001, our institution formed a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machineryâ€™s Special Interest Group for Security, Audit and Control (ACM-SIGSAC) due to extensive interest by the student body in computer security and <b>information</b> <b>assurance,</b> {{as well as an}} awareness of the critical need by the faculty. This was the first <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> student chapter formed out of the more than 600 ACM student organizations worldwide. The chapter was formed with an interdisciplinary approach in order to include a larger portion of the student body and thus influence a larger audience. This approach proved successful. Over the past three years, the group has grown from an idea to a vibrant organization of approximately 600 students. We believe that we have struck a chord with the students that merits examination. The primary goal {{of this paper is to}} provide a descriptive resource to educators who wish to implement a student <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> group. It includes the purpose and methodology behind the formation of the group, our successes and failures, our lessons learned, and potential future directions.

40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> and {{computer}} security are serious worldwide concerns of governments, industry, and academia. Computer security {{is one of}} the three new focal areas of the ACM/IEEE's Computer Science Curriculum update in 2008. This ACM/IEEE report describes, as the first of its three recent trends, "the emergence of security as a major area of concern. " The importance of <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> and <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> education {{is not limited to the}} United States. Other nations, including the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and other members from NATO countries and the EU, have inquired as to how they may be able to establish <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> education programs in their own country. The goal of this document is to explore the space of various existing <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> educational standards and guidelines, and how they may serve as a basis for helping to define the field of <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance.</b> It was necessary for this working group to study what has been done for other areas of computing. For example, computer science (CS 2008 and associate-degree CS 2009), information technology (IT 2008), and software engineering (SE 2004), all have available curricular guidelines. In its exploration of existing government, industry, and academic <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> guidelines and standards, as well as in its discovery of what guidance is being provided for other areas of computing, the working group has developed this paper as a foundation, or a starting point, for creating an appropriate set of guidelines for <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> education. In researching the space of existing guidelines and standards, several challenges and opportunities to <b>Information</b> <b>Assurance</b> education were discovered. These are briefly described and discussed, and some next steps suggested...|$|R
40|$|Good {{security}} is not intrusive {{and can be}} almost invisible to typical users, who are often unaware of or take it for granted. However, good security practice by user populations is a critical element of an organizationâ€™s <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> strategy. This is reflected in government <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> teaching mandates such as DoD Directive 8570. 1, which outlines objectives and requirements for <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> (IA) education, training and awareness. Although mundane education, training and awareness programs may temporarily raise user interest, for many, mandatory education is considered a distracting waste of time. A new approach is needed to convey IA concepts that will engage the userâ€™s imagination. CyberCIEGE*+ is an innovative computer-based tool to teach <b>information</b> <b>assurance</b> concepts.
