Plants of C. diffusa infected with this virus were first found in Florida (2) and in a later study the virus {{was found in a}} plant from the Dominican Republic (3). Host range studies indicate that this virus, though common in Florida, has a limited host range and does not pose a risk to agricultural crops. However, it was often found in a <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) which is an important pest for Florida agriculture. Plants infected with both viruses were found to be “significantly more effective sources of CMV 5-8 weeks after inoculation that singly infected plants.”(2) ...|$|E

40|$|In many natural populations, hosts {{are found}} to be {{infected}} by more than one parasite species. When these parasites have different host exploitation strategies and transmission modes, a conflict among them may arise. Such a conflict may reduce the success of both parasites, but could work to the benefit of the host. For example, the less-virulent parasite may protect the host against the more-virulent competitor. We examine this conflict using the waterflea Daphnia magna and two of its sympatric parasites: the blood-infecting bacterium Pasteuria ramosa that transmits horizontally and the intracellular microsporidium Octosporea bayeri that can concurrently transmit horizontally and vertically after infecting ovaries and fat tissues of the host. We quantified host and parasite fitness after exposing Daphnia to one or both parasites, both simultaneously and sequentially. Under conditions of strict horizontal transmission, Pasteuria competitively excluded Octosporea in both simultaneous and sequential <b>double</b> <b>infections,</b> regardless of the order of exposure. Host lifespan, host reproduction and parasite spore production in <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> resembled those of single infection by Pasteuria. When hosts became first vertically (transovarilly) infected with O. bayeri, Octosporea was able to withstand competition with P. ramosa to some degree, but both parasites produced less transmission stages than they did in single infections. At the same time, the host suffered from reduced fecundity and longevity. Our study demonstrates that even when competing parasite species utilize different host tissues to proliferate, <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> lead to the expression of higher virulence and ultimately may select for higher virulence. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the less-virulent and vertically transmitting O. bayeri protects its host against the highly virulent P. ramosa...|$|R

40|$|Cells {{infected}} with two related retroviruses can generate heterozygous virions, {{which are the}} precursors of recombinant proviruses. Although many {{studies have focused on}} the frequencies and mechanisms of retroviral recombination, {{little is known about the}} dynamics of <b>double</b> <b>infection.</b> To examine this issue, viruses generated from two HIV- 1 vectors containing different markers were mixed together, and were used to infect target cells. The numbers of cells expressing none, one, or both markers were measured and were used to calculate whether <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurred at frequencies expected from random infection events. We found that <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurred significantly more frequently than predicted from random distribution; increased rates of <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> were observed in both a T cell line and primary activated CD 4 + T cells. In addition to direct virus infection, we also examined the nature of cell-mediated HIV- 1 <b>double</b> <b>infection.</b> Increased <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> was observed in all experiments regardless of whether a cell line or primary human dendritic cells were used for capture and transmission of HIV- 1. Therefore, our results indicate that HIV- 1 <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurs more frequently than it would at random in both direct and cell-mediated HIV- 1 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence of nonrandom <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> in HIV- 1.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection is nonrandom and that <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurs more frequently than predicted from random events. To probe the possible mechanisms for nonrandom infection, we examined the role of HIV- 1 entry pathways by using viruses pseudotyped with either CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 Env or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G). These two proteins use different receptors and entry pathways. We found that regardless of the protein used, <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurred more frequently than random events, indicating nonrandom HIV- 1 infection in both entry pathways. However, the frequency of <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> differed significantly, depending on the envelope protein. In primary CD 4 + T cells, <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurred most frequently when both viruses had CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 Env and least frequently when the two viruses had different envelopes. These {{results indicated that the}} preference in virus entry was a significant but not the only factor contributing to nonrandom <b>double</b> <b>infection.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrated that the CD 4 expression level in primary T cells affects their susceptibility to CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 infection but not VSV G-pseudotyped HIV- 1 infection. We have also examined infection with two viruses pseudotyped with CCR 5 - or CXCR 4 -tropic HIV- 1 Env and have found that <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> occurred more frequently than random events. These results indicate that coreceptor usage is not a barrier to recombination between the two virus populations. In our previous study, we also demonstrated nonrandom <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> via dendritic cell (DC) -mediated HIV- 1 transmission. To test our hypothesis that multiple HIV- 1 virions are transmitted during DC-T-cell contact, we used two populations of DCs, each capturing one vector virus, and added both DC populations to T cells. We observed a decreased frequency of <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> compared with experiments in which DCs captured both viruses simultaneously. Therefore, these results support our hypothesis that multiple virions are transmitted from DCs to T cells during cell-mediated HIV- 1 transmission...|$|E

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{occasionally}} co-infects with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Because {{replication of}} HBV is suppressed by HCV core protein in <b>double</b> <b>infection,</b> HBV is usually inactive in such case. In {{light of these}} facts, we examined HBV from patients who were negative for hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBe Ag) and positive for anti-HBe for differences in sequence of the core promoter and precore region between patients with and without HCV co-infection. The subjects were 17 HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis B patients divided into 2 groups: 10 without HCV, and 7 with HCV. DNA from the core promoter to the core gene was directly sequenced and compared between these 2 groups. There {{was a significant difference}} in the frequency of a change from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 1896 between patients with <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> (3 out of 7) and patients infected with HBV alone (9 out of 10) (p< 0. 05). Seven of the patients with HBV alone had genotype C, and 2 had genotype B. Four of the patients with <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> had genoype C, and 2 had genoype B. In the core region, mutations at amino acids 13 and 35 were significantly more frequent in patients with HBV alone. There was no difference in the sequence of the core promoter between the 2 groups. There were significant differences in the sequence of the precore region between patients infected with HBV alone and patients with a <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> of HBV and HCV. This suggests that the mechanisms by which HBV persists after seroconversion of HbeAg differs between patients with <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> and patients with HBV alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect HIV- 2 and to {{discriminate}} between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 infections was evaluated in 46 serum samples from Guinea-Bissau (GB) and Guinea-Conakry (GC) using serological tests and commercial (HIV- 1) and in-house (HIV- 2) real-time PCR assays. Samples were first identified as HIV- 2 positive by Genie I/II assay in GB and GC. HIV positivity was detected in 44 of 46 samples by all screening and confirmatory assays. A diagnostic strategy based on Inno-LIA and HIV- 1 / 2 RNA detection assays allowed accurate discrimination between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 in 84 % of single infections and confirmed 32 % of <b>double</b> <b>infections.</b> In samples with double reactivity in the Inno-LIA test and no detection of both genomes, cross-reactivity likely hampered the identification of true <b>double</b> <b>infections.</b> In conclusion, {{the implementation of a}} diagnostic strategy, based on multiple specific serological tests and highly sensitive quantitative PCR assays, is recommended to ensure accurate HIV- 2 diagnosis and appropriate therapy for individuals from areas in which the virus is endemic...|$|R
40|$|Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV), {{the type}} {{member of the}} newly {{proposed}} Poacevirus genus, and Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), the type member of Tritimovirus genus of the family Potyviridae, infect wheat naturally in the Great Plains and are transmitted by wheat curl mites. In this study, we examined the ability of these viruses to infect selected cereal hosts, and found several differential hosts between TriMV and WSMV. Additionally, we examined the interaction between WSMV and TriMV in three wheat cultivars at two temperature regimens (19 and 20 to 26 °C), and quantified the virus concentration in single and <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. <b>Double</b> <b>infections</b> in wheat cvs. Arapahoe and Tomahawk at both temperature regimens induced disease synergism with severe leaf deformation, bleaching, and stunting, with a 2. 2 - to 7. 4 -fold increase in accumulation of both viruses over single infections at 14 days postinoculation (dpi). However, at 28 dpi, in <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> at 20 to 26 °C, TriMV concentration was increased by 1. 4 - to 1. 8 -fold in Arapahoe and Tomahawk but WSMV concentration was decreased to 0. 5 -fold. WSMV or TriMV replicated poorly in Mace at 19 °C with no synergistic interaction whereas both viruses accumulated at moderate levels at 20 to 26 °C and induced mild to moderate disease synergism in doubly infected Mace compared with Arapahoe and Tomahawk. Co-infections in Mace at 20 to 26 °C caused increased TriMV accumulation at 14 and 28 dpi by 2. 6 - and 1. 4 -fold and WSMV accumulated at 0. 5 - and 1. 6 -fold over single infections, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HBV/HCV <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> and hepatocellular carcinoma risk in Chinese population. Materials and Methods: The databases of PubMed and CNKI were electronic searched by reviewers according to the searching words of HBV, HCV, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The related case–control studies or cohort studies were included. The association between virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma risk was demonstrated by odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). The data were pooled by fixed or random effects model according to the statistical heterogeneity. The publication bias was assessed by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test. Results: Finally, 13 publications were included in this meta-analysis. For significant statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 99. 8 %,P = 0. 00), the OR was pooled by random effects model. The pooled results showed that HBV infection can significantly {{increase the risk of}} developing hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 58. 01, 95 % CI: 44. 27 – 71. 75); statistical heterogeneity analysis showed that significant heterogeneity existed in evaluation of HCV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma risk across the included 13 studies I 2 = 77. 78 %, P = 0. 00). The OR was pooled by random effects model. The pooled results showed that HCV infection can significantly increase the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2. 34, 95 % CI: 1. 20 – 3. 47); significant heterogeneity did not exist in evaluation HBV/HCV <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> and hepatocellular carcinoma risk for the included 13 studies (I 2 = 0. 00 %,P = 0. 80).

40|$|Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV, genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) was {{reported}} {{for the first time}} in France in 1974, and it is now the most prevalent virus in cucurbit crops. In 2000, new strains referred as ‘emerging’ (EM) strains were detected in South-eastern France. EM strains are generally more severe and phylogenetically distinct from those previously reported in this country and referred as ‘classic’ (CL) strains. Since 2000, EM strains have been progressively replacing CL strains in several areas where they co-exist. In order to explain this rapid shift in virus populations, the biological properties of a set of 17 CL and EM WMV isolates were compared. No major differences were observed when comparing a limited host range including 48 different plant species or cultivars. Only two species were differential; Chenopodium quinoa was systemically infected by CL and not by EM isolates whereas Ranunculus sardous was systemically infected by EM and not by CL isolates. A considerable variability was observed in aphid transmission efficiencies but this could not be correlated to the CL or EM types. Two subsets of five isolates of each group were used to compare aphid transmission efficiencies from single and <b>double</b> (CL–EM) <b>infections</b> using six different cucurbit and non-cucurbit hosts. EM isolates were generally better transmitted from mixed CL–EM infections than CL isolates and CL transmission rates were significantly lower from double than from single infections. Cross-protection was only partial between CL and EM strains leading to frequent <b>double</b> <b>infections,</b> and only a slight asymmetry was observed in cross-protection efficiencies. Since <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> occur very commonly in fields, the preferential transmission of EM from mixed CL–EM infections could be one of the factors leading to the displacement of CL isolates by EM isolates...|$|R

SYMMV was most commonly detected, followed by SMV. Only a few samples {{were found to be}} infected by SYCMV; of these, three samples were positive for <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> of SYMMV and SYCMV. Phylogenetic analysis of HC–Pro of the SMV isolates collected in 2014 from the eight provinces of Korea showed that most isolates were distinct from the most common Korean isolate detected in 2012, but related to other Korean, Chinese and North American isolates. No isolates varying in HC–Pro amino acid residues implicated in efficiency of RNA silencing suppression activity were detected in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF 1 of both 2012 and 2014 SYCMV isolates showed differentiation into three subgroups. However, the geographical distribution of all three viruses in 2014 was essentially the same as observed in 2012. Quantitative real time PCR data also indicated a similar pattern of dual infected viruses occurrence as existed in 2012. Results showed SMV/ SYMMV <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> RNA accumulation was not changed as much as SYMMV/SYCMV <b>double</b> <b>infection.</b> However, between <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> SMV/SYMMV, SYMMV RNA accumulation level rises more than SMV, and SYCMV RNA accumulation level decline a little compare with SYMMV. In summary, the 2014 survey showed that SMV and SYMMV are still the most prevalent soybean viruses in Korea, and all three viruses were still dispersed in the same areas where they were detected in 2012, although with an apparent shift towards SMV Group I isolates compared to 2012. The reason for the shift in SMV isolates across all Korean provinces is not clear, as seed transmission through farmer–saved seed is presumed to be the main source of infection within the crop...|$|E

Comparative analysis of the 240 -nucleotide sequences of E/NS 1 gene junction region between the genome of DEN- 1 and DEN- 2 isolates of the corresponding reference Nauru and PR 159 S 1 strains, respectively, showed some nucleotide differences, mainly silent mutations in the third codon position. Results of maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of E/NS 1 gene sequences indicated that both genotypes of DEN- 1 and DEN- 2 viruses recovered from <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> in Barretos belonged to genotypes I and III, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the risk for}} human tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), ixodid tick-borne borrelioses, and <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> from 1994 to 1998 in Perm, which has among {{the highest rates of}} reported cases in Russia. We studied 3, 473 unfed adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected from vegetation in natural foci and 62, 816 ticks removed from humans. TBE virus and Borrelia may coexist in ticks. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and infections of the Lyme borreliosis group, or ixodid tick-borne borrelioses (ITBB) (1), are widespread in Russia. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, cases of these diseases totaled approximately 16, 650, 11, 350, and 14, 700, respectively. Most cases were acquired from the bite of an adult Ixodes persulcatus tick. In some regions west of the Volga River, the I. ricinus tick may also transmit these infections. The geographic distribution and epidemiology of TBE and ITBB in Eurasia are almost identical (2). These data suggest that <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> by TBE viru...|$|E
40|$|The leukemogenic {{activity}} of Gross {{murine leukemia virus}} adapted to rats was tested in W/Fu rats and NIH/Swiss mice. All animals infected with this virus developed thymic and nonthymic T-cell leukemia with a short latency period. It was observed that cell-free extracts from thymic lymphoma tissue of mice and rats, induced by either Gross murine leukemia virus or Gross murine leukemia virus adapted to rats, consisted of both small-plaque-forming and large-plaque-forming viruses, {{as determined by the}} XC plaque test. MCF-type virus was found in these virus complexes. Transformed cell foci were induced in SC- 1 cell layers by <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> of the cloned MCF-type virus and an ecotropic virus. SC- 1 cells containing transformed cell foci were shown to be tumorigenic upon inoculation into nude mice. The formation of transformed cell foci in mink lung cells was also observed after <b>double</b> <b>infection</b> with the cloned MCF-type virus and a xenotropic virus. The possible mechanism of leukemogenesis by endogenous viruses is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of trans-complementation of cell-to-cell movement between plant positive-strand RNA viruses is discussed {{with an emphasis}} on tobamoviruses. Attention is focused on complementation between tobamoviruses (coding for a single movement protein, MP) and two groups of viruses that contain the triple block of MP genes and require four (potato virus X) or three (barley stripe mosaic virus) proteins for cell-to-cell movement. The highlights of complementation data obtained by different experimental approaches are given, including (i) <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> with movement-deficient (dependent) and helper viruses; (ii) infections with recombinant viral genomes bearing a heterologous MP gene; (iii) complementation of a movement-deficient virus in transgenic plants expressing the MP of a helper virus; and (iv) co-bombardment of plant tissues with the cDNAs of a movement-dependent virus genome and the MP gene of a helper virus...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis annually cause 3 million and 2 million deaths, respectively. Last year, 600, 000 individuals, doubly infected with HIV and M. tuberculosis, died. Since World War I, approximately 150 {{million people have}} succumbed to these two infections [...] more total deaths than in all wars in the last 2, 000 years. Although the perceived threats of new infections such as SARS, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and anthrax are real, these outbreaks have caused less than 1, 000 deaths globally, a death toll AIDS and tuberculosis exact every 2 h. In 2003, 40 million people were infected with HIV, 2 billion with M. tuberculosis, and 15 million with both. Last year, 5 million and 50 million were newly infected with HIV or M. tuberculosis, respectively, with 2 million new <b>double</b> <b>infections.</b> Better control measures are urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} utility of a panviral DNA {{microarray}} platform (Virochip) in the detection of viruses associated with pediatric respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Study design The Virochip was compared with conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) - and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based testing {{for the detection of}} respiratory viruses in 278 consecutive nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 222 children. Results The Virochip was superior in performance to DFA, showing a 19 % increase in the detection of 7 respiratory viruses included in standard DFA panels, and was similar to virus-specific PCR (sensitivity, 85 % to 90 %; specificity,> 99 %; positive predictive value, 94 % to 96 %; negative predictive value, 97 % to 98 %) in the detection of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses. The Virochip also detected viruses not routinely tested for or missed by DFA and PCR, as well as <b>double</b> <b>infections</b> and infections in critically ill patients that DFA failed to detect. Conclusions Given its favorable sensitivity and specificity profile and expanded spectrum for detection, microarray-based viral testing holds promise for clinical diagnosis of pediatric RTIs. (J Pediatr 2008; 153 : 76 - 83) Acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common illnesses in human...|$|R
