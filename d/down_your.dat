25|$|In 1972 he {{was asked}} to stand in as the host of the long-running Sunday evening radio {{programme}} <b>Down</b> <b>Your</b> Way (first broadcast in 1946) when Franklin Engelmann, who had hosted the programme since 1953, died very suddenly. He went on to host a further ten editions before leaving to commence his last full-time summer as the BBC cricket correspondent. He was compulsorily retired from the BBC in September of that year having reached his 60th birthday. He was then contracted in a freelance capacity to host <b>Down</b> <b>Your</b> Way on a permanent basis since four other hosts trialled over the summer had proved to be less popular than him. He went on to present this programme for 15 years before bowing out on his 733rd show (equalling Engelmann's tenure) in May 1987 just before his 75th birthday. The final show featured Lord's Cricket Ground and included an interview with his old friend Denis Compton. A valedictory photograph was taken showing Johnston {{standing in front of the}} Lord's scoreboard, which showed 733 under the icon of Last Man to commemorate the event.|$|E

500|$|After university, Chen {{worked as}} a primary school teacher in rural Nanhui County outside of Shanghai.

The actress Wang Ying even performed an English version of the play in the White House for President Roosevelt and his wife. The future Madame Mao, then known as Li Yunhe, was also among its many performers. The play has been described in Chinese media as a [...] "spiritual atomic bomb" [...] against the Japanese invaders.

[...] Duralde believed that Mitra's character would have qualified as a [...] "memorable fierce chick" [...] if the film was not so silly. David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer rated Doomsday at 2.5 out of 4 stars and thought that the film was better paced than most fantasy-action films, patiently building up its action scenes to the major [...] "fireworks" [...] where other films would normally be exhausted early on.|$|E
