40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the behavior of}} the correlation length, r_ 0, {{as a function of the}} sample depth by extracting from the CfA 2 redshift survey volume [...] limited samples out to increasing distances. For a fractal distribution, the value of r_ 0 would increase with the volume occupied by the sample. We find no linear increase for the CfA 2 samples of the sort that would be expected if the Universe preserved its small scale fractal character out to the distances considered (60 [...] 100). The results instead show a roughly constant value for r_ 0 as a function of the size of the sample, with small fluctuations due to local inhomogeneities and luminosity segregation. Thus the <b>fractal</b> <b>picture</b> can safely be discarded. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{by the use}} of the Martin - Siggia - Rose generating functional {{technique and}} the self - consistent Hartree approximation, the dynamics of the ring homopolymer collapse (swelling) following an instantaneous change into a poor (good) solvent conditions. The equation of motion for the time dependent monomer - to - monomer correlation function is systematically derived. It is argued that for describing of the coarse - graining process (which neglects the capillary instability and the coalescence of "pearls") the Rouse mode representation is very helpful, so that the resulting equations of motion can be simply solved numerically. In the case of the collapse this solution is analyzed in the framework of the hierarchically crumpled <b>fractal</b> <b>picture,</b> with crumples of successively growing scale along the chain. The presented numerical results are in line with the corresponding simple scaling argumentation which in particular shows that the characteristic collapse time of a segment of length g scales as t^* ∼ζ_ 0 g/τ (where ζ_ 0 is a bare friction coefficient and τ is a depth of quench). In contrast to the collapse the globule swelling can be seen (in the case that topological effects are neglected) as a homogeneous expansion of the globule interior. The swelling of each Rouse mode as well as gyration radius R_g is discussed. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of computers have made us {{possible to see}} fractal sets casually. If you have any experience of drawing <b>fractal</b> <b>pictures</b> by computer, you must have noticed that some points are easy to draw while others are not. This means that an invariant set does not necessarily have uniform structure from th...|$|R
40|$|Collage grammars provide {{devices for}} the {{generation}} of pictures. They are derived from hyperedge replacement by adding a geometric context. In this paper, collage grammars will be compared with three methods that are used for {{the generation of}} <b>fractal</b> <b>pictures,</b> namely iterated function systems and two generalizations. It will be shown that essentially each operation with these methods can be simulated {{by the use of}} collage grammars. (orig.)

40|$|Two new {{families}} of multipoint without memory iterative methods with eighth- and sixteenth-orders {{are constructed using}} the symbolic software Mathematica. The key idea in constructing such methods is based on producing some generic suitable functions to reduce the functional evaluations and increase the order of convergence along the computational efficiency. Again by applying Mathematica, we design a hybrid algorithm to capture all the simple real solutions of nonlinear equations in an interval. The application of the new schemes in producing <b>fractal</b> <b>pictures</b> is also furnished...|$|R
40|$|This Master's thesis {{deals with}} history of Fractal {{geometry}} and describes the fractal science development. In the begining there are essential Fractal science terms explained.

Thesis informs about fractal geometry practical usage. Few present software packages or more programs {{which can be used}} for making <b>fractal</b> <b>pictures</b> are described in this work. Some of theirs capabilities are described. Thesis' practical part consists of slides, demonstrational program and poster.

50|$|Already {{at the end}} of the 1970s, {{applications}} for the discrete spiral coordinate system were given in image analysis. To represent an image in this coordinate system rather than in Cartesian coordinates, gives computational advantages when rotating or zooming in an image. Also, the photo receptors in the retina in the human eye are distributed in a way that has big similarities with the spiral coordinate system. It can also be found in the Mandelbrot <b>fractal</b> (see <b>picture</b> to the right).|$|R
3000|$|Our {{choice is}} also {{justified}} by the way that humans perceive the fractal complexity. In a study on human perception conducted on <b>fractal</b> <b>pictures</b> [33], the authors conclude that [...] "the hypothesis on the applicability and fulfillment of Weber-Fechner law for the perception of time, complexity and subjective attractiveness was confirmed". Their tests aimed at correlating the human perception of time, complexity, and aesthetic attractiveness with the fractal dimension and the Lyapunov exponent, based on {{the hypothesis that the}} perception of fractal objects may reveal insights of the human perceptual process. In [34], the most attractive fractals appeared to be the ones with the fractal dimension comprised between 1.1 and 1.5. According to [35], [...] "the prevalence of fractals in our natural environment has motivated a number of studies to investigate the relationship between a pattern's fractal character and its visual properties", for example, [36, 37]. The authors of [35] investigate the visual appeal {{as a function of the}} fractal dimension, and they establish three intervals: [1.1 – 1.2] low preference, [1.3 – 1.5] high preference, and [1.6 – 1.9] low preference. Pentland finds in this psychophysical studies [38, 39] that for the one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion and the two-dimensional Brodatz textures, the correlation between the fractal dimension and the perceived roughness is more than 0.9.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this report}} {{is to set up}} {{state-of-the-art}} methods in the field of moving <b>picture</b> <b>fractal</b> coding using I. F. S. This topic is recent, that is why, this review may often be updated. Using I. F. S. for moving pictures is a natural extension of studies conducted in still image compression (see section II). The growing number of articles in this field since 1991 indicates the interest for this technique in the compression community (see section III). In this section, the two main approaches, already defined for moving <b>picture</b> <b>fractal</b> coding using I. F. S., are introduced. Available commercial and public softwares are presented in section IV. In section V, readers can find several summaries of relevant papers. In section VI, open questions, put forth by the previously described methods, are introduced. An extensive (but certainly not complete) * list of relevant references is given in section VII. II.

50|$|The most {{important}} is susceptibility. Let us apply a very small magnetic field to thesystem in the critical point. A very small magnetic field {{is not able to}} magnetize a large coherent cluster, but with these <b>fractal</b> clusters the <b>picture</b> changes. It affects easily the smallest size clusters, since they have a nearly paramagnetic behaviour. But this change, in its turn, affects the next-scale clusters, and the perturbation climbs the ladder until the whole system changes radically. Thus, critical systems are very sensitive to small changes in the environment.|$|R
