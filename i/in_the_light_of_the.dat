5|$|During the Interregnum, Portland Castle {{continued}} to be garrisoned and used a prison, with a unit of 103 men attached to it in 1651. It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1653, seeing action in a three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he reduced the garrison to its pre-war levels but repaired the fortifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuing Dutch threat; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Themistocles, with a {{power base}} firmly established amongst the poor, filled the vacuum left by Miltiades's death, and in the following decade became the most influential politician in Athens. During this period, Themistocles continued to support the expansion of Athens' naval power. The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended, and Themistocles's naval policies may be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential threat from Persia. Aristides, Themistocles's great rival, and champion of the zeugites (the 'upper hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.|$|E

However, the political stability and economic improvements, such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were overshadowed by {{the onset of the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis. On his Presidency the death penalty was revived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rape-slay case of Eileen Sarmienta and Allan Gomez in 1993 and the first person to be executed was Leo Echegaray in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Around late August {{or early}} September, Wiśniowiecki {{met with the}} army regimentarzs Władysław Dominik Zasławski-Ostrogski, Mikołaj Ostroróg and Aleksander Koniecpolski. He was not on overly {{friendly}} terms with them, as he resented being passed in military nominations, but after short negotiations he agreed to follow their orders, and thus reduced to a junior commander status which had little impact over {{the next phase of}} the campaign. On 23 September, their forces were, however, defeated at the Battle of Pyliavtsi; {{near the end of the}} battle some accounts suggest Wiśniowiecki was offered the hetman's position, but refused. On 28 September in Lviv, Wiśniowiecki, with popular support, was given a field regimentarz nomination; about a week later this nomination was confirmed by the Sejm. To the anger of Lviv's townfolk, he decided to focus on retreating towards the key fortress in Zamość instead of Lviv; he would leave garrisons on both towns, and keep his army in the field. In the end, the cities were not captured by the Cossacks, who <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming winter decided to retreat, after being paid a ransom by both town councils; no other large field battle took place that year.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{troops with}} their {{supplies}} and equipment {{had to be}} loaded on board the ships on 31 December 1943, just {{five days after the}} assault on Cape Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced number of landing craft.|$|E

Suffering from sunstroke, she quickly falls unconscious. After the Mysterons warn of its imminent destruction, Spectrum's airborne headquarters, Cloudbase, is placed on red alert and sealed from all external contact. Destiny Angel is launched to search for her comrade, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mysterons' threat is recalled on the orders of Spectrum's commander-in-chief, Colonel White. This decision provokes a heated argument between White and Captain Blue, who confesses that he and Symphony are romantically involved.
