5000|$|Alley Oop's name {{derived from}} the [...] "let's go" [...] phrase allez, hop!, used as a cue by French gymnasts and trapeze artists. Initially, Alley Oop was a daily strip which had a run from December 5, 1932 to April 26, 1933. Beginning August 7, 1933, the strip was {{distributed}} by NEA syndicate, and the early material was reworked for a larger readership. The strip added a full page Sunday strip, on September 9, 1934. It also appeared in half-page, tabloid and half tab formats, which were smaller and/or <b>dropped</b> <b>panels.</b> During World War II, the full page vanished, and newspapers were offered {{a third of a}} page version that <b>dropped</b> <b>panels,</b> so more strips could fit on a page.|$|R
5000|$|Original {{facilities}} provided {{include a}} single manually operated 75 ft diameter turntable with 42 radiating roads. Twenty {{one of these}} roads were covered by a wooden framed roundhouse building clad in corrugated sheeting. All 21 roads in the roundhouse had 60 ft long pits, radial drop pits were fitted to all 21 roads. Two elevated 50000 imp gal tanks fed three 9 in diameter water columns. An office for the District Locomotive Engineer (referred to as the DLE) was constructed using concrete <b>drop</b> <b>panels.</b> An office building for the Superintendent, Steam Shed Inspector, Timkeepers & Clerks was built near the water tanks [...] along with a rest barracks for crews from other depots that was located near the depot, with both of these buildings also using the concrete <b>drop</b> <b>panel</b> method of construction.|$|R

While superficially similar in appearance to many other combo organs in the 1960s, it can easily be distinguished from competing models (the Farfisa Compact and Vox Continental) by identifying the cabinet colors.|$|R

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{comprises the}} range of possible design solutions for reinforced concrete slab structures {{with an emphasis on}} the ribbed and the waffle slabs. The scope of an application of such slabs has been shown, along with the design process, and preparation of a numerical model for the finite element analysis. The comparison of computational models for ribbed slabs has been made and the influence of different distances between ribs on the entire structure has been analysed. A comparison of different systems of ribbed slabs with band beams and <b>drop</b> <b>panels</b> has been made. The advantages and disadvantages of ribbed and waffle have been discussed in comparison to flat slabs...|$|R
40|$|Slabs {{deflection}} of the {{reinforced concrete}} structures {{is of great}} importance in their serviceability limit state design. Leading international codes present several well-founded methods to calculate the slabs mid-panel deflections. Based on the ACI code, this paper presents a nomograph by which the deflection {{of different types of}} slabs is evaluated in proper time with sufficient precision. This nomograph also considers the type of the column-slab connection, such as the presence of columns head or <b>drop</b> <b>panel</b> and relative sizes. In addition, the nomograph can be applied correspondingly in the determination of the minimum slabs thickness based on the deflection criteria. An example is given to show the efficiency of the nomograph...|$|R
50|$|Full-page strips were {{eventually}} replaced by strips half that size. Strips such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, {{such as the}} New Orleans Times Picayune, or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the Chicago Sun-Times. When Sunday strips {{began to appear in}} more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or <b>dropped</b> <b>panels.</b> During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic strip was the Prince Valiant strip for 11 April 1971.|$|R

Volumes 37 and later introduced a new, larger square book in full color, showing the Sunday strips to be formatted in a size as they usually are, instead of shrunken-down to meet the book size. However, this means that the first panel after the logo box (called the <b>drop</b> <b>panel</b> because newspapers can drop it without ruining the point of the strip) is no longer printed in the compilation books.|$|R

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{flat slab}} floors are {{used throughout the}} world as an economical structural system for many building applications. In moderate and high seismic regions, a more rigid structural system, such as a shear wall or moment resisting beam column frame, is generally added to provide adequate lateral resistance. Nevertheless, the slab-column system must maintain its gravity load capacity even after numerous cyclic lateral displacements. In retrofit analysis of older buildings, it is also beneficial to include the lateral resistance provided by the slab-column frames as this may substantially {{reduce the cost of}} the overall building retrofit [Hueste 1999]. The objective of this project was to create a general, robust hysteretic model for the response of slab-column connections to earthquake excitation, with particular attention to older non-ductile construction. This model is now available for use in the OpenSEES non-linear analysis platform. Applicability The hysteretic model presented here is applicable to both interior and exterior slab-column connections of flat slab floor systems without <b>drop</b> <b>panels</b> or column capitals. The model is applicable to connections with or without continuous slab reinforcement, and with or withou...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{capacity}} {{evaluation of}} post-tensioned concrete slab-column frame buildings designed only for gravity loads and wind load is presented. The series of nonlinear pushover analyses {{are carried out}} by using the computer program SAP 2000. An equivalent frame model with explicit transverse torsional members is introduced for modeling slab-column connections. The analyses are carried out by ollowingguidelines in ATC- 40 and FEMA- 273 / 274, where several important factors such as P-Delta effects, strength and stiffness contributions from masonry infill walls, and foundation flexibility are well taken into account. The pushover analysis results, presented {{in the form of}} capacity curves, are compared with the seismic demand from the expected earthquake ground motion for Bangkok and then the seismic performance can be evaluated. Numerical examples are performed on the 9 - and 30 -storey post-tension flat-plate buildings in Bangkok. The results show that in general post-tensioned concrete slab-column frame buildings without shear wall possess relatively low lateral stiffness, low lateral strength capacity, and poor inelastic response characteristics. The evaluation also shows that the slab-column frame combined with the shear wall system and <b>drop</b> <b>panel</b> can increase the strength and stiffness significantly...|$|R
