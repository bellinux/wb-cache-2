25|$|Micron-scale {{mechanical}} components such as springs, gears, <b>fluidic</b> and heat transfer devices are fabricated {{from a variety}} of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like SU8. Examples of MEMS components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.|$|E
25|$|In active flow control, {{forces in}} {{vehicles}} occur via circulation control, in which larger more complex mechanical parts {{are replaced by}} smaller simpler <b>fluidic</b> systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, active flow control promises lower mass, costs (up to 50% less), and very low inertia and response times, and simplicity. This was demonstrated in the Demon UAV, which flew for the first time, in the UK, in September 2010.|$|E

25|$|By {{combining}} nanotechnology with landscape ecology, {{a habitat}} landscape can be nanofabricated on-chip {{by building a}} collection of nanofabricated bacterial habitats, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements and with nano-scale channels providing them with the local ecosystem service of habitat renewal. These landscapes of MHPs {{can be used as}} physical implementations of an adaptive landscape: by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these <b>fluidic</b> landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a metapopulation system operating on-chip within a synthetic ecosystem. The metapopulation biology and evolutionary ecology of these bacterial systems, in these synthetic ecosystems, can be addressed using experimental biophysics.|$|E
500|$|His {{experience}} with the disconnected Borg resulted in Chakotay being against a plan to ally with the Borg against Species 8472 in [...] "", causing conflict between Captain Janeway and him. The alliance results in Seven of Nine {{and a number of}} other Borg drones being placed on Voyager and Janeway injured. Although he was ordered to continue with the alliance, Chakotay seeks to renegotiate the alliance, but Seven refuses any changes. When she opens a rift to <b>Fluidic</b> Space, Chakotay decompresses the cargo bay, sending all the Borg drones out into space with the exception of Seven. Later, when the Borg attempt to double-cross Voyager, Chakotay activates his localised neural link, confusing Seven and allowing Torres to disable her link to the Collective permanently.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{possible}} F414 improvements include {{efforts to}} reduce engine noise by using either mechanical or <b>fluidic</b> chevrons and {{efforts to reduce}} emissions with a new trapped vortex combustor. Chevrons would reduce engine noise by inducing mixing between the cooler, slower bypass air and the hotter, faster core exhaust air. Mechanical chevrons would {{come in the form}} of triangular cutouts (or extensions) at the end of the nozzle, resulting in a [...] "sharktooth" [...] pattern. <b>Fluidic</b> chevrons would operate by injecting differential air flows around the exhaust to achieve the same ends as the mechanical variety. A new combustor would likely aim to reduce emissions by burning a higher percentage of the oxygen, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen available to bond with nitrogen forming the pollutant NOx.|$|E

2500|$|After {{successfully}} driving Species 8472 {{back into}} their <b>fluidic</b> space, Seven of Nine attempts to assimilate Voyager but is severed from the hive mind and stripped of most of her Borg implants, becoming a member of Voyagers crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series. Flashbacks and allusions in several episodes, such as [...] "", establish that before her assimilation, Seven of Nine was Annika Hansen, the child of scientists who studied the Borg in the Delta Quadrant independent of the Federation. Unfortunately her parents were assimilated into the collective with her, but her father makes a temporary appearance in the final episode of Voyager.|$|E
2500|$|Seven of Nine first {{appears in}} the second part of [...] "" [...] at the start of the fourth season. She is chosen by the Borg to {{communicate}} verbally with Captain Janeway so that together they can develop a weapon to defeat Species 8472. After a Borg cube destroys itself to save Voyager, Seven is transported aboard the Federation ship. Janeway is injured, leaving Chakotay in command — but he distrusts Seven and the Borg and after he refuses to work with her, she sends the vessel into <b>fluidic</b> space to force them to develop the weapon. Just before doing so, Chakotay decompresses the cargo bay, killing the remaining Borg with the exception of Seven. Janeway recovers and works with Seven and the Doctor to develop the weapon and defeat an attack by Species 8472. With their alliance ended, Seven attempts to assimilate the crew but they override her neural connection to the Collective. Over the course of the following episode, [...] "The Gift", [...] removes the majority of Seven's Borg implants because her body begins to reject the technology once her connection to the Borg Collective is severed. Seven leaves sick bay to help repair the ship, and while working she attempts to communicate with the Collective, but is stopped by Kes. She is placed in the brig where she and Captain Janeway have a heart to heart discussion. Following the departure of Kes, they attempt to integrate Seven into the crew.|$|E

6000|$|... "Blake {{is as much}} to {{be trusted}} as I am. No, I am forced to a {{practical}} acceptance {{of the theory of}} the <b>fluidic</b> arm, and yet this is a most astounding admission. We must suppose that the psychic was able to read our minds and write down our mingled and confused musical conceptions by means of a supernumerary hand. It happens that I have since seen these etheric hands in action, which makes it easier for me to conceive of such a process. I have seen them dart forth from another medium precisely as described by Scarpa. I have seen them lift a glass of water, and I have had them touch my knees beneath a table while slate-writing was going on--so that, given the power to read my mind, there is nothing impossible (having regard to Bottazzi's definite experiments) in the idea of the etheric hand's setting down the music and reproducing the signature of 'E. A.' In fact, at a recent sitting in a private house with a young male psychic, we had this precise feat performed. Said the psychic to our host, Dr. Towne, 'Think hard of a signature that is very familiar to you,' and Dr. Towne fixed his mind upon the signature of his brother, and immediately, while the young man's material hands were controlled, his etheric hand seized a pencil {{in the middle of the}} table and reproduced the signature." ...|$|E
