5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of <b>getting</b> <b>those</b> fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
25|$|In {{the border}} states there was {{widespread}} concern with military coercion of the Confederacy. Many {{if not a}} majority were definitely opposed to it. When Abraham Lincoln called for troops to march south to recapture Fort Sumter and other national possessions, southern Unionists were dismayed. Secessionists in Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia were successful in <b>getting</b> <b>those</b> states to declare their secession from the U.S. and to join the Confederate States of America.|$|E

The person proposing to cut the tree trunk has blue leśyā, the one suggesting cutting branches has grey leśyā, the person suggesting cutting twigs has red lesya and the person thinking of simply plucking the fruits has yellow leśyā. On the other hand, the person with the white leśyā, having pure disposition, thinks only of picking up fruits fallen on the ground sparing the tree.|$|E

5000|$|A minor {{controversy}} ensued {{after the}} single's release, as the {{lines to the}} chorus ("...Golly jeepers/Where'd you <b>get</b> <b>those</b> weepers?/Peepshow, creepshow/Where did you <b>get</b> <b>those</b> eyes?...") {{were found to be}} too similar to the lyrics in the 1938 song [...] "Jeepers Creepers". To remedy the situation and to avoid legal action, the band gave co-songwriting credit on [...] "Peek-a-Boo" [...] to Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.|$|R
500|$|Valve {{announced}} in July 2012 {{that it was}} developing a Steam client for Linux and modifying the Source engine to work natively on Linux, based on the Ubuntu distribution. This announcement followed months of speculation, primarily from the website Phoronix that had discovered evidence of Linux developing in recent builds of Steam and other Valve software. Newell stated that getting Steam and games to work on Linux is a key strategy for Valve; Newell called the closed nature of Microsoft Windows 8, [...] "a catastrophe {{for everyone in the}} PC space", and that Linux would maintain [...] "the openness of the platform". Valve is extending support to any developers that want to bring their games to Linux, by [...] "making it as easy as possible for anybody who's engaged with usputting their games on Steam and <b>getting</b> <b>those</b> running on Linux", according to Newell.|$|E
500|$|Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, {{the band}} left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas {{by the group}} to arrange an {{appearance}} at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single [...] "Double Yellow Line", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, [...] "Eagle Never Hunts the Fly" [...] failed to chart, but {{is often described as}} Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as [...] "sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time. It was {{the kind of thing you}} just didn’t hear, you almost worried about <b>getting</b> <b>those</b> sounds onto a 45".|$|E
500|$|Because the New York Dolls {{had little}} money, Sylvain and Thunders played the austerely {{designed}} and affordable Gibson Les Paul Junior guitars on the record. They jokingly {{referred to them}} as [...] "automatic guitars" [...] due to their limited sound shaping features. To amplify their guitars, they ran a Marshall Plexi standalone amplifier through the speaker cabinets of a Fender Dual Showman, and occasionally used a Fender Twin Reverb. Some songs were embellished with additional instruments, including Buddy Bowser's brassy saxophone on [...] "Lonely Planet Boy". Johansen sang into distorted guitar pickups for additional vocals and overdubbed them into the song. He also played an Asian gong for [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] and harmonica on [...] "Pills". For [...] "Personality Crisis", Sylvain originally played on The Record Plant's Yamaha grand piano before Rundgren added his own piano flourishes to both that song and [...] "Private World". Rundgren {{also contributed to the}} background vocals heard on [...] "Trash" [...] and played synthesizers on [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] and [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)", which Sylvain recalled: [...] "I remember him <b>getting</b> <b>those</b> weird sounds from this beautiful old Moog synthesizer he brought in. He said it was a model that only he and The Beatles had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Price {{endorsed}} Mitt Romney in the Republican Party's 2008 presidential {{primaries and}} Newt Gingrich in the party's 2012 primaries. In 2016, he supported Marco Rubio and initially opposed Donald Trump, saying in March {{of that year}} that Trump would be [...] "dangerous for politics and the economy." [...] Despite this, once Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, Price switched his allegiance and corralled eight of his fellow House Republican committee chairs into joining him. They released a group endorsement of Donald Trump for president on May 13, 2016, which stated, [...] "There is a path to winning in November, and it comes through unity. To solidify this partnership, we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him." [...] A month later, Price's efforts in <b>getting</b> <b>those</b> committee chairs to endorse Trump led the Washington Post to name Price as one of Trump's [...] "top six allies in Congress." ...|$|E

60|$|Then Blacky the Crow did a {{thing which}} {{disappointed}} scamps often do,--began {{to blame the}} ones {{he was trying to}} wrong because his plans had failed. To have heard him talking to himself, you would have supposed that those eggs really belonged to him and that Hooty and Mrs. Hooty had cheated him out of them. Yes, Sir, that is what you would have thought if you could have heard him muttering to himself there in the tree-top.
