5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy chain or the constant <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

5|$|Isabella and Martinuzzi left Buda on 5 September 1541, taking John Sigismund and the Holy Crown with them. She {{and her son}} {{settled in}} Lippa, which {{was the center of}} an old <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zápolya family. The delegates of the {{counties}} of John Sigismund's realm met in Debrecen on 18October. They swore fealty to him and acknowledged the sultan's suzerainty. Martinuzzi signed a treaty with FerdinandI's representative, Caspar Serédy, in Gyalu (now Gilău in Romania) on 29December. According to the Treaty of Gyalu, Hungary was to be reunited under the rule of Ferdinand, but John Sigismund's right to the Zápolyas' domains in Upper Hungary was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Corvinus {{was unwilling}} to break his own truce with Bayezid, having tacit Ottoman backing for his own war in the west. However, he granted his vassal a {{territorial}} gift in Transylvania, comprising the domains of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă. According to various interpretations, this exchange occurred in or after 1484, and was meant to compensate Stephen {{for the loss of}} his ports. Medievalist Marius Diaconescu dates the lease of Cetatea to 1482, when Corvinus agreed to give Stephen a place of refuge, should Moldavia fall to the Ottomans, while Ciceu only became Stephen's castle in 1489. Both citadels were on land confiscated after conflicts between the Three Nations and Corvinus. Ciceu had been a fief of the Losonczi family, under litigation, while Cetatea had been a special <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Voivode of Transylvania, whose last titular owner before Stephen was John Pongrác of Dengeleg.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše in the 14th century BC, Qatna may {{have become part of}} his kingdom. In 1977, Astour {{considered}} Qatna a constitutent part of the lands of Nuhašše, and identified a king of Qatna named Adad-Nirari with the Nuhaššite king. Astour was followed by Thomas Richter in 2002, who considered Qatna to be a secondary city in the <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nuhaššite king. The tablets of Qatna mention a šakkanakku (military governor) named Lullu, and Richter considered him an official of Nuhašše. The hypothesis of Richter is debated; a number of scholars accept it, for example Pfälzner, who suggested that the Nuhaššite king may have resided in Qatna's royal palace. Richter dated the rule of the Nuhaššite king to the period preceding the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I's first Syrian war, during which Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše opposed the Hittites, was defeated, and, according to Richter, had his kingdom split between different Hittite puppets including Idanda of Qatna.|$|E

In 1312, King Denis donated Póvoa to his bastard son, Afonso Sanches, Lord of Albuquerque, who included it in the patrimony of the Monastery of Santa Clara, which he had just founded in Vila do Conde. In 1367, King Ferdinand I confirmed the charters, privileges and uses of Póvoa de Varzim. These were again confirmed by John I in 1387. But the <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastery over the town grew stronger and the people asked King Manuel I to end the situation. In 1514, during the era of charter reform, the King granted a new charter to Póvoa de Varzim. Besides the town hall and square, the town gained a pillory, granted significant self-government, and involved itself in the Portuguese discoveries.|$|E

The angel of death, Azrael, tells Thalaba that either Okba or Laila must die. Okba uses this {{chance to try}} and stab Thalaba, but Laila steps in between them and is killed. Okba curses God for his fate but Thalaba can only feel pity over the scene. After leaving, {{he is able to}} come to Simorg's valley. Simorg directs Thalaba to take a sled to {{continue}} on his way while the spirit of Laila asks Thalaba to end Okba's misery. However, Thalaba refuses to commit vengeance and he travels onwards until he arrives at a small boat waiting for him. He is taken down a river to the sea where Thalaba tosses away his magic ring.

5|$|St. Charles Bay was the <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Karankawa Indians {{before the}} arrival of European settlers. The Spanish {{referred}} to the bay as Laguna del Bergantine, which translated to the Lagoon of the Brigantine. The name is the likely the source of Burgantine Lake, found at the bay's head. The name derived from a Spanish vessel that was being used to transfer money to Texas to bribe Mexican soldiers at Goliad and San Antonio in 1818. It was caught in an Aransas Bay storm that swept the ship into the waters of St. Charles Bay, landing in a creek at its base. Supposedly, the ship was abandoned in the surrounding prairie (Fagan ranch near Tivoli, Texas), and its parts used by area settlers (later determined to be the Fagan family) to build homes.|$|E

An understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular basis <b>of</b> its {{action has been}} hindered {{by a lack of}} structural and mutational data on the receptor.

In particular, the faces containing the large beta sheets in the L 1 and L 2 domains have been suggested to be involved with ligand binding of EGF to its receptor...|$|R
5|$|The Duchess of York's Catholic secretary, Edward Colman, was, in 1678, falsely {{implicated in}} a fictitious plot against the King by Titus Oates. The plot, {{known as the}} Popish Plot, led to the Exclusionist movement, which was headed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. The Exclusionists sought to debar the Catholic Duke of York from the throne. Their {{reputation}} in tatters, the Yorks were reluctantly exiled to Brussels, a <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King of Spain, ostensibly to visit Lady Mary—since 1677 the wife of Prince William III of Orange. Accompanied by her not yet three-year-old daughter Isabella and Lady Anne, the Duchess of York was saddened by James's extra-marital affair with Catherine Sedley. Mary's spirits were briefly revived by a visit from her mother, who was living in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Special Council of Ministers (equivalent to {{the current}} Council of the European Union) was {{composed}} of representatives of national governments. The Presidency was held by each state {{for a period of}} three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments, which were still responsible for the state's general economic policies. The Council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority. Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Authority, and in these areas the Council (unlike the modern Council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
