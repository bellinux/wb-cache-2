Wilson cites documents in the Vatican Library and the University of Leiden, Netherlands, which seem to suggest the presence of another image at Edessa. A 10th-century codex, Codex Vossianus Latinus Q 69 found by Gino Zaninotto in the Vatican Library contains an 8th-century account saying that an imprint of Christ's whole body was left on a canvas kept in a church in Edessa: it quotes a man called Smera in Constantinople: [...] "King Abgar received a cloth on which one can see not only a face but the whole body" [...] (in Latin: tantum faciei figuram sed totius corporis figuram cernere poteris).|$|E

40|$|The Palaeozoic geosynclinal sediments of the Mossman and Cooktown areas {{consist of}} shallow‐water shelf sediments in the west, {{subdivided}} into two formations, overlain by a thick pile of deep‐water turbidites occupying {{the remainder of}} the Palaeozoic outcrop and constituting one formation. The sediments have been strongly <b>folded</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> phases, and are now characterised by widespread steep dips and steeply plunging folds. The first folds (B 1) were acute folds with steeply dipping axial planes striking north or northnorthwest, and with almost horizontal axes. Broad open B 2 folds, with steep axial planes of various trends, were superimposed on the steeply dipping beds of the B 1 folds. Few minor structures are associated with either of these phases of folding. The third phase of folding (B 3) resulted in tight, almost isoclinal, folds with steep axial planes trending between north and northwest, and with steep plunges. These folds were accompanied by a strongly developed axial plane slaty cleavage which, in many areas, led to a progressive transposition of the original sedimentary bedding into a new lamination. The final period of folding (B 4) was a minor one, affecting only a limited area in which the slaty cleavage of the B 3 folds is the dominant planar element. The cleavage is folded into sharp‐angled chevron folds with almost horizontal axes and gently dipping axial planes...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{physiologic}} and pathologic changes {{associated with}} microgravity exposure {{have been studied}} extensively, {{the effect of this}} environment on the eye is largely unknown. Over the last several years, NASA s Space Medicine Division has documented astronauts presenting with varying degrees of disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds, cotton wool spots, and hyperopic shifts after long-duration space flight. Methods: Before and after long-duration space flight, six astronauts underwent complete eye examinations to include cycloplegic and/or manifest refraction and fundus photography. Five of these astronauts had Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed following their missions. Results: Following exposure to space flight of approximately 6 -months duration, six astronauts had neuro-ophthalmic findings. These consisted of disc edema <b>in</b> <b>four</b> astronauts, globe flattening <b>in</b> <b>four</b> astronauts, choroidal <b>folds</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> astronauts, cotton wool spots in three astronauts, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in five astronauts, and decreased near vision <b>in</b> five astronauts. <b>Four</b> of the astronauts with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift equal to or greater than + 0. 50 D between pre- and post-mission spherical equivalent refraction in one or both eyes (range + 0. 50 D to + 1. 50 D).

Hypertonic saline was administered in a dose dependent manner and the response determined as the dose of hypertonic saline that induced a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20 FEV 1).

PD 20 FEV 1 was attenuated by a mean of 2. 5 fold after terfenadine (geometric mean PD 20 FEV 1 was 22 litres after placebo and 56 l after terfenadine). There was substantial intersubject variation in the inhibitory effect of terfenadine on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction: the ratio of the PD 20 hypertonic saline after terfenadine to that after placebo ranged from 0. 9 to 10. 0.

We then contrasted the phylogenetic signal present in each tooth shape with an exome-wide phylogeny from 10 extant equine species. We estimated the strength of the phylogenetic signal using a Brownian motion model of evolution with multivariate K statistic, and mapped the dental shape along the molecular phylogeny using an approach based on squared-change parsimony. We found clear evidence for the relevance of dental phenotypes to accurately discriminate all modern members of the genus Equus and capture their phylogenetic relationships. These results are valuable for both palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists exploring the spatial and temporal dynamics of the evolutionary history of the horse family, up to the latest domestication trajectories of horses and donkeys...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe NADP-reducing {{hydrogenase}} complex from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans is a heterotetramer encoded by the hndABCD operon. Sequence analysis {{indicates that}} the HndC subunit (52 kDa) corresponds to the NADP-reducing unit, and the HndD subunit (63. 5 kDa) is homologous to Clostridium pasteurianum hydrogenase. The role of HndA and HndB subunits (18. 8 kDa and 13. 8 kDa, respectively) in the complex remains unknown. The HndA subunit belongs to the [2 Fe- 2 S] ferredoxin family typified by C. pasteurianum ferredoxin. HndA is organized into two independent structural domains, and we report in the present work the NMR structure of its C-terminal domain, HndAc. HndAc has a thioredoxin-like <b>fold</b> consisting <b>in</b> <b>four</b> beta-strands and two relatively long helices. The [2 Fe- 2 S] cluster is located near {{the surface of the}} protein and bound to four cysteine residues particularly well conserved in this class of proteins. Electron exchange between the HndD N-terminal [2 Fe- 2 S] domain (HndDN) and HndAc has been previously evidenced, and in the present studies we have mapped the binding site of the HndDN domain on HndAc. A structural analysis of HndB indicates that it is a FeS subunit with 41 % similarity with HndAc and it contains a possible thioredoxin-like fold. Our data let us propose that HndAc and HndB can form a heterodimeric intermediate in the electron transfer between the hydrogenase (HndD) active site and the NADP reduction site in HndC...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} of ITS 2 processing, a eukaryotic insertion between the 5. 8 S and LSU rRNA, remain largely elusive even in yeast. To delineate ITS 2 structural and functional features {{which could be}} common to eukaryotes, we first produced phylo-genetically supported <b>folding</b> models <b>in</b> the vertebrate lineage, then tested them in deeper branchings and, more particularly, among yeasts. ITS 2 comparisons between four Teleostei, a Chondrichthyes specimen and two jawless organisms have revealed a common <b>folding</b> architecture <b>in</b> <b>four</b> to five domains of secondary structure emerging from a preserved structural core. This folding, largely reminiscent of ITS 2 architecture in mammals, is also preserved in amphibia and in chicken, despite dramatic sequence variations. Preferential conservation is located around a central loop and {{at the apex of}} a long stem in the ITS 2 3 '-half. Interestingly, these two independent structural features contain, respectively, the 3 '-ends of the two transient rRNA precursors 8 S and 12 S RNA identified in mammals, suggesting a preservation of these intermediates of processing over the entire vertebrate group. Surprising similarities between the vertebrate ITS 2 folding shape and that of invertebrates as well as protista have made intriguing the significant differences from the yeast model. A detailed comparative analysis including four relatively close species and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a deep yeast branching, has revealed an alternative phylogenetically supported four-domain folding presenting strong similarities to the vertebrate model. Remarkably, the two best conserved regions of vertebrates have unambiguously preserved counterparts which are also sites for internal processing in yeast. Therefore, molecular mechanisms involved in ITS 2 excision in vertebrates and yeast might be more closely related than currently believed and might require a very similar trans -acting machinery...|$|R
