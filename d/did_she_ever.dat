5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She {{was never able to}} walk, nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
500|$|... "Some Girls" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. PopMatters included {{it in its}} [...] "Best Music of 2004" [...] selection, where Adrien Begrand commented that [...] "Stevens might have no singing voice to speak of, but <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> score a slice of pop genius with her single 'Some Girls', on which the ever-crafty Richard X brazenly hijacks a contagious German schaffel beat and tarts {{it up with a}} killer hook in the chorus that never, ever leaves your head". In his review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis referred to the song as [...] "remarkable" [...] for turning Stevens' detached vocal delivery into a strength.|$|E
500|$|While Wollstonecraft's {{arguments}} in The Wrongs of Woman may appear commonplace {{in light of}} modern feminism, they were [...] "breathtakingly audacious" [...] during the late eighteenth century: [...] "Wollstonecraft's final novel made explosively plain what the Rights of Woman had only partially intimated: that women's entitlements — as citizens, mothers, and sexual beings — are incompatible with a patriarchal marriage system." [...] However, while The Wrongs of Woman is now read as the progenitor of many feminist texts and the inspiration for many feminist arguments and rhetorical styles (e.g., the personal confession), Wollstonecraft herself {{was not part of}} a feminist movement nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> argue for one. Although The Wrongs of Woman presents [...] "woman" [...] as [...] "wronged", neither Wollstonecraft nor any other British woman who highlighted the inequalities suffered by women at the time (such as Mary Hays or Mary Robinson) ever put forth a collective solution. As part of the Enlightenment, they were dedicated to individualistic solutions.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘I saw her,’ {{he went on}} to say, not answering, but {{engaged in}} the same slow pursuit of his own thoughts. ‘There she stood: trembling! “How <b>does</b> <b>she</b> look, Richard? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> speak of me? Is she thinner? My old place at the table: what’s in my old place? And the frame she taught me our old work on—has she burnt it, Richard!” There she was. I heard her say it.’ ...|$|R
2500|$|From {{the early}} days of her career, Garbo avoided {{industry}} social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating [...] "as early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, don't like many people." ...|$|E

50|$|Distracted by {{the letter}} and her desire to send the letter to God, she misses her school bus. She is {{disappointed}} and now has a whole day {{to think about what}} to do with the letter. She meets a Muslim mullah, a Buddhist monk and a Church pastor. They all fail to give her God's address. Her patience gives away. She breaks into crying. And then, the story reaches its climax. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> deliver her letter to God? To find out about this, you need to watch the film.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to say whether this name recalls anything to her. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> think of the past? I have seen her hanging over the boy's cot in a very passion of maternal tenderness. The little fellow was lying on his back, a little frightened at me, but very still, with his big black eyes, with his fluttered air of a bird in a snare. And looking at him I seemed to see again the other one--the father, cast out mysteriously by the sea to perish in the supreme disaster of loneliness and despair." ...|$|R

5000|$|... (Minamito Yui) Once a {{neighbor}} and childhood friend of Junpei before moving away, Yui acts {{more like a}} sister than a friend despite being only a year younger. She isn't at all shy around Junpei and is often found sleeping in his bed naked. Though {{considered one of the}} four main heroines in the series, Yui is never considered a love interest nor <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> show Junpei any affection outside of their sibling-type relationship, although she acts at times like an overprotective big sister (especially when Satsuki gets unusually clingy), because Junpei was a crybaby in their childhood days.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} Cornelia, now, for the advice he had asked, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not speak, {{and he had}} to say: [...] "But I don't know whether she likes it or not. Do you know whether <b>she</b> <b>does?</b> Has <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> spoken of it to you? Of course she's said civil things to me about it. I beg your pardon! I suppose you don't care to tell, and I had no right to inquire." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{death of}} Prince Henry in 1612 {{at the age}} of eighteen, {{probably}} from typhoid, and the departure for Heidelberg of the sixteen-year-old Princess Elizabeth in April 1613, after marrying Elector Frederick V of the Palatine, further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James. Henry's death hit Anne particularly hard; the Venetian ambassador was advised not to offer condolences to her [...] "because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> recall it without abundant tears and sighs". From this time forward, Anne's health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known masque in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court. Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.|$|R

60|$|He was a mild, handsome, sensible, {{friendly}} old man, astonishingly ignorant. His wife, {{who was not}} so pleasant in her manners, {{knew how}} to read, although I <b>do</b> not suppose <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> so. <b>She</b> had a share of brains and spoke with a cutting emphasis, like one who ruled the roast.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Littlepage, {{you are not}} {{conscious}} of your importance in your own family, I see. I know it better than you appear to know it yourself. Father, mother, grandmother, and sister, all think and speak of Mordaunt alike. To hear the general converse of the war, you would suppose that he had commanded a company, and Captain Littlepage the regiment. Mr. Littlepage defers to Mordaunt's taste, and Mordaunt's opinions, and Mordaunt's judgment, even in housekeeping and hemstitching. Kate is forever saying, 'my brother says this,' 'my brother writes that,' 'my brother does t'other;' {{and as for the}} old lady here at the 'Toe,' she would hardly think her peaches and cherries could ripen, unless Mordaunt Littlepage, the son of her son Corny Littlepage--by no accident <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> call him 'general,'--were {{on the face of the}} earth to create an eternal sunshine!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Adams's {{place in}} late-twentieth-century American {{literature}} has been earned, writes Christine C. Ferguson, [...] "not {{only by the}} skill and deftness of her prose, but also by her challenge to hackneyed dismissal of love's redemptive possibilities. She presents {{a world where the}} potential for smart and independent women to have their cake and eat it, too, to enjoy professional and romantic success, stubbornly persists even if not often realized. No romanticist, Adams never flinches from describing all the vagaries and disappointments that afflict sexual and platonic relationships, but neither <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> permit these descriptions to produce a sense of crushing pessimism." [...] Reviewers described her work as [...] "fusing the sensibilities of Jane Austen and Mary McCarthy." [...] She received numerous awards, including the O. Henry Lifetime Achievement Award and Best American Short Stories Award. Her stories have frequently been anthologized, including in 22 O. Henry Awards collections.|$|R
60|$|This is that {{consolation}} {{des arts}} {{which is the}} keynote of Gautier's poetry, the secret of modern life foreshadowed--as indeed what in our century is not?--by Goethe.

The courage to give yourselves up to your impressions: yes, that is the secret of the artistic life--for while art has been defined as an escape from the tyranny of the senses, it is an escape rather from the tyranny of the soul.
