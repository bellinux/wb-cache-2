One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy. The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dream</b> speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.|$|E

25|$|On April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew {{announced}} that the $5, $10, and $20 would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. The changes would add new features to combat counterfeiting and make them easier for blind citizens to distinguish. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the obverse, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from the Martin Luther King, Jr. <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dream</b> speech and the 1939 concert by opera singer Marian Anderson.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, {{she came}} under {{criticism}} by Hosea Williams, {{one of her}} husband's earliest followers, for having used the King Center to promote [...] "authentic material" [...] on her husband's dreams and ideals, and disqualified the merchandise {{as an attempt to}} exploit her husband. She sanctioned the kit, which contained a wall poster, five photographs of King and his family, a cassette of the <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dream</b> speech, a booklet of tips on how to celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and five postcards with quotations from King himself. She believed it to be the authentic way to celebrate the holiday honoring her husband, and denied Hosea's claims.|$|E

2500|$|Shachtman's {{youthful}} followers {{were able}} to bring new vigor into the Party, and Shachtman encouraged them to take positions of responsibility and leadership. As a young leader, Harrington sent Kahn and Horowitz to help Bayard Rustin with the American Civil Rights Movement. Rustin had helped to spread pacificism and non-violence to leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, like Martin Luther King. Kahn and Horowitz quickly became close assistants of Rustin. The civil rights movement benefited from intelligence and analysis of Shachtman and increasingly of Kahn. Rustin and his young aides, dubbed [...] "The Bayard Rustin Marching and Chowder Society" [...] by Harrington, organized many protest activities. The young socialists helped Rustin and A. Philip Randolph organize the 1963 March on Washington, where Martin Luther King delivered his <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>A</b> <b>Dream</b> speech.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1900s, nigger {{had become}} a pejorative word in the United States. In its stead, the term colored became the {{mainstream}} alternative to negro and its derived terms. After the Civil Rights Movement, the terms colored and negro gave way to [...] "black". Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans {{at a time when}} black was considered more offensive. This term was accepted as normal, including by people classified as Negroes, until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. of his own race as [...] "Negro" [...] in his famous speech of 1963, <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dream.</b> During the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse. Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro, but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam.|$|E
2500|$|One of Shure's most {{visually}} iconic microphone {{series is}} the Unidyne series, seen in use by {{heads of state}} and popular recording artists and performers from the 1940s {{through the end of}} the twentieth century, including President John F. Kennedy, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. The Model 55 Unidyne is pictured with Harry S. Truman in the famous photograph where he is holding the Chicago Tribune newspaper with the erroneous front page headline [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman." [...] It is also pictured in front of Fidel Castro on the cover of the January 19, 1959 issue of Life magazine and in front of Martin Luther King, Jr. delivering of his <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dream</b> speech during the 1963 March on Washington. The original Shure 55 Unidyne microphone was designed by engineer Ben Bauer and first produced in 1939. Shure designed the 55 Unidyne as a rugged public address microphone with good audio performance. It was notable for its single-element, unidirectional design, which was smaller, less susceptible to feedback, and less sensitive to ambient noise than other microphones of the time. Several variants of the original Unidyne have been produced, most notably the 55S or [...] "Baby Unidyne." [...] The 55S is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Elvis mic" [...] due to its frequent use by Elvis Presley, and is the microphone depicted with Elvis on the commemorative first-class Elvis stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service in 1993. In 2008, the Unidyne Model 55 microphone was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, and the following year, Shure released the 55SH Series II. A supercardioid version, the Super 55 Deluxe Vocal Microphone, was introduced in 2009, featuring high gain before feedback and excellent off-axis rejection and further extending Unidyne's 70-plus year legacy. The 55 Series microphones were given the [...] "IEEE Milestone" [...] award in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|Brian Johnson <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} with Marcus Hathcock, {{the editor-in-chief of}} NewReleaseToday. When Hathcock questioned him about how the album's title and the imagery of the album cover came about, he responded saying:I didn't arrive at it, actually. Some of our team members did. Actually <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> though. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> about turning tides. A lot of it, though, {{has to do with}} the season we're in. There's been a lot of coming, a lot of going with people—a totally different, shifting kind of season. I guess that's the creative way of saying what that season was. We had the idea last-minute to take the whole team to the coast and do the photo shoot at the water. - Brian Johnson, NewReleaseToday ...|$|R

But were my need for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell you. It is not boasting. I measure the results by the books. Your brothers, to-day, are ignorant barbarians compared with me and the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were sleeping. Long ago I wanted to be famous.

60|$|A word of moral: {{it appears}} that B. Pollock, late J. Redington, No. 73 Hoxton Street, not only publishes twenty-three of these old stage favourites, but owns the {{necessary}} plates and displays a modest readiness to issue other thirty-three. If you love art, folly, or the bright eyes of children, speed to Pollock's or to Clarke's of Garrick Street. In Pollock's list of publicanda I perceive a pair of my ancient aspirations: The Wreck Ashore and Sixteen-String Jack; and I cherish the belief that when these shall see once more the light of day, B. Pollock will remember this apologist. But, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> at times that is not all a dream. I seem to myself to wander in a ghostly street--E.W., I think, the postal district--close below the fool's cap of St. Paul's, and yet within easy hearing of the echo of the Abbey Bridge. There in a dim shop, low in the roof and smelling strong of glue and footlights, I find myself in quaking treaty with great Skelt himself, the aboriginal, all dusty from the tomb. I buy, with what a choking heart--I buy them all, all but the pantomimes; I pay my mental money, and go forth; and lo! the packets are dust.|$|E
6000|$|Venice {{continues}} adorable and the Curtises {{the soul}} of benevolence. Their upstairs apartment (empty and still unoffered--at forty pounds a year--to any one but me) beckons me so, as a foot-on-the-water here, that if my dramatic ship had begun to come in, I should probably be tempted to take it at a venture--for all it would matter. But for the present I resist perfectly--especially as Venice isn't all advantageous. The great charm of such an idea is the having, in Italy, a little cheap and private refuge independent of hotels etc., which every year grow more disagreeable and German and tiresome to face--not to say dearer too. But it won't be for this year--and the Curtises won't let it. What Pen Browning has done here ... with the splendid Palazzo Rezzonico, transcends description for the beauty, and, as Ruskin would say, [...] "wisdom and rightness" [...] of it. It is altogether royal and imperial--but [...] "Pen" [...] isn't kingly and the train de vie remains to be seen. Gondoliers ushering in friends from pensions won't fill it out.... I am thinking, after all, of joining the Curtises in the evidently most beautiful drive (of upwards of a week, with rests) they are starting upon on the 14th, from a place called Vittorio, in the Venetian Alps, two hours rail from here, through Cadore, Titian's country, the Dolomites etc., toward Oberammergau. They offer me pressingly the fourth seat in the carriage that awaits them when they leave the train--and also an extra ticket they have taken for the play at Oberammergau, if I choose to go so far. This I shall scarcely do, but I shall probably leave with them, drive 4 or 5 days and come back, via Verona, by rail--leaving my luggage here. Continue to address here--unless, before that, I give you one other address while I am gone. I shall find all letters here, on my return, if I do go, in the keeping of the excellent maestro di casa--the Venetian Smith. I should be back, at the latest, by the 25th--probably by the 20th. In this case I shall presumably go back to Florence to spend 4 or 5 days with Baldwin (going to Siena or Perugia;) after which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> of going to Vallombrosa (nearly 4000 feet above the sea--but of a softness!) for 2 or 3 weeks--till I have to leave Italy on my way home. I am writing to Edith Peruzzi, who has got a summer-lodge there, and is already there, {{for information about the}} inn. If I don't go there I shall perhaps try Camaldoli or San Marcello--all high in the violet Apennines, within 3 or 4 hours, and mainly by a little carriage, of Florence. But I want to compass Vallombrosa, which I have never seen and have always dreamed of and which I am assured is divine--infinitely salubrious and softly cool. The idea of lingering in Italy a few weeks longer on these terms is very delightful to me--it does me, as yet, nothing but good. But I shall see. I put B.'s letter in another envelope. I rejoiced in your eight gallops; they may be the dozen now.|$|E
