2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{thousands}} of teeth analyzed, published in the November 24, 1961, issue of the journal Science, revealed elevated levels of radioactive compounds in the first sets of teeth that had been collected. President John F. Kennedy was made aware of the research results while he was negotiating a treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union to place controls on nuclear testing. His call to the Reiss home was answered by her son; the person on the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> said, [...] "This is John Kennedy, can I talk to your mom?" [...] Further analysis by the team led to the conclusion that children born in 1963 had absorbed levels of strontium-90 that were 50 times higher than those found in children born a decade earlier. Her husband, Eric Reiss, testified before the United States Senate when it was considering ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Later research showed that levels of strontium-90 in the cohort born in 1968, after the treaty had gone into effect, had declined by 50 percent.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Frederick {{shut the}} {{restaurant}} and put it up for auction. Bernard and Lester Magrill, local auctioneers and frequent patrons, conducted the auction. Sol Forman, who owned a metal giftware factory across the street, bought it for [...] "a whimsically low bid". According to Lester Magrill, the purchase price was $35,000, which included the building {{as well as the}} restaurant. According to one history, [...] "the neighborhood was declining, filling up with Hasidic Jews, whose kosher rules forbade the eating of Luger's hindquarters. Forman had been eating at Luger for twenty-five years, and he needed a place to take his clients. He was the only bidder during the auction. The purchase cemented the friendship between the Magrills and Formans and Lester frequented the restaurant almost five days a week for sixty years. Legend has it that Lester visited the Great Neck restaurant one evening and when mistreated by the Maitre'd, he asked to use the house phone. He turned to the offending host and stated, 'It's for you'. On the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> an irate Sol Forman fired the offending host on the spot and Magrill was immediately seated. A rave from über-critic Craig Claiborne in The New York Times was proof that Forman had kept the Luger faith—and the four-star review generated a new legion of the faithful." ...|$|E

50|$|Designers of secure systems often {{forget to}} take {{information}} leakage into account. A {{classic example of}} this is when the French government designed a mechanism to aid encrypted communications over an analog line, such as at a phone booth. It was a device that clamped onto both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> performed <b>the</b> encrypting operations, and sent the signals over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line. Unfortunately for the French, the rubber seal that attached the device to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> was not airtight. It was later discovered that although the encryption itself was solid, if heard carefully, one could hear the speaker, since <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> was picking up some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech. Information leakage can subtly or completely destroy <b>the</b> security <b>of</b> an otherwise secure system.|$|R

When plugged in, they configure themselves based on the customer's geographic areas and the services he or she is subscribed for. If the user moves location, the dialler reconfigures itself.

5000|$|For WFAN, Somers {{has been}} a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station since its {{inception}} in 1987. He spent his first few years with the station as the overnight host.

25|$|Stage 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series {{took place}} in a {{conventional}} TV studio.

Later the same evening a live show followed in which the voting results were revealed, the top two earning a place in the final ten. In series 2, a wildcard round (an innovation that originated on American Idol) was added, in which the judges selected ten rejected contestants and gave them a second chance. In this special edition, one contestant, Susanne Manning, was selected by the viewer vote, and one, Sam Nixon, was chosen by the judges. This meant that the next stage began with twelve contestants, rather than the ten in series 1.|$|R
30|$|The STD {{subsystem}} {{employs a}} term detector to output putative detections from <b>the</b> 1 -best <b>phone</b> sequence and a fusion-based decision maker to ascertain reliable detections. For term detection, <b>the</b> 1 -best <b>phone</b> sequence {{is used as}} source text for an edit distance search. In the search, each detection could be any substring which has a phone edit distance with <b>the</b> search term <b>of</b> less than 50 % of its length. Start and <b>end</b> times <b>of</b> each detection are assigned <b>the</b> start time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>phone</b> that is correctly recognized in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> substring and <b>the</b> <b>end</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>phone</b> that is correctly recognized in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> substring. Detections that overlap in time are removed by keeping the best one (i.e., {{the one with the}} minimum edit distance). Once all the detections have been obtained, two different scores are assigned to each: one derived from the edit distance computed during term search, and an acoustic confidence measure obtained from the lattice. The former is computed from standard substitution, insertion, and deletion errors in <b>the</b> 1 -best <b>phone</b> sequence and normalized by <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term. To obtain the acoustic confidence measure, the following steps are conducted: (1) the lattice is determinized with HTK tool [83], (2) an acoustic mesh graph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> lattice is obtained using <b>the</b> lattice tool <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SRI-LM toolkit [127], and (3) the confidence calculated in the acoustic mesh graph is used in a modified edit distance algorithm where, instead of all costs equal to 1, <b>the</b> confidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matching <b>phones</b> (those that are correctly recognized in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> lattice) with <b>the</b> search term are accumulated. Then, <b>the</b> score <b>of</b> a detection is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confidences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matching <b>phones</b> through <b>the</b> acoustic mesh <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search term between the time limits where the detection resides. This score is also normalized by <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term. The decision maker fuses these two scores with the Bosaris toolkit, produces the final confidence score for each detection, and ascertains reliable detections.|$|R

40|$|Smart Phone Ecosystems {{revolve around}} developers, {{applications}} and users. One of Nokia's own platforms, the S 40, targets <b>the</b> low <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smart <b>phone</b> market. Nokia's Content & Ecosystem Sourcing group is constantly {{looking for ways}} to help its developers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S 40 platform create more successful applications. This paper attempts to do so by examining the different monetization approaches for different application categories across all regions. While paid applications still constitute a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revenue generating applications, the S 40 marketplace has experienced a significant increase in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> Try & Buy and In-App-Purchase applications in recent years. Try & Buy has been proven to be a dominant force in gaming categories, albeit with some differences across the regions. In-App- Purchase has also shown promise within games and some other categories, but <b>the</b> acceptance <b>of</b> this monetization approach varies greatly by region. Two new metrics, Revenue per Product View and Downloads per Product View, are proposed to evaluate application performance independent of download volume and monetization approach. Utilizing these new metrics, we found the applications utilize the Try & Buy approach to perform equally as well, if not better than, the applications utilizing the paid approach. The new metrics will enable the group to track <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> applications from a holistic perspective and more easily identify those developers who have created successful applications. Additionally, the Downloads per Product View metric enables tracking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applications, an indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall ecosystem. The specific knowledge will enable Nokia's Content & Ecosystem Sourcing group to provide more input to developers on monetization approaches during <b>the</b> early stages <b>of</b> development, thereby increasing their chances of launching successful applications, ultimately helping the entire S 40 ecosystem. by Chengran Chai.
