5|$|French women {{welcomed the}} design but the Catholic Church, some media, and a {{majority}} of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant wore them in 1951, but the bikini was then banned from the competition. Actress Brigitte Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses, including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, also gathered press attention when they wore bikinis. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated, giving it additional legitimacy. Ursula Andress made a <b>huge</b> <b>impact</b> when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962). The deer skin bikini Raquel Welch wore in the film One Million Years B.C. (1966) turned her into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s.|$|E

During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands all of whom would have a <b>huge</b> <b>impact</b> on McKellen's future career.|$|E
5|$|When Turkey {{decided to}} join in the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy), the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V. Reshad (1844–1918) {{declared}} a jihad against the Allied Powers (Britain, France and Russia) and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims all around the world to throw their lot with the Caliphate. This move had a <b>huge</b> <b>impact</b> on Muslims throughout the world as the Ottoman Sultan was revered as the Caliph of Islam and long considered by Indian Muslims as the final bulwark of Muslim power following the collapse of the Moghul empire in India. Overnight, Muslims serving under the British Army, such as the sepoys, faced an existential dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah (community, brotherhood) and their British colonial superiors.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} have a <b>huge</b> <b>impact</b> on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes {{that can be}} used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Retroverted {{impacted}} adenomyosis {{may cause}} progressive lower urinary bladder compression, resulting in bladder outflow obstruction and lower urinary tract symptoms. We report {{a case of}} a <b>huge</b> <b>impacted</b> adenomyosis in which the pathogenesis of bladder outflow obstruction was explored using three-dimensional sonography and was clearly shown to be different from that of pelvic-organ prolapse. The pathogenesis of urinary retention is described and discussed. Case Report: A 43 -year-old patient was admitted for acute urinary retention and a <b>huge</b> <b>impacted</b> retroverted uterus with adenomyosis. Sonographic study revealed that the lower urinary bladder was compressed by the cervix, which was upwardly and forwardly displaced. Three-dimensional sonography more clearly identified the bladder neck and adjacent tissue. Conclusion: Sonography is helpful in exploring the anatomic nature of bladder outflow obstruction resulting from retroverted impacted adenomyosis. In this case, the urethra was neither distorted nor compressed, quite different from cases with pelvic organ prolapse. These two types of bladder outflow obstruction are not distinguishable using traditional urodynamic study. Three-dimensional sonography is more helpful in identification of the compressed reshaped lower urinary bladder and its adjacent anatomic structures, even without urine in the low bladder cavity as contrast...|$|R
