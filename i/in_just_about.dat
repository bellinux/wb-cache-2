John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E

500|$|Mother {{received}} a [...] "Silver Hall of Fame" [...] score of 31/40 from Japanese reviewer Weekly Famitsu. Critics noted the game's similarities with the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous [...] "parody" [...] of the genre's tropes. They thought the game's sequel, EarthBound, {{to be very}} similar and a better implementation of Mother gameplay ideas, overall. Reviewers also noted the game's high difficulty level and balance issues. Mother sold 150,000 copies. USgamer Jeremy Parish said that Mother script was [...] "as sharp as EarthBound", but felt that the original's game mechanics were subpar, lacking the [...] "rolling HP counter" [...] and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish wrote earlier for 1UP.com that in comparison to EarthBound, Mother is [...] "worse <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every way", and important less for its actual game and more for the interest it generated in video game emulation and the preservation of unreleased games.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the series}} {{never had a}} high viewership, it was met with {{critical}} acclaim and has a strong fan-base. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season received a score of 78 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Virginia Heffernan wrote for The New York Times that [...] "if the season is anything like the pilot, this new drama about high school football could be great – and not just television great, but great {{in the way of}} a poem or painting." [...] The Washington Post similarly praised the series as [...] "extraordinary <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every conceivable way." [...] Bill Simmons, a former columnist for ESPN Magazine implored readers of his column in the September 24, 2007 issue to watch the show, calling it [...] "the greatest sports-related show ever made." [...] Positive reviews also came from USA Today, the San Francisco Chronicle, and international sources, with The Guardians Jonathan Bernstien calling the pilot [...] "beautifully shot" [...] and the Metro awarding it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|While Parish said Mother {{script was}} [...] "as sharp as EarthBound", {{he felt that}} the original's game {{mechanics}} did not meet the same level of quality. Mother lacked the [...] "rolling HP counter" [...] and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish also found the game's balance to be uneven, as the statistical character attributes and level of difficulty scaled incorrectly with the game's progression. Rose Colored Gaming, a company that made custom reproductions of the NES cartridge, noted that the Japanese release's was more challenging than the unreleased English localization. RPGamer Ramos similarly found balance issues, with a high amount of battles, difficult enemies, reliance on grinding, and some oversized levels. Parish wrote earlier for 1UP.com that in comparison to EarthBound, Mother is [...] "worse <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every way", a clone where its sequel was [...] "a satirical deconstruction of RPGs". He wrote that the game's historical significance is not for its actual game but for the interest it generated in video game emulation and the preservation of unreleased games.|$|E

500|$|Henry Goldblatt, {{writing for}} Entertainment Weekly, gave the episode a grade B. He accused {{the show of}} abandoning the [...] "racial {{diversity}} and the gritty poverty" [...] of the film, but still allowed that Peter Berg had [...] "kept the thrust". The Matt Saracen character was singled out as particularly promising. While positively contrasting the show with other teen-age dramas like One Tree Hill, Goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power. Varietys Brian Lowry called the show [...] "Earnest, beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious {{than anything else in}} primetime". Still, he felt the show was [...] "like one of those family programs middle America and conservatives pine for that too few of them actually bother to watch". He pointed out that the show had to compete with both House and Dancing With the Stars, among women as well as men, in order to survive. The Washington Post critic Tom Shales called the show [...] "Extraordinary <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every conceivable way," [...] particularly emphasising the quality of the cast. Shales did have issues with the documentary style of show's camera movements, but still thought it could be the [...] "best new drama series of the season".|$|E
500|$|Staci Krause of IGN had a {{positive}} outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc. She described the storylines involving the cancer patient's intoxication and Ellis' lucidity as achieving a balance, and moving the show [...] "at a lightning quick pace". Krause deemed the episode [...] "stellar", noting how it avoided the possibility of having negative points. Regarding the episode an [...] "epic" [...] one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood. [...] "This is what we come to expect from medical dramas and it is great to see Grey's get back to this, while not sacrificing the personal stories", stated Krause, putting the emphasis on how [...] "this case brought out the hore <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everyone, pushing their limits for a patient". Krause noted that O'Malley has developed into a hero, stating that [...] "pulling {{all the people in}} the operating room out, even though he was already sick and could have easily died from the effort" [...] in a comparison to Sloan, described as being a man with no appealing traits and [...] "unlikable ways", which attracted criticism from Krause.|$|E
500|$|Based on 73 reviews {{collected}} by Rotten Tomatoes, Halloween II has an overall 19% approval rating from critics, {{with an average}} score of 3.7 out of 10, with the general consensus reading [...] "Zombie shows flashes of vision in the follow-up to his Halloween reboot, but they're smothered by mountains of gore and hackneyed, brutal violence." [...] Rob Nelson, of Variety, felt the use of Deborah and the white horse {{was nothing more than}} [...] "silly", and he disagreed with Zombie's choice to film Halloween II in 16mm film, as opposed to wider format of 35mm that he used on his 2007 remake. Nelson also stated that the hospital scene {{was nothing more than a}} [...] "butcher"-version of Carpenter's 1981 sequel, with the rest of the film feeling like it was rushed and [...] "slapped together" [...] at the last minute. In contrast, Time Out believed the hospital scene at the start of the film [...] " [...] <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every respect". Time Out stated that Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode showed an [...] "intense, nontrivializing dedication to the role" [...] that kept interest, while the storyline of Dr. Loomis's egocentricity hinders the overall storyline. Time Out also said that Zombie hurt the film by trying to show how [...] "violence lingers with, and perverts, all who are touched by it", but then undercutting himself with [...] "carnivalesque" [...] violence. Although the New York Posts Kyle Smith did not believe the character of Laurie Strode was a balance for Michael Myers or Dr. Loomis, he agreed the ghostly images of Deborah Myers were a [...] "relief from the blood-streaked brutality" [...] of Michael's murders.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} well {{received}} amongst critics, especially {{in regards to}} the episodes with Kevin Smith and the storylines on oral sex and the school shooting.

The Boston Herald said [...] "it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi: The Next Generation as [...] "the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre". Another comparison was made between Degrassi: The Next Generation and The O.C., saying [...] "The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life", while the events in the two-part episode [...] "Voices Carry" [...] with [...] "hotel room trashing, projectile launching, fist fighting at weddings bi-polar loon Craig , was like an actual scene from my actual teenage life and just like me, Ashley thinks they're going to pull through it together". AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for [...] "not only focusing on gay teens, but it showcases gay sex, and relationships.

[...] Ben Neihart called Degrassi: The Next Generation [...] "tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!" [...] (the best teen TV in the world) in a six-page article in The New York Times.
