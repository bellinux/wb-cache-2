Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with dowel pins.|$|E
25|$|If it {{is found}} that the {{starting}} position of the pieces is incorrect, the game must be cancelled and restarted.

If a player <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> second illegal move in the same game, the arbiter shall declare the game lost by the offending player. If a game begins with the piece colors reversed, the game should be stopped and restarted unless an arbiter rules otherwise. If a player displaces any pieces, they should place them in the correct locations on their own time.|$|E

25|$|Determining {{the spatial}} {{lightning}} distribution from Schumann resonance records {{is a complex}} problem: in order to estimate the lightning intensity from Schumann resonance records {{it is necessary to}} account for both the distance to lightning sources and the wave propagation between the source and the observer. A common approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> preliminary assumption on the spatial lightning distribution, based on the known properties of lightning climatology. An alternative approach is placing the receiver at the North or South Pole, which remain approximately equidistant from the main thunderstorm centers during the day. One method not requiring preliminary assumptions on the lightning distribution is based on the decomposition of the average background Schumann resonance spectra, utilizing ratios between the average electric and magnetic spectra and between their linear combination. This technique assumes the cavity is spherically symmetric and therefore does not include known cavity asymmetries that are believed to affect the resonance and propagation properties of electromagnetic waves in the system.|$|E

But mostly, my children and my wife, who often had to endure my absence for long periods of time. This is not just for me, but for everyone involved in my career,” Morales said.< As reported on April 25, 2013 by badlefthook.com, Morales plans to fight two times in 2013 in July and November.

25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} {{separability}} of a stochastic process {{was introduced by}} Joseph Doob, where the underlying idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> countable set of points of the index set determine {{the properties of the}} stochastic process. [...] Any stochastic process with a countable index set already meets the separability conditions, so discrete-time stochastic processes are always separable. A theorem by Doob, sometimes known as Doob's separability theorem, says that any real-valued continuous-time stochastic process has a separable modification. Versions of this theorem also exist for more general stochastic processes with index sets and state spaces other than the real line.|$|E
500|$|The war film genre is not {{necessarily}} tightly defined: the American Film Institute, for example, speaks of [...] "films {{to grapple with the}} Great War" [...] without attempting to classify these. However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that [...] "a war film’s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> viewer feel war." [...] John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.|$|E
