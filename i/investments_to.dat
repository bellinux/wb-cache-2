40|$|Public {{and private}} {{investment}} {{and economic growth}} in Zambia: A dynamic approachThis paper investigates the dynamic contributions {{of public and private}} <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> economic growth in Zambia during the period from 1970 to 2014. In the analysis, the paper also estimated the important indirect contribution of public <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> economic growth through its crowding effect on private investment. The study employs the newly proposed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) -bounds testing approach in estimating the economic growth and private investment models. The empirical evidence from the study shows that private <b>investment</b> contributes more <b>to</b> economic growth than public investment in Zambia in the short run and the long run. In addition, gross public investment, infrastructural and non-infrastructural public <b>investment</b> were found <b>to</b> crowd out private investment in the short run; while non-infrastructural public investment also had a crowding out effect on private investment in the long run. The results imply that the long-run contributions of both private and public <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> economic growth in Zambia can be improved by raising the infrastructural public <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> a threshold level that stimulates private investment growth while reducing non-infrastructural public <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> the basic minimum level.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{estimates}} {{the long run}} private investment function for the period from 1972 to 2011 by using Johansen cointegration approach. The results suggest debt servicing, inflation and private <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> be negatively associated. The study concludes positive impact of GDP growth rate, foreign direct investment, and exchange rate on private investment in Pakistan. The Wald (χ 2) Statistics show that GDP, FDI and exchange rate Granger cause private investment. The significance of coefficient of the error correction term confirms the long run causality between explanatory variables and private investment. The pair-wise Granger causality concludes unidirectional causality from private <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> GDP growth, from private <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> foreign direct <b>investment,</b> inflation rate <b>to</b> private <b>investment</b> and from private <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> exchange rate but causality test confirms bidirectional causality between debt servicing and private investment.

The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery, and of slowly clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of skilled workers in Jordan {{is among the}} highest in the region in sectors such as ICT and industry, due to a relatively modern educational system. This has attracted large foreign <b>investments</b> <b>to</b> Jordan and has enabled the country to export its workforce to Persian Gulf countries. Flows of remittances to Jordan grew rapidly, particularly during the end of the 1970s and 1980s, and remains an important source of external funding. Remittances from Jordanian expatriates were $3.8 billion in 2015, a notable rise in the amount of transfers compared to 2014 where remittances reached over $3.66 billion listing Jordan as fourth largest recipient in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and <b>investments</b> <b>to</b> noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E

5|$|In November 1970, the Dovre Line was electrified, and {{the last}} steam {{locomotives}} were retired. A long-term plan to electrify half the lines was finished, and for two decades, NSB's operations were very stable with no major <b>investments</b> <b>to</b> infrastructure or closing of lines. NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed, but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled. In 1981, NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units. They were mainly used on the Nordland Line, and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the other lines, although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line. On 1 April 1987, a Di 3 612 caught on fire; the damage was small enough {{that it could have}} been repaired, but NSB instead decided to put aside the unit. At the time NSB planned to order additional Di 4, but these plans were put on hold. In 1988, the Valdres Line was closed; this was the only time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{expansion}} northwards from the city center to Åsane involve either building the system to replace many of the local buses operating in Sandviken, or make the light rail line an express service. If the latter is chosen, the line will bypass Bryggen in a tunnel and make few stops before Åsane. An important stop mid-way is the Norwegian School of Economics. The terminus will probably be Åsane Senter or Nyborg; the former shopping center has set aside areas for a station. At Åsane, a major bus terminal would allow connections to the northern parts of Bergen, suburbs further north and areas in Nordhordland. An important political argument for prioritizing this line is to spread out the <b>investments</b> <b>to</b> {{all parts of the}} city, since the line is being financed by taxpayers and car-users throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{the airport}} area as a {{civilian}} airport was launched by Varangfly director Odd Bentzen in 1964. After visiting Iceland he proposed a series of short and simple airports in Finnmark which could serve the airline's air ambulance service. A different proposal was launched in 1966 by several of the larger airlines, including Scandinavian Airlines System, Braathens SAFE and Widerøe, to establish a network of short take-off and landing airports in rural areas; Berlevåg was one of six original proposals for Finnmark. A county committee was established in 1966 to look into building small airfields in Finnmark, including Berlevåg. In the following years the municipality made <b>investments</b> <b>to</b> allow the airfield {{to be used for}} air ambulance services. Part of the motivation was Berlevåg's poor port conditions, which often forced seaplanes to land at Kongsfjord.|$|E

5|$|Several local {{politicians}} have proposed re-opening {{the line and}} either making it part of the Jæren Commuter Rail {{or part of the}} planned light rail in Greater Stavanger. Additionally, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has supported a future re-opening of the line. Estimates show that the line has a traffic potential for 600,000 passengers per year. In a proposal from the National Rail Administration, the Ålgård Line is seen as a possible branch of the commuter rail, with stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. Without making any <b>investments</b> <b>to</b> the Sørlandet Line, {{it would be possible to}} extend the two hourly services that terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård. Ålgård is also a good location for a park and ride for European Route E39. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. This would give a travel time from Ganddal to Ålgård of 10 to 12 minutes. The estimated cost of re-opening the line is NOK500 million. The Center Party has proposed converting the line to a bus lane. The borough council of Figgjo has voted to convert the line to a bicycle path, but this has been rejected by the National Rail Administration.|$|E
