5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several {{years went by}} without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory <b>for</b> <b>teacher</b> training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Coonley School (ACS), {{commonly}} called Avery Coonley, is an independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in preschool through eighth grade (approximately ages 3 to 14), and {{is located in}} Downers Grove, Illinois. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory <b>for</b> <b>teacher</b> training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted.|$|E

5|$|The school {{opened on}} September 15, 1914 as Bowling Green State Normal School in two {{temporary}} locations at the Bowling Green Armory {{and at a}} branch school in Toledo for the 1914–1915 academic year. It initially enrolled 304 students from Ohio, Michigan, and New York who were taught by 21 faculty members. The school graduated its first class in 1915, consisting of 35 certified teachers. University Hall and Williams Hall opened that year, the school's first two permanent buildings. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees <b>for</b> <b>teacher</b> education were awarded. On March 28, 1920 a tornado, part of the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, damaged three of the school's buildings.

Admission to teacher training was more competitive, as it did not charge for tuition or board, and guaranteed a job on graduation. Although her family could have afforded to pay, Wu chose the more competitive option, and was ranked ninth among around 10,000 applicants.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance <b>for</b> <b>teacher</b> salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
