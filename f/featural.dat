25|$|A <b>featural</b> script {{represents}} finer detail than an alphabet. Here symbols do {{not represent}} whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) {{that make up the}} phonemes, such as voicing or its place of articulation. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be <b>featural,</b> but the only prominent system of this sort is Korean hangul. In hangul, the <b>featural</b> symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.|$|E

25|$|The major writing systems—methods of inscription—broadly {{fall into}} five categories: logographic, syllabic, alphabetic, <b>featural,</b> and {{ideographic}} (symbols for ideas).

25|$|Sutton SignWriting, or simply, SignWriting, is {{a system}} of writing sign languages. It is highly <b>featural</b> and {{visually}} iconic, both in {{the shapes of the}} characters, which are abstract pictures of the hands, face, and body, and in their spatial arrangement on the page, which does not follow a sequential order like the letters that make up written English words. It was developed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton, a dancer who had two years earlier developed DanceWriting.|$|E
25|$|Xu & Chun (2009) {{propose the}} neural-object file theory, which posits {{that the human}} visual system {{initially}} selects a fixed number of roughly four objects from a crowded scene based on their spatial information (object individuation) before encoding their details (object identification). Under this framework, object individuation is generally controlled by the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), while object identification involves the superior IPS and higher-level visual areas. At the object individuation stage, object representations are coarse and contain minimal feature information. However, once these object representations (or object-files, to use the theory's language) have been 'set up' during the object individuation stage they can be elaborated on over time during the object identification stage, during which additional <b>featural</b> and identity information is received.|$|E
25|$|Hangul is a <b>featural</b> {{alphabet}} {{written in}} morpho-syllabic blocks, and {{was designed for}} both the Korean and Chinese languages, though the letters specific to Chinese are now obsolete. Each block consists {{of at least one}} consonant letter and one vowel letter. When promulgated, the blocks reflected the morphology of Korean, but for most of the fifteenth century they were organized into syllables. In the twentieth century the morpho-syllabic tradition was revived. The blocks were traditionally written in vertical columns from top to bottom, although they are now commonly written in horizontal rows from left to right as well. Spacing has been introduced to separate words in the Western fashion, and punctuation to indicate clauses and sentences, so that Hangul now transcribes Korean at the levels of feature, segment, syllable, morpheme, word, clause, and sentence. However, the suprasegmental features of tone and vowel length, seen as single and double tick marks {{to the left of the}} syllabic blocks in the image in the next section, have been dropped. Six new letters, including two of Sejong's which had become obsolete, were introduced in North Korea in 1948 in order to make Hangul a perfect morphophonological fit to the Korean language, but they were soon discarded.|$|E
500|$|Although the IPA {{diacritics}} {{are fully}} <b>featural,</b> {{there is little}} systemicity in the letter forms. A retroflex articulation is consistently indicated with a right-swinging tail, as in , and implosion by a top hook, , but other pseudo-featural elements are due to haphazard derivation and coincidence. For example, all nasal consonants but uvular [...] {{are based on the}} form : [...] However, the similarity between [...] and [...] is a historical accident; [...] and [...] are derived from ligatures of gn and ng, and [...] is an ad hoc imitation of [...]|$|E

2500|$|A <b>featural</b> script notates the {{building}} blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips ("labial" [...] sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters [...] "b" [...] and [...] "p"; however, labial [...] "m" [...] is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking [...] "q" [...] and [...] "d" [...] are not labial. In Korean hangul, however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the <b>featural</b> elements tend to pass unnoticed.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the design}} of the script may be <b>featural,</b> for all {{practical}} purposes it behaves as an alphabet. The letter [...] is not read as three letters alveolar aspirated plosive, for instance, but as a single consonant t. Likewise, the former diphthong [...] is read as a single vowel e.|$|E
2500|$|The Shavian {{alphabet}} {{consists of}} three types of letters: tall, deep and short. Short letters are vowels, liquids (r, l) and nasals; tall letters (except Yea [...] and Hung [...] ) are voiceless consonants. A tall letter rotated 180° or flipped, with the tall part now extending below the baseline, becomes a deep letter, representing equivalent voiced consonant (except Haha [...] ). The alphabet is therefore to some extent <b>featural.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In SignWriting, a {{combination}} of iconic symbols for handshapes, orientation, body locations, facial expressions, contacts, and movement are used to represent words in sign language. Since SignWriting, as a <b>featural</b> script, represents the actual physical formation of signs rather than their meaning, no phonemic or semantic analysis of a language is required to write it. [...] A person who has learned the system can [...] "feel out" [...] an unfamiliar sign {{in the same way}} an English speaking person can [...] "sound out" [...] an unfamiliar word written in the Latin alphabet, without even needing to know what the sign means.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{linguists}} have praised Hangul for its <b>featural</b> design, {{describing it}} as [...] "remarkable", [...] "the most perfect phonetic system devised", and [...] "brilliant, so deliberately does it fit the language like a glove". The principal reason Hangul has attracted this praise {{is that the}} shapes of the letters are related to the features of the sounds they represent: the letters for consonants pronounced in the same place in the mouth are built on the same underlying shape. In addition, vowels are made from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.|$|E
2500|$|Ledyard {{holds that}} the Koreans adopted five core {{consonant}} letters from ’Phags-pa, namely ㄱ g , ㄷ d , ㅂ b , ㅈ j , and ㄹ l [...] These were the consonants basic to Chinese phonology, rather than the graphically simplest letters (ㄱ g , ㄴ n , ㅁ m , and ㅅ s [...] ) taken {{as the starting point}} by the Haerye. A sixth letter, the null initial ㅇ, was invented by Sejong. The rest of the consonants were developed through <b>featural</b> derivation from these six, essentially as described in the Haerye; a resemblance to speech organs was an additional motivating factor in selecting the shapes of both the basic letters and their derivatives.|$|E
2500|$|His Head is {{a brutal}} {{asymmetrical}} {{reconstruction of the}} motif that submerges <b>featural</b> identity by a logic of thrusting planar forms. The result, unlike that if Filla, is the redesigning of the head {{that is no longer}} dependent upon a frontal confrontation for the most revealing view, and the consistency of this sculptural context discourages trying to project missing features on the blank planes. The blunt force-fulness with which the head is shaped and thrusts in and out suggests that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling.

2500|$|Following the Indic tradition, Hangul consonants are {{classified}} {{according to the}} speech organs involved in their production. However, Hangul goes a step further, in that {{the shapes of the}} letters iconically represent the speech organs, so that all consonants of the same articulation are based on the same shape. That is, Hangul is a <b>featural</b> alphabet, {{the only one in the}} world that is in common use. For example, the shape of the velar consonant (牙音 [...] "molar sound") ㄱ [...] is said to represent the back of the tongue bunched up to block the back of the mouth near the molars. Aspirate ㅋ [...] is derived from this by the addition of a stroke which represents aspiration. Chinese voiced/"muddy" [...] ㄲ [...] is created by doubling ㄱ. (The doubled letters were only used for Chinese, as Korean had not yet developed its series of emphatic consonants. In the twentieth century they were revived for the Korean emphatics.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Other scripts {{may have}} limited <b>featural</b> elements. Many {{languages}} {{written in the}} Latin alphabet make use of diacritics, and those letters using diacritics are sometimes considered separate letters within the language's alphabet. The Polish alphabet, for example, indicates a palatal articulation of some consonants with an acute accent. The Turkish alphabet uses the presence {{of one or two}} dots above a vowel to indicate that it is a front vowel. The Japanese kana syllabaries indicate voiced consonants with marks known as dakuten. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) also has some <b>featural</b> elements, for example in the hooks and tails that are characteristic of implosives, , and retroflex consonants, [...] The IPA diacritics are also <b>featural.</b> The Fraser alphabet used for Lisu rotates the letters for the tenuis consonants ꓑ , ꓔ , ꓝ , ꓚ , and ꓗ [...] 180° to indicate aspiration.|$|E
