5|$|The PanzerI's design {{history can}} be traced to the British Carden Loyd tankette of which it {{borrowed}} much of its track and suspension design. After six prototype Kleintraktor were produced the cover name was changed to Krupp-Traktor whereas the development codename was changed to Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper (LaS) (Agricultural Tractor). The LaS was intended not just to train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92mm MG 13 machine guns in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armour of the time, restricting the PanzerI to a training and anti-infantry role by design.|$|E

On December 3, 1919, the Quebec Bridge opened for rail traffic, after almost two decades of construction. Its centre span of 549 metres (1800ft) remains the longest cantilevered bridge span {{in the world and}} is considered a major <b>engineering</b> <b>feat.</b>|$|E

An <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> of sorts when completed in 1923, the railway underwent an extensive upgrading in 2010 and was reopened in early 2011. It now serves visitors travelling up the Penang Hill, providing quick and {{direct access to}} the hill's peak.|$|E
25|$|The city {{responded by}} {{tunneling}} two miles (3km) out into Lake Michigan to newly-built water cribs. In 1900, {{the problem of}} sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major <b>engineering</b> <b>feat.</b> It reversed {{the flow of the}} Chicago River so the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River, which flows into the Mississippi River.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{a series}} on Canada's {{petroleum}} industry, this entry focuses on the second of these two functions of gas processing - removing impurities from the gas stream - rather than recovering natural gas liquids, described elsewhere. Of course, most large plants perform both functions, and plants have no other ultimate purpose than to quickly, safely and profitably turn raw gas into products to be safely shipped (mostly by pipeline) to market. The discussion covers gas processing as an <b>engineering</b> <b>feat,</b> critical developments in exploration and development and the fundamentals of the marketplace.|$|E
25|$|To {{build the}} final {{passenger}} tramway {{it was first}} necessary to construct a freight tramway to carry materials. Carrying cement and materials by backpack, four dozen men completed the formidable task in December. Construction of the tramway continued through the winter, with almost all the work, pouring 32 carloads of cement, assembling 232 tons of steel and four miles (6km) of cable, done by hand. It was considered an outstanding <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> of the period. On June 28, 1938, after nine months of construction and {{one year after the}} passage of legislation, North America’s first aerial tramway was dedicated.|$|E
25|$|The only {{rail-based}} {{transportation system}} in George Town is the Penang Hill Railway, a funicular railway to {{the peak of}} Penang Hill. When completed in 1923, the railway, then utilising Swiss-made coaches, was considered an <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> of sorts. It underwent an extensive upgrading in 2010 and was reopened in early 2011.Within the city centre, efforts are being undertaken to promote pedestrianisation {{and the use of}} bicycles as a greener alternative transportation mode. Dedicated cycling lanes have been marked throughout the city and in 2016, George Town became the first Malaysian city to operate a public bicycle-sharing service, with the launch of LinkBike.|$|E

25|$|Large {{rammed earth}} walls {{were built in}} ancient China since the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–1050BC), as the capital at ancient Ao had {{enormous}} walls built in this fashion (see siege for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the Warring States (481–221BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). Sections of the Great Wall had been built prior to the Qin Dynasty (221–207BC) and subsequently connected and fortified during the Qin dynasty, although its present form was mostly an <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> and remodeling of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644AD) during the 15th and 16th centuries. The large walls of Pingyao serve as one example. Likewise, {{the walls of the}} Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Route 26 {{originates}} as {{the alignment}} of the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, chartered in 1803 from Warren and Green Streets in Trenton to New Brunswick. The turnpike lasted for 99years, fighting with railroads, canals and stagecoaches to stay in business. The road was designated State Highway Route26 in the 1927 state highway renumbering, running from the state line in Trenton to State Highway RouteS-28 in New Brunswick along the turnpike and Livingston Avenue. The route remained intact, becoming part of an <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> meant {{for the safety of}} drivers. In 1952, the route became part of the Trenton Freeway until the Route26 designation was truncated back to North Brunswick Township in the 1953 state highway renumbering. The route was further truncated back from Route18 in the 1970s in New Brunswick to its current northern terminus at Nassau Street.|$|E
25|$|With the {{permission}} of the parlement of Paris, Philippe sponsored projects to help maintain his estates and enhance their profitability. From 1679, he was granted the right to build the Canal d'Orléans, a large canal that connected the Loire River at Orléans to a junction with the Canal du Loing and the Canal de Briare in the village of Buges near Montargis. As the largest canal built in France since Philippe's grandfather Henri IV built the Canal de Briare in 1604, its construction was considered an <b>engineering</b> <b>feat.</b> The canal, used to transport goods from Orléans to Paris, was a great success in its time and is still used widely today. Philippe's careful investment and management of his various estates made him a wealthy man in his own right, and his fortune was augmented considerably at the death of his cousin Mademoiselle in 1693. Philippe is acknowledged as being not only the biological founder of the House of Orléans, but as financial founder of a family whose monetary value would rival that of the main line of the House of Bourbon.|$|E

25|$|At {{first the}} {{promoters}} wanted {{the most direct}} route to London, even if that meant building a line all the way there, by-passing important towns in Cornwall and Devon. Before the interested parties could raise the money and get parliamentary authority for their line, the Government actually removed {{the bulk of the}} packet trade to Southampton, so that most of the income for any new line was removed. Some interests continued to press for the best line to London, hoping that the packet trade would return; if necessary they would link with another new railway, but the huge cost of this proved impossible to raise. A more practical scheme running to Plymouth gradually took priority, and at first the trains were to cross the Hamoaze, the body of water {{at the mouth of the}} River Tamar on a steam ferry. This was shown to be unrealistic, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was called in to resolve the difficulty. He designed the bridge over the River Tamar at Saltash, the Royal Albert Bridge: when it was built it was the most prodigious <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> in the world. He also improved the details of the route elsewhere. By reaching Plymouth, the company could connect with the South Devon Railway and on to London over the Bristol and Exeter railway and the Great Western Railway. The line was built on the broad gauge.|$|E
500|$|Leary {{wrote that}} the canal began at Long Wharf in New Haven, Connecticut and exited the state of by the Congamnond Ponds, some [...] to the north. The canal had a total of 28 lift locks which {{measured}} [...] long by [...] wide. These lift locks were required due to the significant elevation changes from New Haven to Massachusetts. Beginning in New Haven, the first [...] had masonry walls, {{but the rest of}} the canal was [...] "simply a ditch" [...] about [...] deep that was only suitable for a flat bottomed canal boat. Leary describes the canal was [...] "unquestionably Connecticut's foremost <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> before the advent of the railroads." [...] The first sections of the canal were operational in 1828, and the canal boats were pulled by mules up the canal, but it wasn't complete until the late 1830s. The operation of the canal was affected by the precipitation, with drought-like conditions resulting in closed sections, but it had a great impact on the local businesses and industries adjoining the canal.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the sale}} of [...] to Disston and the skyrocketing price of land, {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the IIF was {{bankrupt}} due to mismanagement. Legal battles ensued between the State of Florida and the railroad owners about who owned the rights to sell reclaimed land in the Everglades. In 1904 gubernatorial campaigning, the strongest candidate, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, made draining the Everglades a major plank. He called the future of south Florida the [...] "Empire of the Everglades" [...] and compared its potential to that of Holland and Egypt: [...] "It would indeed be a commentary on the intelligence and energy of the State of Florida to confess that so simple an <b>engineering</b> <b>feat</b> as the drainage of a body of land above the sea was above their power", he wrote to voters. Soon after his election, he fulfilled his promise to [...] "drain that abominable pestilence-ridden swamp" [...] and pushed the Florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands. They began by taxing counties that would be affected by the drainage attempts, at 5 cents an acre, and formed the Everglades Drainage District in 1907.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian {{posted a}} number of reviews on its website. Julia Reaside deemed the series a [...] "perfectly cast remake of Swedish-Danish crime hit", and stated that [...] "this {{confirms}} Dillane {{as one of our}} very finest. Such control. Poésy is beautifully chilly, and Joseph Mawle (another cracker) leads an asylum-seeker subplot. It's also really funny." [...] Writing about the finale, Reaside said of Dillane's performance: [...] "If this were on a terrestrial channel, he'd be up for all the awards." [...] On the Karl–Elise partnership, she stated: [...] "I wasn't sure about them as a pairing but was immediately convinced by their uncomfortable chemistry." [...] Having not enjoyed The Bridge, Andrew Anthony called The Tunnel an [...] "attractive proposition", adding that [...] "there's an engaging confidence to the slow revelation of the story. All in all, this looks good." [...] Sam Wollaston was more critical of the series, stating that, while the tone was [...] "atmospheric, intriguing, gripping" [...] and there were strong performances from the lead cast members, The Tunnel was [...] "exactly the same as the (recent) original". [...] Wollaston felt that the only [...] "obvious" [...] difference was that, in the original series, there [...] "was a bridge, this is a tunnel.
