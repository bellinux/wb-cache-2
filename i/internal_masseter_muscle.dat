40|$|CystiCerCus bovis is the {{larval stage}} of the human beef tapeworm, taenia saginata. Cattle act as the {{intermediate}} host for the parasite. Cattle become infected through access to environments contaminated by infected human faeces, application of sewage to land, or indirectly through mechanical vectors such as birds. Two per cent of the human population of Europe, the definitive hosts, are thought to infested with t saginata (SCVPH 2003) with infection occurring through ingestion of raw or undercooked beef.

40|$|Background and objectives: Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} is a well-recognized {{and most}} prevalent premalignant condition of oral mucosa in India and Southeast Asia. Frequent and prolonged chewing of gutkha (readymade mixture of arecanut, tobacco, lime, catechu and sweetening agent) exerts undue pressure on muscles of mastication, which inturn {{may result in}} work hypertrophy of muscle. The present study was undertaken to measure thickness of <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> at rest and at maximum clenching position by ultrasonography with <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> hypertrophy in oral submucous fibrosis patient and in control group, and also to establish the normal value of <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness ultrasonographically and to prove that uttrasonography is reliable diagnostic technique {{for the evaluation of}} <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> hypertropy in oral submucous fibrosis patient.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> in eight infant, juvenile, and {{adolescent}} female rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) was examined over a 2. 5 year period using serial radiographic cephalometric techniques {{with the aid of}} radiopaque muscle markers. The radiopaque markers, which are composed of small pieces of root canal broach inserted into the muscle belly, make it possible to determine longitudinal <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> growth as well as migration of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> relative to the mandible. It was found that the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> increased in length by 64 % during the total growth period, most of which occurred between 6 and 18 months of age. Relative to the cranium, the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> grew markedly inferiorly and only slightly posteriorly. Relative to the mandible, the masseter migrated in a posterior and slightly superior direction, keeping pace with the ramus and condyle as they grew posteriorly and posterosuperiorly throughout the study period. It was concluded that: 1) radiopaque muscle markers are a valuable tool for analysis of muscle growth and alteration of muscle location; 2) the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> in the rhesus monkey undergoes elongation, probably due to addition of sarcomeres at the fiber-tendon junctions; and 3) posterior migration of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> relative to the corpus of the mandible, probably {{due to the nature of}} its periosteal attachment, results in a stability of the anteroposterior position of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> despite the anterior displacement of the mandible...|$|R
30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{incidence}} of plate fracture, reduction of masticatory muscle power might be helpful. The proximal segment of the mandible provides the attachment for the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle,</b> temporal muscle, and external pterygoid muscle. Among them, the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> is used for the injection site of BTX-A. BTX-A injection into the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> reduces its muscular power [19]. Because muscle is one of the contributing factors for post-operative relapse [20], BTX-A injection may reduce post-operative relapse. The purpose of this preliminary study was (1) to evaluate BTX-A injection into the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> on the prevention of plate fracture and (2) to compare post-operative relapse between the BTX-A injection group and the no injection group.|$|R

Data were obtained from lateral cephalometric radiographs {{of a total of}} 39 cadavers in which the superficial <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> had been defined with colloidal barium. Principal component analysis provided evidence that the lower <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> width was associated with the size of the ramus, and related to the position of the anterior margin of the muscle. Linear discriminant function data suggested that ramus width, coronoid height and the distance between the anterior margin of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> and the mandibular notch contributed most to the observed difference between dentate and edentulous subjects. The derived function correctly assigned 100 % of dentate and 95 % of edentulous subjects. The results of this study indicated that a reduction of masticatory function was associated with the position of the anterior border of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> insertion and also with differences in ramus dimension, the most significant of which were differences in the coronoid process and gonial angle.

The thickness of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> was measured bilaterally with ultrasonography, using a real time scanner with a 7. 5 MHz linear array transducer. RESULTS: In the untreated group, {{the thickness of the}} <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> on the crossbite side was statistically significantly thinner than the one on the normal side (P =. 025).

40|$|Glucocorticoid has {{a direct}} catabolic effect on {{skeletal}} muscle, leading to muscle atrophy, but no effective pharmacotherapy is available. We reported that clenbuterol (CB) induced <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> hypertrophy and slow-to-fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform transition through direct muscle β 2 -adrenergic receptor stimulation. Thus, we hypothesized that CB would antagonize glucocorticoid (dexamethasone; DEX) -induced muscle atrophy and fast-to-slow MHC isoform transition. We examined the effect of CB on DEX-induced <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> atrophy by measuring <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> weight, fiber diameter, cross-sectional area, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition. To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we used immunoblotting to {{study the effects of}} CB on muscle hypertrophic signaling (insulin growth factor 1 (IGF 1) expression, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and calcineurin pathway) and atrophic signaling (Akt/Forkhead box-O (FOXO) pathway and myostatin expression) in <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> of rats treated with DEX and/or CB. <b>Masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> weight in the DEX-treated group was significantly lower than that in the Control group, as expected, but co-treatment with CB suppressed the DEX-induced <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> atrophy, concomitantly with inhibition of fast-to-slow MHC isoforms transition.

40|$|Loss of the caudal maxilla and ventral orbit after tumor resections {{can have}} {{negative}} functional and esthetic {{influences on the}} eye involved. This article reports on {{a case of a}} caudal maxillary acanthomatous ameloblastoma involving the ventral orbit that was resected and stabilized with a <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> flap. The <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> flap was generated from the superficial belly of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> in order to close a defect in the orbital rim, created by a caudal maxillectomy. None of the published complications such as enophthalmos, excessive lacrimation, globe deviation, or strabismus were noted, 8 months following the procedure. The only clinical sign present at the time of re-evaluation was mild lacrimation. The authors propose the use of a <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> flap as a viable technique in stabilizing the ventral orbit after caudal maxillectomy and ventral orbitectomy, preventing the complications associated with this surgery.
