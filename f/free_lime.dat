25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, <b>free</b> <b>lime,</b> periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase.

40|$|Ceramic {{properties}} of the loess in Nebraska have not been investigated prior to this work. It was the recognition of a need for ceramic materials that prompted the undertaking of this project. Experiments were conducted upon the firing of the Loveland and Peorian formations in southeastern Nebraska. The main purpose of the investigation {{was to determine the}} economic possibilities for utilization of Nebraska loess deposits, in manufacturing bricks and other ceramic products. Results of the fired samples from Nebraska City, West Point and Council Bluffs, Iowa show that the loess in these localities contain too much lime and the vitrified products are too sticky to be utilized in any vitrified products, especially light-weight aggregate, unless by addition of necessary foreign material, stickiness is reduced. The conclusion has been drawn that the loess of deposits of eastern Nebraska can be utilized for more ceramic products than they are at present. The loess is suitable for the manufacturing of relatively coarse and low-cost products. Its advantage lies in minimum mining costs, low firing temperatures, and application of standard methods of production. Products of this type include common bricks, face bricks, plaster tile, and drain tile. The loess would be a good raw material for coarse earthenware products, such a garden tools. In utilization of loess the manufacturers should be cautious and avoid zones of excess lime concentration.

(This plain is partially separated into two basins by a range of hills; the southern half, according to Meyen ("Reise um Erde" [...] Th. 1 s. 274), falls in height, by an abrupt step, of between fifteen and twenty feet.) Near the Cordillera it is composed of a stratified mass of pebbles of all sizes, occasionally including rounded boulders: near its western boundary, it consists of reddish sandy clay, containing some pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice, and sometimes passes into pure sand or into volcanic ashes. At Podaguel, on this western side of the plain, beds of sand are capped by a calcareous tuff, the uppermost layers being generally hard and substalagmitic, and the lower ones white and friable, both together precisely resembling the beds at Coquimbo, which contain recent marine shells. Abrupt, but rounded, hummocks of rock rise out of this plain: those of Sta. Lucia and S. Cristoval are formed of greenstone-porphyry almost entirely denuded of its original covering of porphyritic claystone breccia; on their summits, many fragments of rock (some of them kinds not found in situ) are coated and united together by a white, friable, calcareous tuff, like that found at Podaguel.

This was done via {{the investigation of the}} hydration characteristic of EAF slag – Portland cement blended mixtures. Various ratios of EAF slag were used namely; 5, 10 and 20 wt% of solid mix. The hydration properties investigated for the various mixtures were; compressive strength, chemically combined water and <b>free</b> <b>lime</b> contents as a function of hydration times. The hydration ages were; 1, 3, 7, 28 and 90 days. In addition, phase composition of the formed hydrates was examined using XRD technique as well as differential thermal analysis (DTA) for some selected samples. The results showed that as the ratio of EAF slag increases the values of compressive strength decrease at all the hydration ages. Hydration kinetics of the investigated mixes was followed by determining the variation of <b>free</b> <b>lime</b> and chemically combined water contents with time of hydration. It was observed that hydration proceeds in four different stages. The values of chemically combined water of the cement pastes blended with EAF slag were less than those of the neat Portland cement paste at all hydration ages. The mode of variation of <b>free</b> <b>lime</b> content with time was nearly similar to that of combined water content. The results of chemically combined water, <b>free</b> <b>lime,</b> XRD analysis as well as thermal analysis were correlated well with those of compressive strength. All these results indicate that the used EAF slag has no significant pozzolanic reactivity...|$|E

Phosphorus (P) is very reactive with lime. Following fertilizer application, P undergoes a series of reactions that gradually reduce its solubility. In most calcareous soils, there {{does not appear to}} be a strong agronomic advantage of any particular P source when managed properly. Organic matter can inhibit P fixation reactions to some extent. Some fertilizer recommendations call for additional P to be added when the soil contains high amounts of <b>free</b> <b>lime.</b> surfaces, and pre-cipitation of various calcium phosphate min-erals.
