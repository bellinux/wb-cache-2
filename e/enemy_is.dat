5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> the Flood, a parasitic alien {{life form}} {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form of the Flood, are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Animation {{historian}} Michael Barrier {{points out}} that there was a change in formula in Bugs' cartoons before and following World War II. Before his <b>enemies</b> <b>were</b> hapless boobs which he held in contempt. In this film and others by Freleng, the <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> actually dangerous. But this makes outwitting them more delicious. In this case, the <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> the Gas-House Gorillas. [...] "A whole team of interchangeable ... hulking, blue-jawed, cigar chewing monsters".|$|R

50|$|Many <b>enemies</b> <b>were</b> {{cut from}} the home console version: in stage 3, the walker <b>enemies</b> <b>were</b> removed and placed only once in the final stage {{while some of the}} organic enemies in stage 4 were either removed or their AI was changed.|$|R
5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E
5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, {{around the world to}} interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.|$|E

5|$|On December 18, 1993, Dragon Quest II was remade and {{combined}} with Dragon Quest {{as part of}} Dragon Quest I & II for the Super Famicom, which used Dragon Quest Vs engine. Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features an improved enemy targeting system: if an <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> defeated before a character who was assigned to attack can perform its attack move, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And like its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers. The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> approaching them.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E

5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any other games. He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition can last for hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> {{right in front of}} the player and in view the whole time. In addition, the player has the ability to both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and reload the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in other games.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{include a}} variety of {{anthropomorphic}} vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game.|$|E
50|$|The core <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> planes grouped in a formation, {{similar to}} Galaxian, that break off and dive at the player's boat. Other flying <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> machine gun-equipped {{helicopters}}, Exocet missiles, and bomb-dropping jets. The helicopters {{take the place}} of the flagships in Galaxian, sitting atop the rows of planes. Mines also appear in the water.|$|R

5|$|The final <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> Lorenzo, {{who seemed}} to be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several {{different}} forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him in a rock press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process. With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach the door, he finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set on}} the Southern coastland of England {{during an}} enemy {{invasion}} against the remaining Allied forces. The player takes {{the role of a}} fighter plane pilot, who must defeat the invasion. To accomplish this, the player pilots one of the three available Mark 2.1 AWAT (All-Weather All-Terrain) combat aircraft and is charged with defending the last three Allied airbases being evacuated in front of the enemy's advance. Despite being the lone defender and greatly outnumbered, they must fight enemy forces on all fronts: aerial, ground and naval. The player progresses through the game engaging different contingents of the invaders. Initially, they must intercept enemy fighter planes, helicopters and landing ground forces, including tanks, land bases and SAM sites. Once the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently driven back, the player can engage the naval fleet.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} on the {{floating}} island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands; and the three Surface overworlds {{where the majority of}} the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals in the clouds. Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available, and sometimes mandatory for completing the main quest. The Skyloft overworld is navigated with a great bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Marker beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point. During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, who is able to give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> targeted and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.|$|E
