40|$|AbstractUnconventional {{geothermal}} {{resources at}} supercritical conditions have been inferred to occur beneath high-enthalpy systems in active magmatic environments, and bear {{the potential to}} increase electricity production from a geothermal well by an order of magnitude. The high specific enthalpies of these fluids cannot be explained by simple convection models and a hydrologic divide between two distinct flow regimes may be required. In numerical simulations of porphyry-copper systems, such a hydrologic divide self-organized from an interplay of non-static permeability and fluid flow.

Fumaroles are mainly concentred at the active cone of La Fossa in the northern sector of the island and are periodically characterized by increases in temperature {{as well as in}} the amount of both CO 2 and He. Seismic background activity at Vulcano is dominated by micro-seismicity originating at shallow depth (< 1 - 1. 5 km) under La Fossa cone. This seismicity is <b>related</b> to <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> processes and comprises long period (LP) events. LPs are generally considered as the resonance of a fluid-filled volume in response to a trigger. We analyzed LP events recorded during an anomalous degassing period (August-October 2006) applying a high precision technique to define the shape of the trigger source. Absolute and high precision locations suggest that LP events recorded at Vulcano during 2006 were produced by a shallow focal zone ca. 200 m long, 40 m wide and N 30 - 40 E oriented. Their occurrence is linked to magmatic fluid inputs that by modifying the hydrothermal system cause excitation of a fluid-filled cavity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in the Basin and Range Province of {{the western}} United States {{probably}} differ in many respects from <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> already discovered {{in other parts of}} the world because of the unique tectonic setting. To investigate this, a study of the geothermal occurrences at Fly Ranch, approximately 100 miles north of Reno, Nevada, has been undertaken. Ample evidence for a <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> exists in this area, including the surface expression of heat flow in the form of hot springs, an extensive area of low electrical resistivity, and a high level of seismicity along faults bounding the thermal area. However, geophysical and geological studies have not yet provided evidence for a local heat source at depth.

40|$|The tectonic and magmatic {{framework}} of southeast Oregon provides the conditions {{necessary for the}} existence of geothermal energy resources. However, few detailed studies of <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> {{in this part of the}} Basin and Range have been conducted. Young bimodal magmatism and faulting associated with the High Lava Plains coupled with the encroachment of the Basin and Range tectonic province and potentially the Walker Lane have created the structural configuration, heat source, and secondary permeability necessary for <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in southeast Oregon. The relative contribution of these provinces to the overall tectonomagmatic framework is less well understood. In this study, the <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> near Paisley, Oregon has been characterized by a detailed regional heat flow study, geologic mapping, aqueous geochemical analysis, a gravity survey, and a X-ray diffraction analysis of secondary alteration minerals. Based on these analyses, the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> shares many aspects similar to Basin and Range <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems.</b> Geologic mapping has revealed a sequence of rocks with ages spanning from the mid Eocene-Present as well as structures related to the Basin and Range Province. A structural transfer zone connects two en-echelon normal faults in Summer Lake Basin, which controls the upwelling of thermal waters. The fault controlling fluid flow in the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> was imaged using a gravity survey. Thermal water in the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> has been determined to be of meteoric source, and is interpreted to be of Pleistocene age based on stable isotopes having average values of - 119. 59 ‰ and - 14. 18 ‰ for δD and δ 18 O, respectively. Recharge to the thermal aquifer is driven dominantly by topographic flow, with residence times on the order of 1000 s of years. Aqueous geochemistry was used to determine that the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> is not magmatic in origin, with low values of magmatic SO 4, As, B, and high values of HCO 3 and Na. Geothermometers were used to calculate reservoir temperatures between 95 °C – 166 °C. These results were independently checked by X-ray diffraction studies of alteration mineral assemblages in reservoir rocks from two production wells drilled by Surprise Valley Electrification, which revealed similar temperatures for the stability field of mineral assemblages present in the wells. Because it has been determined that the Paisley geothermal fluids are not influenced by recent magmatism, the role of bimodal magmatism associated with the High Lava Plains on <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in southeastern Oregon appears to be minimal. However, in areas where magmatism is younger than 2 million years, this may not be true. Like the <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> of the western Great Basin, the location of <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in southeast Oregon is highly dependent on the regional structural architecture. Also similar to some <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> of the Basin and Range, the source of water is not modern meteoric water, but is “fossil” water, which implies that production must be managed carefully to create a sustainable resource...|$|R

40|$|An active high {{temperature}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> consists typically of a magmatic heat source, water to tramsport the heat, and fractures or permeable zones {{where the water}} flows. When the heat source cools down and the <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> becomes inactive, we call this a paleo-geothermal <b>system</b> or fossil <b>geothermal</b> <b>system.</b> Gold is often transported by ascending waters in the {{high temperature}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> <b>related</b> with volcanic activities. The upper level of the system, {{at a depth of}} around 400 m or less, is a favorable site of gold deposition. Therefore, epithermal gold deposits and their environments correspond to the paleogeothermal systems, of which high level portions are often eroded away. There are many active- and paleo-geothermal systems in island-arc settings of the western Pacific rim and adjacent regions. Representative gold deposits are: Taio, Kushikino, Hishikari and Iwato in Kyushu, Japan; Chinkuashih in Taiwan; Acupan- Antamok in the Philippines; Lebong Donok and Lebong Tandai in Sumatra, Indonesia; Wau in Papua New Guinea; Mavu in the Solomon Islands; Vatukoula and Mt. Kasi in Fiji; and Waihi in New Zealand. These late Cenozoic epithermal gold regions have several characteristics. (1) Volcanic activities started less than 15 - 16 million years ago and continued to the late Quaternary. (2) <b>Igneous</b> rocks <b>related</b> to the gold mineralization are predominantly dacite or hornblende andesite of the calc-alkalic series. Volcanic rocks of the alkalic series, however, host some of the gold deposits. (3) The site of the gold deposits are restricted to within 8 km (usually 4 km) of the center of volcanic activity. (4) Two types of gold deposits are recognized, the quartz-adularia veins usually with Mn-carbonates, and those in massive silicified rocks. Basements consist of a thick sedimentary sequence in the case of Kyushu, Japan and New Zealand; and probably of oceanic crust in the case of Fiji. Porphyry copper deposits occur intimately with gold deposits in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea but not in Kyushu...|$|R
