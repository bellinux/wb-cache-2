A rheological model has also been suggested to describe this mechanism. The tensile creep of air <b>drying</b> <b>concrete</b> was larger than that expected in compression but smaller when the concrete is stored sealed or under water. The creep of sealed and immersed concrete reached limiting values within two months while that of air <b>drying</b> <b>concrete</b> continued for a much longer tie. in other respects tensile creep behaviour was similar to that in compression. The creep of sealed concrete was about half that of immersed concrete and as low as 0. 1 of that of air <b>drying</b> <b>concrete.</b> A relationship has been obtained between ultimate strength and the period of sustained loading. This relationship is similar to that previously obtained for concrete in compression but the reduction of strength due to long-term loading is greater than than for compression and can be up to 50 per cent of the short-term strength. This relationship is considerably influenced by the storage conditions of the specimen and the type of aggregate employed. The long-term strength of sealed concrete {{has been found to be}} up to 50 per cent higher than that of water-immersed concrete made with gravel aggregate while the short-term strength was about 15 to 20 per cent higher.

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>concrete</b> is {{basically}} a cementitious material, consisting of aggregates imbedded in a cement matrix that function as the binding agent. The water cement factor during this production is customary kept low, since from the economic point of view, speed in production is favored.

A technique of optimizing the hydration process is to apply a compression stress to the dry concretes, during the hydration stage. This stress is aimed to reduce the air voids in the mixture and to enable the entrapped water within the mortar to optimize the reaction with the cement.
