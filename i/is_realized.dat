5|$|Description of {{an early}} form of yoga called nirodhayoga (yoga of cessation) is {{contained}} in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (Shanti Parva) of the Mahabharata. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE. Nirodhayoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha (Self) <b>is</b> <b>realized.</b> Terms like vichara (subtle reflection), viveka (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described. There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.|$|E
5|$|Lex {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} outside of the television series in the novel Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the meteor rocks, Lex becomes interested in what they are really after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research he is doing on the meteor rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con <b>is</b> <b>realized,</b> Lex uses a dummy corporation to steal all of the meteor rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected. In Smallville: Dragon, Lex throws a party at his mansion for the local teenagers, that is ultimately crashed by a repitilian creature that {{was created by the}} meteor rocks. He is also visited by an old flame, Renata, who shows up looking to rekindle their relationship. Lex quickly discovers that she has an ulterior motive when she propositions him to fund a drug deal, which prompts Lex to realize that she was really sent by his father as some test for Lex.|$|E

25|$|Sonorants voiced /m/ and /n/ {{have three}} allophones: w and l intervocalically, b and d word {{initially}} and following an obstruent, and m and n {{in all other}} conditions. In conservative speech, l <b>is</b> <b>realized</b> as a tapped r, however in general cases it <b>is</b> <b>realized</b> as l, perhaps in due part {{to the influence of}} English. Word initially, b is optional for /m/, though b is more commonly realized. The glottal sonorant /h/ assimilates to the nasality of the following segment, but retains its voicelessness.

40|$|Tay [6] {{characterized}} the multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-bar frameworks. Subsequently, Tay [7] and Whiteley [11] independently {{characterized the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge frameworks. We adapt Whiteley’s proof technique {{to characterize the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-bar-and-hinge frameworks. More importantly, we obtain a sufficient condition for a multigraph to <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge framework in which all hinges lie in the same hyperplane. This result is related to a longstanding conjecture of Tay and Whiteley [8] which would characterize when a multigraph can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-andhinge framework {{in which all the}} hinges incident to each body lie in a common hyperplane. As a corollary we deduce that if a graph G has two spanning trees which use each edge of G at most twice, then its square can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid 3 -dimensional bar-and-joint framework...|$|R
