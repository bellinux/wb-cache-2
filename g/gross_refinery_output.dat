Those plans lapsed during the conflicts of the late 1970s and early 1980s but were revived in 1986 by the government {{with the support of}} the World Bank. The reasons for proceeding with plans to exploit these deposits and build a refinery were clear. The cost of importing petroleum products exceeded the cost of extracting and refining domestic crude, even when international oil prices were low. The plans, which anticipated operations to begin in the early 1990s, included well development in the Sédigi field, a pipeline to N'Djamena, a refinery with a 2,000- to [...] capacity, and the transformation or acquisition of power-generating equipment in the capital to burn the refinery's residual fuel oil.

In addition, the so-called Arab Spring has further fuelled contention {{between the state and}} aggressive political actors. However, while most attacks by such groups have been physical, the ubiquity of internet dependence in both social and professional settings has given political cells a decentralized and far less tangible weapon that can have systemic socio-economic consequences for hydrocarbon nations. Consequences can range from disruption of <b>refinery</b> <b>output</b> to widespread infrastructural damage and even loss of life. With increasing cyber-attacks on oil infrastructure in the Gulf, many National Oil Companies are seeking to strengthen online security while retaining resource management independence. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan provides a proximate and fast growing ICT hub for the outsourcing of cyber security for hydrocarbon sectors. Jordan’s nascent ICT development provides flexible opportunities for cyber security advances in the hydrocarbon industry, which must be balanced with the risk of politicizing Jordan and inviting increased terrorist attacks amid the Kingdom’s need to formalize comprehensive responses to online threats...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in {{properties}} and blending stocks on the <b>refinery</b> <b>output</b> and cost of jet fuel in the U. S., Canada, and Europe were determined. Computerized refinery models that minimize production costs and incorporated a 1981 cost structure and supply/demand projections to the year 2010 were used. Except in the West U. S., no changes in jet fuel properties were required to meet all projected demands, even allowing for deteriorating crude qualities and changes in competing product demand. In the West U. S., property changes {{or the use of}} cracked blendstocks were projected to be required after 1990 to meet expected demand. Generally, relaxation of aromatics and freezing point, or the use of cracked stocks produced similar results, i. e., jet fuel output could be increased by up to a factor of three or its production cost lowered by up to $ 10 /cu m. High quality hydrocracked stocks are now used on a limited basis to produce jet fuel. The conversion of U. S. and NATO military forces from wide-cut to kerosene-based jet fuel is addressed. This conversion resulted in increased costs of several hundred million dollars annually. These costs can be reduced by relaxing kerosene jet fuel properties, using cracked stocks and/or considering the greater volumetric energy content of kerosene jet fuel...|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} {{deliberation}} of the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Controls, considerable attention {{was devoted to}} the question whether, regardless {{of the level of}} imports which should be allowed, the control should {{take the form of a}} quota or a tariff. Occasionally reference was made to a well-known equivalence theorem which holds that when there is perfect competition in the product market a tariff will generate a volume of imports which, if alternatively set as a quota, produces an identical discrepancy between foreign and domestic prices. Therefore, other than the transfer of revenues from quota holders to the treasury, there should be no difference between the two types of control. Nevertheless, some support for a quota persisted on the grounds that “A tariff can’t do anything to help the consumer. It will have the same effect in limiting imports as a quota, but all the money goes into the treasury. With quotas, on the other hand, there’s some chance of benefits trickling down to consumers in the form of lower prices. ” Since the market conditions and import regulations for oil differ somewhat from the textbook examples, it is worthwhile to consider whether, in this particular case, there is some reason for consumers to prefer quotas to an “equivalent” tariff. It will turn out that due to the peculiar nature of oil quotas which are set as a fraction of <b>refinery</b> <b>output,</b> such a proposition can be shown to be true under a very restrictive set of assumptions...|$|R

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{investigating}} environmental performance of different alternatives for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production from Natural Gas (NG) at Mongstad oil refinery. An important {{objective is to}} evaluate CHP plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), {{and the performance of}} these compared to a conventional CHP without such application. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the applied methodology for environmental assessment. The LCA results are used to inspect changes in eco-efficiency at the refinery with introduction of a CHP plant. Three CHP configurations have been assessed: 1. 	Conventional CHP 2. 	Conventional CHP with Post-Combustion (PC) CCS 3. 	Autothermal Reforming (ATR) plant; CHP with pre-combustion CCSThe three alternatives are denoted Conventional, PC and ATR in the following. Global Warming Potential (GWP) emissions per MWh exergy produced from the three CHP s are 56, 100 and 337 kg CO 2 -equvivalents for the PC, ATR and Conventional respectively. It is concluded that up-and downstream emissions do not undermine the environmental benefit of applying CCS regarding GWP impacts. The CCS systems have significantly higher impacts of Human Toxicity (HTP), Acidification (AP) and Eutrophication Potentials (EP). HTP impacts are over 50 % higher for CCS systems compared to Conventional. Increased NH 3 and NOx emissions make up much of the 100 - 150 % rise in AP and EP impacts. It is considered possible that flue gas handling can mitigate a substantial fraction of the increased AP and EP impacts. The system expansion reveal that building a Conventional CHP at Mongstad will not lead to global CO 2 reductions if it substitutes renewable electricity production. The CCS systems unreservedly give net global CO 2 reductions, disregarding alternative electricity production technology. The GWP eco-efficiency at Mongstad is defined as total LCA emissions from <b>refinery</b> <b>output</b> products divided by the economic value of the products. Introducing a CHP with CCS would significantly improve the eco-efficiency. Installing a Conventional plant, however, would deteriorate eco-efficiency. Installing a CHP with CCS is hence considered a significant step towards a sustainable development at Mongstad refinery. Given improved flue gas handling of NOx and NH 3, additional environmental effects are not considered to have potential of jeopardizing this conclusion...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a Non Linear Programming (NLP) model developed to optimize simultaneously a {{crude oil distillation}} unit (CDU) system and several cases of application run in a refinery as well. This model optimizes feedstock composition and operational conditions for a CDU System (ECOPETROL S. A.). The NLP Model uses a Metamodeling approach so as to represent Atmospheric Distillation Towers (ADT). The Vacuum Distillation Towers (VDT) are implemented assuming perfect separation (assay cuttings). The defined objective function is given by an economic profit. The CDU system consists basically of five industrial units and fourteen Colombian Crude Oils. Each Metamodel uses as independent variables: crude oil flow rates, operational conditions, Jet EBP, and Diesel T 95 % from ASTM D- 86 distillation curve. The output variables of the Metamodels are product flows, temperatures, and qualities. The developed NLP model was implemented in GAMS. The time needed for its solution is around 60 s while using the CONOPT solver. The NLP model results were successfully applied to a Colombian refinery for 3 consecutive weeks. The model {{was able to find}} the best use of installed equipments in CDUs through the preparation of a crude oil charge quasi-constant quality without matter the time period of the optimization.
