5|$|The {{second wave}} came in LCIs. These were craft {{that had no}} ramps; {{infantry}} disembarked from the down <b>gangways.</b> That they were not suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked, {{but they were all}} that was available. The first wave's mission had been to capture Scarlet Beach and the foreshore. Since that had not been done, they came under fire from the Japanese bunkers. Despite explicit orders not to, they replied with their Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Some helped to suppress the Japanese machine guns, while others fired wildly and caused casualties among the Australian troops ashore. Like the first wave, they veered off to the left, adding to the chaos. At least three of the LCIs grounded on a sand bar, but were able to retract and make better landings, although still on the wrong beach.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig <b>gangways,</b> Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E
25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal's two {{extendible}} <b>gangways,</b> {{designed specifically}} for the building are listed as items of state heritage significance in New South Wales, independently of the main terminal structure. These structures are unique and were specifically designed for use at the OPT. In its original state, there were five of these extendible <b>gangways</b> attached to the terminal. During the 1988 refurbishment two of these extendible <b>gangways</b> were removed and relocated to the Wharf 13 at Pyrmont and Wharf 10 at Darling Harbour.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the idea to develop the {{integrated}} model of offshore <b>gangway</b> model including multi-body dynamics model and hydraulic system model with bond-graph method in 20 -sim. And based on that model, active motion compensation control approach will developed in order to compensate the ship motion during <b>gangway</b> operation and further more a parallel position and force control method will be proposed to make the <b>gangway</b> tip maintain constant contact force with windmill platform as well as compensate ship motion during transferring process. In order to get reasonable data for modeling, simulation and control of <b>gangway</b> operation, an offshore <b>gangway</b> was designed first based on the relative rules and existing products from Uptime Company. Then multi-body dynamic model is developed with IC-field based on the Lagrangian Hamiltonian equation of <b>gangway.</b> After that, the hydraulic system for <b>gangway</b> was designed and verified with simulation. Based on this developed model, the control algorithm for active motion control and parallel position and force control were proposed. The active heave compensation control {{is based on}} the kinematics solving method to mapping the <b>gangway</b> tip trajectory to actuator trajectory and then control the actuator by position and velocity feedback with velocity feedforward controller. And the parallel position and force control was based on the inner positon loop outer force control and the idea is to adjust the desired <b>gangway</b> tip trajectory by the force modulator to achieve the desired contact force...|$|R

25|$|Boat 4 {{appears to}} have had about 42 people aboard (about 40 women and {{children}} and two or three crew members) when it was lowered. As it had been ordered, Perkis steered the boat {{along the side of the}} ship in search for open <b>gangways,</b> since he had been told to take on board more passengers through them, but found no one. This way, the boat ended up near the davits of Boat 16 (which had been already launched), and two greasers, Thomas Ranger and Frederick William Scott, who were standing near them, climbed down the falls to Boat 4 (Scott fell into the water but was hauled aboard the lifeboat). The boat then rowed away from the ship in order to avoid suction. A third man, lamp trimmer Samuel Ernest Hemming, climbed down the falls of another lifeboat and swam over to No. 4, which was about 200 yards far. Immediately after the sinking the boat rowed back to the wreckage to pick up more survivors (the only lifeboat to try immediately to do so). The boat picked up six or seven more men (trimmer Thomas Patrick Dillon, seaman William Henry Lyons, stewards Andrew Cunningham and Sidney Conrad Siebert, storekeeper Frank Winnold Prentice, and one or two more unidentified swimmers) from the water. Two (Siebert and Lyons) later died of exposure. The number of occupants later increased when other people were transferred from Boat 14 and Collapsible Boat D. By the time it reached Carpathia at 8:00a.m. it had about 60 occupants.|$|E

500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is a saprotrophic species, {{deriving}} {{nutrients from}} dead and decomposing organic matter, and grows {{in and around}} stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on bark, particularly the secondary phloem, rather than the wood. In the scheme of the succession of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, C.micaceus is a late stage colonizer, and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached [...] "a friable softened consistency". A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an endophyte, inhabiting the woody tissue of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms. The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots; {{it has also been}} noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments. In one instance it was discovered about 120m (400ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden <b>gangways</b> and props used to support the roof.|$|E

500|$|In early June 1940, about 13,500 {{evacuees}} {{were shipped}} to Casablanca in French Morocco. However, following the capitulation of the French to the German armies later in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found {{the presence of}} Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal. The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore Crichton, repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk. Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees. Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees), {{when he saw the}} mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his <b>gangways</b> for boarding. Just beforehand, the British fleet had destroyed a number of French warships at Mers el-Kebir in order to prevent them ending up in German hands. The attack, during which 1,297 French sailors died, led to high tensions, which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry, leaving many possessions behind. However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the Governor would not allow them to land, fearing that once the evacuees were back on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time. [...] Crowds gathered in John Mackintosh Square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two City Councillors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddell) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land. After receiving instructions from London, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock, and by 13 July the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed.|$|E
