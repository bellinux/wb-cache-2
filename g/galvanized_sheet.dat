2500|$|Enclosures for snails {{are usually}} long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers {{to walk around}} (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The {{enclosure}} may be a trough with sides made of wood, block, fiber cement sheets, or <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> steel. Cover it with screen or netting. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually [...] high plus at least 5inches into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{school is}} a one-story {{building}} with a concrete foundation and red limestone walls of ashlar construction. The corners of the building contain quoins of white limestone, and the roof is <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> metal. There are two entries to the building, on {{the east and west}} sides of the building. The main entry lies to the east, with the rear entry to the west. Both entries have double wooden doors inside of which is a vestibule adorned with stone piers with concrete arches. The schoolhouse architecture is of no particular singular style. American Craftsman and Bungalow style {{can be seen in the}} decorative wooden shingles below the gable ends, three-light panel doors, and knee braces; Romanesque Revival style is seen in the rounded arches of the two entries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wear tester UMT- 2 {{was used}} to study the {{friction}} wear characters of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheets</b> under dry friction and oil lubrication. Three-dimensional morphology instrument WYKONT 11 {{was used to}} observe the width and maximum depth of wear scars, surface roughness and surface topography. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of zinc coating compositions and tests of micro hardness were carried out. Then, the friction wear mechanism of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheets</b> was preliminary discussed. The experimental results indicate that, under dry friction, <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheets</b> experience three stages: run-in wear, abrasive wear and adhesive wear. Meanwhile, zinc coatings exfoliate until they lose efficacy. Good lubrication is propitious to protect zinc coatings and it can reduce friction wear. The research results can provide guidance for formability analysis and mold design of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

Albini achieved a signature [...] "clanky" [...] sound with his guitar by using metal guitar picks notched with sheet metal clips, creating the effect of two guitar picks at once. The Bulldozer EP was recorded with engineer Iain Burgess and released in December 1983, with the first two hundred copies packaged in a <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> metal sleeve in homage to Public Image Ltd.'s Metal Box. Many of the EP's lyrics depicted scenarios drawn from Albini's midwest upbringing, such as [...] "Cables", which described the slaughtering of cows at a Montana abattoir, and [...] "Pigeon Kill", about a rural Indiana town that dealt with an overpopulation of pigeons by feeding them poisoned corn.|$|E

50|$|Steel mills produce <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> steel, {{the base}} {{material}} for the manufacture of cold formed steel profiles. Sheet steel is then roll-formed into the final profiles used for framing. The sheets are zinc coated (galvanized) to prevent oxidation and corrosion. Steel framing provides excellent design flexibility due to the high strength to weight ratio of steel, which allows it to span over a long distances, and also resist wind and earthquake loads.|$|E

40|$|The plasma-activated {{removal of}} oil from {{contaminated}} silicon substrates and <b>galvanized</b> steel <b>sheets</b> has been performed using dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) at athmospheric pressure. Removal rates were determined by ellipsometric measurement of the oil film thickness, using polished silicon as substrates. With <b>galvanized</b> steel <b>sheets,</b> qualitative and quantitative investigations were done using fluorescence microscopic characterization of the plasma-treated surfaces. Both the ellipsometric and the fluorescence microscopic measurements yield the dependence of the removal rate on treatment parameters such as plasma-gas composition and gas flow. The film thickness measurements were calibrated using quantitative IR spectroscopic measurements. It could be shown that the removal rate increases with increasing oxygen content in the process gas, static removal rates of 0. 6 nm/s and 7 nm/s being obtained in pure nitrogen and in pure oxygen, respectively. Fluorescence microscopic investigations showed that oil can be removed even from grooves in the <b>galvanized</b> steel <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} copper strips as an insert {{material}} on electrode failure {{has been studied}} during spot welding of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheets.</b> The results showed that an extended electrode lifetime was obtained due {{to the use of}} copper strips between electrode and workpiece which prevented electrode from alloying with molten zinc and lowered the temperature of electrode tip. In addition, the presence of inserted copper strip increased the resistance of welding system, thus generated much more heat to form larger nugget The electrode degradation mechanism was basically caused by deformation at electrode tip and wear...|$|R
