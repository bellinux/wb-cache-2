This {{is often referred to}} as multiple electrode strategy, and is most common when the tool electrode replicates in negative the wanted shape and is advanced towards the blank along a single direction, usually the vertical direction (i.e. z-axis). This resembles the sink of the tool into the dielectric liquid in which the workpiece is immersed, so, not surprisingly, it {{is often referred to as}} <b>die-sinking</b> EDM (also called conventional EDM and ram EDM). The corresponding machines are often called sinker EDM. Usually, the electrodes of this type have quite complex forms.

5000|$|Around {{the end of}} World War I, {{machine tool}} control {{advanced}} in various ways that {{laid the groundwork for}} later CNC technology. The jig borer popularized the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part from a single reference point); working routinely in [...] "tenths" [...] (ten-thousandths of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for <b>die-sinking</b> via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made diesinking faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer movements to input for servos that worked the machine leadscrews or hydraulics. They also spurred the development of antibacklash leadscrew nuts. All of the above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except for CNC control itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{millimeter}} wave {{frequency range}} {{has got a}} lot of attention {{over the past few years}} because it contains unused frequency spectrum resources that are suitable for delivering Gbit/s end-user access in areas with high user density. Due to the limited output power that current RF active components can deliver in millimeter waves, antennas with the merits of low profile, high gain, high effciency and low cost are needed to compensate free space path loss and increase the communication distance for the emerging high data rate wireless systems. In order to move towards the millimeter wave frequencies we need to face significant hardware challenges, such as active and passive components integration, packaging problems and cost-effective manufacturing techniques. The gap waveguide technology shows interesting characteristics as a new waveguide structure. It may be suitable to fill the existing gap between the planar transmission lines, such as microstrip, coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide and the non-planar hollow waveguides in terms of performance, such as loss and fabrication flexibility at high frequencies. Gap waveguide has a planar profile, and it can be used as low loss distribution network for an antenna array. This thesis mainly focuses on passive components design, in particular array antennas and bandpass filters based on gap waveguide technology. We present several low-profile multilayer corporate-fed slot array antennas with high gain, high effciency and wide impedance bandwidth for the 60 -GHz band. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the advantages of gap waveguide technology as an alternative to the traditional guiding structures to overcome the problem of good electrical contact due to mechanical assembly with low loss. The main challenge of gap waveguide components is the realization of the textured structure (pin surface) with a cost-effective manufacturing method. Due to the relatively complex pattern and physical dimensions of the textured structure, the fabrication of the gap prototypes introduces a challenging task, especially at millimeter wave frequencies. Therefore, we are continuously searching for effective alternative methods.

The focus {{of this study is}} solely on the improvements of electrode use in EDM finishing-processes. The surface finish quality itself is not an area of concern other than maintaining that it does not diminish. The focused concern is maximizing the process by using one electrode unmodified for multiple-finishing operations. The objective for improvement is utilization of one finishing electrode used multiple times rather than only one finishing electrode per die. Utilizing a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), the inspection of specific locations on the finishing electrode reveals the repeatability and accuracy of use for one finishing electrode for six gear forging-dies. Initial experimentation validates the capabilities to finish four dies accurately in two separate die configurations with one electrode. To accomplish finishing the four initial dies, a <b>die-sinking</b> EDM machine that possesses a large enough working envelope was included in the process.

An important {{application of this}} technology is in the drilling of fuel injector nozzle holes for diesel engines. Past research in <b>die-sinking</b> and wire-cut EDM has established that {{the single most important}} factor influencing the EDM process is the spark-gap condition. While adaptive control systems have been developed and utilized successfully in <b>die-sinking</b> and wire-cut EDM applications, the state of art of EDM for drilling micro-holes is still in a primitive stage in terms of spark-gap control.

A high speed measurement system capable of sampling up to 250 MSamples/sec is used to measure the gap-voltage, gap-current and radio frequency emissions from the gap and the data is stored for off-line analysis. A classifier has been developed using digital signal processing techniques to classify the discharges into good and bad machining discharges. Parametric studies have been conducted to understand the effect of the controllable EDM parameters on the spark-gap conditions and on the resulting quality of the micro-hole.
