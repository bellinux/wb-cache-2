25|$|Motion picture film, {{primarily}} because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard C-41 process color film. The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film <b>developer</b> <b>bath,</b> the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.|$|E
50|$|After exposure, {{the paper}} is {{processed}} using chemicals in the darkroom to produce the final print. The paper must {{be placed in a}} film <b>developer</b> <b>bath,</b> a stop bath, fixer, and finally the hypo-eliminator bath, in that order. Failure to adhere precisely to this process will result in a poor-quality final image with a variety of issues.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} houses (Nos. 1 and 2) {{were built in}} the early 19th century and {{completed}} c. 1817 but a financial crisis (resulting from the Bath Bank crash in 1793) meant that <b>Bath</b> <b>developers</b> were struggling to raise money for new houses.|$|R
5000|$|Pre-bleach bath: 2:00 @ 90-103 °F (32.2-39.4 °C). This bath was {{previously}} called [...] "conditioner", but was renamed pre-bleach {{in the mid-1990s}} to reflect the removal of formaldehyde from the process used in the final rinse. In this solution, formaldehyde acts as a dye preservative and EDTA is used to [...] "kick off" [...] the bleach. The pre-bleach bath relies on carry-over of the color developer to function properly, therefore there is no wash step between the color <b>developer</b> and pre-bleach <b>baths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|E-6: Current Ektachrome process {{used for}} all major color {{reversal}} films and formats, first released in 1977. The conditioner, bleach and stabilizer baths were modified in the mid-1990s to remove the formaldehyde from the stabilizer: This change was indicated by changing {{the names of the}} conditioner step to pre-bleach step, and the stabilizer step to the final rinse step; E-6P: Used for push processing of Kodak Ektachrome films in general, and particularly for Kodak Ektachrome EPH ISO 1600 film, which has a speed of ISO 400 in normal E6, but is exposed at EI 1600 and push processed two stops in the first <b>developer</b> <b>bath</b> (10:00 @100.0F) to achieve the ISO 1600 speed rating. (It is natural for a faster film to require a longer first development time. This is sacrificed in the case of most color processing for consistency in processing, especially in machine processing.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Next, {{the film}} is {{developed}} to completion in the colour <b>developer</b> <b>bath,</b> which contains CD-3 as the colour developing agent. When film enters the colour developer, the reversal agent absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or [...] "exposes") the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The colour developer acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is {{not a part of}} the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the [...] "leftover" [...] of the negative image, that is, a positive image. As the colour development progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised colour developer molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes in situ. Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to [...] "kick off" [...] the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is changed to iron (II) EDTA ({Fe+++ EDTA} + {Ag^\circ} + Br^- -> {Fe++ EDTA} + AgBr) before fixing, and final wash. The most common processing chemistry for such films is E6, derived from a long line of developers produced for the Ektachrome range of films.|$|E
40|$|Two I. C. {{fabrication}} process steps and {{the extraction of}} simulation model parameters for them are investigated. Plasma etching of tantalum polycide using chlorinated freons and sulfur hexaflouride is studied. It is shown that nearly vertical gate structures are achieved using these gasses, {{without the need for}} chlorine gas. Photoresist dissolution is also studied. A suite of software, PAREX, has been written which allows the automatic extraction of model parameters from experimental data gathered on a Perkin-Elmer Development Rate Monitor. An example using Kodak 820 photoresist developed in Kodak 809 is given, and the derived parameters are compared to previous characterization values. Lower values are found for high exposures, likely due to the lower level of agitation in the <b>developer</b> <b>bath</b> than in the previous measurement system. In addition, the surface retardation effect is much more difficult to extract due to noise in the data and {{it does not seem to}} be as pronounced possibly due to the lower level of agitation and to noise in the experimental data.

50|$|There are two {{versions}} of the E-6 process. Commercial laboratories use a six-bath chemical process. The 'hobby' type chemistry kits, such as those produced by Tetenal, use three chemical baths that combine the color <b>developer</b> and fogging <b>bath</b> solutions, and the pre-bleach, bleach and fixer bath solutions. The three-bath process has a discrete color developer step in between. However, the three-bath version of the process suffers from poor process control, with color shifts and color crossover, mainly because of insufficient bleaching, fixing or both in the bleach-fixer ("blix") stage.|$|R
50|$|Treehouse {{was founded}} by Ryan Carson, a {{computer}} science graduate from Colorado State University. After graduating, Carson worked for Fingal, a design agency in London before moving to Bath, United Kingdom. In 2004, Ryan Carson and his wife Gillian Carson founded Carsonified, a company built towards training web designers and <b>developers</b> based in <b>Bath,</b> United Kingdom. In addition to training designers and developers, Carsonified also created web applications and hosted web industry events, conferences and workshops. In 2008 Carsonified sold its file-sharing application DropSend to the Florida-based company Webminds. In 2011, Ryan Carson sold Carsonified which is now named Future Insights and started working on his new project, Treehouse.|$|R
50|$|In March 1792 a {{solicitor}} named Richard Bowsher took a {{lease on}} 5 acre of land {{next to the}} river Avon at {{what was then the}} western edge of the city of Bath. The lease stipulated houses of similar style and quality to those being erected in the nearby New King Street should be built on the land. As with other <b>Bath</b> <b>developers,</b> Bowsher's sub-leased plots of ground to craftsmen, on the condition that they would build houses on them, which would subsequently be let out to wealthy families. Several streets were planned with over 100 houses, the centrepiece being a crescent called Norfolk Place (later changed to Norfolk Crescent). The architect John Palmer was engaged to designed a facade for the buildings.|$|R
5|$|The baths were {{originally}} built in approximately 1815, {{by a local}} builder called Newton, from John Pinch the elder's design, on the Duke of Cleveland's land, giving the site its name. They were intended as public pleasure baths, and {{are believed to be}} the oldest surviving outdoor swimming baths in England. The area of Bath to the north and east of the River Avon was undergoing development {{at the end of the}} 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, after the opening of Pulteney Bridge on land around Bathwick which had been owned by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. William Johnstone had inherited the land and planned to create a new town. It was foreseen that, along with the access provided by Pulteney Bridge and Great Pulteney Street, the eastern side of the Avon would become popular with speculators and <b>developers,</b> as <b>Bath</b> had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors. In the 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. After 1789, the financial climate did not encourage further building, as the Panic of 1797, related to a period of deflation between 1793 and 1800, was followed by the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the Depression of 1807. These limited the proposed development of new housing in the area for some years. The Bathwick Water Act of 1801 had prohibited nude bathing in the river and meant that many local subscribers were willing to put money into the construction of the baths.|$|R
