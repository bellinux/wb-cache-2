Sesquiterpenes are terpenes composed of three isoprene units and therefore have 15 carbon atoms. Sesquiterpenes are widely distributed in nature and are found in plants as well as animals, for example in the <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone</b> of insects. Plants use sesquiterpenes as a defense compound against insects. According to some studies, sesquiterpenes have antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, or immunostimulant effects.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three {{thoracic}} ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia.

The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect.

5|$|While there aren’t many {{external}} morphological {{differences between}} queens and workers {{there are some}} internal traits that can be signals of a wasp’s social status. It has also been found that caste determination is irreversibly determined by temperature during the immature stages of development. In one experiment, some wasps emerging in June were kept in long day chambers, or chambers set at 26°C with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. These individuals had larger and more active ovaries as {{compared to those who}} were incubated in short day chambers, which are set at 22°C with 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness. It is thought that this phenomenon may occur because of a <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion that determines the castes and a suppression of the workers’ ovaries by environmental or hormonal factors.|$|E

25|$|In insects, synephrine {{has been}} found to be a very potent agonist at many {{invertebrate}} octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation.

Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (<b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone)</b> release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus.|$|E
2500|$|Foundress {{associations}} in Polistes species establish clear dominant and subordinate relationships {{in which the}} dominant gains the most reproduction success.

40|$|Ecdysteroids (moulting hormones), juvenoids and neuropeptides in ticks are {{reviewed}} but, by far, {{the emphasis is}} on the former since this class of hormones {{has been the subject of}} most investigations. In immature stages of ticks, ecdysteroids have been shown to regulate moulting and to terminate larval diapause. Although there is a paucity of information on the molecular action of ecdysteroids in ticks, their action appears to be via a heterodimeric ecdysone/ultraspiracle receptor, as in insects. The role of ecdysteroids in sperm maturation in adult males is considered. In females, ecdysteroids function in the regulation of salivary glands, of production of sex pheromones and of oogenesis and oviposition. There is evidence for ecdysteroid production in the integument and pathways of hormone inactivation are similar to those in insects. Ecdysteroids also function in embryogenesis.

50|$|The larvae of burying beetles feed {{partly by}} begging for predigested carrion {{from parents and}} partly by self-feeding. In this species, <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone,</b> a major {{regulatory}} insect hormone, stimulates begging and growth.

50|$|In insects {{growth and}} {{metamorphosis}} {{are controlled by}} hormones synthesized by endocrine glands {{near the front of}} the body (anterior). Neurosecretory cells in an insect's brain secrete a hormone, the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) that activates prothoracic glands, which secrete a second hormone, usually ecdysone (an ecdysteroid), that induces ecdysis.PTTH also stimulates the corpora allata, a retrocerebral organ, to produce <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone,</b> which prevents the development of adult characteristics during ecdysis. In holometabolous insects, molts between larval instars have a high level of <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone,</b> the moult to the pupal stage has a low level of <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone,</b> and the final, or imaginal, molt has no <b>juvenile</b> <b>hormone</b> present at all.
