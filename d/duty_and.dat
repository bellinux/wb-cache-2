40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and interpret}} adolescents´ lived experiences of their rights, <b>duties</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities {{in relation to}} their health choices. Fourteen focus group interviews with 67 adolescents aged 15 and 16 were conducted and analysed using the phenomenological hermeneutical method. Adolescents´ lived experiences of their rights {{in relation to their}} health choices were described as things that were allowed. <b>Duties</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities were perceived as something that they were required to carry out for their own health or other people´s health. Although their experiences of rights, <b>duties</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities overlapped, they referred to different aspects of their health choices. Adolescents viewed their rights, <b>duties</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities in the wider context, with parents and society defining their opportunities to make independent choices. We found that ethical considerations influenced adolescents´ choices and, the opportunities to exercise their rights, <b>duties</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities varied. Further consideration and recognition of these issues are needed...|$|R

5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for <b>duty,</b> <b>and</b> the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public <b>duty,</b> <b>and</b> is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.

In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative <b>duty,</b> <b>and</b> that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
