40|$|We {{identified}} the beetle fauna of springs {{of a small}} lowland river and attempted to determine the direction and magnitude of beetle migration between the springs and neighboring water bodies in the river valley, {{as well as the}} local environmental factors and landscape parameters that most influence the character of aquatic beetle assemblages in the springs. We studied springs of three limnological types, along {{the entire length of the}} river valley, and identified 42 beetle species. All types of springs were dominated by stagnobiontic species, which enter springs from other aquatic environments, mainly via dispersion by air. We also found a small proportion of crenophiles and a substantial proportion of rheophiles and tyrphophiles, which was linked to the close proximity of the river and <b>dystrophic</b> <b>water</b> bodies. The fauna of the springs was affected to a similar degree by local environmental factors and by landscape factors acting on a broader scale. This indicates the need for broader consideration of landscape factors, which are often neglected in ecological studies...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{matter in}} soils will {{accumulate}} {{according to a}} series of interrelated factors, namely the climate (particularly temperature), topography, moisture of the soil, the rate of litter fall, the role played by soil micro flora and microfauna, the soil protective capacity (including mineralogy) and the local fire regime. In simple terms, with more organic matter, surface moisture will increase, hence the likelihood that micro climates can influence, even 2 ̆ 7 edaphically 2 ̆ 7 control, fires. The reverse holds too: the drier the soil the more likely it will be to ignite when exposed to fire. Organic matter can thereby influence locally the fire regime by regulating soil moisture. In places where organic matter is likely to accumulate at the soil surface and contribute significantly {{to the development of the}} soil, such as shaded areas, depressions or other cool, moist places, wetland characteristics follow. Water quality associated with such wetland soils has a tendency towards stained, slightly acidic, stratified, <b>dystrophic</b> <b>water,</b> with bottom layers depleted in oxygen. Individual organic-rich wetlands or wetland systems have their own unique suite of invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and vascular and non-vascular plants. These biota are likely to be dependent upon local hydrology and physico-chemical characteristics regulated by the relationship between climate and the presence and condition of organic matter. Our hypothesis is that the dynamic biophysical characteristics and states of these local organic-rich systems can be altered permanently or at least disrupted by the application of an inappropriate fire regime. With frequent hot fires, or any frequent regime designed to systematically remove organic matter, fire can become a geomorphological agent by burning the soil, altering water quality by exposing anaerobic soils to air (i. e. acidification following the exposure of iron sulphides), and threatening elements of biodiversity dependent on the organic matter/moisture relationship. We support this hypothesis with evidence from several recent and on-going studies. and in doing so construct a partial bio-geography of south-west Western Australia (WA), emphasizing the relictual nature of organic-rich, moist places, and the edaphic control of fire...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 23 {{ostracod}} {{species have}} been recorded from surface and short core samples from the Qilian Mountains, NW China. Brooks and rivers, small shallow meadow and oxbow pools and a lake were sampled at an altitude ranging from 2900 m to 3570 m asl. Brooks were dominated by Candona rawsoni, Ilyocypris cf. bradyi and/or Ilyocypris lacustris and Limnocythere inopinata. In river habitats Candona candida and Eucypris sp. were most abundant. Meadow pools with peaty, <b>dystrophic</b> <b>waters</b> mainly contained valves of Ilyocypris cf. bradyi and/or Ilyocypris lacustris and Eucypris sp. whereas the latter was replaced by Heterocypris incongruens in a shallow oxbow pool. Candona rawsoni, Cyclocypris ovum and Ilyocypris echinata were the most frequent species in the freshwater Lake Luanhaizi. The recorded taxa are mainly distributed in the holarctic realm but Fabaeformiscandona danielopoli and Ilyocypris echinata appear to be restricted to the cold mountainous region in China...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{aspects of the}} {{limnology}} of dystrophic lentic freshwaters are covered in this thesis. Initially, studies covering {{a wide range of}} heterogeneous lakes and reservoirs from several different areas are reported, to give an overall perspective of many of the roles dissolved humic substances play in various limnological processes. More detailed case studies of a number of dystrophic lakes and reservoirs are then outlined, to demonstrate how dissolved humic substances actively influence the limnology of these individual waters. Investigations of the underwater light climates of fifty lakes and reservoirs fr om Tasmania, thirty-seven from north-east New South Wales, and of twenty-six coastal dune lakes in south-east Queensland showed that dissolved humic substances were the major attenuators of light in all three areas. Increasing gilvin concentrations led to the rapid extinction of light at shallow depths, and to changes in its underwater spectral distribution from green-yellow in the clearest waters, to red in the most humic. Turbidity and phytoplankton were important contributors to attenuation in {{only a few of the}} waters studied. Results from Tasmania allowed the construction of a predictive model for use in estimating the underwater light climates of the many remote lakes of the island where in situ measurements are impossible, from simple laboratory measurements of small water samples. The rapid attenuation of light in humic waters also strongly affects thermal stratification, leading to strong thermal gradients, shallow thermoclines, and lengthy periods of stratification. Chemical aspects were also examined. Strong negative correlations were found between the concentration of dissolved humic substances and pH in coastal dune lake waters from south-east Queensland, King and Fl inders I s l and s, and we s tern and south-wes t Tasmania. In contrast, there was no correlation between these two parameters in north-east New South Wales waters, probably due to lower humic concentrations and buffering by higher bicarbonate levels. Calcium and bicarbonate levels were also some times low in acidic, dystrophic lakes. A wide range of photo synthetic organisms were present in the sites investigated from New South Wales, Queensland, and coastal lakes of south-west Tasmania. Phytoplankton came both from the Chlorophyceae and from other algal divisions, and desmids and dinoflagellates were e specially common. Proportions of green algae decreased relative to those with accessory photosynthetic pigments, as humic concentration increased, in the highly humic western and south-west Tasmanian lagoons, but this was not apparent in the less <b>dystrophic</b> <b>waters</b> of the other two areas. However, high humic concentrations reduced the number of phytoplankton genera present from all groups. Chrysophytes dominated the phytoplankton communities of polyhumic Lake Chisholm. Studies of Lake Chisholm, the reservoirs of the Pieman River Power Development, and the meronictic lakes of the lower Gordon River, all in Tasmania, showed humic materials played an important role in their limnology. The rapid attenuation of light, and subsequent strong thermal stratification for much of the year lead to sluggish circulation, all owing near-meromictic conditions in Lake Chisholm, and the protection and resultant slowing of the demise of ectogenic meromixis in the Gordon River lakes. These features, along with enhancing the solubility of iron and manganese in the reducing, sulphide laden bottom waters of the Pieman River reservoirs, enabled their chemical stratification. However, other factors, such as basin morphometry and shelter, are also of importance in the limnology of these lakes and reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) is {{the major}} water channel {{expressed}} in brain perivascular astrocyte processes. Although the role of AQP 4 in brain edema has been extensively investigated, little information exists regarding its functional role at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of this work is to integrate previous and recent data regarding AQP 4 expression during BBB formation and depending on BBB integrity, using several experimental models. Results from studies on the chick optic tectum, a well-established model of BBB development, {{and the effect of}} lipopolysaccharide on the BBB integrity and on perivascular AQP 4 expression have been analyzed and discussed. Moreover, data on the BBB structure and AQP 4 expression in murine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are reviewed. In particular, published results obtained from mdX(3 cv) mice have been analyzed together with new data obtained from mdx mice in which all the dystrophin isoforms including DP 71 are strongly reduced. Finally, the role of the endothelial component on AQP 4 cellular expression and distribution has been investigated using rat primary astrocytes and brain capillary endothelial cell co-cultures as an in vitro model of BBB.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} the zooplankton and epiphytic diatom communities of permanent and temporary freshwater pans in the Mpumalanga Highveld region of South Africa. Few studies have investigated the biota of pans in this area, which is seriously threatened by mining and agricultural development. Nineteen pan sites within a 20 km radius covering a wide range of water chemistries were sampled once for zooplankton, epiphytic diatoms and water physico-chemical data in 2009. Collected zooplankton and diatom samples were identified to species or genus level. Many of the zooplankton taxa reported in this study were not recorded in similar pan studies in South Africa and southern Africa. The study revealed a difference among the compositions of zooplankton and diatom communities between temporary pans and permanent pans. Zooplankton found exclusively in freshwater temporary pans included cladocerans (Megafenestra aurita and Scapholeberis kingi), calanoids (Mesocyclops major and Thermodiaptomus mixtus), a cyclopoid (Acanthocyclops vernalis) and a rotifer (Platyias quadricornis). Permanent pans were characterized by taxa such as cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia rigaudi and Dunhevedia crassa), a calanoid (Metadiaptomus transvaalensis), cyclopoids (Paracyclops fimbriatus and Eucyclops gibsoni) and rotifers (Brachionus dimidiatus and Brachionus plicatilis). The most commonly occurring diatom taxa in temporary pans included taxa indicative of slightly acidic to circumneutral, <b>dystrophic</b> and nutrient-poor <b>waters</b> such as Nitzschia acidoclinata, Gomphonema gracile and Eunotia bilunaris. Permanent pan assemblages were characterized by taxa typical of saline waters, including Nitzschia frustulum, Amphora veneta and Planothidium engelbrechtii. Species of the genera Pinnularia and Eunotia were almost totally absent from permanent pans. [URL]...|$|R
