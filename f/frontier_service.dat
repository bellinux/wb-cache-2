25|$|The British <b>Frontier</b> <b>Service</b> was a British {{government}} organisation {{that was}} responsible for border monitoring duties in West Germany between 1946 and 1991. Its personnel served on Germany's international borders with Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium before focusing on the inner German border. It was charged {{with a number of}} tasks, including assisting the movements of British military personnel and their dependents, monitoring the border regions and helping to defuse border incidents. It was ultimately disbanded following German reunification.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, British {{troops in}} Germany were {{deployed}} along the international borders of the British zone of Allied-occupied Germany to control the flow of refugees and prevent smuggling. They were replaced in 1946 by the Frontier Control Service, a civilian frontier force administered by the British Control Commission of Germany. It went through a series of names thereafter: the Frontier Control Service from 1946–49; the Frontier Inspection Service, 1949–55; and British <b>Frontier</b> <b>Service,</b> 1955-91.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} West German state organisations were {{responsible}} for policing {{the western side of}} the border. These included the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS, Federal Border Protection), the Bayerische Grenzpolizei (Bavarian Border Police) and the Bundeszollverwaltung (Federal Customs Administration). In addition, the British Army, the British <b>Frontier</b> <b>Service,</b> the United States Constabulary, and the United States Army carried out patrols and provided backup in their respective sectors of the border. West German troops were not allowed to approach within one kilometre of the border individually or within five kilometres in formation without being accompanied by BGS personnel.|$|E
25|$|The border {{was also}} patrolled in the British sector by the British <b>Frontier</b> <b>Service</b> (BFS), the {{smallest}} of the Western border surveillance organisations. The BFS had been established (as the Frontier Control Service) in 1946 to take over control of border crossing points from the British Army. Its personnel manned frontier control posts along all of the international and interzonal borders of the British sector, including the Danish and Dutch borders as well as the inner German border. The German customs service was re-established under BFS supervision and manned crossing points on the borders of the British zone of occupation along with BFS personnel. When German sovereignty was re-established in 1955, customs responsibilities were handed over to the Germans. A heavily reduced BFS remained in operation to serve as a liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border. One curiosity of the BFS was that despite being entirely land-based, its founding Director was a Royal Navy captain. He instituted the highly distinctive uniform of the BFS, designed in a quasi-naval style with silver rank badges. The BFS was finally disbanded in 1990 following Germany's reunification.|$|E

In 2005 the Australian Inland Mission Hospital at Birdsville closed, after serving as a hospital for 53 years. Its function was taken over by the Diamantina Shire Council, which built a clinic on adjacent land provided by the Uniting Church <b>Frontier</b> <b>Services.</b> The former AIM Hospital remains the property of The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (Qld), which holds the land and buildings in trust for <b>Frontier</b> <b>Services,</b> but is now open to the public as the [...] "Old Birdsville Hospital historical display".|$|R

2500|$|On December 14, 1877, {{the young}} Bigelow {{reported}} for duty at Fort Duncan in West Texas. He {{was assigned to}} Company B, 9th Cavalry. In time he learned to become a cavalry trooper. [...] His handsome looks turned many a lady's head and he left many broken hearts behind him. His language skills and presentation were also a plus for him. His journals and sketches created a colorful portrait of his <b>frontier</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Gibbs {{graduated}} from the United States Military Academy {{in the class of}} 1846, served and was twice wounded in the Mexican-American War and was wounded again by Apaches during <b>frontier</b> <b>service</b> in 1857. His pre-Civil War career was in cavalry service. [...] During the Civil War, Gibbs commanded the only Union army volunteer regiment which was converted from an infantry regiment entirely to a cavalry regiment: The 130th New York Infantry converted to the 1st Regiment New York Dragoons.|$|E
2500|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of the Union Cavalry in the East was chaotic. At {{the beginning of the}} Civil War, officers were elected by the men or appointed politically. This resulted in many misguided and inept commanders. The tools and techniques of pre-war cavalry often seemed inadequate, resulting in a steep learning curve that was costly in men and supplies. Slowly out the chaos came the tactics and leaders who proved worthy of the challenge. Union [...] "horse soldiers" [...] became cavalry troopers under this tough regimen and proved adept, dismounted and mounted on horseback, with their carbines, pistols, sabers and confident under their battle-proven leaders. Claflin had a head start due to his <b>frontier</b> <b>service</b> and West Point service that helped the regiment adapt. [...] He was at Yorktown from June to August 1862. But was noted at the Seven Days Battles (June 25 to July 1, 1862), then served as the regimental commissary officer from August 27 to September 5, 1862. [...] He was assigned to several company commands starting in September where his focus was training, manning and supplying those companies to fight as cavalry. [...] In April 1863, he was assigned to command Company H of the 6th, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} service, except for when he was a staff officer of the regiment.|$|E

In 2014, Prince commissioned {{the company to}} modify Thrush 510G crop-dusters with surveillance equipment, machine guns, armor, and other weapons, including custom pylons that could mount either NATO or Russian ballistics. One of the modified crop-dusters was delivered to Salva Kiir Mayardit's forces in South Sudan shortly before a contract with <b>Frontier</b> <b>Services</b> Group was cancelled. <b>Frontier</b> <b>Services</b> Group owns two of the modified Thrush 510Gs, but since executives learned the craft had been weaponized by Prince, the company has declined to sell or use the aircraft to avoid violating U.S. export controls.|$|R

6000|$|Washington, {{who was at}} Raystown {{when the}} {{disastrous}} news arrived, was publicly complimented by General Forbes on the gallant conduct of his Virginian troops, and Bullitt's behavior was [...] "a matter of great admiration."

60|$|The {{manner in}} which Washington was {{received}} by Lord Loudoun on arriving in Philadelphia, showed him at once, that his long, explanatory letter had produced the desired effect, and that his character and conduct were justly appreciated.

He advised that an attack should be made on Fort Duquesne, simultaneous with the attempts on Canada. At such time {{a great part of}} the garrison would be drawn away to aid in the defence of that province, and a blow might be struck more likely to insure the peace and safety of the southern frontier, than all its forts and defences.|$|E

60|$|After {{the close}} of the British war, he {{remained}} in the <b>frontier</b> <b>service</b> of the West, till 1818. He was then transferred to the Southern frontier, where he remained, most of the time, in active service till 1826. In 1819, and during his service in the South, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1826 he was again sent to the North-West, where he continued until 1836. In 1832 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. In 1836 he was ordered to the South to engage in what is well known as the Florida War. In the autumn of 1837 he fought and conquered in the memorable Battle of Okeechobee, one of the most desperate struggles known to the annals of Indian warfare. For this he was honored with the rank of Brigadier-General; and in 1838 was appointed to succeed General Jessup in command of the forces in Florida. In 1841 he was ordered to Fort Gibson to take command of the Second Military Department of the United States; and in September, 1844, was directed to hold the troops between the Red River and the Sabine in readiness to march as might be indicated by the charge of the United States, near Texas. In 1845 his forces were concentrated at Corpus Christi.|$|E
60|$|The din {{and stir}} of warlike {{preparation}} disturbed {{the quiet of}} Mount Vernon. Washington looked down from his rural retreat upon the ships of war and transports as they passed up the Potomac, with the array of arms gleaming along their decks. The booming of cannon echoed among his groves. Alexandria was but a few miles distant. Occasionally he mounted his horse, and rode to that place; {{it was like a}} garrisoned town, teeming with troops, and resounding with the drum and fife. A brilliant campaign was about to open under the auspices of an experienced general, and with all the means and appurtenances of European warfare. How different from the starveling expeditions he had hitherto been doomed to conduct! What an opportunity to efface the memory of his recent disaster! All his thoughts of rural life were put to flight. The military part of his character was again in the ascendant; his great desire was to join the expedition as a volunteer. It was reported to General Braddock. The latter was apprised by Governor Dinwiddie, and others, of Washington's personal merits, his knowledge of the country, and his experience in <b>frontier</b> <b>service.</b> The consequence was a letter from Captain Robert Orme, one of Braddock's aides-de-camp, written by the general's order, inviting Washington to join his staff.|$|E
