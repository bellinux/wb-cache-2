5000|$|An {{example of}} such a {{construct}} is the <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> in Pascal. Pascal requires that procedures be declared or fully defined before use. This helps a one-pass compiler with its type checking: calling a procedure that hasn't been declared anywhere is a clear error. <b>Forward</b> <b>declarations</b> help mutually recursive procedures call each other directly, despite the declare-before-use rule: ...|$|R
5000|$|The term forward {{reference}} is sometimes {{used as a}} synonym of <b>forward</b> <b>declaration.</b> However, more often it is taken {{to refer to the}} actual use of an entity before any declaration; that is, the first reference to [...] in the code above is a {{forward reference}}. Thus, we may say that because <b>forward</b> <b>declarations</b> are mandatory in Pascal, forward references are prohibited.|$|R

50|$|Using <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> {{to prevent}} {{circular}} references {{is a bad}} practice as it often hide an architectural problem that should be solved using interfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Note that {{although}} a name (e.g. [...] ) can be declared multiple times, {{such as in}} <b>forward</b> <b>declarations,</b> {{it can only be}} defined once (the One Definition Rule).|$|R

50|$|When Basic4GL {{was first}} {{released}} {{it had no}} support for functions. That changed however when version 2.5.0 was released in January 2008. Now Basic4GL has full support for local variables, parameters, <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> and recursion.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, a <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> is {{a declaration}} of an identifier (denoting an entity such as a type, a variable, a constant, or a function) for which the programmer has not yet given a complete definition.|$|R
50|$|Here the {{variable}} NodePtr is a pointer {{to the data}} type Node, a record. Pointers can be used before they are declared. This is a <b>forward</b> <b>declaration,</b> {{an exception to the}} rule that things must be declared before they are used.|$|R
5000|$|... enum class Color : long {Red, Green, Blue}; // must fit in {{size and}} memory layout the type 'long'enum class Shapes : char; // <b>forward</b> <b>declaration.</b> If later there are values defined that don't fit in 'char' it is an error.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>declaration</b> of a {{class is}} not {{sufficient}} {{if you need to}} use the actual class type, for example, if you have a member whose type is that class directly (not a pointer), or if you need {{to use it as a}} base class, or if you need to use the methods of the class in a method.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{languages}} (e.g. Haskell and Java) tend {{to avoid}} copybooks or includes, preferring modules and import/export systems for namespace control. Some of these languages (such as Java and C#) {{do not use}} <b>forward</b> <b>declarations</b> and, instead, identifiers are recognized automatically from source files and read directly from dynamic library symbols, meaning header files are not needed.|$|R
5000|$|In Pascal {{and other}} Wirth {{programming}} languages, it {{is a general}} rule that all entities must be declared before use, and thus <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> is necessary for mutual recursion, for instance. In C, the same general rule applies, but with an exception for undeclared functions and incomplete types. Thus, in C it is possible (although unwise) to implement a pair of mutually recursive functions thus: ...|$|R
5000|$|See {{reflection}} {{for calling}} and declaring functions by strings. Pascal requires [...] "forward;" [...] for <b>forward</b> <b>declarations.</b> Eiffel allows the specification of an applications root class and feature. In Fortran, function/subroutine parameters are called arguments (since PARAMETER is a language keyword); the CALL keyword {{is required for}} subroutines. Instead of using [...] "foo", a string variable may be used instead containing the same value.|$|R
50|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages and}} other computer files have a directive, often called '''''' (as well as '''''' and ''''''), {{that causes the}} contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These included files are called copybooks or s. They are often used to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code and/or <b>forward</b> <b>declarations</b> while promoting encapsulation and the reuse of code.|$|R
50|$|Implementation of {{circular}} dependencies in C/C++ {{can be a}} bit tricky, {{because any}} class or structure definition must be placed above its usage in the same file. A circular dependency between classes A and B will thus both require the definition of A to be placed above B, and the definition of B to be placed above A, which of course is impossible. A <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> is therefore needed to accomplish this.|$|R
50|$|In other {{languages}} <b>forward</b> <b>declarations</b> are not necessary, which generally requires instead a multi-pass compiler {{and for some}} compilation to be deferred to link time. In these cases identifiers must be defined (variables initialized, functions defined) before they are used in execution, but {{do not need to}} be defined before they are used in source code for compilation or interpretation: identifiers {{do not need to be}} immediately resolved to an existing entity.|$|R
5000|$|Variables are lexically scoped at {{function}} level (not {{block level}} as in C), and {{this does not}} depend on order (<b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> is not necessary): if a variable is declared inside a function (at any point, in any block), then inside the function, the name will resolve to that variable. This is equivalent in block scoping to variables being forward declared {{at the top of the}} function, and is referred to as [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>declaration</b> {{is used in}} {{languages}} {{that require}} declaration before use; {{it is necessary for}} mutual recursion in such languages, as it is impossible to define such functions (or data structures) without a forward reference in one definition: one of the functions (respectively, data structures) must be defined first. It is also useful to allow flexible code organization, for example if one wishes to place the main body at the top, and called functions below it.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, name {{resolution}} based on lexical scope is straightforward {{to use and}} to implement, as in use one can simply read backwards in the source code to determine to which entity a name refers, and in implementation one can simply maintain {{a list of names}} and contexts when compiling or interpreting a program. Basic difficulties arise in name masking, <b>forward</b> <b>declarations,</b> and hoisting, while considerably subtler ones arise with non-local variables, particularly in closures.|$|R
5000|$|In C and C++, {{the line}} above {{represents}} a <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> of a function {{and is the}} function's prototype. After processing this declaration, the compiler would allow the program code {{to refer to the}} entity [...] {{in the rest of the}} program. The definition for a function must be provided somewhere (same file or other, where it would be the responsibility of the linker to correctly match references to a particular function in one or several object files with the definition, which must be unique, in another): ...|$|R
5000|$|SuperPascal {{is secure}} {{in that it}} should enable its {{compiler}} and run-time system to detect as many cases as possible in which the language concepts break down and produce meaningless results. SuperPascal imposes restrictions {{on the use of}} variables that enable a single-pass compiler to check that parallel processes are disjoint, even if the processes use procedures with global variables, eliminating time-dependent errors. Several features in Pascal were ambiguous or insecure and were omitted from SuperPascal, such as labels and [...] statements, pointers and <b>forward</b> <b>declarations.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{stage of}} a multi-pass {{compiler}} is to remove irrelevant information from the source program that syntax analysis {{will not be able}} to use or interpret. Irrelevant information could include things like comments and white space. In addition to removing the irrelevant information, the lexical analysis determines the lexical tokens of the language. This step means that <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> is generally not necessary if a multi-pass compiler is used.This phase is focused on breaking a sequence of characters into tokens with attributes such as kind, type, value, and potentially others, as well.|$|R
50|$|Each stack frame {{corresponds}} to a lexical level in the current execution environment. As you can see, lexical level is the static textual nesting of a program, not the dynamic call nesting. The visibility rules of ALGOL, a language designed for single pass compilers, mean that only variables declared before the current position are visible at {{that part of the}} code, thus the requirement for <b>forward</b> <b>declarations.</b> All variables declared in enclosing blocks are visible. Another case is that variables of the same name may be declared in inner blocks and these effectively hide the outer variables which become inaccessible.|$|R

5000|$|A basic {{dichotomy}} {{is whether}} a declaration contains a definition or not: for example, whether a declaration of a constant or variable specifies {{the value of the}} constant (respectively, initial value of a variable), or only its type; and similarly whether a declaration of a function specifies the body (implementation) of the function, or only its type signature. Not all languages make this distinction: in many languages, declarations always include a definition, and may be referred to as either [...] "declarations" [...] or [...] "definitions", depending on the language. However, these concepts are distinguished in languages that require declaration before use (for which <b>forward</b> <b>declarations</b> are used), and in languages where interface and implementation are separated: the interface contains declarations, the implementation contains definitions.|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{a function}} prototype or function interface is {{a declaration of}} a function that specifies the function's name and type signature (arity, data types of parameters, and return type), but omits the function body. While a function definition specifies how the function does what it does (the [...] "implementation"), a function prototype merely specifies its interface, i.e. what data types go in and come out of it. The term function prototype is particularly used {{in the context of}} the programming languages C and C++ where placing <b>forward</b> <b>declarations</b> of functions in header files allows for splitting a program into translation units, i.e. into parts that a compiler can separately translate into object files, to be combined by a linker into an executable or a library.|$|R
25|$|Just as {{algorithms}} on recursive {{data types}} can naturally be given by recursive functions, algorithms on mutually recursive data structures can be naturally given by mutually recursive functions. Common examples include algorithms on trees, and recursive descent parsers. As with direct recursion, tail call optimization is necessary if the recursion depth is large or unbounded, such as using mutual recursion for multitasking. Note that tail call optimization in general (when the function called {{is not the}} same as the original function, as in tail-recursive calls) may be more difficult to implement than the special case of tail-recursive call optimization, and thus efficient implementation of mutual tail recursion may be absent from languages that only optimize tail-recursive calls. In languages such as Pascal that require declaration before use, mutually recursive functions require <b>forward</b> <b>declaration,</b> as a <b>forward</b> reference cannot be avoided when defining them.|$|R
50|$|A subtle {{issue is}} exactly when a scope begins and ends. In some languages, {{such as in}} C, a scope starts at declaration, and thus {{different}} names declared within a given block can have different scopes. This requires declaring functions before use, though not necessarily defining them, and requires <b>forward</b> <b>declaration</b> in some cases, notably for mutual recursion. In other languages, such as JavaScript or Python, a name's scope begins {{at the start of}} the relevant block (such as the start of a function), regardless of where it is defined, and all names within a given block have the same scope; in JavaScript this is known as variable hoisting. However, when the name is bound to a value varies, and behavior of in-context names that have undefined value differs: in Python use of undefined variables yields a runtime error, while in JavaScript undefined variables are usable (with undefined value), but function declarations are also hoisted to the top of the containing function and usable throughout the function.|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{a declaration}} is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) [...] "means. Declarations are {{most commonly used}} for functions, variables, constants, and classes, but {{can also be used}} for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions. Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the data type (for variables and constants), or the type signature (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays. A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the compiler; this is important in those strongly typed languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in <b>forward</b> <b>declaration.</b> The term [...] "declaration" [...] is frequently contrasted with the term [...] "definition", but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages; see below.|$|R
