40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel {{additions to}} our existing amateur media creation framework. The framework provides at-capture guidance {{to enable the}} home movie maker to realize their aesthetic and narrative goals and automation of post-production editing. A common problem with the amateur filming context is its contingent nature, which often results in the failure to <b>gain</b> <b>footage</b> vital to the user 2 ̆ 7 s goals, even with at-capture software embedding. Accordingly, we have modelled minimizing the difference between target and captured footage {{at a given time}} during filming as a probability distribution divergence problem. We apply two policies of feedback to the user on their performance, passive communication via a suggestion desirability measure, and active filtering of undesirable suggestions. We demonstrate the framework using each policy with a simulation of various user and filming situations with promising results. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial vaginosis is {{the most}} common cause of vaginal complaints. Bacterial vaginosis is further {{associated}} with a sizeable burden of infectious complications. Diagnosis relies on standardized clinical criteria or on scoring bacterial cell morphotypes on a Gram-stained vaginal smear. A few point-of-care tests have not <b>gained</b> <b>footage</b> in clinical practice, but molecular diagnosis is now pending. Treatment remains cumbersome and clinicians are currently rather poorly armed to treat bacterial vaginosis in the long run. As an adjuvant to standard treatment with antibiotics, alternative treatments with antiseptics and disinfectants, vaginal-acidifying and -buffering agents, and probiotics hold some promise for long-term prevention...|$|R

Shortly after he is accused of sexually assaulting Xanthe, Cooper is attacked. Xanthe's father Gary becomes the prime suspect. Richardson commented that Gary was capable of committing the attack, as he is frustrated with the way the school is handling the situation. Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) later learns someone planted cameras in the hotel rooms and she <b>gains</b> <b>footage</b> of Xanthe's assault, which she anonymously posts to her. Ben also learns that Cooper's mother, Maureen Knights (Judith Chaplin), was the one who attacked him and urges him to tell the police.

2500|$|Tony Bomford, {{another of}} Survival's long-serving cameraman, was {{assisted}} {{on most of}} his early films by his first wife Liz, and also by Tim Borrill. In 1984, Bomford {{became one of the}} first wildlife film-makers to shoot a major documentary in Communist eastern Europe when he <b>gained</b> rare <b>footage</b> of the European bison and Przewalski's horse in Poland's Bialowieza Forest, ancient hunting grounds of Polish kings and Russian tsars. Actress Rula Lenska, herself descended from Polish nobility, narrated the ITV programme. Tony also filmed for Survival in Russia in the late 1980s. He had an especially close affinity with the Shetland Islands and, in 1994, shot Hunters of the Silver Shoals looking at the delicate marine food chain and charting the impact on the environment of the 1993 oil spill from the tanker MV Braer. It was his last film for Survival. He was diagnosed with bone cancer after a fall while filming in India, and died in 2001 ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives of the Study: Globally, the Enterprise Social {{phenomenon}} is <b>gaining</b> <b>footage</b> in organizations, transforming them more transparent, communicative and collaborative. In Finland the Enterprise Social Software (ESS) tools behind this transformation {{are not yet}} that common, and many companies are currently working on the selection and implementation of these tools. At {{the same time the}} ESS implementations in other countries have often failed due to lack of proper implementation efforts. The objectives of this study are two-fold: to form an understanding on the state of ESS in large companies in Finland, and to present a framework on how to best implement these tools within this target group. The intentions on a larger scale are to encourage companies to start the journey to Enterprise Social, and to provide tools and knowledge of ESS implementations overall. Academic background and methodology: The academic base on the research is founded on Enterprise Social literature, which has gained popularity recently. The terminology and Enterprise Social background are covered first more broadly to form an understanding on the Enterprise Social field. The main part of the research is based on a literature review on ESS and the best practices for their implementation, synthesizing the results as a preliminary implementation framework. The empirical part consists of 18 interviews and an online survey, and is aimed at comparing the findings from the literature review against the interview insights. A revised framework is developed from the results. Findings and conclusions: The findings of this thesis are two-fold; the state of ESS in large companies Finland and the best practices for its implementation. The ESS tools are now at implementation or recently implemented level in many large companies, but the process overall is still at the very beginning concerning the cultural change it requires. As a main derivative, the implementation framework and the necessary steps were formed, combining the results from both the empirical research and the literature review. The key success factors of ESS implementation were identified. The results regarding implementation best practices emphasize the importance of concrete management support, real business cases for the tools, and community manager's as well as product champions' efforts in the implementation process...|$|R

Courtney, a promiscuous girl, admits {{to her that}} she was raped by Scott as well but did not have the courage to say something. At Michael's going away party, his fraternity brothers force him to drink excessively, causing him to severely black out and be hospitalized, though he survives. This inspires Melissa to fight back, and she starts to collect evidence against Scott and is successful in <b>gaining</b> much video <b>footage</b> that was taken the night of the party and various other times in the frat house that shows his true nature. She gives him one chance to come clean, and when he does not take it, she publicizes the footage by airing it on TV, showing what kind of person he truly is. Afterwards, all the students turn their back against Scott, Kellie apologizes for not being there for her, and Jordan finally shares her rape story with Melissa.|$|R
5000|$|On March 29, 2007, Jensen! {{became a}} subject of {{controversy}} in the United States as the show's guest that day, Snoop Dogg, delivered a few uncensored profanities directed at American TV host Bill O'Reilly. During {{the course of the}} interview, the topic of O'Reilly taking Snoop Dogg to task over the rapper's drug and gun possession arrest weeks before, was brought up by Jensen. Snoop Dogg responded by saying [...] "fuck Bill O'Reilly" [...] and [...] "suck my dick" [...] among other things, all of which aired uncensored on Dutch TV. Snoop Dogg continued to lash out at O'Reilly while expressing frustration about O'Reilly not inviting him on his show to talk about the arrest, so that he could understand Snoop. The <b>footage</b> <b>gained</b> global notoriety after it was uploaded on YouTube, where it reached more than 1,000,000 views. Bill O'Reilly responded on his show, mocking Snoop Dogg for bashing him and the Netherlands for letting Snoop Dogg in the country, something which increased not only Snoop Dogg's popularity in The Netherlands, but also Robert Jensen's popularity. On 26 November 2009 Snoop Dogg returned in JENSEN! to talk about Bill O'Reilly again.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedAll {{participants}} were recorded, with permission, using {{a video camera}} to <b>gain</b> documentary <b>footage</b> for a future broadcast project that will expand {{the scope of this}} master’s project.; This project explores how three Christians-in-theatre with notable industry experience integrate their devout religious beliefs within America’s commercial theatrical arena. Over the course of their varied careers in acting, casting or playwriting – highlighted by Broadway, national tours and Off-Broadway productions – their religious convictions and practices, representing three different religions (Catholic, Evangelical and Mormon), have been received differently within the workplace.; In actor Jennifer Naimo’s case, her dedication to specific language and moral choices earned praise and condemnation by both the religious and theater communities over her 30 -year career; she, a devout Catholic, has weathered the conflict and to this day maintains a steady presence on stage and on screen in Southern California. Derided for his Evangelical religious practices, David Clemmons, however, experienced a different trajectory. He initially caved into industry pressures, only to return years later as a committed, transparent Christian who proudly announces his faith in his professional role as casting director. Tim Sutton, on the other, is an openly homosexual playwright and a Mormon, who has been isolated and shunned by both his church and the theater community. At present, Sutton remains prohibited by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from formalized religious practices, because he is gay. Yet, he is also criticized within his theater circles for not taking more of a gay activist stance in the plays he writes.; All three interviewees experienced rejection for their faith by the theatrical world in which they were determined to work, and all three found ways to surmount such social and professional obstacles. This is the story of their journeys of faith. Each has learned to accept their own limitations, to know themselves and, as each notes in the profiles that follow, it is only by being outspoken and flexible that negative implications associated with Christians-in-theatre are reversed.; Religion; Theatre; Catholic; Evangelical; Mormon; Comedy; Scripture; Gender Orientation; Singing; Audition; Broadway; New York; Californi...|$|R
