5|$|In October 1947, {{following}} an offensive by the Pakistani raiders in Jammu and Kashmir, the Defence Committee of the Indian Cabinet directed the Army Headquarters {{to undertake a}} military response. The Army planned several operations to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the raiders as directed. In one such operation, the 50th Para Brigade, to which the Rajput Regiment was attached, was ordered to secure Naushahra and establish a base at Jhangar in mid-November.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Norman lords {{who had been}} extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The {{toll on the}} American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (Minced Meat). Hackfleisch aimed to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb {{had been}} {{repelled}} from Damascus, and in 1028, their emir died. He {{was replaced by}} his nephew, Rafi ibn Abi'l Layl, who defected to the Fatimids, thus weakening the tripartite Bedouin alliance. In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and additional horsemen from the Kalb and Banu Fazara to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Tayy, and also to evict the Mirdasids from central Syria.|$|E

5|$|Outside the pays d'en haut, most warriors of the {{influential}} Iroquois Confederacy {{did not participate}} in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.|$|E

5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The Hananu Revolt (also {{known as}} the Aleppo Revolt or the Northern revolts) {{occurred}} in 1920–1921 in the western countryside of Aleppo and its purpose was to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> French military forces from northern Syria. Support for the revolt was driven by opposition {{to the establishment of}} a French Mandate in the country. The revolt was named after its leading commander, Ibrahim Hananu, and mainly consisted of four allied revolts in the areas of Jabal Harim, Jabal Qusayr, Jabal Zawiya and Jabal Sahyun. The rebels were led by rural leaders and mostly engaged in guerrilla attacks against French forces or the sabotage of key infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The Hussite Wars, {{also known}} as the Hussite Crusade, {{involved}} military action against the Bohemian Reformation in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the followers of early Czech church reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415. Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431. These expeditions forced the Hussite forces, who disagreed on many doctrinal points, to unite to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the invaders. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise Compacts of Basel by the Church and the Hussites.|$|E

In 2005, Mugabe instituted Operation Murambatsvina ("Operation <b>Drive</b> <b>Out</b> the Rubbish"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E
5|$|After Negron {{gets his}} damaged {{backpack}} radio working, the soldiers contact headquarters and {{are told to}} capture an enemy soldier. A local Partisan group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema were killed by German forces following a betrayal by a partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> of town, but he is killed in the opening German offensive.|$|E
