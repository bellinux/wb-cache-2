40|$|<b>Internships</b> are {{understood}} as a bridge into scarce employment by young job entrants or students. Using the IAB Establishment Panel, we discovered 600, 000 <b>internships</b> in 300, 000 firms. The use of <b>internships</b> differs significantly between sectors. They are frequently used in the sale and retail sector, and in social and business services. The analysis of the firms' use of <b>internships</b> is based an the theoretical concept of the 'political personnel economy' by Nienh. We extract central employment strategies to explain the function of <b>internships</b> in the firm. From this perspective we distinguish five problems of the firms' employment strategy: the problems of availability, transformation, discontinuity, maintenance of power and - across the board - the cost problem. We find significant indications that <b>internships</b> are used to solve recruitment problems and can therefore be seen as having a functional equivalence to apprenticeship contracts in academic labour markets. We also confirm the affirmed correlation between the regional unemployment rate {{and the use of}} <b>internships.</b> Finally <b>internships</b> can often be found in firms without motivation problems...|$|R
