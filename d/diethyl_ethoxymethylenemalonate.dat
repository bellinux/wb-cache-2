40|$|Background and Aims]. Plant {{species are}} {{considered}} as {{a good source of}} dietary proteins, although the nutritional quality of proteins depends on their amino acid composition. In this work the protein content and amino acid composition of nutlets of 21 Teucrium taxa (Lamiaceae) from Spain were analysed and their nutritional quality was compared with the minimum values established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In addition, the amino acid composition was evaluated as a chemical character to clarify the taxonomic complexity in this genus. [Methods]. Amino acid content of nutlets was determined after derivatization with <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethoxymethylenemalonate</b> by high-performance liquid chromatography. Previously, nutlets samples were hydrolysed and incubated in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h. [Key Results]. The protein content was variable, ranging from 6 · 4 % in T. dunense to 43 · 8 % in T. algarbiense. According to the FAO values all taxa contain satisfactory amounts of leucine, threonine and valine and are deficient in lysine. The similarity analysis of Teucrium taxa using amino acid composition data did not clearly reflect the infrageneric classification of this genus. [Conclusions]. Annual species, such as T. spinosum, T. aristatum and T. resupinatum showed a better balanced amino acid composition. The dendrogram partly matched with the karyological complexity of Teucrium. No correlation between amino acid composition and habitat has been observed, showing that Teucrium nutlet amino acid composition may not be strongly influenced by the environment. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe high {{nutritional}} and health-promoting {{properties of}} kymyz, a traditional drink of nomads produced from mare's milk, are well-known and reported in literature. The composition of mare's milk is {{significantly different from}} that of cow and other ruminants. Fatty acid composition and amino acid profile of mare's milk produced at Suusamyr pastures of Kyrgyzstan were studied during four lactation months (May, June, July and August). The amino acid composition was determined by precolumn derivatization with <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethoxymethylenemalonate</b> (DEEMM) in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 18 amino acids were determined in mare's milk. Most abundant amino acids were glutamic acid (16. 8 - 21. 2 %), leucine (8. 2 - 10. 1 %), lysine (8. 9 - 10. 1 %) and ornithine (0. 1 - 0. 7 %) was in a small amount. The percentages of essential AA in protein of mare milk were 46 %, 46 %, 51 %, 48 % for May, June, July and August months respectively, which demonstrate the high biological value of milk during all milking season. The fatty acid contents of the milk fat were determined in the form of fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatograph after methylation with potassium hydroxide in methanol. The concentrations of capric (10 : 0), lauric (12 : 0) and myristic acid (14 : 0) were similar during four lactation months and the concentration of linoleic acid (18 : 2) was higher in July month. The results of the study have shown that the highest contents of the nutritive compounds were found in the mare's milk obtained in July...|$|E

This study developed a rapid method for the extraction of free amino acids and ammonium ion from saffron, thus permitting the differentiation of saffron samples by origin. The first step tested the extraction time (15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min) and extractive solvent (water, 0. 1 N HCl, 0. 5 N HCl and 1 N HCl). The best results for the free amino acids and ammonium ion extraction were obtained using 0. 1 N HCl during 60 min. Subsequently, these compounds were derivatised using <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethoxymethylenemalonate</b> (DEEMM) and analysed by HPLC. Using this method, 20 saffron samples from different countries (Spain, Italy, Greece and Iran) were analysed. Alanine, proline and aspartic acid were the major amino acids in all the samples. Alanine presented the maximum value in Iranian samples with 0. 17 ± 0. 02 mg/ 100 mg of saffron. The highest concentration of proline (0. 087 ± 0. 01 mg/ 100 mg) appeared in Greek samples and the maximum value of aspartic acid was 0. 04 ± 0. 01 mg/ 100 mg in Spanish samples. Greek and Iranian saffron presented the highest total free amino acid content, 0. 50 ± 0. 08 mg/ 100 mg and 0. 55 ± 0. 07 mg/ 100 mg, respectively. Furthermore, the free amino acid profile enabled us to differentiate the Iranian samples from the European samples (p < 0. 05) ...|$|E

In the first step, ethyl α-carboethoxy-β-(5 -pyrazolylammonium)acrylate (8) was prepared by the condensation between 5 -amino- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-pyrazole (9) and <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethoxymethylenemalonate,</b> in ethanol.

Nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine atom in compound 7 by aromatic amines gave ethyl 4 -(arylamino)- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-pyrazolo[3, 4 -b]pyridine- 5 -carboxylates (5 a-k) in yields 52 - 82 % [26, 29]. Similarly, aminopicolines were used to obtain ethyl 4 -[(methylpyridin- 2 -yl)amino]- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-pyrazolo[3, 4 -b]pyridine- 5 -carboxylates (6 a-c) in yields 50 - 60 %. These were achieved by heating at 140 °C without solvents for 2 - 4 h an equimolar mixture of the appropriate aniline or aminopicoline and the compound 7. However, better results were obtained when these reactions were carried out in solvents such as DMF [25]. Subsequent hydrolysis of the esters 5 a-k and 6 a-c afforded the corresponding 4 -(arylamino)- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-pyrazolo[3, 4 -b]pyridine- 5 -carboxylic acids (3 a-k) and 4 -[(methylpyridin- 2 -yl)amino]- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-pyrazolo[3, 4 -b]pyridine- 4 -carboxylic acids (4 a-c), in high yields, 86 - 93 and 80 - 93 %, respectively [28].

The tetracyclic compounds 1 a-k and 2 a-c were isolated in 60 - 70 % yield.|$|E
