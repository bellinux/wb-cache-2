50|$|A {{dielectric}} (or dielectric material) is {{an electrical}} insulator {{that can be}} polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material {{as they do in}} an electrical conductor, but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing <b>dielectric</b> <b>polarization.</b> Because of <b>dielectric</b> <b>polarization,</b> positive charges are displaced toward the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction.
