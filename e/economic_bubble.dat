5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an <b>economic</b> <b>bubble,</b> with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
25|$|Golf became widely popular {{during the}} <b>economic</b> <b>bubble,</b> when golf club passes became useful tools for {{currying}} favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf {{to participate in}} golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the <b>economic</b> <b>bubble</b> led to the closing of many golf courses, and the ritual of playing golf with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and golf is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{failures}} of capitalism or free market and {{presents the results}} of economic analysis by applying a logistic capital growth model. The application of a logistic growth model for analysis of <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles</b> reveals the fundamental causes of bubble formation&# 8212;economic paradoxes related with phenomena of saturated markets: the paradox of growing returnability and the paradoxes of debt and leverage trap. These paradoxes occur exclusively in the saturated markets and cause the majority of economic problems of recent days including overproduction, <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles</b> and cyclic <b>economic</b> development. Unfortunately, these paradoxes have not been taken into account when dealing with the current failures of capitalism. The aim of the paper is to apply logistic capital growth models for the analysis of economic paradoxes having direct impact on the capitalism failures such as <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles,</b> <b>economic</b> crisis and unstable economic growth. The analysis of economic paradoxes and their implication son failures of capitalism provided in the paper presents the new approach in developing policies aimed at increasing economic growth stability and overcoming failures of capitalism...|$|R

25|$|An <b>economic</b> <b>bubble</b> or {{asset bubble}} (sometimes also {{referred}} to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. though theories of financial crises such as debt-deflation and the Financial Instability Hypothesis suggest instead that bubbles burst progressively, with the most vulnerable (most highly-leveraged) assets failing first, and then the collapse spreading throughout the economy.|$|E

Mahjong was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups.

To support this research, literature has been consulted on historical and recent bubbles, theories surrounding speculation, the market for venture capital, and bubbles in the technology sector. By analysing a range of bubbles, rather than just those in the technology sector, general bubble-principles are also identified. All the <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles</b> are classified under “uncontrolled risk” and a recommended method that can detect and analyse full impacts by uncontrolled risk will be presented, together with future directions to be discussed...|$|R

25|$|Despite slowing of the economy, as of June 2015 the Chinese stock index, the CSI 300 Index, {{which is}} based on 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, had risen nearly 150% over the past 12 months. In an effort to {{forestall}} damage from collapse of a possible <b>economic</b> <b>bubble</b> fueled by margin trading the central government raised requirements for margin lending. Economic damage from a crash in 2007-2008 was limited due to margin lending being highly restricted. In early July, after a fall in the markets of nearly 30% from their 12 June highs, there were efforts by blue-chip, often state-owned, firms, the Chinese securities industry, and the central government to stabilize the market by buying back stock and increasing purchases of the stock of established firms; however, much of the volatility has been in smaller, less-established firms that had been heavily invested in by unsophisticated, often working class, investors who had purchased stock based solely on its rapid increase in valuation. 80% of Chinese stocks are owned by individual investors, many novices. As of 10 July 2015 efforts by the China Securities Finance Corporation, CFS, a firm created by China's commodities and stock exchanges to finance trades, had apparently stabilized the market. Major Chinese securities firms were required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to buy, and hold, a substantial amount of securities affected by the downturn. Using funds supplied by the central bank and commercial banks the China Securities Finance Corporation purchased enough stocks to halt the slide acquiring as much as 5% of the stock in some firms. Lines of credit were extended by CFS to 21 securities firms, some of which also purchased up to 5% of some companies stocks. Some of the small cap stocks acquired may be overvalued.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{dispute that}} prices for tulip bulb {{contracts}} rose {{and then fell}} in 1636–37, but even a dramatic rise and fall in prices {{does not necessarily mean}} that an economic or speculative bubble developed and then burst. For tulip mania to have qualified as an <b>economic</b> <b>bubble,</b> the price of tulip bulbs would need to have become unhinged from the intrinsic value of the bulbs. Modern economists have advanced several possible reasons for why the rise and fall in prices may not have constituted a bubble, even though a Viceroy Tulip was worth upwards of five times the cost of an average house at the time.|$|E

Yū Kondō, Toriyama's second editor, from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that Dragon Ball hit its peak in popularity during the Freeza arc. In a one-thousand ballot popularity poll held in Weekly Shōnen Jump, Dragon Ball received 815 votes. Finding the escalating enemies difficult, Toriyama created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the manga.|$|E
50|$|Within {{mainstream}} economics, <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles,</b> and {{in particular}} real estate bubbles, are not considered major concerns.

5000|$|In most <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles,</b> {{there is}} no single person or group misrepresenting the {{intrinsic}} value.

500|$|The 2007–2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent Great Recession challenged macroeconomic theory. [...] Few economists predicted the crisis, and, even afterwards, {{there was great}} disagreement on how to address it. The new synthesis consensus broke down as economists debated policy responses {{to deal with the}} deep recession. The new synthesis formed during the Great Moderation and had not been tested in a severe economic environment. Many economists agree that the crisis stemmed from an <b>economic</b> <b>bubble,</b> but neither of the major macroeconomic schools had paid much attention to finance or a theory of asset bubbles: how they form, how they can be recognized, and how they can be prevented. The failures of current economic theory to deal with the crisis spurred economists to reevaluate their thinking. Commentary ridiculed the mainstream and proposed a major reassessment.|$|E
500|$|Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was {{a period}} in the Dutch Golden Age during which {{contract}} prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania {{was more of a}} hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century. The term [...] "tulip mania" [...] is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large <b>economic</b> <b>bubble</b> when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values.|$|E
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's {{theory of money}} and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers are saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an <b>economic</b> <b>bubble</b> begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} types of <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles,</b> {{disagreement}} exists {{over whether or not}} a real estate bubble can be identified or predicted, then perhaps prevented. Speculative bubbles are persistent, systematic and increasing deviations of actual prices from their fundamental values. Bubbles can often be hard to identify, even after the fact, due to difficulty in accurately estimating intrinsic values.|$|R
40|$|Chinese {{economy has}} grown rapidly and {{substantially}} for decades, without facing a serious crisis or destabilization and without suffering a correction, but this doesn’t {{mean that it}} has definitely avoided corrections. On the contrary, it might signify that a correction is possible anytime, risking to be the harsher the later it happens. China’s numerous achievements are undeniable, {{but some of the}} very mechanisms that have nourished its successes – mainly the distorted price system (relying on controlled, low prices for labour, capital, energy, land, natural resources, national currency, zero pollution costs, etc.) – are the ones which now hinder its further modernization and growth dynamism. Excessively forced to grow very fast, Chinese economy developed structural imbalances and <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles</b> in almost each of its systems.

25|$|In this view, {{countries}} may develop unsustainable <b>economic</b> <b>bubbles</b> or otherwise mishandle their national economies, and foreign exchange speculators made the inevitable collapse happen sooner. A relatively quick collapse {{might even be}} preferable to continued economic mishandling, followed by an eventual, larger, collapse. Mahathir Mohamad and other critics of speculation are viewed as trying to deflect the blame from themselves for having caused the unsustainable economic conditions.|$|R
500|$|It {{was when}} the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular, having {{recalled}} the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump. Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created {{around the time of the}} Japanese <b>economic</b> <b>bubble</b> and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the [...] "worst kind of people." [...] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. He added time travel next, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.|$|E
