5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only predict the {{spectral}} lines of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as spectrographic technology improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't <b>explain.</b> <b>In</b> 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model {{to explain the}} extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot <b>explain</b> <b>in</b> psychology.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} from Ceylon by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1847; soon after (1852), specimens {{were collected from}} South Carolina USA. Later, the fungus was described {{under a variety of}} names: Lentinus chrysopeplus from Cuba; Agaricus sabriusculus and Agaricus lacunosa from New York; Collybia lacunosa from Michigan; and Omphalia scabriuscula in Connecticut. As Canadian mycologists Redhead and Ginns <b>explain</b> <b>in</b> a 1980 article on the species, since its original 1847 description, C.asprata has been given 28 names, and placed in 14 different genera.|$|E
40|$|In {{this modern}} world, {{travelling}} {{has become as}} normal routine {{for most of the}} people in the cities. At the same time, frequency of happening of accidents also increasing alarmingly. Also one cannot avoid health care and should take proper health checks in hospitals periodically. At the time of accidents, to save precious lives, we must know better hospitals nearby. In that context, in this paper X-tree [1] structure has been implemented for multidimensional data ranking.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot <b>explain</b> <b>in</b> depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the roughly}} equal {{participation}} of the sexes in nest building and incubation, analysis has shown clearly that males alone select {{the location of the}} nest.
