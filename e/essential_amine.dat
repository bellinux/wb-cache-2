40|$|Tryptophan is an {{essential}} amino acid that is obtained from the diet. Approximately 98 % of ingested tryptophan is metabolized by the enzyme tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO). The metabolism of tryptophan by TDO is an important determinant of tryptophan bioavailability to the brain for serotonin (5 -HT) biosynthesis, an <b>essential</b> <b>amine</b> in affective disorders such as depression. Studies done on circadian rhythmicity of the enzyme activity have shown that, TDO activity is high during the scoto-phase (dark-phase), which is attributable to the de novo enzyme synthesis that occurs during this phase. 6 -Methoxy- 2 -benzoxazolinontr-(6 -MBOA), a structural analogue of melatonin (aMT) was shown to inhibit TDO activity in both the photo-phase (light-phase) and the scoto-phase with greater potency during the light-phase. Further studies were directed at demonstrating the effects of 6 -MBOA on the brain tryptophan hydroxylase (TH) activity, which is a rate limiting enzyme in 5 -HT biosynthesis and subsequently on 5 -HT levels. The findings showed that, 6 -MBOA induces TH activity with a concomitant rise in brain 5 -HT levels. The blockade of 5 -HT re-uptake into the presynaptic neuron leads {{to an increase in}} 5 -HT available for the stimulatory action of 5 -HT receptors. An attempt to establish whether the administration of 6 -MBOA would block the binding of 5 -HT to receptors on the synaptosomal membrane showed that 6 -MBO A only inhibits the binding of 5 -HT at specific concentrations. In view of the positive effects imposed by 6 -MBOA on brain 5 -HT levels, urinary 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid (5 -HIAA) excretion was measured before and after treatment with 6 -MBOA. 5 -HIAA excretion was found to be significantly increased after 6 -MBOA treatment. Extensive research on the biosynthesis of pineal metabolites has been conducted in the past two decades. The pineal metabolites are synthesized from the precursor tryptophan. In order to obtain an overall picture of the effect of 6 -MBOA on pineal indole metabolism, an organ culture technique was employed. The results obtained showed that although 6 -MBOA administration to rats caused a significant increase in aMT production, there was an insignificant increase in NAS production. This is an immediate precursor of aMT. Other pineal indoles were not affected at all by 6 -MBOA administration. Furthermore, the production of pineal NAS and aMT showed an inter-individual variation with some animals producing very high, some very low and some produced average levels of these two metabolites in both photo and scoto-phase experiments. A study undertaken to investigate the circadian rhythm in endogenous aMT production using the competitive ELISA technique showed a clear pattern with high levels of aMT produced during the dark-phase and low levels ofaMT produced during the light-phase. Furthermore, the administration of 6 -MBOA to rats lead to a significant rise in endogenous aMT production. ...|$|E

40|$|L-carnitine is an <b>essential</b> quarternary <b>amine</b> {{having an}} {{important}} role in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. Although L-carnitine was shown to be protective against toxic effects of some chemicals the dose-effect relationship with respect to its antioxidant action and protection from lipid peroxidation is unknown. To evaluate the dose-response profile of L-carnitine on blood sialic acid, glutathione and malondialdehyde concentrations, 40 mice were randomly allocated to 4 groups. Experimental mice were treated with intraperitoneal saline for 5 days (Group 1), L-carnitine at 100 mg/kg for 5 days (Group 2), L-carnitine at 250 mg/kg for 5 days (Group 3), L-carnitine at 500 mg/kg for 5 days (Group 4). Following the treatments, blood samples were collected, and blood glutathione, malondialdehyde and sialic acid concentrations were determined. L-carnitine provided an antioxidant action at doses of 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg with the strongest antioxidant action observed at 500 mg/kg dose. There was a significant increase in malondialdehyde and sialic acid concentrations at all doses of Lcarnitine with the highest effect seen at 500 mg/kg dose. In addition, Lcarnitine caused a dose-dependent elevation in glutathione level. These results suggest that L-carnitine applied at 500 mg/kg dose provides strong antioxidant action by increasing glutathione, malondialdehyde and sialic acid in BALB/c mice...|$|R
40|$|Seed of Australian acacia species, Acacia colei, Acacia elecantha, Acacia torulosa, Acacia turmida and Acacia saligna, were {{analysed}} {{for the presence}} of toxic non-protein amino acids and the levels of <b>essential</b> amino acids. <b>Amines</b> were derivatised with 6 -aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate before analysis using liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QQQ-MS). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with optimised transitions and collision energies for each analyte were employed. The known nephrotoxic compound djenkolic acid was found to be present at elevated levels in all species tested. The lowest levels were in A. colei (0. 49 % w/w) and the highest in A. saligna (1. 85 % w/w). Observed levels of djenkolic acid are comparable to measured and reported levels found in the djenkol bean. Subsequent testing of seed processing methods showed djenkolic acid levels can be significantly reduced by over 90 % by dry roasting at 180 °C rendering the seed safe for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The solute-carrier gene (SLC) {{superfamily}} encodes membrane-bound transporters. The SLC superfamily comprises 55 {{gene families}} having at least 362 putatively functional protein-coding genes. The gene products include passive transporters, symporters and antiporters, located in all cellular and organelle membranes, except, perhaps, the nuclear membrane. Transport substrates include amino acids and oligopeptides, glucose and other sugars, inorganic cations and anions (H +, HCO 3 -, Cl -, Na +, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, PO 4 3 -, HPO 4 2 -, H 2 PO 4 -, SO 4 2 -, C 2 O 4 2 -, OH -,CO 3 2 -), bile salts, carboxylate and other organic anions, acetyl coenzyme A, <b>essential</b> metals, biogenic <b>amines,</b> neurotransmitters, vitamins, fatty acids and lipids, nucleosides, ammonium, choline, thyroid hormone and urea. Contrary to gene nomenclature commonly assigned {{on the basis}} of evolutionary divergence [URL], the SLC gene superfamily has been named based largely on transporter function by proteins having multiple transmembrane domains. Whereas all the transporters exist for endogenous substrates, it is likely that drugs, non-essential metals and many other environmental toxicants are able to 'hitch-hike' on one or another of these transporters, thereby enabling these moieties to enter (or leave) the cell. Understanding and characterising the functions of these transporters is relevant to medicine, genetics, developmental biology, pharmacology and cancer chemotherapy. </p...|$|R
