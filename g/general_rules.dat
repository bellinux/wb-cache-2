5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E

30|$|With {{the values}} obtained, we {{calculate}} {{the standard deviation}} of the support distribution of specific rules. If {{the ratio of the}} standard deviation and arithmetic mean of the distribution is below a specified level, the behavior of specific rules is regular, and they can be replaced by the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> and pruned. Otherwise, there are singular specific rules, which do not fit the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> and cannot be pruned. We must then determine if the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> is representative of non-singular specific <b>rules.</b> If the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> covers sufficiently the non-singular specific rules, the latter will be pruned. Otherwise, it is the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that brings no value, and can be pruned.|$|R

5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E

In the preprocessing enrichment, the computed value of CRg is compared with the specified CRgmin value. When CRg[*]≥[*]CRgmin the specific rules can be discarded because they are represented by the more <b>general</b> <b>rule.</b> Otherwise, the discarded rule is the more <b>general</b> <b>rule.</b> In tests with CRgmin {{it was found that}} the best results for this threshold varied between different databases (from 0.5 to 0.8).
