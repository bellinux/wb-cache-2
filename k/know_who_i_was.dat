500|$|Headstrong is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Ashley Tisdale, {{released}} on February 6, 2007, by Warner Bros. Records. [...] Tisdale {{began working on}} the project after the first installment of High School Musical (2006), and after she had achieved the feat {{of being the first}} female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Tisdale describes her work on the album saying. [...] "I didn't really <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and I {{was trying to figure out}} who to do. I now am way more comfortable in my own skin." [...] The singer worked with a variety of established writers and producers on the album, including Diane Warren, J.R. Rotem, Ryan Tedder, Evan [...] "Kidd" [...] Bogart, and Kara DioGuardi, among others. Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E
500|$|She went {{to drive}} the No. 99 Ford Thunderbird, owned by the poorly-funded Colburn Racing team for the 1995 season, and planned to run five races in the Winston Cup Series along with a full season in the Busch Series. Robinson {{attempted}} to enter the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify after finishing 26th in the first Gatorade Twin 125s event. Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark. She declined an offer to test at Daytona International Speedway while {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy. Shortly before the birth of her two children, Robinson started her interior-decorating business from her home, and painted murals for homes and businesses. She said of her decision to have children: [...] "Racing is part of who I am, If I became a different person because I had kids, then the kids were not going to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> my whole life before them." ...|$|E
500|$|On 22 May 1911 Mahler {{was buried}} in the Grinzing {{cemetery}} (...) , as he had requested, under a tombstone inscribed only with his name because [...] "any who come to look for me will <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and the rest don't need to know." [...] Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as [...] "the holy Gustav Mahler"), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. The New York Times, reporting Mahler's death, called him [...] "one of the towering musical figures of his day," [...] but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to [...] "two hours and forty minutes." [...] In London, The Times obituary said his conducting was [...] "more accomplished than that of any man save Richter," [...] and that his symphonies were [...] "undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality," [...] though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bjelland {{was married}} and {{divorced}} twice and had a son, Henry (born 1999), with her second husband. In 2007 Bjelland had a schizophrenic episode and had received treatment. Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian stuck by and helped me through it all. So obviously {{that was going to}} affect some of what I wrote about." [...] She was later told she has a schizoaffective disorder.|$|E

5000|$|When Casper Christensen {{was first}} {{appointed}} postmaster and bishop, a postal inspector found him {{working in the}} field and tried to make him understand that he wanted to inspect his postal records. Finally in desperation he said, [...] "You don't seem to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a postal inspector." [...] Brother Casper indignantly replied, [...] "And YOU don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I'm the Bishop on the Creek!" [...] Town residents have continued to use this phrase when dealing with someone who was self-important.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of--of--I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking of, and it doesn't {{make any difference}} anyway; somebody idolized him, I recollect {{it as if it}} were yesterday; and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>WAS</b> when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then it was I {{begged him}} to carry me before Virginia soldiers, if indeed there were any under General Lafayette, {{claiming}} that they would <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and most like have come {{in touch with my}} father, whereupon he said with a sneer, as if my prayers had only strengthened his suspicions: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{could not}} write, because she doesn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and <b>I</b> don't know her. We {{talked for a}} minute or two, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{glared at}} me, {{as if he}} didn’t <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> when I went downstairs. His heart was going like a hammer. He can’t help being excitable. I woke mother up, {{and asked her to}} sit with him till he went to sleep. It isn’t his fault. He’s no trouble when he’s left alone.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{get over}} it," [...] she said, [...] "I conquered it, for I {{found that this}} was the most likely place to meet Junius. And Aunt Keswick has {{certainly}} treated me in the kindest manner, although she is very angry about Mr Null. But when I first came and she did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> she behaved in the most extraordinary manner." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{time and}} place were every way propitious, and I {{determined}} to let Mary Warren <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> By doing it I might give her confidence in me {{at a moment when}} she was in distress, and encourage her with the hope that I might also befriend her father. At any rate, I was determined to pass for an itinerant Dutch music-grinder with her no longer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{before you}} <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Now {{you go on}} rowing,--that's your share of the work; and I'll take care of mine." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said briefly. [...] "I met her accidentally {{about two}} months ago and as accidentally {{found out that she}} had taken an {{interest}} in {{one of the first things}} I ever wrote for your paper. She neither knew you nor me. It was then that she told me this story; she did not even then <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> though she had met some of my family. She was very good and has generously tried to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you never any balls at Northampton? I {{should like to}} see you dance, and I'd dance with you if you would, for nobody would <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here, and I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about {{together}} many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street? I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better." [...] And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them, [...] "Is not Fanny a very good dancer, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|They were {{curious to}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> how long I was {{condemned}} to solitary, and why I {{had been so}} condemned. But all this I put to the side in order first to learn their system of changing the code initial. After I had this clear, we talked. It was a great day, for the two lifers had become three, although they accepted me only on probation. As they told me long after, they feared I might be a stool placed there to work a frame-up on them. It had been done before, to Oppenheimer, and he had paid dearly for the confidence he reposed in Warden Atherton's tool.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am too {{fine for}} this world!' said she {{as she lay}} in the gutter; 'but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and that is always a little satisfaction!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nigh ready," [...] {{answered}} the girl, gazing {{at him with}} wonder in her eyes. [...] "Don't you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> granduncle? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Norah Brewster from Witham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{how good}} of you!" [...] I cried. [...] "But I really couldn't think of it. Thank you ever so much, though, for your kind thought, all the same. It's {{so good and}} sweet of you. But you don't even <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> have no introduction." ...|$|R
60|$|I asked #100, and he rose up to #30; I fell to #80, and he {{rose again}} to #40; in a word, he offered #50, and I consented, only {{demanding}} {{a piece of}} lace, which I though came to about #8 or #9, {{as if it had}} been for my own wear, and he agreed to it. So I got #50 in money paid me that same night, and made an end of the bargain; nor did he ever <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> or where to inquire for me, so that if it had been discovered that part of the goods were embezzled, he could have made no challenge upon me for it.|$|E
60|$|Here again my old caution stood me in good stead; namely, {{that though}} I often robbed with these people, yet I never let them <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> or where I lodged, nor could they ever find out my lodging, though they often endeavoured {{to watch me}} to it. They all knew me {{by the name of}} Moll Flanders, though even some of them rather {{believed}} I was she than knew me to be so. My name was public among them indeed, but how to find me out they knew not, nor so much as how to guess at my quarters, whether they were at the east end of the town or the west; and this wariness was my safety upon all these occasions.|$|E
60|$|The chauffeur {{started the}} car off again. What with the shock I had had and the luxury of riding in a motor-car, I was a little distrait, and I could not say how far we went. But {{it must have been}} miles and miles, for it seemed a long time {{afterwards}} that we stopped at the biggest house I have ever seen. There were smooth lawns and flower-beds, and men in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right, kennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their noses through the bars and shouting. They all wanted to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and what prizes I had won, and then I realized that I was moving in high society.|$|E
6000|$|... "Set the supper," [...] {{he said to}} his sister; [...] "the citizen {{will take}} a meal with us. You <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> suppose?" [...] he said to Harry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Julien," [...] she asked, [...] "I beg {{of you to}} tell me this. If you do not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{why have}} you {{mentioned}} Herr Freudenberg's name to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{be afraid}} of her," [...] said Sylvia to herself, as she turned into the Spencer lane. [...] "But I don't expect I'll ever become acquainted with her.
