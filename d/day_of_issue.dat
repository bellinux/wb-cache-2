5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard {{was ranked}} as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, {{consisting}} of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> ceremony was held at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
50|$|While the Congressional Research Service {{technically}} {{is prohibited}} from making its reports automatically {{available to the}} public, several legislative efforts are underway to change this, and in practice, its reports are often Internet-accessible within a few <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> typically on the Federation of American Scientists website.|$|R

50|$|The large {{post offices}} & head post offices {{continued}} to issue postal orders for around 2 or 3 weeks after 31 October 2001.

The stamp design is by Howard E. Paine of Delaplane, Virginia. The image of Reagan was modeled after a portrait painted by award-winning artist Michael J. Deas. On June 14, 2006, this stamp was reissued with a 39-cent valuation {{to match the}} new first-class postage rate.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the legalization}} of {{same-sex}} marriage delayed its implementation by collecting the signatures necessary to put the measure to a popular vote on November 6, 2012, as Referendum 74. In that referendum, voters approved the law by a 54%-46% margin. The law took effect on December 6. Because Washington requires a three-day waiting period (excluding the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue)</b> before a marriage certificate may be signed, the first same-sex marriages in the state took place on December 9, 2012.|$|E

50|$|Local {{governments and}} postal {{officials}} successfully {{seized the opportunity}} to raise additional funds. Hubei province, for instance, introduced a rule that from 1 January 1993 a charge be made to finance postal development and a label was issued by a postmaster in Susong in support of China's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. As time went on more stamp-like labels were produced and they were often banned by the central government within <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> Some may well have been purely philatelic issues with no genuine function.|$|R
25|$|In 1936, the US Patent Office {{declared}} Bell {{first on}} {{its list of}} the country's greatest inventors, leading to the US Post Office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 {{as part of its}} 'Famous Americans Series'. The First <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Issue</b> ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf. The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time. The stamp became and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.|$|E
25|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps was commemorated with a 20-cent USPS stamp {{issued on}} April 5, 1983 in Luray, Virginia. The stamp portrays {{construction}} of a typical stretch along the Appalachian Trail. The First <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Issue</b> ceremony was held at Big Meadows, Virginia, the site of Camp Fechner; Camp Roosevelt near Edinburg, Virginia, {{was the site of}} the first CCC camp. President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the CCC on April 5, 1933, appointing Robert Fechner as its National Director. The CCCs mission was to employ thousands of young men to develop and conserve the nation’s natural resources during the Great Depression. They built roads, irrigation dams, fire towers, camp grounds and trails, planting nearly 1.3 billion trees and stocking streams and lakes with fish and game. An image of the stamp can be found at Arago online at the link in the footnote.|$|E
25|$|With {{the closure}} of the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, in December 1985, and {{the closure of}} the Women's Officer Training Wing at Georges Heights, Sydney, in December 1984, the Royal Military College, Duntroon became the sole General Service Officer {{training}} institute in the Australian Army, as all Regular Army officers serving in combat, combat support or service support Corps were required to attend Duntroon in order to be commissioned. Shortly after this, the role of the college changed again with the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986. As a result of this change, Duntroon ceased to offer university degrees as ADFA became responsible for the academic training of Army cadets, as well as those from the Air Force and Navy. The same year, the college celebrated its 75th anniversary (1911–1986). As an acknowledgement of this, 33 cent stamps featuring the head of a male officer cadet were printed; the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> was 27 June 1986.|$|E

500|$|Representatives of the ACS {{were present}} at the October 1970 {{dedication}} of the house as a museum. On April 25, 1974 around 400 chemists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in Scranton came to visit the home. The Priestley Medal, the highest and oldest honor awarded by the ACS, was awarded to Paul Flory at the house that day. (A replica of the Priestley Medal is {{on display at the}} house.) On August 1, 1974—what has been labeled the bicentennial of the discovery of oxygen—over 500 chemists attending the third Biennial Conference on Chemical Education at State College traveled to the house to celebrate [...] "Oxygen Day". In October 1976, the ACS celebrated its own centennial with a celebration in Northumberland. A 100-plus piece replica of Priestley's laboratory equipment, made by universities, corporations, and the Smithsonian Institution, was presented to the house for display. On April 13, 1983, ACS President Fred Basolo spoke at the house to celebrate Priestley's 250th birthday and as part of a first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> ceremony for the United States Postal Service's Joseph Priestley commemorative stamp. In 2001 the ACS again met at the house to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the society, and reenacted parts of the 1874 and 1926 celebrations, including a march to Priestley's grave, at which each participant left a red rose.|$|E

2500|$|Postage stamps {{are first}} issued on a {{specific}} date, {{often referred to as}} the First <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> A first day cover usually consists of an envelope, a postage stamp and a postmark with the date of the stamp’s first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> thereon. Starting in the mid-20th century some countries began assigning the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> to a place associated with the subject of the stamp design, such as a specific town or city. There are two basic types of First Day Covers (FDCs) noted by collectors. The first and often most desirable type among advanced collectors is a cover sent through the mail in the course of everyday usage, without the intention of the envelope and stamp ever being retrieved and collected. The second type of FDC is often referred to as [...] "Philatelic," [...] that is, an envelope and stamp sent by someone with the intention of retrieving and collecting the mailed item at a later time and place. The envelope used for this type of FDC often bears a printed design or cachet of its own in correspondence with the stamp’s subject and is usually printed well in advance of the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> date. The latter type of FDC is usually far more common, and is usually inexpensive and relatively easy to acquire. Covers that were sent without any secondary purpose are considered non-philatelic and often are much more challenging to find and collect.' ...|$|E
