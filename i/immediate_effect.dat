5|$|Brown {{announced}} on 10 May 2010 {{that he would}} stand down as Labour Leader, {{with a view to}} a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with <b>immediate</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|CSC {{announced}} {{that they would not}} renew the contract in spring 2008, meaning Riis Cycling A/S would need a new main sponsor from 2009.

40|$|Self-talk is a {{psychological}} and cognitive product of humans that correlates with stress-related variables, such as anxiety and depression. The <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> of positive self-talk on stress (in terms of cortisol reactivity) and speech performance {{have yet to}} be investigated. Thus, the author examined the <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> of positive self-talk on stress and speech performance. The roles of dispositional and speech-related inner self-talk were also investigated. One hundred and forty participants were assigned to Control, Stress Alone, Positive Self-Talk, or Distraction conditions. A standardized stress-inducing task was used for the experimental groups. Participants in the Positive Self-Talk condition rehearsed a positive self-statement during the experiment, and a distraction task was completed by those in the Distraction condition. Saliva samples were collected for cortisol analysis, and questionnaires were administered to assess participant perceived stress levels and inner self-talk. <b>Immediate</b> <b>effects</b> of positive self-talk on cortisol reactivity, perceived stress, and speech performance were absent. Nevertheless, speech-related positive inner self-talk was inversely correlated with the perceived stress level. Furthermore, negative inner self-talk was also related to cortisol reactivity, perceived stress, and speech performance...|$|R

5|$|The Washington Secretary of State issued {{standardized}} {{colors for}} the state flag in 1955, including the modern colors used in the state seal. The state seal itself was redesigned by Dick Nelms {{at the request of}} the Secretary of State in 1967, using Gilbert Stuart's famous portrait painting of George Washington. The new state seal was approved by the state legislature in April 1967, placing it on the updated state flag with <b>immediate</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>immediate</b> <b>effect</b> of Peterloo was a {{crackdown}} on reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E

Prompted by Limantour, two days {{after the end of the}} battle Díaz signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with Madero, and ten days after the battle he resigned and went into exile in France. This ended the first stage of the Mexican Revolution, and at the same time made it clear that even well-garrisoned troops were not invulnerable to guerrilla armies.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event.

5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac {{at a meeting}} at the western edge of Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La Pointe. The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands in what is now Michigan, had little <b>immediate</b> <b>effect</b> but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue. He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young people under their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, and not from anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from this}} <b>immediate</b> <b>effect,</b> the case {{represented}} a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E
5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with <b>immediate</b> <b>effect,</b> a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The <b>immediate</b> <b>effect</b> on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{infusion}} of 3 -methylindole (3 -MI) dissolved in 10 % Cremophor EL in water was immediately followed by pulmonary arterial hypertension, systemic arterial hypotension, decreased minute volume and periods of apnoea in goats. Rapid intravenous {{infusion of}} Cremophor EL/water alone caused similar <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> {{to those of}} Cremophor EL plus 3 -MI in various dosages. Pretreatment of goats with piperonyl butoxide or phenobarbitone did not significantly alter these immediate cardiopulmonary responses. But pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide prevented clinical signs and pulmonary lesions of 3 -MI toxicity, whereas phenobarbitone pretreatment shortened survival time and enhanced pulmonary pathology. Cremophor EL and 3 -MI dissolved in Cremophor EL caused severe in vitro haemolysis of caprine and bovine erythrocytes. There was no relationship between the <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> of 3 -MI and the subsequent development of 3 -MI-induced pneumotoxicity and deaths in control goats or in goats pretreated with piperonyl butoxide or phenobarbitone. Induction or inhibition of mixed function oxidase activity had no influence on immediate responses to 3 -MI but did change the severity of clinical and pathological responses. It is concluded {{that there is no}} apparent relationship between the immediate and the pneumotoxic effects of 3 -MI. It is possible that the <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> are the result of intravascular haemolysis...|$|R

5|$|On 11 May 2010, {{two days}} {{after the end of the}} 2009–10 season, West Ham {{announced}} the termination of Zola's contract with <b>immediate</b> <b>effect.</b> On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit. West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2–1 defeat at Stoke City.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the <b>immediate</b> <b>effect</b> of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the immediate {{impact of the}} European Central Bank’s asset purchase programmes on sovereign bond spreads in the euro area between 2008 and 2015 using a country-by-country GARCH model. The baseline estimates are rigorously diagnosed for misspecification and subjected {{to a wide range}} of sensitivity tests. Among others, changes in the dependent variable, the independent variables and the number of (G) ARCH terms are tested. Moreover, the model is applied to subsamples and dynamic conditional correlations are analyzed to estimate the effects of the asset purchases on the contagion of spread movements. Generally, it is found that the asset purchase programmes triggered an reduction of sovereign bond spreads. More specifically, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) had the most significant <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> on sovereign bond spreads across the euro area. The announcements related to the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme also yielded substantial spread compression in the periphery. In contrast to that, the most recent Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) announced in January 2015 and implemented since March 2015 had no significant <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> on sovereign bond spreads, except for Irish spreads. Hence, <b>immediate</b> <b>effects</b> seem to be dependent upon the size of the programme, the extent to which it targets distressed sovereigns and the way in which it is communicated...|$|R
