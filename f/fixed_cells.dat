He first described the growth cone based on <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> as [...] "a concentration of protoplasm of conical form, endowed with amoeboid movements" [...] (Cajal, 1890). Neuronal growth cones are situated on the very tips of nerve cells on structures called axons and dendrites.

50|$|Connective {{tissue cells}} are {{typically}} {{divided into two}} types, <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> and wandering cells. Fibrocytes, or fibroblasts and fat cells(adipocytes) are <b>fixed</b> <b>cells,</b> where as macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and mast cells are wandering cells.Fibrocytes {{are the most common}} cell type in connective tissues. If fibrocytes are stimulated by damage to the surrounding tissue, the fibrocyte is altered into a fibroblast. The fibroblasts contain organelles that are necessary for the synthesis and excretion of proteins needed to repair the tissue damage. Fibrocytes usually do not leave the connective tissue. Reticular cells are usually larger than fibrocytes. Reticular cells are the fibrocytes of reticular connective tissue and form a network of reticular fibers. Adipocytes are fat cells that are <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> in loose connective tissue. Their main function is the storage of lipid. Macrophages arise from monocytes. Monocytes originate in the bone marrow upon which they are released into the blood stream. They are mobile and leave the blood stream to enter connective tissues where they differentiate into marcophages.The fibroblasts are the most important in the connective tissue. Fibroblasts manufacture and maintain the extracellular material. They migrate throughout the extracellular matrix to wherever they are needed. Adipocytes are cells that are very efficient at storing energy in the form of triglycerides.|$|E

40|$|The spatio-temporal {{localization}} {{of molecular}} interactions within cells in situ {{is of great}} importance in elucidating the key mechanisms in regulation of fundamental process within the cell. Measurements of such near-field localization of protein complexes may be achieved by the detection of fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) between protein-conjugated fluorophores. We demonstrate the applicability of time-correlated single photon counting multiphoton microscopy to the spatio-temporal localization of protein-protein interactions in live and <b>fixed</b> <b>cell</b> populations. Intramolecular interactions between protein hetero-dimers are investigated using green fluorescent protein variants. We present an improved monomeric form of the red fluorescent protein, mRFP 1, as the acceptor in biological fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments using the enhanced green fluorescent protein as donor. We find particular advantage in using this fluorophore pair for quantitative measurements of FRET.

40|$|Abstract. Fusion of {{neuraminidase}} or trypsin pretreated human erythrocytes and untreated cells was performed.

A surprisingly high diffusion constant was obtained, about 3 x 10 - " cm 2 /s.
