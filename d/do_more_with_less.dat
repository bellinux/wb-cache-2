The phenomena, how to work with marketing with the use of limited capital, has attracted attention in different contexts lately. It may sound hopeless to reach all the way through by the use of limited capital but it although exist examples of compa-nies that have succeeded with this; they are <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less.</b> Purpose The main purpose of this thesis is to examine how firms, by the use of no or limited finan-cial resources, could market themselves successfully and how such a marketing process look like. The other purpose is to identify or map out the difference among traditional marketing and <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less.</b> Method <b>With</b> a <b>more</b> inductive research approach and a qualitative research method the data was collected for this thesis. Four companies were carefully selected and interviewed over the phone. The chosen respondents are; Tomas Gustafsson representing Brämhults, Per Holk-nekt at Odd Molly, Jan Gustafsson at Saltå Kvarn and Hanna Lundgren at WeSC. Conclusion We have concluded that many strategies can be successful in <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less.</b> The strategies found in this study are; Public Relations, Brand Management, Packaging, Product Placement, Event Marketing and Unique Selling Propositions. A coherent pattern or proc-ess could not be identified but it exist similarities in the way that companies make use of marketing strategies concerning <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less.</b> Moreover we came up with the con-clusion that the difference between traditional marketing and the strategies identified as do-ing <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less,</b> besides the obvious cost aspect, is the connection that they are often presented in a way which is not as easy for the potential consumer to perceive as commer-cial...|$|R

40|$|It is {{no secret}} that the {{pharmaceutical}} industry is undergoing rapid and revolutionary change. The impact of managed care and threatened pricing caps by the US Congress on new products has caused many companies to re-evaluate their {{short and long term}} business and research strategies. In too many cases, this has resulted in down-sizing by both lay-offs and attrition. For most analytical laboratories, this has meant <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less</b> resources. There are several major ‘realities’ that are having a significant influence on the amount and type of analytical support required to bring a new product to the market place in today's regulatory climate. They are pre-approval inspections, the Barr decision and the proposed ICH guidelines. Other realities of the 1990 s are also influencing the operation of the analytical laboratory. To cope with these realities, wise use of resources is mandatory. The strategies employed by each company differ, but laboratory automation is usually one of the important elements of the equation. Other elements include contract laboratories, consultants and temporaries. Each of these elements provides part of the solution to <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> <b>less,</b> but each has its own positives and negatives which must be considered.
