40|$|The {{interest}} for LNG as ship fuel is increasing the world all over. This {{means that the}} crews onboard these ships have to take issues with LNG into consideration when they conduct their fire drills. In this thesis that subject has been analyzed extensively by literary research and semi structured interviews with operators and other professionals in the field. It has become apparent that the part of operation when a spill and fire {{is most likely to}} occur is during bunkering, while spills as a consequence of a collision or grounding were found to be very unlikely. Another matter that has been under investigation is the need for coordination exercises between ship and shore based firefighting units, and the conclusion is that there is an interest from the ports to conduct such exercises. Fixed firefighting systems {{have been found to be}} advantageous due to the fact that they can be operated from a safe position and are relatively easy to use, thus conducting exercises with this equipment is a vital component of the onboard drills. The <b>extinguishing</b> <b>mediums</b> that should be used against LNG-fires are either dry chemical powder or possibly high-foam...|$|R

Because SF6 is a greenhouse gas more potent than CO2, by switching from SF6 to CO2 {{it is possible to}} reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 10 tons during the product lifecycle.|$|E
50|$|This section details which <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium</b> (water, powder or foam) {{should be}} used {{in the case of a}} fire as well as how a {{particular}} medium is either unsuitable or when it should be avoided. Depending on the chemical content of the hazardous substances, it is critical that the correct substance is used to avoid undesired behaviors and risks related to extinguishing fires. Various fire extinguishing equipment exists to handle various fire classes.|$|E
40|$|Class A foam {{is often}} used in the {{suppression}} of wildland and structural fires, with manual application methods. This report examines the feasibility of utilising class A foam <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium</b> in automatic wet pipe sprinkler systems. Previous researchers report that for certain applications the addition of class A foam solution to a sprinkler system increases suppression effectiveness. Researchers investigating applications with manual fire fighting techniques, using this <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium,</b> report mixed conclusions. The integration of class A foam hardware with standard wet pipe sprinkler technology is discussed. Consideration is given to potential corrosion effects and compatibility with sprinkler hardware items. A review of environmental issues revealed that some products are readily biodegradable, while others are not, and that results vary with the test method used. Tests undertaken to investigate {{the relationship between the}} applied sprinkler head pressure and the foam expansion ratio, revealed that only a slight increase in the expansion ratio occurred when the pressure was increased from 50 kPa to 85 kPa. Expansion ratios obtained were similar to those obtained by other researchers using AFFF type foam solution. Foam-water distribution tests indicated that the distribution densities obtained with class A foam sprinkler arrays are within close proximity to the densities obtained using pure water. It is suggested that future work in this area should be based around the protection of extreme class A hazard type fires...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} {{of heat and}} mass transfer were investigated experimentally while moving and evaporating the atomized water flow in high-temperature combustion products of typical liquid fuels and organic flammable liquids: gasoline, kerosene, acetone, crude oil, industrial alcohol. We determined typical periods of liquid extinguishing by an atomized water flow of various dispersability. Data of the discharge of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium</b> corresponding to various parameters of atomization and duration of using the atomization devices was presented. It is shown that U[m]≈ 3. 5 m/s is a minimal outflow velocity of droplets during moving while passing the distance of 1 m in the high-temperature gas medium to stop the combustion of organic liquid...|$|E
40|$|We report results {{concerning}} {{the distribution and}} properties of galactic extinction at high galactic latitudes derived from stellar statistics using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use the classical Wolf diagram method to identify regions with extinction, and derive the extinction and the extinction law of the dust using all five SDSS spectral bands. We estimate {{the distance to the}} <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium</b> using simple assumptions about the stellar populations in the line of sight. We report the identification of three extinguishing clouds, each a few tens of pc wide, producing 0. 2 – 0. 4 mag of g ′-band extinction, located 1 – 2 kpc away or 0. 5 – 1 kpc above the galactic plane. All clouds exhibit grey extinction, i. e., almost wavelength-independent in the limited spectral range of the SDSS. We discuss the implication of this finding on general astrophysical questions...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{extinction}} of flames with water mist where surface cooling effects are neglected i. e. water mist {{as a total}} flooding system where the direct spray cannot reach and cool all burning items in the protected volume. The study includes {{a survey of the}} production and properties of water mist such as different types of nozzles and means to describe droplet size distribution. Properties of jets and sprays are discussed as well as water droplet movement, fall and evaporation. Three different series of experiments were conducted with different hydraulic atomising nozzles. In the first series, droplet size distribution and water spray distribution measurements for the nozzles were conducted. The measurements showed that the droplet size distribution ranged from a Sauter Mean Diameter of approximately 35 - 85 µm, all dependent on the water pressure and the configuration of nozzles. The measurements show that considerably larger droplets are formed when individual nozzles are placed together. This can be explained by a coalescence effect when droplets from the sprays of the nozzles collide. The second series of experiments were done using a tubular propane gas bumer where water and propane were mixed prior to reaching the burner outlet. Based on the tests, the specific amount of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium</b> required (Required <b>Extinguishing</b> <b>Medium</b> Portion, REMP = m, / m, i. e. the ratio of the agent quantity to fuel quantity consumed) is given as a quantitative measure of the efficiency of the agent. The lower the REMP value, the more efficient the agent. The water pressure ranged between 40 and 80 bar which provided for droplet sizes with a Sauter Mean Diameter in the order of 35 pm. The results show that the amount of water needed for extinguishment by weight is between 1. 2 - 2, 2 times the amount of propane gas. The decrease in droplet sizes decreased the amount of water needed. Another observation was that the heat release rate of the fire is not affected until extinction occurs. A REMP-value of 1, 2 - 2, 2 corresponds to a water content of 100 – 200 g/m 3 protected volume which is in agreement with theoretical values. Finally, a series of tests were conducted in a 113 scale room using a propane gas fire. Parameters such as location of the fire, the location of the nozzle, water flow rate {{and the size of the}} room opening were varied. In these tests the water content needed was in close agreement with the values obtained from the REh 4 P experiments and the theoretical values. These tests also highlighted the problem of delivering the droplets to the fire. To achieve "total flooding" in an actual situation, nozzles covering the complete protected compartment, with additional nozzles under obstructions would be needed. To make droplets follow the air flows inside a room and behave more like a gaseous total flooding agent, requires droplets of a size in the order of 1 - 20 µm...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the motor}} vehicle {{directive}} of the European Community, as of January 2017 new cars {{will only be}} allowed to use air conditioning systems with refrigerants of GWP below 150. A moratorium to significantly extend this deadline {{is not to be}} expected considering the recently negotiated F-Gas-Regulation. One option will be flammable refrigerants of the ASHRAE classification A 3 or a future classification A 2 L. However they are subject to safety reservations when used in systems with direct evaporation. R 744 requires for a wide use and a complete realization with development, industrialization and validation probably more time than the remaining available time horizon. Therefore an option shall be discussed, which is based on a hybrid solution with R 744 and a flammable refrigerant and which may allow a sufficiently rapid implementation. The utilization of R 744 refrigerant mixtures shall not be considered. Instead a small and compact refrigerant loop will be operated with A 3 or A 2 L refrigerants. Compactness, leak tightness and significant reduced charge amounts already contribute to the enhanced safety. R 744 will be used as a secondary refrigerant. For the distribution in branched systems, new approaches have to be discussed. Additional safety aspects arising from the use of R 744 as secondary refrigerant {{and at the same time}} in the function as fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>medium.</b> Efficiency, safety, time-to-market and scenarios for the possible full transition to R 744 as a refrigerant will be discussed...|$|E
