On the floor they were pounding {{half a dozen}} stocks in which Maxwell's customers were heavy <b>investors.</b> <b>Orders</b> {{to buy and sell}} were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate, strong machine--strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate, never hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and mortgages, margins and securities--here was a world of finance, and there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Investor’s</b> <b>order</b> {{behavior}} directly {{reveals his}} willingness. Investors usually submit their orders {{according to their}} information. Different information will lead to diversity order behavior. In this paper, based on the asymmetry information, an <b>investor’s</b> <b>order</b> choice model in Chinese order-driven market is constructed, and then the role of asymmetry information on order submission strategy is investigated. By modifying the restriction on the duration of information, this paper discusses private information duration and uninformed investor’s learning process and <b>investor’s</b> optimal <b>order</b> strategy, and then concludes that when informed <b>investor</b> places market <b>order,</b> uninformed <b>investor</b> is more inclined to place limit order; only {{at the beginning of}} trading when informed <b>investor</b> places limit <b>order,</b> the uninformed buyer is more inclined to place market order...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the role of {{informed}} and uninformed investor in explaining the formation of the pattern of trading volume in the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). The data which is used in this study is the data of the transaction history-corporate edition demand and order history stock on the company which included LQ- 45 in the period of March, April and May 2005 from the IDX. The data analysis method used multiple regression analysis with regress all order status to trading volume. The results of this study show that informed <b>investor</b> <b>order</b> is related significantly with trading volume on each interval. Otherwise the placement of uninformed <b>investor</b> <b>order</b> either uninformed buy or uninformed sale is mostly not related significantly on trading volume. That finding gives the indication that only informed <b>investor</b> <b>order</b> is more plays in explaining trading volume pattern. Whereas, if it is seen by order status, this study finds that mostly order status amend, open and withdraw are not influenced significantly to trading volume. This means that trading volume is commonly driven by order match status, specifically informed buy match and informed sale match...|$|R

40|$|We develop {{from basic}} {{economic}} principles a continuous-time {{model for a}} large investor who trades with {{a finite number of}} market makers at their utility indifference prices. In this model, the market makers compete with their quotes for the <b>investor’s</b> <b>orders</b> and trade among themselves to attain Pareto optimal allocations. We first consider the case of simple strategies and then, in analogy to the construction of stochastic integrals, investigate the transition to general continuous dynamics. As a result, we show that the model’s evolution can be described by a nonlinear stochastic differential equation for the market makers’ expected utilitie...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a model where investors use {{a credit}} rating {{to decide whether}} to finance a firm. The rating quality depends on unobservable effort exerted by a credit rating agency (CRA). We study optimal {{compensation}} schemes for the CRA when a planner, the firm, or <b>investors</b> <b>order</b> the rating. Rating errors are larger when the firm orders it than when investors do (and both produce larger errors than is socially optimal). Investors overuse ratings relative to the firm or planner. A trade-off in providing time-consistent incentives embedded in the optimal compensation structure makes the CRA slow to acknowledge mistakes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{key element}} of the {{business}} structure for electronic markets is the design of price schedules for transaction services. Stock exchanges and transaction service providers around the world regard transaction fees {{not only as a}} major source of income but also as an incentive mechanism for investors. In this paper, we discuss the principles of nonlinear transaction fee schedules and present the results of a field experiment on <b>investor</b> <b>order</b> behaviour. We find that the number and the volume of orders are influenced by the transaction fee schedule. Furthermore, the initial endowment of participants has an impact on the price elasticity of the demand for transaction services. The discussion highlights the need for a structured approach for price schedule design in the context of market engineering...|$|R
