5|$|The song's lyrics {{were written}} by Cyrus and Casey Beathard. Cyrus {{discussed}} Home at Last {{in an interview with}} Calvin Gilbert of CMT News in which he said the song was about children growing up and moving on, from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of moving his family to Los Angeles to help Miley with her acting and singing career.|$|E
5|$|Cretton was {{inspired}} to write Short Term 12 based on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of working in a group facility for teenagers. He first wrote and produced a short film {{based on the idea}} and later adapted it into a feature-length screenplay. While Larson and John Gallagher, Jr. won their roles after auditioning through Skype, most of the children featured in the film were cast through open casting calls. Filming took place over 20 days in Los Angeles, California in September 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} chapter, he {{addresses}} {{the experiences of}} the life of solitude. He indicates that while others may have written on the life of solitude, he draws mostly from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experiences</b> rather than that of a stranger.

5|$|Mansukhani {{conceived}} {{the film as}} a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience.</b> Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) {{to shed light on}} the issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes {{for the rest of the}} cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Moffat's first {{television}} work was the teen drama series Press Gang. His first sitcom, Joking Apart, {{was inspired by}} the breakdown of his first marriage; conversely, his later sitcom Coupling was based upon the development of his relationship with television producer Sue Vertue. In between the two relationship-centred shows, he wrote Chalk, a sitcom set in a comprehensive school inspired by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> as an English teacher.|$|E
5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

5|$|The film {{utilized}} fascist imagery throughout, including {{portraying the}} Terran Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those {{worn by the}} SS, the Nazi paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that the first scene of the film—an advertisement for the Mobile Infantry—was adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Other references to Nazism include the Albert Speer-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue ("Violence is the supreme authority!"). According to Verhoeven, the references to Nazism reflected <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during WW II.|$|E
5|$|When Dean {{returned}} to the United States, he received a hero's welcome and was presented {{with a number of}} decorations, including the Medal of Honor, which he was unaware he had been awarded. Dean maintained he did not think <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> was particularly heroic and asserted he did not feel he deserved an award for his actions in Korea. He was given a ticker-tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26, 1953, and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Ledonne {{had spent}} many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and {{programming}} knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. Super Columbine Massacre was created with ASCII's game development program RPG Maker 2000 and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an artist's statement about the work after his identity was revealed. Super Columbine Massacre was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled {{hundreds of thousands of}} downloads.|$|E

5|$|Victory {{joined the}} British fleet off Cádiz on 27 September, Nelson taking over from Rear Admiral Collingwood. He spent the {{following}} weeks preparing and refining his tactics for the anticipated battle and dining with his captains {{to ensure they}} understood his intentions. Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional line of battle. Drawing on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> from the Nile and Copenhagen, and the examples of Duncan at Camperdown and Rodney at the Saintes, Nelson decided to split his fleet into squadrons rather than forming it into a similar line parallel to the enemy. These squadrons would then cut the enemy's line {{in a number of}} places, allowing a pell-mell battle to develop in which the British ships could overwhelm and destroy parts of their opponents' formation, before the unengaged enemy ships could come to their aid.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} was in power, press {{secretary}} Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's press officer, was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives; this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations {{to ensure that a}} clear message was presented, and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> in journalism; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites. Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the powered armor {{technology}} that {{is central to the}} book is completely absent in the movie. According to Verhoeven, this—and the fascist tone of the book—reflected <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> in Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II.|$|E
