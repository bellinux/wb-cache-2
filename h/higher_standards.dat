5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to <b>higher</b> <b>standards</b> of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E

5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of <b>higher</b> <b>standards</b> for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the heavy}} {{damage from the}} cyclone and other recent disasters, the World Bank enacted a plan for Andhra Pradesh in April 1997, {{consisting}} of repairing damaged infrastructure, an updated disaster plan, and technical assistance to the state government. Shelters and roads would be improved to <b>higher</b> <b>standards.</b> This plan ultimately cost about US$175million and was completed in July 2003, three years longer than expected but {{at a lower cost}} due to the Indian rupee losing some of its value. Power lines were improved to withstand winds of , while drains were enlarged and a coastal plant system was created to lessen flooding. An additional 82public shelters were constructed. However, the plan failed to yield a long term disaster policy for the state.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} four years, a $12 million project to construct storm shelters for residents across the Oklahoma City metropolitan area was enacted. The goal {{was to create a}} safer community in a tornado-prone region. By May 2003, a total of 6,016 safe rooms were constructed. On May 9, 2003, the new initiative was put to the test as a tornado outbreak in the region spawned an F4 tornado, which took a path {{similar to that of the}} Bridge Creek–Moore tornado. Due to the <b>higher</b> <b>standards</b> for public safety, no one was killed by the 2003 tornado, a substantial improvement in just four years. On May 20, 2013, an EF5 tornado impacted some of the same areas affected by the 1999 storm, tracking through the heart of Moore. Throughout the city, 24 people were killed (along with one additional person who died as an indirect result of the tornado) and more than 230 were injured.|$|E
5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy <b>higher</b> <b>standards</b> of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model this paper analyses the overall process through which <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> production and consumption affect development. Market imperfections are so critical in modeling the real effects of <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> {{that we have to}} take into account four kinds of them: labor market segmentation, labor migration costs, credit constraints and fixed costs. Our model allows to measure structural production changes and welfare effects on rural and urban households through various channels. We calibrate and simulate the model using the dataset of China, which is just in its middle development phase. The simulation results show that the issue of exclusion depends on the neutrality of shocks or policies leading to the expansion of <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> sector, that inequality and poverty would decrease when the world price for <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> food increase and when richer consumers increase preferences for <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> food, and that the gain from labor market can cover the loss of exclusion from <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> farming if more efficient farms expand their output in <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> sector. The interaction of several related markets also provides some insights for the logic of China-style gradual markets reform. 1...|$|R

Some research has also linked maximizing to high need for cognition, again primarily with the <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> component. Finally, research examining the association between maximizing and personality dimensions of the Big Five personality model have found <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> to be associated with high conscientiousness and decision difficulty with low conscientiousness.
