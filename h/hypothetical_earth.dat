This thesis provides a framework for understanding the origin, nature, and types of ECAs. The change in velocity requirements to achieve a two Earth radii deflection for long and short term warning scenarios are developed. Next, a method of developing <b>hypothetical</b> <b>Earth</b> colliding asteroid orbits is presented. These hypothetical orbits are used in two ways: (1) to evaluate the ability of Dance of the Planets, a solar system simulation model developed by Applied Research and Consulting, Inc., to accurately propagate orbits of imported asteroid orbits, and (2) to analyze the sensitivity of deflection distance to variation in deflection angle and orbital parameters of a given orbit. Inaccuracies during importation of data precluded the use of Dance of the Planets for the purpose of sensitivity analysis. The program does provide an excellent tool for visualization of ECA scenarios. Consequently, a simpler orbital model was developed to provide a Earth miss distance sensitivity analysis. With one asteroid orbital period warning the minimum change in velocity to deflect an asteroid two Earth radii is approximately 0. 135 m/s and the optimal deflection is along the flight path. Maximum deflection occurs when the deflection is applied at perihelion. The miss distance decreases markedly with increase in true anomaly until it is a minimum at aphelion. U. S. Navy (U. S.

Its age of 2. 3 Gyr {{is the same as}} the Sun when there was a considerable increase of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere due to micro-organisms living under the sea. We present the analysis of superflares seen on the transit lightcurves of Kepler- 96 b. The model used here simulates the planetary transit in a flaring star. By fitting the observational data with this model, it is possible to infer the physical properties of the flares, such as their duration and the energy released. We found 3 flares within the energy range of superflares, where the biggest superflare observed was found to have an energy of 1. 81 × 10 ^ 35 ergs. The goal is to analyse the biological impact of these superflares on a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>Earth</b> in the habitable zone of Kepler- 96 assuming this planet has protection via different scenarios: an Archean and Present-day atmospheres.

However, they could escape from the hazardous UV effects at a depth of 28 m and 12 m below the ocean surface, respectively. For smaller superflares contribution, D.

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{concrete}} for hydraulic structures has special requirements {{for water and}} its penetration through the concrete, {{and the effect of}} different aggressive agents on the concrete and its components. The requirements are much higher on permeability and durability than in the case of mechanical properties. While in the case of mechanical effects, stress concentrations are greater in region of higher quality concretes (rigidity and strength), the water flow line follow the weaker planes of increased permeability. This paper reviews typical values of design seepage coefficient from literature and also uses the experimental results of a laboratory study done for clay-cement concrete material. The clay-cement concrete studied was designed to be a low-strength material and its properties fall between those of soil and concrete. The material may be used as anti-seepage material in the foundation and diaphragm wall in earth dams, and canal lining in channel constructions. The three main design criteria considered for anti-seepage requirements, i. e. permeability, deformity, and long-term performance are used in the dam analysis with emphasis on water permeability. Water flow effect in <b>hypothetical</b> <b>earth</b> dam cases were assessed using a finite element-based software program to determine the influence of the design water permeability of cut-off wall based on the seepage regime that develops {{as a result of the}} barrier construction. It was found that construction of an anti-seepage barrier is effective in reducing the hydraulic gradient, even if the permeability coefficient of the barrier is several orders of magnitude high. Results also indicate that clay-cement concrete anti-seepage effect potentially gives high performance. This study may contribute a better understanding of the fluid flow characteristics in dams having a cut-off wall for improved practices and anti-seepage materials...|$|E

40|$|A planet's obliquity, {{which is}} the angle between its orbital angular {{momentum}} and its rotational angular momentum, {{is an important factor}} in determining its climate and habitability. For small obliquities, as well as obliquities close to 180 degrees, the planet receives more radiant energy from its star at equatorial latitudes than near its poles, whereas the poles are heated the most for obliquities near 90 degrees. Jacques Laskar has analyzed possible obliquity variations of the planets in our Solar System. His study also considers the same planets with different rotational periods, and the Earth without the Moon. He finds, using frequency map analysis, that the obliquity of the Earth is stabilized by the Moon, and can vary by at most a few degrees. In contrast, the obliquity of Mars can range from 0 to 60 degrees, and a <b>hypothetical</b> moonless <b>Earth's</b> axial tilt could be close to 0 degrees or as large as 85 degrees. Numerical integrations by Laskar and others have shown that Mars' obliquity indeed varies over most of its permitted range on time scales of tens of millions of years.

Without lunar influence, a frequency-map analysis by Laskar et al. showed that the obliquity could vary between 0 deg. and 85 deg. This has left an impression in the astrobiology community that a large moon is necessary to maintain a habitable climate on an Earth-like planet. Using {{a modified version of the}} orbital integrator mercury, we calculate the obliquity evolution for moonless Earths with various initial conditions for up to 4 Gyr. We find that while obliquity varies significantly more than that of the actual Earth over 100, 000 year timescales, the obliquity remains within a constrained range, typically 20 - 25 deg. in extent, for timescales of hundreds of millions of years. None of our Solar System integrations in which planetary orbits behave in a typical manner show obliquity accessing more than 65 % of the full range allowed by frequency-map analysis. The obliquities of moonless Earths that rotate in the retrograde direction are more stable than those of pro-grade rotators. The total obliquity range explored for moonless Earths with rotation periods shorter than 12 h is much less than that for slower-rotating moonless Earths.

40|$|A {{framework}} for assessing changeability {{in the context}} of dynamic Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE) is proposed and applied to three aerospace systems. The framework consists of two parts. First, changeability concepts such as flexibility, scalability, and robustness are defined in a value-centric context. These system properties are shown to relate “real-space to value-space ” dynamic mappings to stakeholder-defined subjective “acceptable cost ” thresholds. Second, network analysis is applied to a series of temporally linked tradespaces, allowing for the quantification of changeability as a decision metric for comparison across system architecture and design options. The quantifiable is defined as the filtered outdegree of each design node in a tradespace network formed by linking design options through explicitly defined prospective transition paths. Each of the system application studies are assessed in the two part framework and within each study, observations are made regarding the changeability of various design options. The three system applications include a <b>hypothetical</b> low <b>Earth</b> orbit satellite mission, a currently deployed weapon system, and a proposed large astronomical on-orbit observatory. Preliminary cross-application observations are made regarding the embedding of changeability into the system architecture or design.

The weapon system can increase its changeability by continuing to embrace modularity, use of commercial off-the-shelf parts (COTS), and simple, excess capacity interfaces. The large astronomical observatory can increase its potential changeability by having the ability to reconfigure its physical payloads and reschedule its observing tasks.

40|$|Earth {{will become}} uninhabitable within 2 - 3 Gyr {{as a result}} of the moving {{boundaries}} of the habitable zone caused by the increasing luminosity of the Sun. Predictions about the future of habitable conditions on Earth include a decline in species diversity and habitat extent, ocean loss and changes in the magnitudes of geochemical cycles. However, testing these predictions on the present-day Earth is difficult. The discovery of a planet that is a near analogue to the far future Earth could provide a means to test these predictions. Such a planet would need to have an Earth-like biosphere history, requiring it to have been in its system's habitable zone (HZ) for Gyr-long periods during the system's past, and to be approaching the inner-edge of the HZ at present. Here we assess the possibility of finding this very specific type of exoplanet and discuss the benefits of analysing older Earths in terms of improving our understanding of long-term geological and bio-geological processes. As an illustrative example, G stars within 10 parsecs are assessed as potential old-Earth-analogue hosts. Surface temperature estimates for <b>hypothetical</b> inner-HZ <b>Earth</b> analogues are used to determine whether any such planets in these systems would be at the right stage in their late-habitable lifetimes to exhibit detectable biosignatures. Predictions from planet formation studies and biosphere evolution models suggest that only 0. 36 % of G stars in the solar neighbourhood could host an old-Earth-analogue. However, if the development of an Earth-like biosphere is assumed to be rare, requiring a sequence of low-probability events to occur, then such planets are unlikely to be found in the solar neighbourhood - although 1000 s could be present in the galaxy as a whole.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of atmospheric modelling and its inherent non-linearity, {{together with the}} limited amount of data of exoplanets available, motivate model intercomparisons and benchmark tests. In the geophysical community, the Held-Suarez test is a standard benchmark for comparing dynamical core simulations of the Earth's atmosphere with different solvers, based on statistically-averaged flow quantities. In the present study, we perform analogues of the Held-Suarez test for tidally-locked exoplanets with the GFDL-Princeton Flexible Modeling System (FMS) by subjecting both the spectral and finite difference dynamical cores to a suite of tests, including the standard benchmark for <b>Earth,</b> a <b>hypothetical</b> tidally-locked <b>Earth,</b> a "shallow" hot Jupiter model and a "deep" model of HD 209458 b. We find qualitative and quantitative agreement between the solvers for the Earth, tidally-locked Earth and shallow hot Jupiter benchmarks, but the agreement is less than satisfactory for the deep model of HD 209458 b. Further investigation reveals that closer agreement may be attained by arbitrarily adjusting {{the values of the}} horizontal dissipation parameters in the two solvers, but it remains the case that the magnitude of the horizontal dissipation is not easily specified from first principles. Irrespective of radiative transfer or chemical composition considerations, our study points to limitations in our ability to accurately model hot Jupiter atmospheres with meteorological solvers at the level of ten percent for the temperature field and several tens of percent for the velocity field. Direct wind measurements should thus be particularly constraining for the models. Our suite of benchmark tests also provides a reference point for researchers wishing to adapt their codes to study the atmospheric circulation regimes of tidally-locked Earths/Neptunes/Jupiters.

In this paper, we show that, to the first post-Newtonian level, there is also a gravitolectric clock effect induced by the static component of the gravitational field of a non-rotating body. Indeed, the difference of the draconitic periods of two test particles moving in opposite directions along identical quasi-circular orbits turns out to be non-vanishing. It depends on the shape, the size and the pericenter location of the orbit, but it is independent of the initial position along it.

The {{incorporation of}} sulfur into many biomolecules likely {{dates back to the}} development of the earliest metabolic strategies. Sulfur is common in enzymes and co-enzymes and is an indispensable structural component in many peptides and proteins. Early metabolism may have been heavily influenced by the abundance of sulfide minerals in hydrothermal systems. Understanding how sulfur became prevalent in biochemical processes and many biomolecules requires knowledge of the reaction properties of sulfur-bearing compounds. We have previously estimated thermodynamic data for thiols, the simplest organic sulfur compounds, at elevated temperatures and pressures. If life began in hydrothermal environments, it is especially important to understand reactions at elevated temperatures among sulfur-bearing compounds and other organic molecules essential for the origin and persistence of life. Here we examine reactions that may have formed amino acids with thiols as reaction intermediates in <b>hypothetical</b> early <b>Earth</b> hydrothermal environments. (There are two amino acids, cysteine and methionine, that contain sulfur.) Our calculations suggest that significant amounts of some amino acids were produced in early Earth hydrothermal fluids, given reasonable concentrations H 2, NH 3, H 2 S and CO. For example, preliminary results indicate that glycine activities as high as 1 mmol can be reached in these systems at 100 C. Alanine formation from propanethiol is also a favorable reaction. On the other hand, the calculated equilibrium log activities of cysteine and serine from propanethiol are - 21 and - 19, respectively, at 100 C. These results indicate that while amino acid formation with thiols as intermediates is favored in some cases, other mechanisms may have been necessary to produce significant amounts of other amino acids. Coupled with our previous results for thiols, these studies imply that sulfur may have been easily incorporated into the organic geochemistry of early Earth hydrothermal systems, leading to its widespread use in biomolecules.

The resulting predictive equation, based on the compositions of a large set (n = 160) of published garnet-melt pairs, produces values of DMg that are within 20 % of measured values at temperatures between 1, 450 and 1, 930 °C, and pressures between 2. 5 and 7. 5 GPa. The model for trivalent (3 +) trace elements is based on the lattice strain approach to partitioning, which describes mineral-melt partition coefficients in terms of three parameters; the effective radius, ro(3 +), of the site on which partitioning takes place (in this case, the garnet X-site); the apparent site Young's modulus Ex(3 +); and the partition coefficient Do(3 +) for a fictive trivalent element J 3 +, with radius ro(3 +), that does not strain the crystal lattice when entering the garnet X-site. Analogous to the model for DMg, simple activity-composition relations link Do(3 +) to ΔGf of a hypothetical garnet component incorporating a <b>hypothetical</b> rare <b>earth</b> element J 3 + through a YAG-type charge-balancing mechanism (J 3 +Mg 2 Al 3 Si 2 O 12). Through analysis of existing garnet-melt rare earth element partitioning data (n = 18 garnet-melt pairs), an expression is derived relating Do(3 +) to pressure, temperature and DMg. Predicted DREE/Y/Sc values agree to within 5 - 50 % of experimental measurements for all elements except La and Ce, which are liable to large experimental errors, spanning pressures between 2. 5 and 5. 0 GPa and temperatures between 1, 430 and 1, 640 °C. In conjunction with our new parameterisation for DMg, and previously published equations linking ro(3 +) and Ex(3 +) to garnet major element composition, this model gives a description of trivalent REE, Y, In and Sc partitioning between garnets and anhydrous melts over a range of pressures, temperatures and compositions relevant to melting of garnet-bearing sources in the Earth's upper mantle...|$|R
40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} refraction in transit transmission spectroscopy on spectral absorption features and on temporal variations {{that could be used}} to obtain altitude-dependent spectra for planets orbiting stars of different stellar types. We validate our model against altitude-dependent transmission spectra of the Earth from ATMOS and against lunar eclipse spectra from Palle et al. (2009). We perform detectability studies to show the potential effects of refraction on <b>hypothetical</b> observations of <b>Earth</b> analogs with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC). Due to refraction, there will be a maximum tangent pressure level that can be probed during transit for each given planet-star system. We show that because of refraction, for an Earth-analog planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star only the top 0. 3 bars of the atmosphere can be probed, leading to a decrease in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of absorption features by 60 %, while for an Earth-analog planet orbiting in the habitable zone of an M 5 V star it is possible to probe almost the entire atmosphere with minimal decreases in SNR. We also show that refraction can result in temporal variations in the transit transmission spectrum which may provide a way to obtain altitude-dependent spectra of exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, the variations prior to ingress and subsequent to egress provide a way to probe pressures greater than the maximum tangent pressure that can be probed during transit. Therefore, probing the maximum range of atmospheric altitudes, and in particular the near-surface environment of an Earth-analog exoplanet, will require looking at out-of-transit refracted light in addition to the in-transit spectrum.
