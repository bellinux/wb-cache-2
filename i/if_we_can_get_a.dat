2500|$|Eastwood had {{confidence}} in Swank's acting background, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, [...] "I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. If {{we can get}} her trained up. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little bit more bulk on her, to make {{her look like a}} fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jonas, [...] "not much now, but {{the wind}} may rise before we get back. However, we'll go and see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Merely {{that the}} Cupania is sailing on the twentieth, and I've telegraphed to know <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> room. I'm afraid it won't {{be a good}} one, but she's the first boat out, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you like}} Plumfield better than Page's farm. Well, {{let us see}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on more comfortably this time than we did before." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{expect to}} do a lot of inland work. The {{smallness}} of the Snark makes this possible. When we enter the land, out go the masts and on goes the engine. There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River. We shall spend months on them <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> permission from the government. That will be the one obstacle to our inland voyaging--governmental permission. But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that permission, there is scarcely a limit to the inland voyaging <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two {{or three}} days, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> camels," [...] the other replied. [...] "I see {{you agree with}} me, then, as to Craig's {{probable}} destination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{couple of}} hundred yards into this thick wood the fire would not be seen through it," [...] Vincent said; [...] "of course I {{do not mean to}} make a great bonfire which would light up the forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I say it's idiotic {{to apply}} your {{standards}} {{to people who}} have nothing in common with you? I hate all this interfering. For God's sake let us go our way; and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little pleasure out of dross and tinsel, let us keep it." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy is in waiting. I {{need not}} tell you how our Printer failed us last night.[28] I hope for better things to-night, and am bent on a fight for it. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good paper to-morrow, I believe we are as safe as such a thing can be.|$|E
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> young men, {{young boys}} into scouting, {{it might help}} them get off the streets with these guns. [...] Frank [...] "Tick" [...] Coleman ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{ready to}} go up with you, Harry, we could go into lodgings at Putney, till we find a house to suit us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Mother,' said Ellen, 'I'll go in {{and take}} the things to Betsey on the next market-day, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> thirty shillings on them without the mantle--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't want {{to fall in}} love, do we, child? We don't want to be {{breaking}} our hearts like some young folks, and dancing attendance at balls night after night, and capering about in the Park to see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of the beloved object, eh, Rosey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'd better {{give you}} a tenner to go on with. I'll go and see my {{solicitor}} and get him to write to Miller. We can make him pay up something, I'm sure. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hundred pounds out of him it'll carry you on till after the baby comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We came to {{find new}} things," [...] I {{answered}} boldly. [...] "We {{are tired of the}} old things; we have come up out of the sea to know that which is unknown. We are of a brave race who fear not death, my very much respected father--that is, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little information before we die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't in {{very good}} form that night," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I must {{make up for it}} to-night, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Fothergill to give us our revenge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Frenchman has gone, father; and so noiselessly that I {{could hardly}} hear her. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out as quietly {{there is little}} fear of our being noticed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a vessel}} on the sands," [...] Frank exclaimed. [...] "Let us make for her. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on board <b>we</b> shall {{have a better}} chance than here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} {{four or five}} hundred yards start," [...] Rupert said, looking back, [...] "but the {{horsemen}} will overtake us; they can go faster than the camels for a burst. Ride, sheik," [...] he said; [...] "push on to the utmost. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> mile away from the footmen before they come up to us we can thrash the horsemen." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{course of}} public affairs {{being what it is}} in respect to the Church, I cannot {{reconcile}} myself to delay from a hope of succeeding at another time. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new church erected at Cockermouth, great will be the benefit, with the blessing of God, to that place; and our success cannot, I trust, but excite some neighbouring places to follow the example.|$|E
6000|$|... “Certainly not. We don’t {{want to do}} any exploring. All {{we want to do}} is to {{look for}} food, and the most likely food for us to find is a troop of monkeys among the trees {{overhanging}} the river. As a rule, I should not like to shoot the beasts. They are too much like human beings. But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> supply of meat it will be welcome, no matter what it may be. Of course we should not shoot many, for a couple of days would be the outside that meat would keep good here.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aint no {{cabin on}} this trail short of Hank Leeson's place, twenty miles {{this side of}} the fort. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that far I reckon <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make the fort." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 26 December 1821 In {{a letter}} to Trelawny, Edward E. Williams wrote: [...] "Have a boat <b>we</b> must and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Roberts to build her, so much the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Hugh, as they strung their bows, [...] "six arrows apiece here, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> off so many, {{and the odd}} eleven at {{our next}} stand. Ah, they come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} sort of {{excitement}} will be nice," [...] Dick replied; [...] "it must be horribly anxious work to think every time {{you go out to}} work that the place may be attacked and every one killed before you get back. But that is all nonsense, you know; I have been reading about some of the Kaffir wars; they are in the bush-country, down by the sea. We are going up on to the high lands at the back of Natal. Father says very likely we may buy a farm in the Transvaal, but mother does not seem to like the accounts of the Dutchmen or Boers, as they are called, who live there, and says she would rather have English neighbours; so I expect <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> farm somewhere in the Natal colony, we shall do so." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mike Park stated, [...] "what we're hoping {{with this}} tour is to maybe educate {{about the history}} of ska, but also hit an age group that's really impressionable. I know a lot of these kids are just here to see the music, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> small {{percentage}} to really get involved, become proactive, and volunteer their time with youth centers and demonstrate against Klans in their area--whatever. Just to become more educated." [...] Chuck Wren, the radio and street promotion for the tour, said he didn't think it would change the world but that on balance it was a good thing: [...] "I think {{part of the reason for}} the tour is to bring some awareness and to hand out literature from the different organizations and to raise money as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> horses {{enough to}} pull it," [...] said Ben. [...] "Some farmers won't let their horses out in such a storm as this--and you can't blame 'em much, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's my nickel," [...] and Seth {{produced}} the money, Dan following his partner's example. [...] "I'll be glad <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> rid of Sam; but I'm 'fraid that won't settle things for Jip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We do, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{the machine}} into shape," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "It {{may be that}} something got broke on the way {{and will have to}} be mended," [...] he added, anxiously.|$|R
5000|$|Carl Edwards won {{the pole}} {{with a time}} of 49.056 and a speed of 183.464 mph. “This is really cool," [...] Edwards said. [...] "Just to be here racing is cool and with all the work the guys put in yesterday, we started out terribly and we were really slow. Just proud of {{everybody}} for digging deep. Darian (Grubb, crew chief) and these guys have done a great job. TRD, Toyota and everybody has put a lot of effort in and to have Stanley Tools on the pole for the Brickyard 400, this is cool.” [...] "Overall from where we have been this weekend to what we picked up today I am proud of what my Shell Pennzoil team has done," [...] Joey Logano said after qualifying second. [...] "We have a good piece. I look forward to the race tomorrow. Clean air is king. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good start and settle in and click some laps off and run our strategy we can be there in the end." [...] "Unfortunately that wasn’t the one that paid, but that got us in the second round which was the important part," [...] Tony Stewart said after qualifying fourth. [...] "The second round we were a little bit freer than we were the first round. I was a little busy inside the car. We got that track bar adjuster and I was moving it around quite a bit during the lap.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Goode began October with {{a trip to}} the Wayne County Agricultural Fair in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He then campaigned in South Carolina and Georgia and {{attended}} the Florida State Constitution Party Convention. The party qualified for write-in status in many states in which ballot access efforts fell short. Concerns grew about the Goode campaign's impact on the race, particularly in Virginia. State GOP chairman Pat Mullins proclaimed, [...] "A vote for Virgil Goode is a vote for Barack Obama." [...] Goode felt the GOP attacks were an overreaction, arguing that he was more likely to receive votes from [...] "disgruntled Democrats" [...] and non-voters than Republicans. He disputed the [...] "spoiler" [...] label on CNN's The Situation Room, arguing that he was [...] "doing the right thing" [...] by running because it would [...] "help America <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of votes." [...] He added that if he were elected president, [...] "it would be a tremendous help" [...] because [...] "it would shake up Washington; an average citizen would be president instead of someone that is backed by the Super PACs." [...] Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus asserted that third party candidates like Goode would be [...] "non-factors" [...] in the race. [...] Goode spoke before the National Press Club on October 12 and remarked that he was [...] "optimistic" [...] his campaign would have a [...] "strong showing" [...] on Election Day. Again addressing the [...] "spoiler" [...] issue, he held that balancing the federal budget and securing jobs for American citizens were more important issues than who becomes president.|$|E
5000|$|Proctor {{signed for}} Preston North End on 20 January 2012 and was {{announced}} captain on his arrival and {{he received a}} new two-year deal on 1 July 2012. He scored his first goal for the club against future club Bury in a Football League Trophy tie on 18 December 2012. However, after 23 league appearances, 17 of them coming from the bench he decided to cancel his contract via mutual consent with the [...] "lily whites" [...] after 18 months of service. After only a week without a club Procter joined Bury F.C. on a free transfer penning a two-year deal with [...] "the shakers". In his first season at Bury he made 28 appearances in all competitions. In his second season at Bury he {{was put on the}} transfer list along with Ashley Grimes after being seen as surplus to requirements. On 1 September 2014 he had his contract cancelled because Procter wanted to leave Bury but Bury manager at the time David Flitcroft said [...] "If nothing happened (by Monday) we won't be loaning players out for no money". He rejoined Accrington Stanley on 1 September stating [...] "I spoke to James Beattie in the summer and made it clear that I was keen to come back. It became apparent that I wasn't going to get many games at Bury and I've never been someone to sit on a contract so I just wanted to come back and get playing games again."When I left Accrington we'd just finished in the play-offs and {{were on the verge of}} the play-offs when I actually left. That's where I'd like to help the club return to."I went to watch the Bury game on Saturday and really liked what I saw. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> decent run of results together then there's no reason why we can't push up that table.". He will competing against the likes of Luke Joyce and Josh Windass in 2014/15 season.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{spirit is}} still in the body, sir, but about to depart, <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> him to swallow a little of the coffee, the angel of death may yet loosen his hold on him." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "A lot {{of people}} hear about Biscayne National Park because of Stiltsville. It can be a {{wonderful}} educational tool <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> people out there so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> talk about the local history and marine environment." ...|$|R
