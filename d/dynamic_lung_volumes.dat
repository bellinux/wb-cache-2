40|$|ABSTRACT: Deep diving {{refers to}} {{saturation}} diving {{to a depth}} of more than 180 m (1. 9 MPa ambient pressure). In the 1990 s diving to 400 m may be necessary on the Norwegian continental shelf. The safety margins are narrow and the respiratory system is subject to great strain at such depths. The respiratory resistance increases and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> are reduced as the pressure Increases due to enhanced gas density. Helium is used together with oxygen as breathing gas and Us lower density partly normalises the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes.</b> The respiratory system puts clear Umitatlons on Intensity and duration. of physical work In deep diving. Systematic studies of lung mechanics, gas exchange and respiratory regulation in the different phases of deep dives are lacking.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} stimulated {{breathing}} during carbon dioxide inhalation was studied {{in a group}} of 21 patients with severe irreversible airways obstruction (mean FEV 1 = 0. 9 litre, mean FEV 1 /FVC% = 50 %). Carbon dioxide rebreathing experiments were performed, the ventilatory response being defined in terms of total ventilation (V) and CO 2 sensitivity (S). Breathing pattern was defined by the changes in tidal volume (delta VT) and respiratory frequency (delta f) and the maximum VT achieved (VTmax). Contrary to some previous studied no significant relationship could be demonstrated between the severity of airway obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC%, Raw) and the ventilatory response to rebreathing (V, S, delta VT, delta f, VTmax). However, measurements of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> (FEV 1, FVC, IC) were found to be significantly correlated with the breathing pattern variables (delta VT, delta f, VTmax). Resting PaO 2 and PaCO 2 were significantly correlated with delta VT but not delta f. Results indicate that the degree of airway obstruction does not dictate the ventilatory or breathing pattern response to carbon dioxide induced hyperpnoea. In contrast it is the restriction of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume,</b> by limiting the VT response, that appears to determine the ventilatory and breathing pattern response in patients with severe airway obstruction...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the long-term outcome of lung function in survivors of severe ARDS after modern treatment strategies including lung protective mechanical ventilation and prone positioning maneuvers. DESIGN: Follow-up cohort study. SETTING: University hospital pulmonary division and level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: Sixteen survivors of severe ARDS (from 1992 to 1994) with a lung injury score > or = 2. 5. MEASUREMENTS: The follow-up study (from 1995 to 1996) included interview, physical examination, chest radiographs, static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> diffusion {{capacity of the}} lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), blood gas analysis, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: The mean +/- SD interval between hospital discharge and functional assessment was 29. 5 +/- 8. 7 months (range, 15. 0 to 40. 7 months). In approximately {{one half of the}} patients, mild abnormalities in static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> were found. In 25 % (4 of 16 patients), lung function was obstructive; in 25 % (4 of 16 patients), lung function was restrictive; and in 6. 3 % (1 of 16 patients), a combined obstructive-restrictive pattern was revealed. DLCO was impaired in 12. 5 % (2 of 16 patients); gas exchange during exercise was impaired in 45. 5 % (5 of 11 patients).

The atmospheres were helium-oxygen mixtures with partial pressures of oxygen of 40 - 60 kPa. The durations of the dives were 14 - 30 days. Mean rate of decompression was 10. 5 - 13. 5 kPa/hour. A total of 43 divers were examined, six of whom took part in two dives, the others in one only. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> did not change significantly but total lung capacity (TLC) increased significantly by 4. 3 % and residual volume (RV) by 14. 8 % (p less than 0. 05).

A control examination of 38 of the divers {{four to six weeks}} after the dives showed a partial normalisation of the changes.

40|$|Lung {{function}} {{depends on}} the expansion and contraction of lung tissue during the respiratory cycle. The measurement of regional pulmonary function is of great interest and importance since many lung diseases can cause changes in biomechanical or material properties. It is also significant to study the radiation-induced changes in pulmonary function following radiation therapy. In this thesis, we propose a technique that uses four-dimensional (3 D+time) CT imaging (4 DCT), 3 D non-rigid image registration to estimate regional lung function. Lung images reconstructed at different inflation levels are analyzed for <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> function development during a breath cycle. We demonstrate local pulmonary function can be reproducibly measured using 4 DCT in human subjects prior to RT. The image registration accuracy is validated using semi-automatic anatomic landmark picking system. The major contributions of this thesis include: 1) demonstrating the robustness and reproducibility of regional pulmonary function measurement using 4 DCT in both sheep and human subjects, 2) developing approaches to improve the measurement reproducibility by <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> matching and Jacobian normalization, 3) development and comparison four cubic metrics for reproducibility analysis, 4) research on time-varying lung ventilation in different breathing phases in both sheep and human subjects.

40|$|Respiratory {{mechanical}} abnormalities {{in patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) may impair cardiodynamic responses and slow down heart rate (HR) kinetics compared with normal resulting in reduced convective oxygen delivery during exercise. We reasoned that heliox breathing (79 % helium- 21 % oxygen) and the attendant reduction of operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> should accelerate HR kinetics in the transition from rest to high-intensity exercise. Eleven male ambulatory patients with clinically stable COPD undertook constant work-rate cycle testing at 80 % of each individuals' maximum work capacity while breathing room air (RA) or heliox (HX), randomly. Mean response time (MRT) for HR and <b>dynamic</b> end-expiratory <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> (EELV) were measured. Resting EELV was not affected by HX breathing, while exercise EELV decreased significantly by 0. 23 L at isotime during HX breathing compared with RA. During FIX breathing, MRT for HR significantly accelerated (p = 0. 002) by an average of 20 s (i. e., 17 %). Speeded MRT for HR correlated with indices of reduced lung hyperinflation, such as EELV at isotime (r = 0. 88, p = 0. 03), and with improved exercise endurance time (r = - 0. 64, p = 0. 03). The results confirm that HX-induced reduction of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> hyperinflation is associated with consistent improvement in indices of cardio-circulatory function such as HR kinetics in the rest-to-exercise transition in COPD patients...|$|R

Effect of biventricular pacing on {{ventilatory}} and perceptual {{responses to}} exercise {{in patients with}} stable chronic heart failure. J Appl Physiol 106 : 1574 - 1583, 2009. First published February 26, 2009; doi: 10. 1152 /japplphysiol. 90744. 2008. -Despite the growing evidence supporting the use of biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), the mechanisms whereby acute hemodynamic improvements lead to improved exertional dyspnea are not precisely known. We hypothesized that improved cardiac function and ventilation-perfusion relations following CRT would reduce ventilatory demand, thereby improving <b>dynamic</b> operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and enhancing tidal volume expansion during exercise. This, in turn, {{would be expected to}} reduce perceived exertional dyspnea and contribute to improved exercise performance. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared cardiovascular, metabolic, ventilatory responses (breathing pattern, operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> pulmonary gas exchange) and exertional symptoms in seven stable CHF patients who undertook incremental cardiopulmonary cycle exercise test with CRT switched to the "on" (CRT(on)) or "off" (CRT(off)) modality. Following CRT(on), peak oxygen uptake was significantly increased by 15 %, and dyspnea ratings were lower for a given work rate (at work rate of 40 W, dyspnea = 1 +/- 0. 4 vs. 2. 5 +/- 0. 9 Borg units, P < 0. 05) and ventilation (at ventilation of 31 l/min, dyspnea = 2 +/- 0. 7 vs. 3. 3 +/- 1. 1 Borg units, P < 0. 05). CRT(on) was associated with improvements in ventilatory threshold, oxygen pulse, and oxygen uptake/work rate relationships (10. 2 +/- 1 vs. 7. 9 +/- 1. 3 ml. min(- 1). W(- 1), P < 0. 05). CRT(on) reduced the ventilatory requirement during exercise as well as the steepness of ventilation-CO(2) production slope (35 +/- 4 vs. 45 +/- 7, P < 0. 05). Changes in end-expiratory <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> during exercise were less with CRT(on) than with CRT(off) (0. 12 vs. 0. 37 liter, P < 0. 05), and breathing pattern was correspondingly slower and deeper. Biventricular pacing improved all noninvasive indexes of cardiac function and oxygen delivery during exercise.

Total lung volume is significantly smaller (46. 2 ± 5. 9 mL kg− 1) than in similar sized mammals (75. 0 ± 2. 1 mL kg− 1). The lung volume:body mass ratio decreases during growth rather than increase as it does in other mammals. Tracheal diameter is significantly narrower than in similar sized mammals but dead space volume (2. 9 ± 0. 5 mL kg− 1) is larger than in similar sized mammals (2. 4 ± 0. 1 mL kg− 1). Our calculations suggest that tidal volume (10. 5 ± 0. 2 mL kg− 1) is increased compared to that in other mammals(10. 0 ± 0. 2 mL kg− 1) so that the dead space:tidal volume ratio is the same as in other mammals.

In subjects treated with simple drainage mean TLC was 96 % predicted. One subject treated with talc poudrage had extensive pleural calcification and a substantial reduction in lung function (TLC 58 % predicted) with some evidence of lung fibrosis. None of the subjects had developed a mesothelioma. We conclude that, although talc poudrage may cause a mild restrictive impairment of lung function and pleural thickening on the chest radiograph, the long term outlook is good...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Breath-hold divers employ {{glossopharyngeal}} insufflation (GI) {{in order}} to prevent the lungs from compressing at great depth and to increase intrapulmonary oxygen stores, thus increasing breath-hold time. The presented case study shows the physiological data and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) findings of acute hyperinflation, deliberately induced by GI, in a breath-hold diver and discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the associated hazards of this unique competitive sport. Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and expiratory flows were within the normal range, with vital capacity and peak expiratory flow being higher than the predicted values. Airway resistance and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide were normal. Static compliance was normal and increased five-fold with hyperinflation. dMRI revealed a preserved shape of the thorax and diaphragm with hyperinflation. A herniation of the lung beneath the sternum and enlargement of the costodiaphragmatic angle were additional findings during the GI manoeuvre. After expiration, complete resolution to baseline was demonstrated. Hyperinflation can be physiological and even protective under abnormal physical conditions in the sense of acute adaptation to deep breath-hold diving. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging is adequate for visualisation of the sequence of the glossopharyngeal insufflation manoeuvre and the complete reversibility of deliberate hyperinflation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{activity}} and health status deteriorate {{early in the}} course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This can only partially be explained by the degree of airflow limitation. Changes in (resting and <b>dynamic)</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> are known to be associated with functional impairments and thus might influence physical activity level. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to explore the contribution of dynamic hyperinflation during daily life activities (ADL) in the decline in physical activity. METHODS: Airflow limitation and inspiratory capacity at rest to total lung capacity ratio (IC/TLC) as a measure of resting hyperinflation were measured in 59 patients with COPD (GOLD I-IV). Mean daily physical activity was assessed with a tri-axial accelerometer. Measurements of dynamic hyperinflation during ADL (DeltaIC and inspiratory reserve volume at end ADL) were performed at patients' home using a portable breath-by-breath system. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that resting as well as ADL-induced dynamic hyperinflation independently contributed to decreased daily physical activity, together explaining 45. 8 % of the variance in physical activity. In contrast to hyperinflation, the severity of airflow limitation (FEV 1) appeared to have no unique part in explaining how physically (in-) active patients were. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of resting hyperinflation and occurrence of dynamic hyperinflation during ADL contribute to reduced physical activity levels in patients with COPD, independently of the degree of airflow limitation...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory {{mechanical}} abnormalities {{in patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) may impair cardiodynamic responses and convective oxygen delivery during exercise, resulting in slower ventilatory, pulmonary gas exchange (PGE), and heart rate (HR) kinetics compared with normal. We reasoned that bronchodilators and the attendant reduction of operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> should accelerate ventilatory, PGE, and HR kinetics in the transition from rest to high-intensity exercise. Twelve clinically stable COPD patients undertook constant-work rate cycle testing at 75 % of each individual's maximum work capacity after receiving either combined nebulized bronchodilators (BD) or placebo (PL), randomly. Mean response time (MRT) and amplitude of slow component for oxygen uptake (V'O(2)), carbon dioxide production (V'CO(2)), ventilation (V'(E)), and HR together with operating <b>dynamic</b> end-expiratory <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> (EELV) were measured. Resting and exercise EELV decreased significantly by 0. 38 L after BD compared with PL. After BD, V'O(2), V'CO(2), V'(E), and HR MRT accelerated (p < 0. 05) by an average of 12, 22, 27, and 22 s, respectively (i. e., 15, 18, 22 and 27 %, respectively). The slow component for V'O(2) declined by an average of 55 ml/min compared with PL. Speeded MRT for V'O(2) correlated with indices of reduced lung hyperinflation, such as resting EELV (r = - 0. 64, p = 0. 025) and EELV at isotime (r = - 0. 77, p = 0. 0032). The results confirm an important interaction between abnormal dynamic respiratory mechanics and indices of cardio-circulatory function in the rest-to-exercise transition in COPD patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that elastic binding of the abdomen (AB) would enhance neuromuscular efficiency of the human diaphragm during exercise. Twelve healthy non-obese men aged 24. 8 ± 1. 7 years (mean ± SE) completed a symptom-limited constant-load cycle endurance exercise test at 85 % of their peak incremental power output with diaphragmatic electromyography (EMGdi) and respiratory pressure measurements under two randomly assigned conditions: unbound control (CTRL) and AB sufficient to increase end-expiratory gastric pressure (Pga,ee) by 5 – 8 cmH 2 O at rest. By design, AB increased Pga,ee by 6. 6 ± 0. 6 cmH 2 O at rest. Compared to CTRL, AB significantly increased the transdiaphragmatic pressure swing-to-EMGdi ratio by 85 – 95 % during exercise, reflecting enhanced neuromuscular efficiency of the diaphragm. By contrast, AB {{had no effect on}} spirometric parameters at rest, exercise endurance time or an effect on cardiac, metabolic, ventilatory, breathing pattern, <b>dynamic</b> operating <b>lung</b> <b>volume,</b> and perceptual responses during exercise. In conclusion, AB was associated with isolated and acute improvements in neuromuscular efficiency of the diaphragm during exercise in healthy men. The implications of our results are that AB may be an effective means of enhancing neuromuscular efficiency of the diaphragm in clinical populations with diaphragmatic weakness/dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has become an}} attractive tool in understanding the characteristic of air flow in the human lungs. Inter-subject variations make subject-specific simulations essential for understanding structure-function relationship, assessing lung function and improving drug delivery. However, currently the subject-specific CFD analysis remains challenging due, in large part to, two issues: construction of realistic deforming airway geometry and imposition of physiological boundary conditions. To address these two issues, we develop subject-specific, <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> models by utilizing two or multiple volume multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) data sets and image registrations in this thesis. A mass-preserving nonrigid image registration algorithm is first proposed to match a pair of three-dimensional (3 D) MDCT data sets with large deformations. A novel similarity criterion, the sum of squared tissue volume difference (SSTVD), is introduced to account for changes in intensity with lung inflation. We then demonstrate the ability to develop <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> models by using a pair of <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> to account for deformations of airway geometries and subject-specific boundary conditions. The deformation of the airway geometry is derived by the registration-derived deformation field and subject-specific boundary condition is estimated from regional ventilation in a 3 D and one-dimensional (1 D) coupled multi-scale framework. Improved <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> models are then proposed from three <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> by utilizing nonlinear interpolations. The improved lung models account for nonlinear geometry motions and time-varying boundary conditions during breathing. The capability of the proposed <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> model is expected to move the CFD-based interrogation of lung function to the next plateau...|$|R
