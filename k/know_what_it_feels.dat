500|$|Cameron {{acknowledges}} that Avatar implicitly criticizes the United States' {{role in the}} Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference {{to the use of}} the term shock and awe in the film, Cameron said, [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to launch the missiles. We don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like for them to land on our home soil, not in America."

500|$|Cameron {{said that}} Americans have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to {{understand}} {{the impact of their}} country's recent military campaigns. [...] Commenting on the term [...] "shock and awe" [...] in the film, Cameron said: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to launch the missiles. [...] We don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E
500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like {{to fight the}} hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings {{with the intention of}} starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E

Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her that she does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to be worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks who else would love her; she answers: [...] "Me".

500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being {{that it will be a}} small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

Her death is significant because it gives Victor a unique understanding of his creation; he now <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like to be completely alone in the world, with nothing to live for but revenge.|$|R

You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, {{and then the next}} thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine {{what it feels like to}} not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E

40|$|We explore {{some aspects}} of the elusive idea of a “teachable moment” with a special {{emphasis}} on the role of emotion, intuition, and ima-gination as well as intuition, paradox and possibility. The teachable moment occurs when students and teachers genuinely share an interest in better understanding something, some situation, or, in the case discussed, some text, and wish to inquire into the object of mutual concern together. Some of the aesthetic elements of John Dewey’s theory of inquiry serve as a way to gain insight into the “logic ” of creating and sustaining teachable moments. The “teachable moment ” is perhaps the most sought after pedagogical prize. Every teacher <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like even if she cannot name its characteristics. It is as wonderful as it is elusive.

The {{aim of this study}} was to gain insight into the phenomena of nutritional care from the patients' perspective, by exploring older people's experiences and feelings in relation to the provision of food in hospital. A descriptive study design was employed to enable patient's own words to offer insight into their experiences. Data were collected from individual interviews with fifteen patients, and analysed according to the principles of phenomenology. Four key themes emerged from the data: Making choices, anticipation, eating behaviour, and appreciation. The findings are based on informant's descriptions of the specific themes, and their general feeling of each theme being experienced either positively or negatively, and indicate patients' experience of eating was an 'evolving process', termed the 'eating process continuum', that began even before patients received their food. This process was affected by issues such as the variety of foods offered, the content of the meals and the nursing care given at mealtimes.
