The new Dark Age <b>is</b> <b>ending,</b> however, and a new Renaissance is beginning. Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott, a highly regarded secular scholar, is sent by his cousin Hannegan, Mayor of Texarkana, to the abbey.

5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony of Havana and {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns guarding it. As the battle <b>is</b> <b>ending,</b> Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes her out of the way. All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage <b>is</b> <b>ending,</b> spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E

25|$|Orphan colonies are colonies {{that are}} {{maintained}} by workers after the queen is {{gone from the}} nest. Orphaned workers {{have the ability to}} mate and produce female offspring, but they only begin to oviposit after the queen has disappeared. This is unique to P. snelleni. Orphaned workers can act essentially as replacement queens, because they can inhibit mating in other workers and founding queens. It has been said that P. snelleni goes by the mode of serial polygyny, however this was disproven because by the time new reproductive females are ready to reproduce, the season <b>is</b> <b>ending.</b> So, only a few queen replacements can occur. There are usually 1-2 laying workers that are elderly in these orphan colonies. The dominant laying workers in a nest have a monopoly over ovipositions by selectively egg-eating.|$|E

25|$|On Christmas Day, Gavin texts Sharon {{and later}} arrives at her house, saying he has missed her. Sharon hurries {{him out and}} he leaves her a present. He also visits her in {{hospital}} when her son Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) {{is involved in a}} car crash. He invites her to Hong Kong but she declines, promising to still keep in touch and thanking him for the present. When Sharon tells Gavin that she <b>is</b> <b>ending</b> her marriage to Phil, he visits her, offering his support. She rejects him and the gift he has left for Dennis, saying she does not want liars in her life, but he insists he has never lied to her and reminds her of his offer to join him overseas, insisting that he will have a steady job and that he wants a second chance of having a family. Sharon and Dennis later join Gavin.|$|E
25|$|The lovers, at last {{alone and}} {{freed from the}} {{constraints}} of courtly life, declare their passion for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart. It is only in night, he claims, that they can truly be together and only in the long night of death can they be eternally united ("O sink' hernieder, Nacht der Liebe"). During their long tryst, Brangäne calls a warning several times that the night <b>is</b> <b>ending</b> ("Einsam wachend in der Nacht"), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other's arms. Marke is heartbroken, {{not only because of}} his nephew's betrayal but also because Melot chose to betray his friend Tristan to Marke and because of Isolde's betrayal as well ("Mir – dies? Dies, Tristan – mir?").|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} terminus of the freeway, SR 143 {{begins at the}} intersection of 48th Street and Broadway, climbing over Interstate 10 on the original 48th Street bridge built without any shoulder lanes in 1967. Traffic heading southbound at this point is warned of a traffic signal that hides over the optical horizon of the overpass to most traffic. To combat safety issues raised by the lack of visibility of the main traffic signals, a second traffic signal was installed at a higher elevation so that it is visible to traffic on the northern approach of the overpass. At one point, the second signal included a high-intensity strobe embedded in the red signal; however, the strobe has since been removed. In addition to the strobing signal light, rumble strips have been cut into the bridge deck at several intervals, and there is a sign that turns on if the signal is red and the speed limit is reduced, further alerting traffic that the freeway <b>is</b> <b>ending.</b>|$|E

500|$|Perot {{employed}} a massive marketing strategy, spending $34.8 {{million to buy}} half hour and hour segments on major television networks, memorably using charts to illustrate his ideas for the economy. His first infomercial was aired on October 6, and viewed by 16.5 million people. He used two dozen charts and a metal pointer during the ad, explaining that [...] "We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle." [...] He later concluded that [...] "our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody {{steps up to the}} plate and accepts responsibility for anything." [...] He spent a large portion of the infomercial speaking into the camera while sitting at a desk in front of a bookshelf. Political experts commented that the nature of the ad was groundbreaking. Two days later, an ad campaign was unveiled that included three new 60-second commercials to air on ESPN, CNN and five other cable networks. One commercial entitled [...] "Red Flag" [...] displayed a waving red flag with a background drum roll and the statement: [...] "While the Cold War <b>is</b> <b>ending</b> another war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams." [...] A second half hour infomercial was shown on October 9.|$|E
500|$|... "Soft Light" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "gains points for the obscure subject matter" [...] but [...] "loses them for the strained conspiratorial element". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also gave it a [...] "B–". He praised the cold open for its strangeness and X's involvement, but thought that the explanation for Banton's shadow was not satisfactorily fleshed out. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the episode's case, calling it one wherein [...] "Mulder and Scully get to investigate properly, coming up with theories that they later build on or retract." [...] Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the episode's conclusion, noting that [...] "there's no better illustration for distrusting the government than the brilliant closing scene" [...] which features Shalhoub [...] "fixed to a chair, bombarded with flashes of light, as one single tear rolls down his terrified face." [...] Other reviews were decidedly more critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 5 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode falls short due to a completely ludicrous central concept, only partially countered by an interesting resolution highlighting the more sinister side of Informant X. Much like last season’s final few episodes, this season <b>is</b> <b>ending</b> with plenty of hints that Mulder and Scully are pushing the wrong buttons." ...|$|E
