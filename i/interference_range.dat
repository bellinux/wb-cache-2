The lack of lubricant in the wreckage's turbopump indicated cooling by a pumped liquefied gas, and intelligence reports about liquid oxygen as rocket fuel allowed the accurate interpretation that the payload was 2 tons or less. Conversely, the British mistakenly prepared radio jammers since the wreckage happened to have Wasserfall guidance control for a test (only {{a small portion of}} combat V-2s used radio motor cutoff—during ascent and with a 10 km <b>interference</b> <b>range</b> from the [...] "firing point"). The test was for determining [...] "the influence of the rocket jet on the guidance radio signal."|-| 1944-07-28| Big Ben| Eight V-2 parts from Poland along with photographs, drawings, and Special Report 1/R no. 242 arrived in the UK from Brindisi, Italy. In Operation Most III an RAF Dakota had landed at an abandoned German airfield in Poland on July 25/26 and collected the 100 lb of cargo from the Polish underground. The Polish parts came from V-2s launched from Blizna (one had crashed near Sarnaki without exploding on May 20), and the underground had hidden wreckage in the Western Bug river. Antoni Kocjan prepared the Polish parts and information, which arrived after the British had already obtained similar material from the Swedish V-2 wreckage (as did Sanders' Blizna report). Most III also transported Jerzy Chmielewski, who had cycled 200 miles through enemy territory and reported the V-2 airbursts to the British.|-| 1944-07-31| Meillerwagen| A dummy rocket and an erector trailer captured at a V-2 storage site at Hautmesnil confirmed the size of the V-2.|-| 1944-08-15| Double Cross System| Use of double agents to deceive the Luftwaffe into mis-aiming the V-1s continued despite risking civilians in one area over others. After the last V-1 launch in France on September 1, Canadian troops captured the last of the initial V-1 launch sites. [...] Despite intelligence and countermeasures, V-1s killed/seriously injured over 6,000/17,000 UK civilians, even when only ~1/4 of the V-1s launched at England struck successfully. Over 8000 V-1s were launched at London [...] (2,448 at Antwerp)—2340 reached the London Civil Defence Region from France, and by June 27 in the UK, [...] "over 200,000 houses had been damaged or destroyed by the V-1… and shattered sewage systems threatened serious epidemics."|-| 1944-08-25|| [...] Plans for aerial reconnaissance of V-2 sites were included in the joint [...] "Plan for Attack on the German Rocket Organization When Rocket Attacks Commence". [...] Based on rocket fuel intelligence the plan also identified primary and secondary liquid-oxygen plants as the third priority targets [...] Mission 572 on August 24 had targeted rocket fuel production in France and Belgium.|-| 1944-08-25| Belgium| Based on the intelligence of V-2 liquid oxygen, the Eighth Air Force bombed 5 LOX plants (the next day's mission was [...] "to hit liquid oxygen plants at La Louvière, Torte and Willebroek").|-| 1944-09-08| Sound ranging| Microphones in East Kent reported the times of the first London V-2s: 18:40:52 and 18:41:08 (at different locations, both Jones and Duncan Sandys recognized the supersonic [...] "double-crack"). The ranging system provided the V-2 [...] "trajectory from which the general launching area could be determined." [...] Civil defense officials refused to give any public information about the rocket ("It might have been a gas main explosion"), and despite that day's German headline—"Vergeltungswaffe-2 Gegen London im Einsatz" [...] (Vengeance Weapon 2 in Action Against London)—the British's official SECRET statement was that [...] "BIG BEN" [...] had not been [...] "CONFIRMED".|-| 1944-09-17| Netherlands| Airfields suspected as He 111 bases for V-1 air-launches were attacked (airfields were bombed at Hopsten, Leeuwarden, Steenwijk, and Rheine). [...] Modified V-1s were air-launched from September 16-January 14 (865 launches). On October 21, the first V-1 launches for Operation Donnerschlag (Thunderclap) began from Germany.|-| 1944-09-22| Poland| [...] After the Soviets captured Blizna in July and the Anglo-American Sanders Mission arrived on September 3, Colonel T.R.B Sanders issued his preliminary report.|-| | Mittelwerk|PR of Niedersachswerfen showed shadows of railcars consistent with those loaded with V-2s.|-| 1944-10-25| Netherlands| An informant arrived behind Allied lines with reports of V-2 launches from Wassenaar.|-| 1944-12| Royal Artillery| Project Firework was enacted by the 11th Survey Regiment to watch for [...] "all data obtained regarding the origin and flight of enemy rockets" [...] with the use of sound ranging stations and, after modification, the radar stations at Swingate, Rye, Pevensey, Poling, and Ventnor (11 Group); and Branscombe, Ringstead, and Southbourne (10 Group) along with the pair at St Lawrence and Newchurch.

40|$|Summary: In this paper, {{interference}} and {{matrix effect}} of Fe on the spectroscopic (FAAS) determination of Au and Ag in the ore of İzmit Region in Turkey was investigated. Au and Ag {{contents of the}} samples were determined by the FAAS and Fe by the XRF and found to be about 12. 7 % Fe. To determine the interference effect of Fe, standard solutions of FeCl 3 were added to 0. 5 - 1 ppm standard solutions of Au increasingly and analyzed by FAAS. The minimum interference occured at 100 ppm Fe 3 + in 0. 5 ppm standard solution of Au and 500 - 2000 ppm Fe 3 + in 1 ppm standard solution of Au on BC-ON (Background Correction-ON) mode and higher <b>interference</b> <b>ranges</b> were found on BC-OFF mode.

These parameters are defined in [1] and the authors proposed the first analytical {{model for the}} <b>interference</b> <b>range</b> based on which new protocols has been proposed [2]–[5]. In this paper, we improve on this model by relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions. A new formula for <b>interference</b> <b>range</b> is derived, where noise is not ignored as {{it was done in}} [1]. Our formula shows that <b>interference</b> <b>range</b> obtained by ignoring the noise is a good approximation, only for receivers close to the transmitter. While for receivers closer to the transmission range, which suffer from hidden terminal problem, ignoring the noise results in substantially underestimating the <b>interference</b> <b>range.</b> We also study the effect of physical layer parameters on Rtx and Ri, by introducing more general definitions for these ranges. Our study indicates that both Rtx and Ri are influenced by variations in packet size, modulation, and coding. This implies that RTS/CTS packets may have a different Rtx and Ri compared to data packets. Thus, we expect the performance analysis based on the assumption of similar Rtx and Ri for RTS/CTS and data packets, to be inaccurate. Moreover, effects of small-scale fading on Rtx and Ri for the case where fading value is constant during a packet investigated. Our case study indicates that Rayleigh fading has a negative effects on both Rtx and Ri...|$|E

30|$|This type {{solution}} {{is presented in}} [13] by Ju Suyang and Evans Joseph B through using spectrum disjointness. A space discovery protocol is designed to find multiple space disjoint paths, and a spectrum discovery protocol is designed to guarantee spectrum bands which are used by nodes in selected paths that are independent to neighbor nodes. So, the chosen paths are space disjoint, edge disjoint, and spectrum disjoint. This protocol could avoid an interference between neighbor nodes and guarantee the communication of nodes in disjoint paths that are spectrum uncorrelated. However, this solution does not focus on the disjoint multi-path routing problem in CR networks, and the spectrum bands of selected links may not be independent from each other, and PUs’ <b>interference</b> <b>ranges</b> are much larger than CR nodes, which leads to path selections that are useless.|$|R

The allocation of the same channels in neighbor cells cause inter-cell interference, so the channel allocation {{needs to be taken}} carefully to lower the inter-cell interference. In distributed channel allocation, each cell independently tries to allocate channels that suffer low interference level. In this paper, under the assumption of static users, we introduce the concept of <b>interference</b> <b>range</b> and use it in designing our two algorithms; basic and combined.

30|$|The lower {{obtained}} throughputs can {{be explained}} as follows. By using the protocol model, {{there is one more}} condition added to the definition of an independent set. In particular, the receiver node of a link in an independent set must not be in the <b>interference</b> <b>ranges</b> of the transmitter nodes of the other links in the same independent set. Consequently, the size of an independent set is in general reduced, whereas the size of a family of independent sets whose union can cover all links of the network is in general increased. Given the same amount of traffic, the wireless link scheduling constraint, and the same link capacities, the number of channel uses available from independent sets to support traffic demands per unit time becomes smaller. Therefore, the capacity of wireless mesh networks decreases when there is a single wireless channel available.|$|R

Then, the least overlapped paths could be selected for disjoint paths route. But because full routing information is needed in advance, dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol should be equipped for path searching.

Although this type solutions could solve disjoint multi-path routing problem in CR networks in some respects, priori routing knowledge is necessary, which would cost exponential level time complexity for processing.
