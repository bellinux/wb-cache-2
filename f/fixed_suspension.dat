40|$|Human leukocytes <b>fixed</b> in <b>suspension</b> {{were allowed}} to settle onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and {{prepared}} for observation with the scanning electron microscope (SEM).

Quantitative comparison of the number of cells present after settling with the number retained for final viewing with the SEM revealed a cell yield approaching 100 %. This simple, reproducible, high-yield technique for processing cells <b>fixed</b> in <b>suspension</b> for SEM prevents changes in surface architecture induced by collecting live cells onto various substrates before fixation and also avoids potentially selective cell losses.

5000|$|Torque, moment, or {{moment of}} force (see [...] "Defining terminology" [...] below) is {{rotational}} force.

5000|$|Kapitza's {{pendulum}} is a rigid pendulum {{in which}} the pivot point vibrates in a vertical direction, up and down. It is named after Russian Nobel laureate physicist Pyotr Kapitza, who in 1951 developed a theory which successfully explains some of its unusual properties. The unique feature of the Kapitza pendulum is that the vibrating suspension can cause it to balance stably in an inverted position, with the bob above the suspension point. In the usual pendulum with a <b>fixed</b> <b>suspension,</b> the only stable equilibrium position is with the bob hanging below the suspension point; the inverted position {{is a point of}} unstable equilibrium, and the smallest perturbation moves the pendulum out of equilibrium. In nonlinear control theory the Kapitza pendulum is used {{as an example of a}} parametric oscillator that demonstrates the concept of [...] "dynamic stabilization".|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the F-actin network in cycling {{suspension}} culture cells of carrot (Daucus carota L.) using rhodaminyl lysine phallotoxin (RLP). In addition to conventional fixation with formaldehyde, we have used two different nonfixation methods before adding RLP: extracting cells in a stabilizing buffer; inducing transient pores in the plasma membrane with pulses of direct current (electroporation). These alternative methods for introducing RLP revealed additional features of the actin network not seen in aldehyde-fixed cells. The three- dimensional organization of this network in nonflattened cells was demonstrated by projecting stereopairs derived from through-focal series of computer-enhanced images. F-actin is present in interphase cells in four interconnected configurations: a meshwork surrounding the nucleus; thick cables in transvacuolar strands and deep in the cytoplasm; a finer network of bundles within the cortical cytoplasm; even finer filaments that run in ordered transverse array around the cell periphery. The actin network is organized differently during division {{but it does not}} disappear as do the cortical microtubules. RLP stains a central filamentous cortical band as the chromatin begins to condense (preprophase); it stains the mitotic spindle (as recently shown by Seagull et al. [Seagull, R. W., M. Falconer, and C. A. Weerdenburg, 1987, J. Cell Biol., 104 : 995 - 1004] for aldehyde <b>fixed</b> <b>suspension</b> cells) and the cytokinetic apparatus (as shown by Clayton, L., and C. W. Lloyd, 1985, Exp. Cell Res., 156 : 231 - 238).

40|$|As the {{vibration}} of high speed train becomes fierce {{when the train}} runs at high speed, {{it is crucial to}} develop a novel suspension system to negotiate trainâ€™s vibration. This paper presents a novel suspension based on Magnetorheological fluid (MRF) damper and MRF based smart air spring. The MRF damper is used to generate variable damping while the smart air spring is used to generate field-dependent stiffness. In this paper, the two kind smart devices, MRF dampers and smart air spring, are developed firstly. Then the dynamic performances of these two devices are tested by MTS. Based on the testing results, the two devices are equipped to a high speed train which is built in ADAMS. The skyhook control algorithm is employed to control the novel suspension. In order to compare {{the vibration}} suppression capability of the novel suspension with other kind suspensions, three other different suspension systems are also considered and simulated in this paper. The other three kind suspensions are variable damping with <b>fixed</b> stiffness <b>suspension,</b> variable stiffness with <b>fixed</b> damping <b>suspension</b> and passive suspension. The simulation results indicate that the variable damping and stiffness suspension suppresses the vibration of high speed train better than the other three suspension systems...|$|R

40|$|The common {{practice}} of counting bacteria using epifluorescence microscopy involves selecting 5 â€“ 30 random fields {{of view on}} a glass slide to calculate the arithmetic mean which is then used to estimate the total bacterial abundance. However, not much {{is known about the}} accuracy of the arithmetic mean when it is calculated by selecting random fields of view and its effect on the overall abundance. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the arithmetic mean by estimating total bacterial abundance and to calculate its variance using a bootstrapping technique. Three <b>fixed</b> <b>suspensions</b> obtained from a three-week-old marine biofilm were stained and dispersed on glass slides.

40|$|In {{connection}} with a fractionation procedure involving the separation of particles, a dilute suspension of these particles in a liquid is carefully layered on a dense liquid. Under ideal conditions, the suspension forms a zone of finite thickness with a 'sharp' interface between the suspension layer and the supporting liquid.

However, {{in many cases the}} ideal conditions necessary for the fractionation process are not obtained. Many studies have been conducted to explore the reasons for suspension layer 'instability'.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that microwave energy (MW) {{can be used in}} conjunction with chemical cross-linking agents in order to rapidly <b>fix</b> cell <b>suspensions</b> and tissue blocks for electron microscopy in 7 - 9 seconds. The optimal MW fixation method involved immersing tissues up to 1 cu cm in dilute aldehyde fixation and immediately irradiating the specimens in a conventional microwave oven for 9 seconds to 50 C. Ultrastructural preservation of samples irradiated by MW energy was comparable to that of the control samples immersed in aldehyde fixative for 2 hours at 25 C. Stereologic analysis showed that tissue blocks fixed by the MW fixation method did not cause organelles such as liver mitochondria and salivary gland granules to shrink or to swell. Potential applications for this new fixation technology include the investigation of rapid intracellular processes (eg, vesicular transport) and preservation of proteins that are difficult to demonstrate with routine fixation methods (eg, antigens and enzymes) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{microscopic}} nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) slide test, used {{to score}} {{the ability of}} individual phagocytic leukocytes to produce superoxide, was improved according to the following procedure.

On December 14, after the last game of Avery's suspension, the Stars announced that Avery would {{not return to the}} team. One factor in the Stars decision was that coach Dave Tippett and several of the players, including Mike Modano and Marty Turco, let it be known they weren't willing to take him back on the team. Tippett had warned Avery not to talk to the media about his former girlfriends, and was outraged when he did so.
