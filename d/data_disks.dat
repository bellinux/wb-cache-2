500|$|The {{cooperative}} story {{takes place}} after the single-player campaign and has some ties into it, but players {{are not required to}} play them in order. Player characters Atlas and P-Body are bipedal robots who navigate five sets of test chambers together, each with a fully functioning portal gun. After completing a test chamber, the robots are disassembled and reassembled at the next chamber. After completing each set of chambers, they are returned to a central hub. The puzzles in each set of chambers focus on a particular testing element or puzzle-solving technique. In the first four sets, GLaDOS prepares the robots to venture outside of the test systems of Aperture Laboratories to recover <b>data</b> <b>disks.</b> She destroys them and restores their memories to new bodieswhich also happens when they die in a test chamber hazard. At first, GLaDOS is excited about her non-human test subjects, but later becomes dissatisfied because the two robots cannot truly die. At the end of the story, the robots gain entry to [...] "the Vault", where humans are stored in stasis. GLaDOS gives thanks to the robots on locating the humans, whom she sees as new test subjects, and destroys the robots.|$|E

Also, the 640 KB format differed by using physical CHS sector numbers starting with 0 (not 1, as common) and incrementing sectors in the order sector-track-head (not sector-head-track, as common). The FAT started {{at the beginning of the}} next track. These differences make these formats unrecognizable by other operating systems. The geometry parameters for these formats are: ...|$|E

Wai Lin is kidnapped but is later freed by Bond after he kills Carver's right-hand man, Stamper. Wai Lin stops the engine while Bond shoots and kills Carver and stops the stolen nuclear missile from destroying Beijing. Bond and Wai Lin escapes the stealth boat before it self-destructs.|$|R

This paper describes {{the design and}} implementation of Trail, a disk subsystem that features a track-based logging technique to minimize the performance impact of synchronous disk write operations. We have demonstrated in this research that Trailcan reduce the latency of a synchronous disk write operation to close to data transfer delay only, the absolute theoretical minimum. Trailfirst bu#ers an incoming synchronous disk write request at a persistent logging disk, and asynchronously performs the write operation to a normal <b>data</b> <b>disk.</b> As a result, the performance of synchronous disk write is improved significantly without any compromise in data integrity. In the event of system failures, Trail's data recovery mechanism guarantees the integrity of data blocks that are bu#ered at the log disk but not yet committed to the actual <b>data</b> <b>disk</b> at the time [...] ...|$|R
