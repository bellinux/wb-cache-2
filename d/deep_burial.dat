Out of 89 samples collected for petrographic studies, six major microfacies have been identified, namely brecciated limestone, dolomites, mudstones, wackestones, packstones and grainstones. Four major diagenetic processes comprising micritization, cementation, compaction and dolomitization have also been identified. Micritization occurs as the first phase diagenesis after the sediments were deposited on the sea floor, followed by cementation in the marine environment and also in meteoric environments when the shallow marine carbonate at some points in time was subjected to subaerial exposure. Early burial were indicated by fractures and deformation as well as destruction of grains whole structure.

40|$|Abstract: The North Atlantic {{continental}} margins {{have been}} subject to widespread exhumation, although the timing, magnitude and causes of this uplift and erosion are debated. Exhumation is thought to be most severe across the Irish Sea basin system (Western UK), and recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on the role of Palaeogene underplating as the primary mechanism of uplift. We present a study of palaeothermal and compaction data from the Mochras borehole (NW Wales). Located near the presumed locus of exhumation, Mochras penetrated thick successions of Lower Jurassic and Oligo-Miocene sediments. Our results indicate that both these successions experienced considerably <b>deeper</b> <b>burial</b> prior to early Cretaceous and Neogene exhumation, respectively. Apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA) and vitrinite reflectance data from the borehole reveal evidence for exhumation-related cooling episodes beginning during the Cretaceous (150 – 80 Ma) and Cenozoic (50 – 0 Ma). Regional AFTA results and stratigraphic constraints refine the timing estimates to the early Cretaceous (120 – 115 Ma) and Neogene (20 – 0 Ma). Estimates of exhumation magnitudes during these episodes based on palaeothermal and compaction data are c. 2. 5 km and c. 1. 5 km, respectively. Palaeothermal data provide no evidence for elevated Palaeogene palaeotemperatures indicative of <b>deeper</b> <b>burial,</b> and thus question the basis of Palaeogene exhumation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Thermal {{maturity}} analyses {{provide a}} valid basis {{to reconstruct the}} burial and temperature history of sedi-mentary rocks. In combination with computer based modeling {{it is possible to}} quantify former overburden and erosional thickness. This study was carried out to analyze thermal maturity and elaborate the burial history of Permo-Mesozoic sediments of the Western Dolomites, Northern Italy. Based on their location in the non-metamorphosed Southern Alps of the Alpine realm, the Dolomites are well suited to study thermal maturation in a complex orogenic setting. Determination of maturity was carried out by vit-rinite reflectance and solid bitumen reflectance measure-ments on a large number of samples as well as by Rock– Eval pyrolysis. Vitrinite reflectance commonly ranges between 0. 5 % VRr for Triassic and 0. 76 % VRr for Per-mian sediments allowing an analysis of the lateral and vertical maturation patterns. Several 1 D basin models were developed and calibrated by maturity measurements. Results show that <b>deepest</b> <b>burial</b> probably occurred at the end of Cretaceous times, followed by erosion of about 1800 ± 200 m. The estimated heat flows were moderate with 75 mW/m 2 for Jurassic rifting, 46 mW/m 2 for times of <b>deepest</b> <b>burial</b> and 41 mW/m 2 for present day...|$|R

It is shown that metals in howardites are found primarily in Ni-poor components, associated with primary clasts and similar in composition to pristine lunar anorthosite metal, and in Ni-rich grains, associated with glassy melt rocks and possibly derived from the projectiles which caused the melting. Variations in primary clast metal compositions among the howardite and the identities of matrix and clast metal contents within many howardites suggest that each howardite is derived from a distinct source region.
