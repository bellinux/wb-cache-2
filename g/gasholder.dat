25|$|The Oval Gasholders is the {{unofficial}} name {{given to the}} gas holder (gasometer) located near The Oval in London, England. It was built in 1853 and is officially called Kennington Holder Station by its owners, Southern Gas Network. It is a grade II listed building with the listed part of them known as <b>Gasholder</b> No. 1.|$|E
25|$|Few batsmen, or writers, {{announce}} {{themselves as}} Dexter did when batting for Sussex against Surrey at the Oval last summer. His first ball, from the pavilion end, was slightly over-pitched on middle and leg. Feet moved fractionally, head hardly at all, but the bat swung {{the ball for}} six over long leg and they fetched it back from the seats under the <b>gasholder.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The first iron <b>gasholder</b> was {{installed}} on the site in 1847 to service a gasworks next to Vauxhall Bridge. [...] The Phoenix Gas Light and Coke Company replaced it in 1877–79 to designs by Sir Corbet Woodall, with two lifts holding 3 million cubic ft, making it the largest <b>gasholder</b> in the world. [...] It was enlarged again by Frank Livesey in 1891–92 for the South Metropolitan Gas Company, by modifying the guides to increase their height by 50%, and adding two more lifts, including a [...] "flying lift" [...] rising above the guides, doubling its capacity to 6 million cubic ft. [...] It is an early use of wrought iron in a frame. [...] This structure, <b>Gasholder</b> 1, is Grade II listed by virtue of it: a) being the world's largest <b>gasholder</b> at the time, b) its famous designers Frank and George Livesey and c) it being an internationally renowned backdrop to matches at the adjacent Oval Cricket Ground. The cylindrical wrought iron guide frame is about [...] high, with 24 t-section lattice standards, rising in three tiers and connected by three rows of horizontal lattice girders, with a rising [...] "bell" [...] of four tiers, including the top [...] "flying lift" [...] rising above the standards. [...] It would have topped [...] when full.|$|E

2500|$|A second <b>gasholder,</b> No.2, was {{constructed}} in 1854-5 and converted to a spiral-guided holder in 1950, which {{does not require a}} frame. [...] No.3 {{was constructed}} in 1869 but demolished c.1975.|$|E
2500|$|Gas can {{be stored}} above ground in a <b>gasholder</b> (or gasometer), largely for balancing, not {{long-term}} storage, {{and this has been}} done since Victorian times. [...] These store gas at district pressure, meaning that they can provide extra gas very quickly at peak times. [...] Gasholders are perhaps most used in the United Kingdom and Germany.|$|E
2500|$|The Phoenix Gas Light & Coke Company {{bought the}} site {{north of the}} Oval in 1845 from the Southwark & Vauxhall Waterworks Company, who had laid out the site in 1807 as a {{waterworks}} with an engine house and two circular brick-lined reservoirs. The Phoenix Gas Company adapted the circular reservoirs for <b>gasholder</b> tanks and erected five gasometers between 1847 and 1874.|$|E
50|$|By 1948, {{capacities}} in {{the central}} and eastern <b>gasholders</b> had been significantly increased, to provide a total capacity of 1,517,000 cu.ft., and <b>gasholders</b> 1 and 3 had been re-numbered to 3 and 1 respectively. The 1912 cast iron scrubber, known as the Gas Stripping Tower, obsolete by 1948, {{was taken out of}} service at around this time, later to be re-located in nearby parkland.|$|R
5000|$|Wetherby Gasworks {{was opened}} in 1852 {{on what is}} now Gashouse Lane. It had two <b>gasholders</b> and closed in the late 1970s. [...] Wetherby had a {{concrete}} water tower in the Spofforth Hill area which was demolished in 1959. [...] The gasworks no longer has <b>gasholders,</b> or produces town gas since the conversion to natural gas, however a gas site still does exist {{in the vicinity of}} Gashouse Lane and Victoria Street.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, {{there were}} three <b>gasholders</b> on site, No.1 a triple or quadruple lift of the spiral guide type, No.2 a single lift frame-guided type and No.3 a double lift frame-guided type, {{all of which have}} since been retired or replaced. However, site {{inspection}} suggests that the same (brick) water tanks have been adapted and/or re-used for the later <b>gasholders.</b> Capacity in 1935 seems to have been 922,000 cu.ft., one of the holders probably being the same or of the same configuration (non-telescopic) as the one that survived the 1893 flood.|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous British <b>gasholder</b> is the large column-guided [...] "Oval gasholders" [...] that overlooks The Oval cricket ground in London. [...] Gasholders {{were built in the}} United Kingdom from early Victorian times; many, such as Kings Cross in London and St. Marks Street in Kingston upon Hull are so old that they are entirely riveted, as their {{construction}} predates the use of welding in construction. [...] The last to be built in the UK was in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Only 13.3 overs were {{possible}} on a rain-affected third day, as Surrey moved to 33 for 1, with a draw a virtual certainty. The day was enlivened {{by the sight}} of a fox on top of one of the famous gasholders. It presumably went onto the top when the <b>gasholder</b> was low, and was trapped as the level rose. On the fourth day, Surrey's stand-in captain Ramprakash made an impressive 152, as Surrey elected to prolong their first innings until they reached 402 for 5 declared, to claim maximum batting points. The game ended there as a draw.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 January a fire {{broke out}} in the melt-pot room, and efforts to put it out were under way when {{approximately}} [...] of TNT ignited at 6:52pm. The TNT plant was destroyed instantly, as were many nearby buildings, including the Silvertown Fire Station. Much of the TNT was in railway goods wagons awaiting transport. Debris was strewn for miles around, with red-hot chunks of rubble causing fires. A gasometer <b>gasholder</b> was damaged on Greenwich Peninsula, creating a fireball from [...] of gas; the holder was later repaired and remained until 1986. Several thousand pounds' worth of goods were also destroyed in nearby warehouses, estimated by the Port of London Authority to span [...] The chancel and church hall of the local church, St Barnabas', were destroyed, only to be replaced in 1926.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} an oil gas works on site near CD2. Whilst the Great Eastern was fitting {{electric}} lighting to most of its carriages, it still had 4,000 lit by gas. There were permanent pipelines to Tottenham, Temple Mills and Ilford whilst travelling <b>gasholders</b> supplied gas to other carriage stabling locations.|$|R
5000|$|Between Paston and Bacton, [...] "the road {{runs through}} acres of <b>gasholders,</b> pipes, control wheels and other gadgetry, all {{protected}} by formidable fences.

The site {{is also one}} terminal of the Interconnector pipeline link with continental Europe.|$|R
25|$|The <b>gasholders</b> {{overlook}} The Oval at the Vauxhall End of the ground. They {{are considered}} part of the background of The Oval despite being newer than The Oval, which was established in 1846. During England cricket team matches advertising banners hang from the gas holders. They are regularly referred to in Test Match Special broadcasts.|$|R
2500|$|The island had two chapels and Thomas Pennant {{who visited}} Ailsa Craig in 1772 {{recorded}} that {{the ruins of}} a small chapel were located near the landing place and that another chapel (which he did not visit) was located on the summit of the island and was probably used by seamen to pray for safe voyages and returns. Lawson sees this second chapel as being a myth. When the lighthouse was being constructed four stone coffins were found that may well have been associated with the first mentioned chapel, two at the tenant's house and two at the <b>gasholder</b> site. The monks of Crossraguel Abbey once held the island and [...] "places of prayer" [...] are therefore to be expected especially with a garrisoned castle nearby; it is to be noted that even the diminutive Lady Isle off Troon once had a chapel. The chapel was first mentioned, along with the castle, in 1580 by Sir James Balfour.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{plans were}} {{announced}} to dismantle {{all of the}} United Kingdom's gasholders due to being made largely redundant due to improvements in gas storage. This was intended to include the Oval Gas Holders. Regeneration of these contaminated brownfield sites can help deliver London with much needed homes. Berkeley Homes and Lambeth Council are working together cooperatively to prepare a Masterplan for an area surrounding the Oval Gas Holders. This {{is known as the}} Oval and Kennington Development Area (OAKDA). A preliminary consultation with the local community occurred in January and February 2015 to discover local aspirations. Draft Masterplan proposals will be released to a second consultation {{towards the end of the}} year where comments will be welcomed. In March 2012 Lambeth Council locally listed the three gas holders of 1874, 1876 and 1892 (No.4, No.5 and No.1). In 2015, Lawrence D'Silva, a 26 year old local resident, presented a case to Historic England to make the gasholders listed buildings. [...] Subsequently, Historic England assessed them all for national listing and in March 2016 decided to grant Grade II listed status to just one of the Oval Gasholders – No.1 dating from 1892. The national listing designation supersedes the local listing status of this gasometer so <b>Gasholder</b> No. 1 was subsequently removed from the Local list by Lambeth – Nos. 4 & 5 remain locally listed. There is a strong presumption in the planning decision-making process against the demolition of a nationally listed heritage asset.|$|E
2500|$|Fry {{first met}} {{pioneering}} social reformer Elizabeth Denby in 1934, whom {{he described as}} [...] "a small dynamic woman", {{at a party in}} Henry Moore's studio. Denby had a sponsor, Lady Mozelle Sassoon, for the flats - R. E. Sassoon House - they had designed as part of a working-class estate around the Pioneer Health Centre in Peckham, London. As pleasant social housing at minimum cost, Sassoon House became his first collaboration with Denby. He worked again with Denby to create Kensal House, in Ladbroke Grove, London, on a disused corner of land belonging to the Gas Light and Coke Company between the Grand Union Canal and the railway. The project, completed in 1937, was for property developer Charles Kearley. Fry opportunistically planned the blocks of flats to curve in front of the site of a disused <b>gasholder</b> which then included a nursery school, and his simple design won the competition for this project. The result was a spacious estate for working-class people with modern shared amenities. which set new standards for its time. Fry admitted in his Autobiographical Sketches that during their work together his enthusiasm for their work on the project was for some time undistinguishable from his enthusiasm for her, distracted by the [...] "sad inadequacies" [...] of his own marriage: but he broke up the relationship because he admitted [...] "... I failed publicly to acknowledge her and injured us both irreparably." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{conjoined}} pair of <b>Gasholders</b> No. 4 & 5 {{erected in}} 1874 and 1876 {{were designed by}} Sir Corbet Woodall and are locally listed.

The gasometers were decommissioned in 2014 and the site is due for redevelopment, there are concerns that only the nationally listed No.1 gasometer will be preserved.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gasholders</b> were {{constructed}} {{of a variety}} of materials, brick, stone, concrete, steel, or wrought iron. The holder or floating vessel is the storage reservoir for the gas, and it serves the purpose of equalizing the distribution of the gas under pressure, and ensures a continuity of supply, while gas remains in the holder. They are cylindrical like an inverted beaker and work {{up and down in the}} tank. In order to maintain a true vertical position, the vessel has rollers which work on guide-rails attached to the tank sides and to the columns surrounding the holder. <b>Gasholders</b> may be either single or telescopic in two or more lifts. When it is made in the telescopic form, its capacity could be increased to as much as four times the capacity of the single-lift holder for equal dimensions of tank. The telescopic versions were found to be useful as they conserved ground space and capital.|$|R
5000|$|In 1886 the company, {{which had}} dropped the [...] "Light" [...] from its name, began using the {{carbureted}} water gas process to manufacture gas. This increased its production efficiency and volume, and required {{the addition of}} more buildings — a boiler house, oil and coal storage and more <b>gasholders.</b> The following year the company merged with the American Illuminating Company to become the Saratoga Gas, Electric Light and Power Company. A dynamo on the site provided electricity for the city's street lights.|$|R
