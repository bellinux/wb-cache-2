50|$|In {{all of the}} {{algorithms}} {{the messages}} emanating from check nodes are the same; however, since the verification rules are different for different algorithms the messages produced by variable nodes will be different in each algorithm. The algorithm given above works {{for all of the}} VB-MPA's, and different algorithms use different rules in <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and 2. For instance, Genie algorithm uses D1CN rule in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1, and in fact the <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 2 which uses ZCN rule is useless in Genie algorithm. LM algorithm uses D1CN in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and XH algorithm uses ECN rule in this stage instead of D1CN. SBB algorithm also uses both D1CN and ECN rule in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1. All of these rules can be efficiently implemented in update_rule function in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1.|$|R

50|$|In the florescence of Puuc {{architecture}} (such as at {{the ancient}} Maya site of Uxmal) buildings were decorated with carefully <b>cut</b> <b>veneer</b> stones set into a concrete core. The lower portion of the façades are blank with a flat surface of rectangular blocks punctuated by doorways, while the upper façade is richly decorated with intricate stone mosaics, often alternating repeated geometric elements with more elaborate figurative sculpture.

50|$|The town's economy {{remained}} sluggish {{until the}} timber industry moved in. The Brown Cooperage Company bought {{thousands of acres of}} timber, mostly white oak, for $1 per acre. In 1884, the Bell Messler Company placed a factory at Zalma to <b>cut</b> <b>veneer</b> and box laths. The Zalma factory was located just upstream from the mill dam. This factory provided work for women who stacked the box laths in long rows in the sun for drying. A second box factory was located {{on the north side of}} Green Street near the Railroad Street intersection, a short distance west of the present Highway 51.|$|R
50|$|The main {{operation}} of the mill under ownership of the Rankine brothers was the peeling of veneers. The Rankine's transported the <b>cut</b> <b>veneers</b> to their drying sheds at Peeramon by truck. The mill continued to produce timber stock for sale. The Rankine brothers took over Foxwood Industries in 1986, acquiring mills at Ingham, Innisfail and Mareeba. In 1989, this company {{was said to be}} the largest timber business in Queensland. The mill closed when World Heritage listing of the Wet Tropics Rainforest of North Queensland in 1988 prevented further milling of rainforest timber. The sawmill burned down in the late 1980s.|$|R

50|$|Due to The J. Peterman Company's {{acquisition}} {{of this particular}} necklace through the sale of props from the film, this design {{is often referred to}} as the J.

This particular design is another blue cubic zirconia; however, it is cut into the shape of a heart rather than a trillion cut. The main stone is surrounded by <b>round</b> <b>cut</b> cubic zirconias and features a white <b>round</b> <b>cut</b> stone at the top where it attaches to the chain. The chain is composed of white <b>round</b> <b>cut</b> cubic zirconias, with a larger inverted pear cut cubic zirconia as the bail. This particular design is featured in the film for a brief moment when Caledon retrieves the necklace from his safe during the sinking, this is the only time the necklace is seen on screen. This particular necklace is believed to still be in the possession of the J. Peterman Company.|$|R
