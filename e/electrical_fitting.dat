5000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the maintenance period Asheville began a work-up for another six-month deployment to the Western Pacific. This work-up included various underway periods, for weekly operations. At the end of May 1999, Asheville conducted two family day cruises. The first left Pearl Harbor and steamed to Lahaina, Maui. Asheville anchored a mile off the Maui coast for five days. She returned to Pearl Harbor, {{at the end of}} the week, with the second group of family members aboard. In July 1999, Asheville deployed to the Eastern Pacific (EASTPAC) for two months, continuing work-ups with the John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group. During this deployment, she visited San Diego, CA, Esquimalt/Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and Ketchikan, Alaska. While conducting sound testing off the coast of Ketchikan, Asheville was suspended at a depth of 400 feet, and held in position by four mooring buoys above. During this 36-hour period, the crew made phone calls with a line rigged though an <b>electrical</b> <b>fitting.</b> After the testing, the boat surfaced. The crew ate hamburgers, and [...] "got some sun". Some of the crew members swam in the 50 degree waters of Behm Canal. She returned to Pearl Harbor, at the end of August, 1999. She conducted a six-week upkeep period, after which a Change of Command Ceremony was held on 15 October 1999, as CDR Grooms was relieved by CDR Ingalls. At the end of October 1999, Asheville returned to San Diego for three weeks where she completed final work-ups with the Stennis Battle Group, including staged attacks on the ship. Asheville was the only ship in the Battle Group that was not successfully boarded or attacked. Another part of this final work up included SPEC WAR, off the coast of California, when Asheville launched a BGM-109 Tomahawk Cruise Missile. After the launch, an F-14 Tomcat pilot took control of the missile. The missile flew to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, hitting the target perfectly. Asheville returned to Pearl Harbor at the end of November, 1999. She completed a six-week upkeep period, and made final preparations for her forthcoming deployment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{requirements}} of “The Twelfth Five Years ” development planning of State Grid {{and the development of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>fitting,</b> State Grid will enlarge the change of rural power network and power distribution market, which will make the coverage of rural power network and power distribution to be larger so that reducing the loss of the power transmission line will become an important task research. To reduce or replace the high energy consumption steel fittings and the high price aluminum fittings, this article make feasibility analyses for a new material used in electrical fittings to protect the environment and economy energy source, by analyzing the performance and test property of the new material. Preface The loss of the power transmission line is high. The number of the loss is 6. 55 % in china, is 5. 15 % in Japan. The number of china is higher than that of developed countries. The main reason of high power transmission loss is a lot of steel electric fittings used. Production cost of aluminum or aluminum alloy electric fittings is high, and electrolytic aluminum consumption is high. Backward production processing in china so that the number of aluminum or aluminum alloy electric fittings cannot {{meet the needs of the}} development of smart grid.

The team from Norbuilt who constructed the library were ecstatic about their success and paid tribute to the role that Marcus Collins Architects played in the project. The category for the Best Commercial Building between 1 and 3. 5 million dollars was a highlight along with the prestigious Best Commercial Building Award, which the library also won. Other categories that the library received awards for were; Paving, Steelwork, <b>Electrical</b> <b>Fitting</b> and Painting. Also, {{as part of the}} recent Broome North West Expo and Australian Innovation Festival, the Library held an information session for the local business community which aimed at enhancing awareness of what the University Library could offer in the way of business information and resources. The session included a tour of the new facility, displays of available resources both print and electronic, and a discussion forum on what the business community would like to have available. An explanation of how to access services was also given by Library Technician Jill Skinner. Executive Director of Notre Dame’s Broome Campus Gavin Greaves said, “As well as our own staff and students, we really want the wider community to benefit from the University’s resources and facilities. This is a fantastic initiative from the library staff, Lyn Quince and Jill Skinner; and they should be congratulated on their proactive approach. ...|$|E

[...] Bare's inspection of the aircraft was very detailed and involved considerable maintenance, repair and modification. There were two stages. The first was an assembly-line type of operation in the largest hangar where everything was checked.

One C-46 arrived with a block of wood in a carburetor air filter.|$|R
50|$|Nearly all mains {{appliances}} and accessories {{can only be}} opened {{with the use of}} a screwdriver (or a substitute item such as a nail file or kitchen knife). This prevents children and others who are careless or unaware of the dangers of opening the equipment from doing so and hurting themselves (from electrical shocks, burns or cuts, for example) or damaging the equipment. Sometimes (especially in order to avoid litigation), manufacturers go further and use tamper-resistant screws, which cannot be unfastened with standard equipment.

In Europe, since 1951 the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (CEE) has published a standard (CEE 7 Specification for Plugs and Socket-Outlets for Domestic and Similar Purposes) describing the plugs and sockets used. In 1953 the CEE published Technical Report 83 (later 60083), which was a listing of plugs and sockets then in use. In North America the National Electrical Manufacturers' Association (NEMA) publishes standards for plugs and sockets.|$|R
