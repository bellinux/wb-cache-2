40|$|We analyze a principal’s {{ability to}} {{discriminate}} between honest and dishonest agents, who have private information about {{the circumstances of the}} exchange. Honest agents reveal circumstances truthfully as long as the mechanism is sufficiently fair: the probability that an equilibrium allocation is chosen by an agent who is lying should not be too large. Without intolerance for lying the agent is given proper incentives if dishonest and zero rent if honest. With even a small intolerance for lying the optimal mechanism is discontinuously altered. It may still involve <b>ethics</b> <b>screening</b> whereby some allocation chosen by a dishonest agent is never chosen by an honest agent. It happens either when the dishonest is overstating circumstances, or when the principal is forced to allow for some suboptimal announcements due to an excessive intolerance for lying. With limited intolerance for lying, <b>ethics</b> <b>screening</b> allows for doing better than in the standard setup where the agent is dishonest with certainty, even if honesty is unlikely.

40|$|Closed access. The main aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{framework}} for ethical decision making on construction projects. The framework consists of three levels of decision making – individual, project and corporation – to reflect the nature of the industry whose main product is ‘projects’. In addition, this paper highlights principal ethical theories such as virtue ethics, deontology, consequentialism (utilitarianism), and relativism and explore their potential applications to ethical decision making in construction. The Agent (virtue ethics) -Action(deontology) - Results(consequentialism) concept has been combined with Kohlberg’s moral development model which has been modified in terms of stakeholder approach. Based on these applications, ‘ethics screen’ has been produced in which ethical decisions can be filtered and scored to select the best decision. An example of <b>ethics</b> <b>screen</b> has been presented and discussed to demonstrate the practicality and benefits of <b>ethics</b> <b>screen</b> as a decision support tool for construction managers...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate over}} {{cardiovascular}} screening to prevent {{sudden cardiac death}} in the young (SCDY) has fervent and well-intentioned supporters on both sides. However, this debate will continue unresolved until additional,compelling evidence is provided that either supports orrefutes the utility of screening for SCDY. In an effort to provide direction to determine what type of evidence is necessary and the best methodology to obtain such evidence, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened a Working Group meeting in April 2010 in Bethesda, MD. The charge of the Working Group {{was to develop a}} research agenda and identify resources to evaluate whether screening for SCDY would effectively reduce sudden cardiac death and add overall healthcare value, where value was defined as improved clinical outcomes with an acceptable cost-benefit ratio.

40|$|Commonly {{expressed}} in theoretical discussions about ethical {{problems in the}} context of epidemiology and screening is the need for more data. A study was carried out involving 21 explorative interviews with participant and nonparticipant mothers in a neonatal research screening project in progress in Sweden, ABIS (All Babies in Southeast Sweden). The respondents were asked, by way of open-ended questions, to give their opinions about certain ethical issues: informed consent; reasons for joining/declining; surrogate decision; the collection, analysis and storage of written and "live" material (biobanks); intervention etc. The ethical implications mentioned in the literature mostly concern the risk of creating distress and anxiety (anxiety and possible stigmatisation in respect of positive or false-positive results, worry about material collected and stored, distress caused by blood sampling procedures, etc.). Our results do not support the idea that the risks are substantial. The respondents rather indicate an attitude of benevolence [...] they are positive both to the current research on children, to the material they contribute (both written material and "biomaterial"), to possible results and intervention plans. On the other hand the participants expressed concern about the storage of material and the right to be informed of any screening/project results. Further studies in this field are needed and would be of help in theoretical discussion, the work of ethical committees and the designing of, for example, screening and research projects. <b>Ethics</b> <b>Screening</b> Neonatal Informed consent Diabetes ABIS Sweden...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} Report titled "A {{comprehensive strategy}} {{on how to}} minimize research misconduct and the potential misuse of research in EU funded research” is based on discussions among 51 Ethics Experts with previous experience in EU <b>Ethics</b> <b>Screening,</b> Review and Audit and was chaired by Johannes Rath. The discussions took place from December 2009 to March 2010 via the SINAPSE system and concluded that: Research misconduct and potential misuse constitute an ethical issue {{in the context of}} EU funded research and should be systematically addressed in EU Ethic’s oversight (Screening, Review and Audit). In defining the scope of this ethical issue the following definitions were used as guidelines: A. “Potential misuse of research” {{in the context of this}} document is defined as: Research involving or generating materials, methods or knowledge that could be misused for unethical purposes. The main areas of concern regarding potential misuse are: • Research involving agents or equipment that could be directly misused for criminal, terrorist or unethical military purposes; • Research which creates knowledge that could be used for criminal, terrorist and unethical military purposes; • Research which can result in stigmatization and discrimination; • Application and development of surveillance technologies; • Data mining and profiling technologies. B. “Research misconduct” in the context of this document is defined as: fabrication, falsification and plagiarism. Falsification is defined as the misrepresentation of results. Fabrication is defined as the reporting on experiments never performed. Plagiarism is defined as taking the writings or ideas of another and representing them as one's own. Aim of this report: The aim of this document is to provide a comprehensive strategy on how to safeguard EU funded research against misconduct and misuse.

40|$|Each year {{millions}} of nonhuman animals suffer in biomedical research {{for human health}} benefits. Clinical ethics demand that nonhuman animals {{are used in the}} development of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Nonhuman animals are also used for fundamental biomedical research. Biomedical research that uses nonhuman animals is big business. This paper explores how such research generates profits and gains for those associated with the industry. Research establishments, scientists and other professionals who work in laboratories, companies that supply nonhuman animal subjects and equipment for the research, and corporations that sell the resulting products are among those that benefit financially. Clinical ethical partiality to human health benefits enables these beneficiaries to claim that such research is unquestionably ethical because it conforms to required clinical ethical codes. The paper argues that even this anthropocentric form of ethics is compromised by the pervasiveness of profit-making industry. Because nonhuman animal-based biomedical research is considered to have a more ethical purpose than other forms of experiments that use nonhuman animal subjects the focus on biomedical <b>ethics,</b> that <b>screens</b> out the profits made, enables the paper to conclude with a challenge to the assumption about the ethical legitimacy of the use of nonhuman animal experiments across the board...|$|R
40|$|What is {{biomedical}} ethics? Biomedical {{ethics is}} {{a branch of}} applied ethics dedicated to the evaluation of ethical issues in health care.

40|$|A central {{question}} in economics {{is how to}} ensure that employees do not shirk their work-place responsibilities. Most {{of the research on}} this question focuses on economic governance schemes that provide incentives to induce employees to act in the interests of their employ-ers (Canice Prendergast 1999). Some studies examine arrangements to induce self-selection by potential employees having heterogeneous unobserved human capital. An alternative to self-selection, much less studied by econo-mists (for an exception, see Casey Ichniowski, Kathryn Shaw, and Giovanna Prennushi 1997), is applicant screening, where the employer attempts to identify which applicants have the desirable attributes. An advantage of the screen-ing approach versus self-selection {{is that it does not}} require the applicant to even be aware of possessing relevant attributes. Virtually all employers use some level of applicant screening. It is a fundamental part of the human resources function in most firms. Although different kinds of jobs may require different attributes, arguably the most funda-mental attribute and the one that cuts across vir-tually all jobs can be described as work ethic, what we might think of as the ability to work hard independent of monitoring by employers or of rewards. The field of personnel psychology has spent a great deal of time examining attri-butes of individuals associated with work ethic, and one of the most important is the personality construct known as “conscientiousness, ” which has been found to be a reliable and consistent dimension of personality that relates strongly to job performance across types of jobs (Frank Schmidt and John Hunter 1998).

40|$|In {{answer to}} {{questions}} raised by practitioners, an <b>ethics</b> of genetic <b>screening</b> {{is located in a}} tension between liberty and responsibility in three respects: (1) to nature and biological processes; (2) to the disposal of human life; and (3) to the relation of persons to society. Under (1), the obligation to pursue research, fundamental as well as applied, is affirmed, offering the benefit of economy with fetal life, but requiring discrimination between the beneficial, the trivial, and the bizarre. Under (2) the abortion question, when relevant to diagnosed abnormality, is discussed, not in the language of conflicting rights, but of the relation of duties to interests. Under (3) the familial and social dimensions of screening raise questions of the disclosure of information and the keeping or extending of confidences. Last comes the value placed on truth in two related areas of developing practice. In infertility treatment, the donors of gametes are required to remain anonymous. Gene tracing through families requires for its effectiveness some correspondence between assumed identity and genetic identity. This conflict of social policies should be resolved...|$|R
40|$|As {{highlighted}} in BioNews, in early April 2011 the UK's Human Genetics Commission (HGC) published a report supporting preconception genetic testing and screening (1). Preconception screening, {{which can be}} broadly described as identifying carriers of genetic mutations to inform reproductive decision-making for the person tested or his/her relatives, is well established in some jurisdictions but relatively unknown in the UK. The proposals outlined in the report could be argued to be merely an extension of established principles of genetic testing in pregnancy {{to those who are}} not yet pregnant. The rationale for this extension is that it will increase people's options and choices, enhancing reproductive autonomy. But large-scale screening of young people previously unaware of such testing will give rise to new issues. This means Dr Callum MacKellar was right to question the <b>ethics</b> of <b>screening</b> in his recent BioNews Commentary. But I think that Dr MacKellar hasn't quite hit the mark with his criticism. His concerns can be divided into two broad areas: (i) whether preconception testing is eugenic; and (ii) that preconception testing necessarily entails selecting against children. Taking his first concern, Dr MacKellar does not explicitly state whether he believes the report's recommendations will lead to eugenic practices, although he does seem to imply they may contravene some EU legal instruments if put into practice. But if such an interpretation is sound, it would also mean most current prenatal diagnosis also amounts to such a contravention. It may be more helpful to examine what might be wrong with 'negative eugenics' (that is, discouraging couples from having a particular child).

The RCs main responsibility is to ensure that all research is conducted according to the appropriate protocols, regulations and guidelines. Aim Description of demographics, the role and associated responsibilities and assessment of items of importance to, and satisfaction with, various job related items. Method An observational web-based cross-sectional study of RCs working in Intensive Care Units (ICU) across Australia and New Zealand. Results Fifty-six participants completed the survey. Forty percent had more than 6 years experience in ICU research and one-third held a Masters Degree. Most respondents performed research related tasks including <b>ethics</b> submission, patient <b>screening,</b> education and data collection. Autonomy and work hours were the most satisfying job characteristics reported and aspects relating to autonomy were most important for the RCs. Inadequate remuneration was of great concern to the participants. Conclusion Research Coordinators in Australia and New Zealand have many and varied roles with a significant workload. Unfortunately, the RCs do not feel their employers are adequately remunerating the demand on their time and efforts. The results indicate that RCs enjoy high levels of satisfaction with general conditions and facets of their work and its environment and they remain passionate about their role in the ICU setting.

40|$|In {{recent years}} medical ethics {{has become an}} undisputed part of medical studies. Many people believe that modern {{advances}} in medical technology- such as the development of dialysis machines, respirators, magnetic resonance imaging and genetic testing and types of cancer screenings- have created bioethical dilemmas that confront physicians in the 21 st century. Debates over research and <b>screening</b> <b>ethics</b> have until recently revolved around two related questions: the voluntary, informed consent of subjects, and the appropriate relationship between risk and benefit to subjects. Every patient {{has a right to}} full and accurate information about his or her medical condition. This legal principle arose primarily through court decisions concerning informed consent, but over time physicians recognized that most patients prefer to learn the truth about their condition and use the information well. To screen is to search for disease in the absence of symptoms or, in other words, to attempt to find disease in someone not thought to have a disease. Examples of screening include routine mammography to detect breast cancer, routine pap smears to detect cervical cancer, and routine Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing to detect prostate cancer. Ethical principles to be followed in cancer screening programmes are intended mainly to minimize unnecessary harm for the participating individuals. Numerous ethical questions can be raised about the practice of screening for disease. Here, we examine four leading cancer killers worldwide and we review the screening of protocols of these cancer types and their possible ethics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is a {{cause of}} stroke and a marker of atherosclerosis and of all patients with stroke, around 17 % have AF. The screening and treatment of AF could prevent about 12 % of all strokes. Several relatively low-cost devices with good accuracy now exist which can detect AF including WatchBP and AliveCor. However, they can only measure the ECG or pulse over short time periods. Inexpensive devices such as heart rate monitors, which are widely available, can measure heart rate for prolonged periods and may have potential in screening for AF. This study aims to determine the accuracy of AliveCor and WatchBP along with a bespoke algorithm using a heart rate monitor belt (Polar H 7) and a wearable RR interval recorder (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2) for detecting AF during a single screening visit in primary care patients. Methods/analysis: A multicentre case–control diagnostic study comparing the four different devices {{for the detection of}} AF with a reference standard consisting of a 12 -lead ECG in GP surgeries across Hampshire, UK. We aim to recruit 92 participants with AF and 329 without AF aged 65  years and over. We will ask participants to rate comfort and overall impression for each device. We will collect qualitative data from participants capturing their experience of using wearable devices in order to evaluate acceptability. We will collect data from GPs to determine their views on AF <b>screening.</b> <b>Ethics</b> and dissemination: This protocol was approved by the London—City & East Research Ethics Committee in June 2016.

40|$|Introduction Prenatal alcohol {{exposure}} {{can cause}} lifelong disability, including physical, cognitive and behavioural deficits, known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Among individuals with FASD, engagement with justice services is common. Little {{is known about}} the prevalence of FASD among young people engaged with the Australian justice system. This study aims to establish FASD prevalence among sentenced young people in detention in Western Australia (WA), and use the findings to develop a screening tool for use among young people entering detention. Translation of these results will guide the management and support of young people in detention and will have significant implications on the lives of young people with FASD and the future of Australian youth justice services. Methods and analysis Any sentenced young person in WA aged 10 – 17  years 11  months is eligible to participate. Young people are assessed for FASD by a multidisciplinary team. Standardised assessment tools refined for the Australian context are used, acknowledging the language and social complexities involved. Australian diagnostic guidelines for FASD will be applied. Information is obtained from young people, responsible adults, teachers and custodial officers. Individualised results and management plans for each young person are communicated to the young person and responsible adult. Prevalence of FASD will be reported and multivariate methods used to identify variables most predictive of FASD and to optimise the predictive value of <b>screening.</b> <b>Ethics</b> and dissemination Approvals have been granted by the WA Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee, University of WA Human Research Ethics Committee, Department of Corrective Services, and Department for Child Protection and Family Support.

40|$|Abstract. The {{majority}} of institutional ethics committees at South African tertiary institutions state in their {{standard operating procedures}} {{that the role of}} the <b>ethics</b> committee includes <b>screening</b> proposed research with regard to the core principles of ethics (dignity and autonomy, justice, non-maleficence and beneficence), as well as the scientific validity of the envisaged study. The first part of this paper debates to what extent such an approach is justified, as the notion of validity is primarily located in the philosophy of science and not in the field of moral philosophy. The second part of the paper illustrates some of the main points of the discussion with selected examples from the field of visual communication design research. The examples are drawn from (1) practice-based design research, where the products of the design practice are presented as inquiry outcomes, often contextualized in an accompanying written report; (2) practice-led design research, i. e. studies that investigate the nature of practice in an effort to develop insights that will contribute to new knowledge about the design practice, where the processes and products of the design practice may be used as data, but are not considered to be inquiry outputs in themselves; and (3) image-based design research, or research approaches where visual images such as photographs, drawings or video recordings form {{an integral part of the}} data collection and analysis methods. As the selected examples show, the notions of validity and ethics are interwoven and inextricably linked, but not inseparable. While recognizing that crude errors of reasoning (i. e. low validity) may in some cases ultimately lead to harm (i. e. unethical conduct), it is argued that the 'dual mandate' approach of screening for issues of ethics and validity concomitantly is not suitable for visual communication design research. Ethics clearance is a relatively recent requirement at Universities of Technology and is becoming increasingly rigorous. In the light thereof, the paper contributes to the current debates about the ethics dimension of design practice and design research, especially in a South African setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{prenatal}} screening and diagnosis has developed rapidly {{over the past}} half-century, enabling possibilities for detecting anomalies in reproduction that were never before contemplated. A simple blood sample can aid {{in the identification of}} several conditions in the fetus early in the pregnancy. If a fetus is found to be affected by Down syndrome, anencephalus, spina bifida, or Edward's syndrome, a decision must then be made whether to continue or terminate the pregnancy. As prenatal screening becomes increasingly commonplace and part of routine maternal care, researchers are faced with the challenge of understanding its effects {{at the level of the}} population and monitoring trends over time. Greater uptake of prenatal screening, when followed by prenatal diagnosis and termination, has important implications for both congenital anomaly surveillance and infant and fetal mortality indicators. Research in Canada suggests that this practice has led to reductions in the congenital-anomaly specific infant mortality rate and increases in the stillbirth rate. (1, 2) The current study is a population-based, epidemiological exploration of demographic predictors of maternal serum screening (MSS) and amniocentesis uptake, with special attention to variations in birth outcomes resulting from different patterns of use. To accomplish our objectives, multiple data sources (vital statistics, hospital and physician services, cytogenetic and MSS laboratory information) were compiled to create a comprehensive maternal-fetal-infant dataset. Data spanned a six-year period (2000 - 2005) and involved 93, 171 pregnancies. A binary logistic regression analysis found that First Nations status, rural-urban health region of residence, maternal age group, and year of test all significantly predicted MSS use. Uptake was lower in women living in a rural health region, First Nations women, and those under 30 years of age. The study dataset identified ninety-four terminations of pregnancy following detection of a fetal anomaly (TOPFA), which led to a lower live birth prevalence of infants with Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, and anencephalus. While a significant increasing trend was observed for the overall infant mortality rate in Saskatchewan between 2001 - 2005, a clear trend in one direction or the other could not be seen in regards to infant deaths due to congenital anomaly. First Nations status and maternal age were important predictors of both MSS and amniocentesis testing, and appeared to influence the decision to continue or terminate an affected pregnancy. The fact that First Nations women were less likely to screen (9. 6 % vs. 28. 4 %) and to have diagnostic follow-up testing (18. 5 % vs. 33. 5 %), meant that they were less likely to obtain a prenatal diagnosis when the fetus had a chromosomal anomaly compared to other women (8. 3 % vs. 27. 0 %). This resulted in a lower TOPFA rate compare to the rest of the population (0. 64 vs. 1. 34, per 1, 000 pregnancies, respectively) and a smaller difference between the live birth prevalence and incidence of Down syndrome and Trisomy 18 for First Nations women. Women under 30 years of age were much less likely to receive a prenatal diagnosis when a chromosomal anomaly was present (18. 4 % vs. 31. 8 %). While risk for a chromosomal anomaly is considerably lower for younger mothers, 53. 5 % of all pregnancies with chromosomal anomalies and 40. 7 % of DS pregnancies belonged to this group. Consistent with other studies pregnancy termination rates following a prenatal congenital anomaly diagnosis are high (eg. 74. 1 % of prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome or Trisomy 18 cases), but these rates may be misleading in that they are based on women who chose to proceed to prenatal diagnosis. The fact that two-thirds (67. 3 %) of Saskatchewan women who received an increased-risk result declined amniocentesis, helps to put this finding into context. Strong surveillance systems and reasonable access to research datasets will be an on-going challenge for the province of Saskatchewan and should be viewed as a priority. Pregnancies and congenital anomalies are two particularly challenging outcomes to study in the absence of perinatal and congenital anomaly surveillance systems. Still pregnancies that never reach term must be accounted for, in order to describe the true state of maternal-fetal-infant health and to study its determinants. While our study was able to identify some interesting trends and patterns, it is only a snapshot in time. Key to the production of useful surveillance and evaluation is timely information. The current system is not timely, nor is it user-friendly for researchers, health regions or governments. Data compilation for the current study was a gruelling and cumbersome process taking more than five years to complete. A provincial overhaul is warranted in both the mechanism by which researchers access data and in the handling of data. The Better Outcomes Registry & Network (BORN) in Ontario is an innovative perinatal and congenital anomaly surveillance system worthy of modelling. (3) Academic papers in non-ethics' journals typically focus on the technical or programmatic aspects of screening and do not effectively alert the reader to the complex and profound moral dilemmas raised by the practice. A discussion of ethics was felt necessary to ensure a well-rounded portrayal of the issue, putting findings into context and helping to ensure their moral relevance did not remain hidden behind the scientific complexities. Here I lay out the themes of the major arguments in a descriptive manner, recognizing that volumes have been written on the <b>ethics</b> of both <b>screening</b> and abortion. A major ethical tension arising within the context of population based prenatal screening is the tension between community morality and the principle of respect for personal autonomy. Prenatal screening and selective termination have been framed as a purely private or medical matter, thereby deemphasizing the social context in which the practice has materialized and the importance of community values. I consider how a broader sociological perspective, one that takes into account the relevance of community values and limitations of the clinical encounter, could inform key practice and policy issues involving prenatal screening. It is my position that the community's voice must be invited to the conversation and public engagement processes should occur prior to any additional expansion in programming. I end with a look at how the community’s voice might be better heard on key issues, even those issues that at first glance seem to be the problems of individuals. As Rayna Rapp (2000) (4) poignantly observed, women today are 'moral pioneers' not by choice, but by necessity. By elucidating the effects of prenatal screening and the extent of the practice of selective termination in the province, the true occurrence of important categories of congenital anomalies in our province can be observed. Without this knowledge it is very difficult to identify real increases or decreases in fetal and infant mortality over time as the etiologies are complex. Evidence suggests a large and increasing impact of TOPFA on population-based birth and mortality statistics nationally, whereas in Saskatchewan the effect appears to be less pronounced. Appreciation of the intervening effect of new reproductive technologies will be increasingly important to accurate surveillance, research, and evaluation as this field continues to expand...|$|R
