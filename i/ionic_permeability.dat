IPSPs always want to keep the membrane potential more negative than the action potential threshold and can be seen as a [...] "transient hyperpolarization". [...] EPSPs and IPSPs compete with each other at numerous synapses of a neuron; this determines whether or not the action potential at the presynaptic terminal will regenerate at the postsynaptic membrane.

5000|$|Saclofen is a {{competitive}} antagonist for the GABAB receptor. This drug is an analogue of the GABAB agonist baclofen. The GABAB receptor is heptahelical receptor, expressed as an obligate heterodimer, which couples to the Gi/o class of heterotrimeric G-proteins. The action of saclofen {{on the central}} nervous system is understandably modest, because G-proteins rely on an enzyme cascade to alter cell behavior while ionotropic receptors immediately change the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> of the neuronal plasma membrane, thus changing its firing patterns. These particular receptors, presynaptically inhibit N- and P/Q- voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) via a direct interaction of the dissociated beta gamma subunit of the g-protein with the intracellular loop between the 1st and 2nd domain of the VGCC's alpha-subunit; postsynaptically, these potentiate Kir currents. Both result in inhibitory effects.|$|E
50|$|Hair cells utilize {{a system}} of {{transduction}} that uses rate coding in order to transmit the directionality of a stimulus. Hair cells of the lateral line system produce a constant, tonic rate of firing. As mechanical motion is transmitted through water to the neuromast, the cupula bends and is displaced. Varying in magnitude with {{the strength of the}} stimulus, shearing movement and deflection of the hairs is produced, either toward the longest hair or away from it. This results in a shift in the cell’s <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability,</b> resulting from changes to open ion channels caused by the deflection of the hairs. Deflection towards the longest hair results in depolarization of the hair cell, increased neurotransmitter release at the excitatory afferent synapse, and a higher rate of signal transduction. Deflection towards the shorter hair has the opposite effect, hyperpolarizing the hair cell and producing a decreased rate of neurotransmitter release. These electrical impulses are then transmitted along afferent lateral neurons to the brain.|$|E

The basic circuit elements are (1) the phospholipid bilayer, which is analogous to a capacitor in that it accumulates ionic charge as the electrical potential across the membrane changes; (2) the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the membrane, which are analogous to resistors in an electronic circuit; and (3) the electrochemical driving forces, which are analogous to batteries driving the ionic currents.

40|$|Objective: Transmembrane {{resistance}} {{is a measure}} of <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability.</b> The occurrence of <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> on the leptomeningeal tissue may suggest its contribution to the cerebrospinal fluid turnover. This property will support the background for a new in vitro model for the study of subarachnoid physiology. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the occurrence and mean value of transmembrane resistance of leptomeninges in sheep at the basal state. Methods: Cranial leptomeningeal tissues from 26 adult sheep were isolated. Electrophysiological measurements were performed with the Ussing system. Histological samples of leptomeningeal tissue were prepared under light microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results: The mean transmembrane resistance of the leptomeninges in sheep was found to be 11. 38 +/- 1. 28 Omega cm(2). The histological preparations revealed the homology with the leptomeninges of humans under light microscopy. Discussion: Leptomeningeal tissue demonstrates <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> as it was indicated by the measured transmembrane resistance.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> of the {{leptomeninges}} related to the effect of ouabain (sodium-potassium-ATPase inhibitor) and amiloride (epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitor) on the tissue, as well as identify the presence of ion channels. Methods: Cranial leptomeningeal samples from 26 adult sheep were isolated. Electrophysiological measurements were performed with Ussing system and transmembrane resistance values (RTM in Ω*cm 2) obtained over time. Experiments were conducted with the application of ouabain 10 - 3 M or amiloride 10 - 5 M at the arachnoidal and pial sides. Immunohistochemical studies of leptomeningeal tissue were prepared with alpha- 1 sodium-potassium-ATPase (ATP 1 A 1), beta-ENaC, and delta-ENaC subunit antibodies. Results: The application of ouabain at the arachnoidal side raised the transmembrane resistance statistically significantly and thus decreased its <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability.</b> The addition of ouabain at the pial side led also to a significant but less profound increment in transmembrane resistance. The addition of amiloride at the arachnoidal or pial side did not produce any statistical significant change in the RTM from controls (p> 0. 05). Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of the ATP 1 A 1 and beta- and delta-ENaC subunits at the leptomeninges. Conclusions: In summary, leptomeningeal tissue possesses sodium-potassium-ATPase and ENaC ion channels. The application of ouabain alters the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> of the leptomeninges thus reflecting the role of sodium-potassium-ATPase. Amiloride application did not alter the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> of leptomeninges possibly due to localization of ENaC channels towards the subarachnoid space, away from the experimental application sites. The above properties of the tissue could potentially be related to cerebrospinal fluid turnover at this interface. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. We have {{previously}} demonstrated pressure-dependent membrane depolarization and action potential generation in cat cerebral arteries. It was {{the purpose of}} this study to examine and compare the membrane electrical responses to increasing transmural pressure in sponta-neously hypertensive rats with those of their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto controls. It was found that at transmural pressures from 40 - 160 mm Hg, spontaneously hypertensive rat cerebral arterial muscle depolarized more than nonnotensive counterparts. Pressure-induced action potentials could be recorded from arterial segments from both animal strains; however, the amplitude and upstroke velocity was significantly greater in spontaneously hypertensive rat cerebral arterial muscle. These data suggest that there are altered <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> in spontaneously hyperten-sive rat cerebral arterial muscle which result in enhanced response to increasing transmural pressure. The implications of these findings are discussed. (Circ Res 57 : 319 - 322, 1985) WE have recently demonstrated that elevation of transmural pressure in cat cerebral arteries results in muscle cell depolarization and acdon potential gen-eration (Harder, 1984).

40|$|ABSTRACT Relations {{are derived}} that {{describe}} the combined effects of electrodiffusion, the Na/K pump, and Na/Ca transport by carrier on the resting membrane potential. Equations are derived {{that apply to}} both steady-state and non-steady-state conditions. Some example calculations from the equations are plotted at different permeability coefficient ratios, PK:Pca:Pr~a. The equations predict a depolarizing action of Na/Ca transport when more than two Na ions per Ca ion are transported by the carrier. For all permeability ratios examined, a steady state for Ca ions is achieved with at most a few millivolts of depolarization. The well-known relation for the membrane potential in terms of <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> is not precise if ionic pumps and transport mechanisms contribute significantly to the potential (Goldman, 1943; Hodgkin and Katz, 1949). The original equation has since been modified to include the contribution of an electrogenic Na/K pump to the membrane potential (Mullins and Noda, 1963; Sjodin and Ortiz, 1975).

Polarised 16 HBE 14 o- or differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) were exposed to increasing multiplicities of infection (MOI) of B. thailandensis or F. tularensis Live Vaccine Strain and barrier responses monitored over 24 – 72 h.

40|$|In a microvillar photoreceptor, {{absorption}} of an incident photon initiates a phototransduction reaction that generates a depolarizing light-induced current (LIC) in the microvillus. Although in-depth knowledge about these processes in photoreceptors of the fruitfly Drosophila is available, not much {{is known about}} their nature in other insect species. Here, we present description of some basic properties of both elementary and macroscopic LICs and their Ca(2 +) -dependence in the photoreceptors of a dark-active species, the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Cockroach photoreceptors respond to single photon absorptions by generating quantum bumps with about 5 -fold larger amplitudes than in Drosophila. At the macroscopic current level, cockroach photoreceptors responded to light with variable sensitivity and current waveform. This variability could be partially attributed to differences in whole-cell capacitance. Transient LICs, both elementary and macroscopic, showed only moderate dependence on extracellular Ca(2 +). However, with long light pulses, response inactivation was largely abolished and the overall size of LICs increased when extracellular Ca(2 +) was omitted. Finally, by determining relative <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> from reversals of LICs, we demonstrate that when compared to Drosophila, cockroach light-gated channels are only moderately Ca(2 +) -selective...|$|R

In terms of ionic transference numbers, deduced from measurements of the membrane potential at zero current, Tcat/TCl increased from about 6 to 21 and TK/TNa increased from about 3 to 21.

Acute elevations in intracellular adenosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations {{are known to}} increase ionic chloride permeability in diverse tissues. To determine if chronic endogenous increases in cAMP are associated with sustained alterations in membrane ionic permeabilities, renal cortical brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were prepared and red blood cells were harvested in a model of chronic renal failure, the 75 % nephrectomized rat. Relative ionic permeabilities were determined using the potential-sensitive fluorescent probe 3, 3 ′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [diS-C 3 -(5) ]. These studies demonstrate that renal cortical homogenate and RBC cAMP concentrations are increased in chronic renal failure animals. In the same animals relative ionic chloride permeability (PCl/PK) was significantly increased in renal cortical BBMV and RBC ghosts: PNa/PK was not affected. This selective change in permeability results in {{a significant increase in}} PCl/PNa and hyperpolarization of BBMV of sufficient magnitude to stimulate Na+-dependent glutamine transport. The change in glutamine uptake was not consequent to an alteration in the kinetics of glutamine transport or delayed dissipation of the inward Na+ gradient.

For this purpose a recently described model of the neural membrane [Wooldridge, D. E. (1975) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 3468 - 3471] is extended. Allowances are made for the flow of Ca++, Cl-, and Na+ ions through some of the membrane pore configurations, as well as for some electron conductance, all of amounts too small to be significant in the normal neuron. It is also postulated that the nature of the perfusing fluid affects the rates of some of the reactions that change the convertible gates from one configuration to another, as well as the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the resulting configurations.

50|$|In sensory neurons, an {{external}} signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is {{coupled with the}} opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn alter the <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the membrane and its voltage. These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials. Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and Meissner's corpuscle, which are critical for the sense of smell and touch, respectively. However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon! Instead, they may convert the signal into {{the release of a}} neurotransmitter, or into continuous graded potentials, either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. For illustration, in the human ear, hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels, which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some amacrine cells and the third layer, the ganglion cells, produce action potentials, which then travel up the optic nerve.|$|R

The technique consists of injection of current via a glass micropipette into a capillary and measurement of the resulting intra- and extravascular potential profiles with another micropipette placed at various distances from the current source. The theory of Peskoff and Eisenberg (1974) was used to handle the problems arising from distributed extravascular resistances and was experimentally shown to describe the external field satisfactorily. With this extension of one-dimensional cable theory the specific electrical resistance of arterial microvessels was 33 omega cm 2 and of venous capillaries 23 omega cm 2.

For this purpose, we expressed mouse Snail (mSnail) cDNA in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells under the control of a doxycycline-repressible transactivator. Inducible expression of Snail did not result in overt EMT but induced a number of phenotypic alterations of MDCK cells, the most significant of which was the absence of fluid-filled blisterlike structures called "domes. " To understand the mechanisms responsible for dome suppression, we assessed the effect of mSnail expression on epithelial barrier function. Although mSnail did not alter tight junction (TJ) organization and permeability to uncharged solutes, it markedly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance. In light of these findings, we evaluated the ability of MDCK cell monolayers to maintain ionic gradients and found that expression of mSnail selectively increases Na+ and Cl- permeability. Analysis of the expression of claudins, transmembrane proteins that regulate TJ <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability,</b> showed that mSnail induces a moderate decrease in claudin- 2 and a substantial decrease in claudin- 4 and - 7 expression.

With the resistances properly balanced, a series of characteristic deflections resulted when the balancing capacity was varied. With many cells, no complete capacity balance was ever attained over the entire transient time course; but instead either a monophasic or diphasic residual deflection always remained. This behavior is {{comparable to that of}} a polarizing electrode in D.

However, some cells can be balanced almost completely against a mica condenser of proper value, which indicates that they display a nearly pure static capacity under some conditions. This static state could be produced experimentally by exposure to weak acids (acetic, carbonic, etc.) and by metabolic agents probably inducing internal acidity (low oxygen tension, long exposure to cold, narcotics, etc.). Conversely, penetrating weak bases, such as ammonia, abolished the static capacity, or even any regular polarization. Light acts something like ammonia, after an initial "acid gush" anomaly.

These experiments have been performed by using the following salts: lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and cesium chloride. Different homogeneous Nafion membranes, NF 111, NF 112, NF 115 and NF 117, have been used in this work, with the aim of studying the membrane thickness influence. It has been observed that the membrane water uptake increases with the membrane thickness and decreases with the size of the cation. The integral permeability coefficient has been determined from the time evolution of the salt concentration in the dilute solution. The results show that the integral permeability coefficient decreases with the membrane thickness. In general, the influence of the type of electrolyte on the integral permeability coefficient is not significant for the membranes with larger thickness (that is, NF 115 and NF 117). Average apparent cation transport number has been determined for the same salt solutions, and from that membrane apparent permselectivity has been estimated. In general, in membranes with large thickness, the average apparent cation transport number increases with the cation size.

50|$|However, a real cell is more complicated, having permeabilities to many ions, each {{of which}} {{contributes}} to the resting potential. To understand better, consider a cell with only two permeant ions, potassium and sodium. Consider a case where these two ions have equal concentration gradients directed in opposite directions, and that the membrane permeabilities to both ions are equal. K+ leaving the cell will tend to drag the membrane potential toward EK. Na+ entering the cell will tend to drag the membrane potential toward the reversal potential for sodium ENa. Since the permeabilities to both ions were set to be equal, the membrane potential will, {{at the end of}} the Na+/K+ tug-of-war, end up halfway between ENa and EK. As ENa and EK were equal but of opposite signs, halfway in between is zero, meaning that the membrane will rest at 0 mV. Note that even though the membrane potential at 0 mV is stable, it is not an equilibrium condition because neither of the contributing ions are in equilibrium. Ions diffuse down their electrochemical gradients through ion channels, but the membrane potential is upheld by continual K+ influx and Na+ efflux via ion transporters. Such situation with similar permeabilities for counter-acting ions, like potassium and sodium in animal cells, can be extremely costly for the cell if these permeabilities are relatively large, as it takes a lot of ATP energy to pump the ions back. Because no real cell can afford such equal and large <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> at rest, resting potential of animal cells is determined by predominant high permeability to potassium and adjusted to the required value by modulating sodium and chloride permeabilities and gradients.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe micromorphic {{continuum}} {{theory of}} dielectrics introduced {{in a previous}} work (Romeo, 2011) is here reduced to a linear set of balance and constitutive equations modeling thermo-electromagneto-elastic solids which allow for electric dipoles and quadrupoles. Electric polarization {{turns out to be}} a linear function of macroscopic strain, microrotation and their gradients. Micropolar isotropic dielectrics are considered in particular to set up the one-dimensional problem of a dielectric layer subjected to a voltage drop. The solution accounts for <b>ionic</b> <b>permeability</b> and electrostriction. In addition, the well known anomalous behavior of the electric capacitance of thin dielectric layers arises as a consequence of electroelastic coupling...|$|E
40|$|The {{modes of}} ammonia {{transport}} across the gill epithelium {{of the marine}} teleost Opsanus beta were investigated using an isolated, perfused head preparation. During perfusion for approximately 2 h there was no macro- or microscopic damage to the exterior surface of the gill filaments or lamellae, no swelling of lamellae, the structural leak was only 0 - 3 %, the afferent perfusion pressure was constant, and the transepithelial electrical potential (TEP) approximated that measured in vivo. The rate of ammonia efflux {{was similar to that}} measured in vivo, was constant for at least 80 min, and approached zero when the perfusate was nominally ammonia-free. Addition of ouabain or bumetanide to the perfusate indicated that basolateral Na+/NH 4 + exchange, but not Na+/NH 4 +/ 2 CP cotransport, was important in transbranchial ammonia transport. No evidence was found for apical Na+/NH 4 + exchange. Specific increases in perfusate NH 3 were nearly 100 times as effective as increases in NH 4 + concentrations in stimulating ammonia efflux. Alteration of TEPs could not account for any of these effects. Calculated relative permeabilities to NH 3 and NH 44 " indicate that the toadfish gill is relatively permeable to NH 4 " 1 " compared to the shark gill and other 'tight' epithelia, consistent with the general conclusion that marine teleost gills are relatively cation-'leaky'. Computation of the relative roles of the three delimited pathways for ammonia efflux indicate that 22 % is via basolateral Na+/NH 4 + exchange, 57 % via non-ionic diffusion of NH 3 and 21 % via ionic diffusion of NH 4 " 1 ". Comparison with other published data suggests that the relative roles of non-ionic and ionic diffusion of ammonia across epithelia may be correlated with relative <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Homomeric human ρ 1 GABAC receptors were {{expressed}} in Xenopus oocytes and in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) {{in order to}} examine their conductance and permeability. Reversal potentials of currents elicited by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured in extracellular solutions of various ionic composition to determine relative permeability of homomeric ρ 1 receptors. The rank order of anionic permeability was: SCN− > I− > NO 3 − > Br− > Cl− > formate (For−) > HCO 3 − > acetate (Ac−) ≈ proprionate (Prop−) ≈ isethionate (Ise−) ≈ F−≈ PO 4 −. In the oocyte expression system, relative permeabilities to SCN−, I−, NO 3 −, Br− and HCO 3 − were higher for ρ 1 GABAC receptors than α 1 β 2 γ 2 L GABAA receptors. Expression of ρ 1 GABAC receptors in Xenopus oocytes and in HEK 293 cells gave similar relative permeabilities for selected anions, suggesting that the expression system does not significantly alter permeation properties. The pore diameter of the homomeric ρ 1 GABAC receptor expressed in oocytes was estimated to be 0. 61 nm, which is somewhat larger than the 0. 56 nm pore diameter estimated for α 1 β 2 γ 2 L GABAA receptors. Homomeric ρ 1 GABA receptors expressed in oocytes had a single channel chord conductance of 0. 65 ± 0. 04 pS (mean ±s. e. m. s) when the internal chloride concentration ([Cl−]i) was 20 mm. With a [Cl−]i of 100 mm, the single channel chord conductance was 1. 59 ± 0. 24 pS. The mean open time directly measured from 43 GABA-induced channel openings in six patches was 3. 2 ± 0. 8 s. The mean open time in the presence of 100 μm picrotoxin was 0. 07 ± 0. 01 s (77 openings from 3 patches). The differences observed in <b>ionic</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> pore size, single channel conductance and mean open time suggest that the ρ 1 homomeric receptor may not be the native retinal GABAC receptor reported previously...|$|R
