40|$|Abstract: A {{flexible}} manufacturing cell (FMC) {{is defined as a}} highly automated manufacturing system. The design of these kinds of systems is characterized by massive alternatives of components positions and paths. While in practice there is always the attempt to minimize the cycle time, dealing with a lot of alternatives- in respect to components positioning and paths planning- is necessary. There are a lot of constraints and boundary limits of such systems too. For that reason, it is a very difficult task- sometimes it is impossible- to achieve an optimal configuration of FMC components positions and paths without using simulation and 3 D CAD-software. This paper introduces two different solutions for cycle time optimization based on a {{flexible manufacturing}} cell for <b>handling</b> <b>cover</b> parts. The simulation was made on the simulation software Arena 7. 0 for two different scenarios. The components positions and paths as well as collision detections are verified on the ABB 3 D simulation software RobotStudi...|$|R
40|$|Because Gaia {{will perform}} a {{continuous}} all-sky survey at a medium (Spectro) or very high (Astro) angular resolution, the on-board processing needs {{to cope with}} a high variety of objects and densities which calls for generic and adaptive algorithms at the detection level, but not only. Consequently, the Pyxis scientific algorithms developed for the on-board data <b>handling</b> <b>cover</b> a large range of application: detection and confirmation of astronomical objects, background sky estimation, classification of detected objects, Near-Earth Objects onboard detection, and window selection and positioning. Very dense fields, where the real-time computing requirements should remain within fixed bounds, are particularly challenging. Another constraint stems from the limited telemetry bandwidth and an additional compromise has to be found between scientific requirements and constraints in terms of the mass, volume and power budgets of the satellite. The rationale for the on-board data handling procedure is described here, together with the developed algorithms, the main issues and the expected scientific performances in the Astro and Spectro instruments.

60|$|Then, {{one bright}} day, a 'Power,' {{watching}} his hands, conceived {{the idea of}} giving him two balls of string, one blue, the other buff, and all that afternoon he stayed up a single tree, and came down with one of his rare sweet smiles and a little net, half blue, half buff, with a <b>handle</b> <b>covered</b> with a twist of Turkey-red twill--such a thing as one scoops up shrimps with. He was paid for it, and his eyes sparkled. You see, he had no money--the 'poilu' seldom has; and money meant drink, and tobacco in his cheek. They gave him more string, and {{for the next few days}} it rained little nets, beautifully if simply made. They thought that his salvation was in sight. It takes an eye to tell salvation from damnation, sometimes.... In any case, he no longer roamed from tree to tree, but sat across a single branch, netting.
