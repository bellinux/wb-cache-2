2500|$|Stiffelio confronts Raffaele {{and asks}} {{him what he}} would do if Lina were free, {{offering}} him a choice between [...] "a guilty freedom" [...] and [...] "the future of the woman you have destroyed". [...] The younger man does not respond, and the priest tells him to listen to his encounter with Lina <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> Stiffelio lays out the reason that their marriage can be annulled (Opposto è il calle che in avvenire - [...] "Opposite are the paths that in future our lives will follow"). Lina's reaction, when presented with the divorce decree, is to swear an ongoing love for her husband ("I will die for love of you"). Appealing to Stiffelio more as a priest than as a husband, Lina confesses that she has always loved him and she still does. [...] Stankar enters to announce that he has killed Raffaele. Jorg tries to convince Stiffelio to come to the church service (Ah sì, voliamo al tempio - [...] "Ah, yes, let us flee to the church").|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete came rushing in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> to get him off of me. But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E

It might be unfurnished, and function as a family room {{during the day and}} a bedroom at night. Many washitsu have sliding glass doors opening onto a deck or balcony.|$|R
60|$|I had {{hauled off}} his coat and waistcoat, so I let him sink again into stupidity while I took off my boots. Then I got him to his feet, and, walking behind him, impelled him slowly upstairs. I lit a candle in his bedroom. There was no sound <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> So I undressed him, and got him in bed at last, somehow. I covered him up and put over him the calf-skin rug, because the night was cold. Almost {{immediately}} he began to breathe heavily. I dragged him over to his side, and pillowed his head comfortably. He looked like a tired boy, asleep.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn most applications, such as urbanism and architecture, {{randomly}} utilizing given spaces {{is certainly}} not favorable. This study proposes an explicit algorithm for utilizing the given spaces inside a rectangle with satisfactory results. In the literature, connectivity is not considered as a criterion for floor plan design, but it is deemed essential in architecture. For example, dining rooms are preferably connected to kitchens, toilets should be connected to many rooms, and each bedroom should be separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> This paper describes adjacency among spaces and proves that the obtained rectangular floor plan {{is one of the}} best ones in terms of connectivity. An architectural and mathematical object called extra spaces is introduced by the proposed algorithm and is subsequently examined in this work...|$|R
30|$|We can, however, {{modify the}} first {{scenario}} {{in a less}} radical way. If {{the people living in}} a subset of adjacent rooms can communicate with each other, visit each other and even collaborate in joint projects, they might ask their guards to keep the doors open between these particular rooms. In this case, they will want their guards to agree also on a set of common rules for admission of people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> palace that are not included in the agreement. Free movement can thus be expanded in a world of independent states on a basis of reciprocal agreements between these. Since distances have shrunk due to global communication networks and mobility, it should also be possible to conclude free movement agreements between non-adjacent states, for example between the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} built in 1793 with local bloc-cut {{sandstone}} and is a two-storey building. The monogram of the owner and the date of its erection {{can be seen on}} a marble tablet inside the entrance. The architectural plan of the building {{in the form of a}} Greek [...] "Π" [...] surrounds a central garden with a fountain and a private bathhouse (Hammam) which has three rooms. On the ground floor the servants’ quarters and the kitchen were situated. Roofed wooden stairs with a stone base lead to the entrance hall on <b>the</b> first floor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> courtyard. The official reception room and the living areas communicated with this reception hall. The official reception room (the onda), at the end of the east wing, differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> with its exceptional carved wooden, gilded and painted decoration, which liken it to <b>other</b> official reception <b>rooms</b> in many mansions of the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

Later on in the day I was sent for to the boudoir where she was consulting with Mrs. Grant as to the lodgment of Mr. Corbeck. They were in doubt as to whether he should have a room close to Mr. Trelawny's or quite away from it, and had thought it well to ask my advice on the subject. I {{came to the conclusion that}} he had better not be too near; for the first at all events, he could easily be moved closer if necessary. When Mrs. Grant had gone, I asked Miss Trelawny how it came that the furniture of this room, the boudoir in which we were, was so different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> house.|$|R
50|$|A famous megaron is in {{the large}} {{reception}} hall of the king in the palace of Tiryns, the main room of which had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns that served as supports for the roof. This was from a Cretan influence, and evolved into <b>the</b> palace type <b>from</b> Minoan Architecture. After that the Myceneans took over this design, making it characteristically Greek.Frescoes from Pylos show figures eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Bulls were also a trend in many Greek frescoes. Other famous central megaron units are at Tiryns, Thebes, Mycenae, and Pylos. The decoration unifies each Megaron suite decoratively, This also distinguishes famous megarons, making them unique. Different Greek cultures had their own unique megarons; for example, {{the people of the}} Mainland tended to separate their central megaron <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> whereas <b>the</b> Cretans did not do this.|$|R

25|$|During the {{original}} endowment temple ordinance, members moved between ordinance rooms that represented the three different kingdoms of glory. In most newer LDS temples, {{the majority of}} the moves between rooms have been replaced with changes in lighting to represent changes from one degree of glory to the next. In some of the older Mormon temples (e.g., the Salt Lake, Manti Utah, and Cardston Alberta Temples), the classic version of the endowment ceremony is still done by moving from room to room. Every LDS temple includes a celestial room—representing the celestial kingdom—that is separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ordinance <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{principal}} entrance {{was formerly}} through the porch {{on the south}} front, but its large doors caused too many draughts.

40|$|Normally, {{traditionally}} built houses {{as well as}} prefabricated {{houses have}} similar components as regards building technology. For example, this includes the supply with power and gas, the heating technology, the supply and disposal of water, sanitary equipment, communication technology as well as staircases and an optional lift. The current research project aimed at the concentration of these technologies to form a so-called supply and technical (VT) module for universal applications as far as possible. As an example, a product suitable for series production and adaptable to individual conditions was to be developed and produced for series production. The cost-efficient high-quality steel frame design proven in module construction was {{the starting point for}} this as a static support structure. During an intensive planning phase predictive requirements were collected and designed to form a model. Static calculation showed that the VT modules could compatibly be placed one above <b>the</b> <b>other</b> for houses with up to 5 floors. The concept is based on a strict separation of <b>the</b> VT modules <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> in <b>the</b> building. All interfaces have largely been standardized and are of the plug-in or screw-type. Thus, building units erected with the traditional building technology, room module and prefabricated wood design can be interconnected easily. During a modernization of old buildings with multiple floors the specially designed VT modules can be 'docked' to existing buildings. A major advantage, for example, is a subsequent and easy retrofit of a building with a lift without essentially interfering with the existing buildings. A selection of the appropriate support heights allows a relatively simple adaptation to the different existing floor heights. A selection of the materials for designing the facade permits an optional adaptation to the existing buildings. Due to <b>the</b> results <b>from</b> this project, planners and architects may use a module which has a high degree of quality, reduces the construction time and makes the building phase more independent of atmospheric influences.
