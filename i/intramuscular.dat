5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium. Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable <b>intramuscular</b> absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.|$|E
5|$|In TgPVR1 mice, the {{transgene}} encoding {{the human}} PVR {{was incorporated into}} mouse chromosome 4. These mice express {{the highest levels of}} the transgene and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, intracerebral, <b>intramuscular,</b> and intravenous pathways, but not through the oral route.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin V, due to safety, cost, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is preferred in Europe. In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, <b>intramuscular</b> benzathine penicillin G is the first choice for treatment.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an <b>intramuscular</b> injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with <b>intramuscular</b> injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
25|$|An <b>intramuscular</b> {{suspension}} {{formulation of}} progesterone contained in microspheres is marketed under {{the brand name}} ProSphere in Mexico. It is far longer-lasting than regular <b>intramuscular</b> progesterone and is administered once weekly or once monthly, depending on the indication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intramuscular</b> {{injection}} can {{be complicated}} {{in that the}} depth of subcutaneous fat varies and may result in subcutaneous injection, or may be injected intravenously in error, or the wrong strength used. <b>Intramuscular</b> injection does give a faster and higher pharmacokinetic profile when compared to subcutaneous injection.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{can also}} be {{administered}} alternatively via subcutaneous injection, with the aqueous formulation Prolutex in Europe being intended specifically for once-daily administration by this route. This formulation is rapidly absorbed and {{has been found to}} result in higher serum peak progesterone levels relative to <b>intramuscular</b> oil formulations. In addition, subcutaneous injection of progesterone is considered to be easier, safer (less risk of injection site reactions), and less painful relative to <b>intramuscular</b> injection. The terminal half-life of this formulation is 13 to 18hours, which is similar to the terminal half-lives of OMP and <b>intramuscular</b> progesterone.|$|E
25|$|With <b>intramuscular</b> {{injection}} of 10nbsp&mg progesterone in vegetable oil, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached at approximately 8 hours after administration, and serum levels remain above baseline for about 24 hours. Doses of 10nbsp&mg, 25nbsp&mg, and 50nbsp&mg via <b>intramuscular</b> injection result in mean maximum serum concentrations of 7nbsp&ng/mL, 28nbsp&ng/mL, and 50nbsp&ng/mL, respectively. With <b>intramuscular</b> injection, {{a dose of}} 25nbsp&mg results in normal luteal phase serum levels of progesterone within 8 hours, and a 100nbsp&mg dose produces mid-pregnancy levels. At these doses, serum levels of progesterone remain elevated above baseline for at least 48 hours, with an elimination half-life of about 22hours.|$|E
25|$|Routes of {{administration}} that progesterone {{has been used}} by include oral, intranasal, transdermal/topical, vaginal, rectal, <b>intramuscular,</b> subcutaneous, and intravenous injection. Oral progesterone {{has been found to be}} inferior to vaginal and <b>intramuscular</b> progesterone in terms of absorption (low) and clearance rate (rapid). Intravaginal progesterone is available in the forms of progesterone gel, rings, and suppositories or pessaries. Advantages of intravaginal progesterone over oral administration include high bioavailability, rapid absorption, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, sustained plasma concentrations, and a local endometrial effect, while advantages of intravaginal progesterone relative to <b>intramuscular</b> injection include greater convenience and lack of local injection site pain.|$|E
25|$|No <b>intramuscular</b> {{dissection}} necessary, making surgery {{easier than}} in traditional GAP flaps.|$|E
25|$|The term {{injection}} encompasses intravenous (IV), <b>intramuscular</b> (IM), subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) administration.|$|E
25|$|When {{given by}} the {{subcutaneous}} or <b>intramuscular</b> routes for asthma, an appropriate dose is 0.3 to 0.5mg.|$|E
25|$|The current {{treatment}} for first-stage disease is intravenous or <b>intramuscular</b> pentamidine for T. b. gambiense or intravenous suramin for T. b. rhodesiense.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous or <b>intramuscular</b> {{injections}} in hypotensive {{people or}} those in shock should be administered carefully and vital signs should be monitored.|$|E
25|$|For adults, {{intravenous}} (IV) or <b>intramuscular</b> (IM) artesunate is recommended. Quinine is {{an acceptable}} alternative if parenteral artesunate is not available.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine is marketed {{throughout}} the world mainly under the brand name Tofranil. Imipramine pamoate is marketed under the brand name Tofranil-PM for <b>intramuscular</b> injection.|$|E
25|$|The {{perforator}} of the sc-GAP flap courses {{between the}} gluteus medius and maximus muscles. Using the septocutaneous gluteal artery perforator obviates {{the need for}} <b>intramuscular</b> dissection.|$|E
25|$|These {{are also}} called {{injectable}} formulations {{and are used}} with intravenous, subcutaneous, <b>intramuscular,</b> and intra-articular administration. The drug is stored in liquid or if unstable, lyophilized form.|$|E

25|$|Hydroxyzine can be {{administered}} orally or via <b>intramuscular</b> injection. When given orally, hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of hydroxyzine is notable in 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|If {{the person}} has inborn errors in the methyltransfer pathway (cobalamin C disease, {{combined}} methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria), treatment with intravenous, <b>intramuscular</b> hydroxocobalamin or transdermal B12 is needed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intramuscular</b> {{progesterone}} irritates {{tissues and}} {{is associated with}} injection site reactions such as changes in skin color, pain, redness, transient s (due to inflammation), ecchymosis (bruising/discoloration), and others.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vaccines}} {{are given}} by subcutaneous (under the skin) or <b>intramuscular</b> (into the muscle) injection. Respiratory tract disease vaccination {{may be given}} intra-nasally (in the nose) in some cases.|$|E
25|$|When given intravenously, {{lorazepam}} {{appears to}} be superior to diazepam for stopping seizure activity. <b>Intramuscular</b> midazolam {{appears to be}} a reasonable option especially in those who are not in hospital.|$|E
25|$|Injectable codeine is {{available}} for subcutaneous or <b>intramuscular</b> injection only; intravenous injection is contraindicated as this can result in non-immune mast-cell degranulation and resulting anaphylactoid reaction. Codeine suppositories are also marketed in some countries.|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac acts by {{inhibiting}} {{the bodily}} synthesis of prostaglandins. Ketorolac in its oral (tablet or capsule) and <b>intramuscular</b> (injected) preparations is a racemic mixture of both (S)-(−)-ketorolac, the active isomer, and (R)-(+)-ketorolac.|$|E
25|$|Rh {{disease is}} {{generally}} preventable by treating the mother during pregnancy or soon after delivery with an <b>intramuscular</b> injection of anti-RhD immunoglobulin (Rho(D) immune globulin). The RhD protein is coded by the RHD gene.|$|E
25|$|Intranasal {{progesterone}} as a {{nasal spray}} {{has been found}} to be effective in achieving therapeutic levels, and was not associated with nasal irritation, but was associated with an unpleasant taste of the spray. Rectal, <b>intramuscular,</b> and intravenous routes may be inconvenient, especially for long-term treatment. Plasma levels of progesterone are similar after vaginal and rectal administration in spite of the different routes of administration, and rectal administration is an alternative to vaginal progesterone in conditions of vaginal infection, cystitis, recent childbirth, or when barrier contraception methods are used. <b>Intramuscular</b> injection of progesterone may achieve much higher levels of progesterone than normal luteal phase concentrations and levels achieved with other routes.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} achieved, progesterone by <b>intramuscular</b> injection at the usual clinical dose range is able to suppress gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, demonstrating antigonadotropic efficacy (and therefore suppression of gonadal sex steroid production).|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone can be {{administered}} orally, intranasally, via intravenous, <b>intramuscular,</b> or subcutaneous injection, or rectally. The bioavailability of oral administration of oxycodone averages 60–87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; intranasal varies between {{individuals with a}} mean of 46%.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{mammalian}} muscle flesh {{consists of}} roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent <b>intramuscular</b> fat, 1.2 percent carbohydrates and 2.3 percent other soluble non-protein substances. These include nitrogenous compounds, such as amino acids, and inorganic substances such as minerals.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and ketamine. Doing nerve blocks with guanethidine appears to be harmful. Evidence for sympathetic nerve blocks generally is insufficient to support their use. <b>Intramuscular</b> botulinum injections may benefit people with symptoms localized to one extremity.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus toxoid can {{be given}} {{in case of a}} {{suspected}} exposure to tetanus. In such cases, it {{can be given}} with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin). It can be given as intravenous therapy or by <b>intramuscular</b> injection.|$|E
25|$|The 2016 global {{switch in}} {{vaccination}} methods resulted in shortages of the injectable vaccine, and led WHO in April 2017 to recommend general {{use of the}} fIPV vaccination protocol, involving subcutaneous injection of a lower dose than used in the standard <b>intramuscular</b> delivery.|$|E
25|$|A vaccine {{administration}} may be oral, by injection (<b>intramuscular,</b> intradermal, subcutaneous), by puncture, transdermal or intranasal. Several recent {{clinical trials}} {{have aimed to}} deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up-taken by the common mucosal immunity system, thus avoiding the need for injections.|$|E
