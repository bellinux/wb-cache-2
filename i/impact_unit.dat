40|$|Fisheries {{managers}} in the United States are required to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts of fishing activity on essential fish habitat (EFH). There are additional concerns that the viability of noncommercial species, animals that are habitat dependent and/or are themselves constituents of fishery habitat may still be threatened. We consider a cap-and-trade system for habitat conservation, individual habitat quotas for fisheries, to achieve habitat conservation and species protection goals cost effectively. Individual quotas of habitat <b>impact</b> <b>units</b> (HIUs) would be distributed to fishers with an aggregate quota set to maintain a target habitat “stock ” of EFH conservation. Using a dynamic, spatially explicit fishery simulation model we explore the efficiency and cost effectiveness of an IHQ policy versus alternative marine protected area (MPA) configurations, at {{reducing the risk of}} extinguishing a habitat dependent species of unknown spatial distribution. Our findings indicate that an IHQ policy with a conservatively established habitat target is better suited to the protection of non-targe...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{production}} in the United States is in transition as the demand for clean and domestic power increases. Wind energy offers the benefit of reduced emissions, yet, like oil and natural gas, it also contributes to energy sprawl. We used a diverse set of indicators to quantify the ecological impacts of oil, natural gas, and wind energy development in Colorado and Wyoming. Aerial imagery was supplemented with empirical data to estimate habitat loss, fragmentation, potential for wildlife mortality, susceptibility to invasion, biomass carbon lost, and water resources. To quantify these impacts we digitized the land-use footprint within 375 plots, stratified by energy type. We quantified the change in <b>impacts</b> per <b>unit</b> area and per unit energy produced, compared wind energy to oil and gas, and compared landscapes with and without energy development. We found substantial differences in impacts between energy types for most indicators, although the magnitude {{and direction of the}} differences varied. Oil and gas generally resulted in greater <b>impacts</b> per <b>unit</b> area but fewer <b>impacts</b> per <b>unit</b> energy compared with wind. Biologically important and policy-relevant outcomes of this study include: 1) regardless of energy type, underlying land-use matters and development in already disturbed areas resulted in fewer total impacts; 2) the number and source of potential mortality varied between energy types, however, the lack of robust mortality data limits our ability to use this information to estimate and mitigate impacts; and 3) per unit energy produced, oil and gas extraction was less impactful on an annual basis but is likely to have a much larger cumulative footprint tha...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Hammer drills are known to cause vibration induced injury. One method of alleviating this problem {{is to reduce the}} level of vibration generated by the hammer drill <b>impact</b> <b>unit,</b> so that less vibration is felt by the operator. The objective {{of this study was to}} increase the understanding of <b>impact</b> <b>unit</b> behaviour and develop theoretical models to assist the design process. The <b>impact</b> <b>unit</b> was initially simplified to a two degree of freedom vibro-impact system with impact excitation. The periodic Green's function method was used to study the system analytically. The equations of motion were solved for the initial two degree of freedom system for both sinusoidal and impulse excitation cases, without recourse to numerical methods. This is the first purely analytical solution that has been obtained for such a two degree of freedom system with impact excitation. Two solutions to the equation of motion were found but a stability analysis showed that only one was stable. The analytical solution provides a reliable basis for the development of more detailed numerical models of the <b>impact</b> <b>unit.</b> A Simulink model achieved a good agreement with the analytical solution for both sinusoidal and impulse excitation. It was found that the use of compliance in the impact surfaces was essential to avoid the accumulation of integration errors due to infinite acceleration at impact. A more complex model with a loose mass was also simulated. A two mass test rig was developed to provide data to support the development of the simplified models. Two resonances and an antiresonance were identified, confirming the modelling results. The first experimental rig to be based on an actual hammer drill was also developed, to support the development of more complex models. A laser vibrometer was used to measure the velocities of the internal parts. By varying the hammer drill speed a general understanding of its behaviour was obtained. The hammer drill showed periodic behaviour with the same period as the excitation but with some variation from cycle to cycle...|$|E
