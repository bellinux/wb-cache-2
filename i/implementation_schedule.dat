25|$|In early 2000, the {{national}} government developed two key policy instruments to control wastewater pollution. First, the National Plan for Municipal Wastewater Management (PMAR), which provides a framework for the rapid evolution of wastewater management programs in the large urban areas. This national plan promotes coordinated wastewater management at the local, regional, and national levels by focusing on institutional strengthening {{and the application of}} existing planning tools. Furthermore, it promotes the construction of wastewater treatment systems in municipalities with adequate water and sewerage service and with prioritized high impact watersheds, including Río Bogotá, Río Chicamocha, Río Medellin and Río Cauca. Second, the Sanitation and Management of Wastewater Discharge Plan (Plan de Saneamiento y Manejo de Vertimientos, PSMV), which mandates that the service providers indicate programs, projects and activities following an <b>implementation</b> <b>schedule</b> and investment plan aimed at reducing pollution loads in receiving waters and improving wastewater collection in municipal sewer systems. PSMV’s action plans are aligned with other planning instruments, for instance water quality objectives defined by the environmental authority, as well as master plans and investment plans set by the municipalities. These two national policies have been instrumental to support the recent increase of wastewater programs in large cities in Colombia.|$|E

Given {{a list of}} installations for realignment and closure, BRACAS maximizes the net present value of future savings less the one-time costs while satisfying yearly budget constraints. BRACAS provides insights on {{the adequacy of the}} budget and tradeoffs between budget and savings. Modeling issues that have impact on further use of the model such as solution persistence' and alternate computation of savings are examined. With solution persistence incorporated, BRACAS is capable of generating an optimal schedule that maintains continuity with a previous schedule. Between June and August 1995 BRACAS helped the Army Base Realignment and Closure Office determine budget levels and <b>implementation</b> <b>schedules</b> for the 1995 round of base realignments and closures.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the factors affecting resource based scheduling and the barrier/constraints against {{the implementation of}} resource based scheduling in Indian construction project. However the traditional methods such as critical path method and program evaluation and review technique are based on time but actual work is not completed on time. Hence it becomes essential to follow a resource based schedule {{which is based on}} actual availability of resource to meet the project deadline. This paper mainly focuses the resource oriented scheduling techniques and it is helpful to investigate the <b>implementation</b> of <b>scheduling,</b> type of scheduling adopted, method of scheduling, status of <b>scheduling</b> <b>implementation</b> in various construction firm. The questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the factors affecting resource oriented <b>scheduling</b> <b>implementation</b> and barriers/constraints against its implementation in the Indian construction project. The collected data was analyzed using statistical tool. Prioritization of the factors by frequency analysis and average index method was carried out. The barriers/constraints against <b>implementation</b> of resource <b>scheduling</b> were identified and presented. Suitable suggestions for the Indian construction companies were given to promote and motivate the professionals entering the firm at the initial stage about the concepts of resource scheduling so that they have a genuine commitment in the <b>implementation</b> of resource <b>scheduling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{software}} project encounters {{many changes}} during the software development life cycle. The key {{challenge is to}} control these changes and manage {{their impact on the}} project plan, budget, and <b>implementation</b> <b>schedules.</b> A well-developed change control process should assist the project manager and the responsible team in monitoring these changes. In this paper, we examine a number of approaches for project monitoring & control with different scenarios of project schedules. The comparison shows the effect of applying each approach on the cost and the time of the project. The evaluation illustrates that the integrated software Project and Change Management (IPCM) is a more efficient for providing more control in tracking change requests, and improve the performance monitoring process...|$|R

This enables the user to identify the implications of choosing among different <b>implementation</b> <b>schedules.</b> We illustrate these ideas by examining how our framework can used to evaluate investments in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Cash Management Systems (CMS). ...|$|R
