25|$|Entirely {{different}} in origin {{is the first}} part of the second section, drawn undoubtedly from an old tannaitic source. Four sentences of this section are cited in the Talmud as being taken from a Baraita (B. B. 90b; Sanh. 76b; Shab. 88b), and one in the name of Abba Arika (Sanh. l.c.), who often quoted old sentences and maxims (Er. 54a). The composition shows that this section is not taken from the Talmud, for the division into 12 good and 12 bad classes of men is not found in the latter. The other half of this section, however, is probably a later interpolation, belonging properly to the third section. For this section begins with a saying of Ben Azzai concerning <b>four</b> <b>things</b> the contemplation of which would keep men from sin: hence the four classes of <b>four</b> <b>things</b> each that are enumerated in the second section.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} there are cases where two things can be {{rendered}} impure in succession by a corpse, {{one of those things}} being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the other thing being rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening. There are cases where three things can be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, two of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening. And there are cases where <b>four</b> <b>things</b> can be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, three of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening.|$|E
25|$|Josephus {{interpreted}} the Tabernacle and its furnishings {{to represent the}} universe. He saw the Tabernacle's two parts accessible to the priests (the Holy and the Courtyard) to denote {{the land and the}} sea, the third division set aside for God (the Holy of Holies) to represent heaven, inaccessible to people. He saw the 12 loaves to denote the year divided into months. He saw the Menorah divided into 70 parts, representing the 70 divisions of the planets, and the seven lamps on the Menorah to refer to the course of the seven planets (then known). He saw the veils, composed of <b>four</b> <b>things,</b> to declare the four elements: the fine linen signified the earth, because the flax grows out of the earth; the purple signified the sea, because purple was dyed by the blood of shellfish from the sea; the blue signified the air; and the scarlet signified fire.|$|E

They are often commended as a {{collective}} topic for pious meditation; Saint Philip Neri wrote, [...] "Beginners in religion ought to exercise themselves principally in meditation on the Four Last Things."

2500|$|Ben Azzai {{mentioned}} <b>four</b> <b>things</b> {{in connection}} with the four sayings. They are drawn from the Talmud (Suk. 29). The third section seems to have been in ancient times the beginning of Derek Ereẓ R. (Rashi on Ber. 22a; Pes. 86b; Tosef. 'Er. 53b), for which reason the old writers called the whole treatise [...] "Perek ben Azzai." [...] Yet it is difficult to understand how this section came to be taken as the introduction to the treatise, which otherwise, beginning with the fourth section, forms a connected whole, and has totally different contents from the Pereḳ ben Azzai.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash deduced {{from the}} use of the word [...] "this" [...] in [...] that the work of the Menorah was one of <b>four</b> <b>things</b> that God had to show Moses with God's finger because Moses was puzzled by them.

[...] (The word [...] "this" [...] {{implying}} that something was held up to illustrate the instructions given.). See also Sifri Zutta Beha'alotekha 8:4:1:3.

[...] A famous Mishnah statement on attempts to [...] "pierce the veil" [...] is this: [...] "Whoever reflects on <b>four</b> <b>things</b> it were better for him that he had not come into the world: [...] "what is above? what is beneath? what is before? and what is after?" ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Four</b> <b>things</b> are {{required}} for caries formation: a tooth surface (enamel or dentin), caries-causing bacteria, fermentable carbohydrates (such as sucrose), and time. This involves adherence of food to the teeth and acid creation by the bacteria that makes up the dental plaque. [...] However, these four criteria are not always enough to cause the disease and a sheltered environment promoting development of a cariogenic biofilm is required. [...] The caries disease process {{does not have an}} inevitable outcome, and different individuals will be susceptible to different degrees depending on the shape of their teeth, oral hygiene habits, and the buffering capacity of their saliva. [...] Dental caries can occur on any surface of a tooth that is exposed to the oral cavity, but not the structures that are retained within the bone.|$|E

[...] The Rabbis deduced that one must [...] "be strong" [...] in Torah and [...] "be courageous" [...] in good deeds. In support {{of the need for}} strength in prayer, the Rabbis cited [...] "Wait for the Lord, be strong and let your heart take courage, yea, wait for the Lord." [...] And in support of the need for strength in work, the Rabbis cited [...] "Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people." ...|$|E

The fourth thing in this series, whether a person or a utensil, is then rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening — a first-grade impurity ( [...] , rishon l'tumah).|$|E

2500|$|In nature, a {{light source}} emits {{a ray of}} light which travels, eventually, to a surface that {{interrupts}} its progress. [...] One can think of this [...] "ray" [...] as a stream of photons traveling along the same path. [...] In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of <b>four</b> <b>things</b> might happen with this light ray: [...] absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. [...] A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting {{in a loss of}} intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. [...] It might also reflect {{all or part of the}} light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any transparent or translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the spectrum (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. [...] A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of [...] the incoming rays. [...] Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Mani of She'ab (in Galilee), Rabbi Joshua of Siknin (also in Galilee), and Rabbi Johanan {{all said}} {{in the name of}} Rabbi Levi that Nadab and Abihu died because of <b>four</b> <b>things,</b> in {{connection}} with each of which Scripture mentions death: (1) Because they had drunk wine, for in connection with drinking wine [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "Drink no wine nor strong drink [...] [...] [...] so that you do not die." [...] (2) Because they lacked the prescribed number of garments (while officiating), for in connection with appropriate garments [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And they [...] shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons [...] [...] [...] so that they bear no iniquity and die." [...] Nadab and Abihu lacked their robes (implied perhaps by the report of [...] that they their bodies were carried out in their tunics), in connection with which [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And it shall be upon Aaron to minister [...] [...] [...] so that he does not die." [...] (3) Because they entered the Sanctuary without washing their hands and feet, for [...] says, [...] "So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die," [...] and [...] says, [...] "When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they do not die." [...] (4) Because they had no children, for in connection with not having children [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And Nadab and Abihu died [...] [...] [...] and they had no children." [...] Abba Hanin taught that it was because they had no wives, for [...] says, [...] "And [...] make atonement for himself, and for his house," [...] and [...] "his house" [...] implies that he had to have a wife.|$|E
