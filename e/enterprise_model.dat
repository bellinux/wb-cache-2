5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model,</b> but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard {{the bridge of the}} Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set.|$|E
5|$|First Contact was {{the last}} film to feature a {{physical}} model of the Enterprise. For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team combined motion control shots of the <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model</b> with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created Generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots of the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E

Rick Sternbach constructed the model by kitbashing Ertl kits {{of the movie}} Enterprise, using parts from other models such as the VF-1 Valkyrie to add detail. Greg Jein used Sternbach's and Andrew Probert's designs to create the four-foot shooting model of the USS Stargazer for [...] "The Battle".

500|$|ILM {{delivered}} the main <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model,</b> {{which was built}} by Magicam in 1978 for , [...] to Associates and Ferren. However, scenes which included the Enterprise in the Earth-orbiting Spacedock platform, {{as well as the}} Spacedock itself, were taken directly from ILM's previous work in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model</b> had been damaged when it was loaned out for touring purposes, meaning the 30,000 panels on the model had to be repainted by hand. While production wrapped, Ferren continued work on the miniatures and other optical effects at his New Jersey studio. The opticals were completed in Manhattan before being sent west; for example, bluescreen footage of the motion controlled miniatures was filmed in Hoboken, New Jersey. In New York, the blue screen was replaced by a moving starfieldâ€” a single finished shot of a ship moving through space required as many as fifty pieces of film. The Great Barrier effects were created using chemicals, which were dropped into a large water tank to create swirls and other reactions. The [...] "God column", in which the false god appeared, was created by a rapidly rotating cylinder through which light was shone; the result appeared on film as a column of light. Ferren used a beam splitter to project actor George Murdock's head into the cylinder, giving the appearance that the false god resided within the column.|$|E
500|$|Greg Jein {{had already}} {{been working on a}} new model of the USS Excelsior for the [...] "Flashback" [...] episode of Voyager when he saw the test footage for [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations". He promised to make a new model of the Enterprise too, but warned that he didn't know when he would have time to do it. He {{actually}} started work on it immediately, and together with his colleagues he not only built a [...] long model of the Enterprise, but created a new model of Deep Space Station K7 and the Klingon cruiser as well. The <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model</b> was the first to be built of the original Star Trek starship in more than 30 years. Other props were also recreated, with around 1,400 tribbles created for the various scenes. They were purchased from Lincoln Enterprises, a company set up by Majel Barrett, widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. The rest of the era-specific props were newly created, and were made by Steve Horsch.|$|E

The main <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model</b> was eight feet long, to a scale of 1/120th scale size, or [...] to [...] It took 14 months and $150,000 to build. Instead of {{standard}} fiberglass used for older models, the new Enterprise was constructed with lightweight plastics, weighing [...] The biggest design issue was {{making sure that the}} connective dorsal neck and twin warp nacelle struts were strong enough so that no part of the ship model would sag, bend, or quiver when the model was being moved, which was accomplished via an arc-welded aluminum skeleton. The completed model could be supported at one of five possible points as each photographic angle required. A second, 20-inch (50.8cm) model of the ship was used for long shots. While the hull surface was kept smooth, it was treated with a special paint finish that made its surface appear iridescent in certain light. Transparencies of the film's sets were inserted behind some windows, and as jokes, some featured Probert, other production staff members, and Mickey Mouse. The Enterprise was revised again after Abel & Associates were dismissed.|$|E

500|$|For the Borg battle, Knoll {{insisted on}} closeup shots that were near the alien vessel, necessitating a {{physical}} model. ILM layered their [...] model {{with an additional}} fiveinches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination. To make the Borg vessel appear even larger than it was, Knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing the camera like the prow of a ship and that the Cube broke {{the edges of the}} frame. To give the Cube greater depth and texture, Rosenberg shot the vessel with harsher light. [...] "I created this really odd, raking three-quarter backlight coming from the right or left side, which I balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights. I wanted it to look scary and mysterious, so it was lit like a point, and we always had the camera dutched to it; we never just had it coming straight at us," [...] he said. Small lights attached to the Cube's surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale; the model was deliberately shot with a slow, determined pacing to contrast with the Federation ships engaged in battle with the Borg. The impact of Federation weaponry on the Borg Cube was simulated using a [...] model of the Cube. The model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging the miniature. For the final explosion of the Cube, Rosenberg shot ten [...] Cube miniatures with explosive-packed lightweight skins. The Cubes were suspended from pipes sixtyfeet above the camera on the ground. Safety glass was placed over the lens to prevent damage, while the camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion. The smaller Borg sphere was a [...] model that was shot separately from the Cube and digitally added in post-production. The time-travel vortex the Sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re-entry effect; bowshock forms in front of the ship, then streams backwards at high speed. Interactive lighting was played across the computer-generated <b>Enterprise</b> <b>model</b> for when the ship is caught in the time vortex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a Unified <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Modeling</b> Language (UEML) {{and a set}} of mappings which support translating models represented under an <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Modeling</b> Language into another <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Modeling</b> Language.

Additionally, UEML is a meta-model that represents the (abstract) syntax of a Unified <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Modeling</b> Language (UEML 1. 0). This paper presents the foundations of the work performed during the UEML project funded by IST Programme of the European Commission 5 th Framework. The rationale, the basic principles and the undertaken approach followed to define UEML 1. 0.
