5|$|If {{the player}} saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, {{and that they}} were not the killer robots who {{slaughtered}} Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands.</b> Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of the}} island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.|$|E

50|$|Following an {{incident}} involving the killings of several innocent lives, {{staff at the}} Osiris Medical Facility, a research complex in Virginia, prepare to work on John Vattic, a parapsychology researcher and the man claimed to be responsible. Unbeknown to them, Vattic awakens and breaks free from his isolation cell, discovering that he has powerful psychic abilities of unknown origin, and no recollection of his past or his identity. Seeking to find answers {{for what happened to}} him, Vattic begins searching for the facility's computer records, experiencing a flashbacks to the past upon learning his identity. Finding himself reliving events that occurred six months ago, Vattic recalls that he had been recruited by the Pentagon to assist a special taskforce of U.S. Marines, called WinterICE. Although he had been told his role was strictly to be advisory, upon arriving at a training facility in Germany and meeting with the taskforce, including their commanding officer, Colonel Joshua Starke, and their advisor, Jayne Wilde, a psychic who Vattic had clashed with over his published works, he found himself being given weapons training, before learning he was to go with them to Siberia. The WinterICE team had been assigned to find and recover a Russian scientist named Victor Grienko, a renowned scientist who was now seeking political asylum with the United States in exchange for the protection of his secret research into parapsychology, deemed dangerous if it fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrongs</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R

25|$|Since {{the early}} days of communication, diplomats and {{military}} commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands,</b> {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653).|$|E
25|$|In {{the history}} of Myth, one {{particularly}} celebrated legend is that of Connacht, who, one thousand years ago, saved the world from a race of flesh-eating monsters called the Myrkridia, which had hunted humanity to near extinction over the previous millennium. Coming from the eastern land of Gower {{at the same time}} a comet appeared in the western skies, Connacht was the first human to fight the Myrkridia and survive. However, not only did he survive, he defeated them, ultimately imprisoning them in a magical prison known as the Tain, built for him by the Dwarven smiths of Muirthemne. With the Myrkridia gone, Connacht became Emperor of the Cath Bruig, presiding over a prosperous era known as the Age of Light. However, many years later, he disappeared from the historical records. It is unknown exactly what happened to him, although one theory suggests he went in search of powerful magical artifacts, fearful of the ramifications if such items should fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands.</b> Whatever the truth about his disappearance, Connacht was never seen again.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” {{to be the}} ones getting the gun {{at the end of the}} day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." [...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands.</b> The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm”.|$|E

Here Bucer met Luther {{for the first}} time. [...] In a long letter to his mentor, Beatus Rhenanus, Bucer recounted what he learned, and he commented on several of Luther's Ninety-Five Theses. He largely agreed with them and perceived the ideas of Luther and Erasmus to be in concordance. Because meeting Luther posed certain risks, he asked Rhenanus to ensure his letter did not fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands.</b> He also wrote his will, which contains the inventory of his books. In early 1519, Bucer received the baccalaureus degree, and that summer he stated his theological views in a disputation before the faculty at Heidelberg, revealing his break with Aquinas and scholasticism.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{traditional}} belief, early kabbalistic knowledge was transmitted orally by the Patriarchs, prophets, and sages (hakhamim in Hebrew), eventually to be [...] "interwoven" [...] into Jewish religious writings and culture. According to this view, early kabbalah was, {{in around the}} 10th century BCE, an open knowledge practiced by over a million people in ancient Israel.

2500|$|Secret sharing schemes {{are ideal}} for storing {{information}} that is highly sensitive and highly important. [...] Examples include: [...] encryption keys, missile launch codes, and numbered bank accounts. [...] Each of these pieces of information must be kept highly confidential, as their exposure could be disastrous, however, it is also critical {{that they should not}} be lost. [...] Traditional methods for encryption are ill-suited for simultaneously achieving high levels of confidentiality and reliability. [...] This is because when storing the encryption key, one must choose between keeping a single copy of the key in one location for maximum secrecy, or keeping multiple copies of the key in different locations for greater reliability. [...] Increasing reliability of the key by storing multiple copies lowers confidentiality by creating additional attack vectors; there are more opportunities for a copy to fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] Secret sharing schemes address this problem, and allow arbitrarily high levels of confidentiality and reliability to be achieved.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, Jane's Information Group {{reported}} that the Typhoon was the favourite to win the contest for Japan's next-generation fighter requirement. The other competitors then were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. On 17 October 2007, Japanese Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed that Japan may buy the Typhoon. Although the F-22 Raptor was in his words [...] "exceptional", it was not [...] "absolutely necessary for Japan", and the Typhoon was the best alternative. The F-22 is currently unavailable for export per US law. During a visit to Japan in June 2009, Andy Latham of BAE pointed out that while F-22 exports were restricted to keep advanced military technology from falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>hands,</b> selling the Typhoon would take a [...] "no black box approach", that is that even licensed production and integration with Japanese equipment would not carry the risk of leakage of restricted military technology. In July 2010, it was {{reported that}} the Japan Air Self-Defense Force favoured acquiring the F-35 ahead of the Typhoon and the F/A-18E/F to fulfill its F-X requirement due to its stealth characteristics, but the Defense Ministry was delaying its budget request to evaluate when the F-35 would be produced and delivered. David Howell of the UK Foreign Office has suggested that Japan could partner with Britain in the continuing development of the Eurofighter. On 20 December 2011, the Japanese Government announced its intention to purchase 42 F-35s. The purchase decision was influenced by the F-35's stealth characteristics, with the Defence Minister Yasuo Ichikawa saying, [...] "There are changes in the security environment and the actions of various nations and {{we want to have a}} fighter that has the capacity to cope".|$|E
