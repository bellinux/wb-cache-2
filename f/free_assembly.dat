5|$|Stephen Anthony McNallen (born October 15, 1948) is an American {{proponent of}} the modern Pagan new {{religious}} movement of Heathenry. He founded the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), which he led from 1994 until 2016, having previously been {{the founder of the}} Viking Brotherhood and the Asatrú <b>Free</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|E

The 30-minute shutdown was criticized by the media and King County Executive Dow Constantine as an attempt to hamper protesters' freedom of speech and right to <b>free</b> <b>assembly.</b> Service was resumed at the direction of Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff, and the following week Sound Transit and King County Metro formalized a new protocol requiring future requests from law enforcement to suspend service be approved by the CEO or general manager.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{emerged in}} the United States during the 1960s. In 1969 the Danish Heathen Else Christensen {{established}} the Odinist Fellowship {{at her home in}} the U.S. state of Florida. Heavily influenced by Mills' writings, she began publishing a magazine, The Odinist, which placed greater emphasis on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones. Stephen McNallen first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s, before creating the Asatru <b>Free</b> <b>Assembly</b> in 1976, which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of neo-Nazis within the group. In the 1990s, McNallen founded the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), an ethnically-oriented Heathen group headquartered in California. Meanwhile, Valgard Murray and his kindred in Arizona founded the Ásatrú Alliance (AA) in the late 1980s, which shared the AFA's perspectives on race and which published the Vor Tru newsletter. In 1987, Stephen Flowers and James Chisholm founded The Troth, which was incorporated in Texas. Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation.|$|E

5|$|The {{right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, which is {{guaranteed}} to Singapore citizens by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore, is essential to the concept of representative democracy. Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, Speakers' Corner, and the new media. However, Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds. One of these is the protection of reputation. Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People's Action Party have used civil defamation suits against opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament. The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims. In addition, both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government. Article 14 protects the right {{to freedom of}} assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings. <b>Free</b> <b>assembly</b> is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held, though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers and speakers who are citizens.|$|E
25|$|While the 1999 {{constitution}} guarantees a {{right to}} <b>free</b> <b>assembly,</b> in practice the government places restrictions on political gatherings, especially at time of popular unrest. There have been three blanket states of emergency declared since 1999, the longest beginning in August 2007 for the entire Agadez Department, and renewed in November 2007. These states of emergency essentially remove all rights to protest, gathering and free movement. They also allow detention without charge or trial.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 the Free Church of Scotland {{united with}} the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland {{to form the}} United Free Church of Scotland. However, a {{minority}} of the original Free Church remained outside this new union. The protesting and dissenting minority at once claimed to be the legitimate Free Church. They met outside the <b>Free</b> <b>Assembly</b> Hall on October 31 and, failing to gain admission, withdrew to another hall, where they elected Colin A. Bannatyne as moderator and held the remaining sittings of their Assembly. It was reported that between 16,000 and 17,000 names had been received of persons adhering to the anti-unionist principle. It has been estimated that the number of Free Church communicants dropped from a little under 300,000 in 1899 to just over 4,000 in 1900.|$|E

25|$|The {{exercise}} {{of the right to}} <b>free</b> <b>assembly</b> is restricted by the common law as well as legislation. There is a common law duty to protect the Queen's peace and the power to detain persons who commit breach of the peace. The Public Order Act 1986 provides for the offences of riot, violent disorder, affray and causing harassment, alarm or distress, all of which may be committed by participants in an assembly. In addition, the Public Order Act 1936 outlaws the wearing of political uniforms at a public meeting when they suggest an association with a political object. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 gives the police powers in relation to trespassers on private land. There is now a requirement under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to notify the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis of an intention to demonstrate in Parliament Square and the Commissioner may impose such conditions as they see fit, including the place, time and number of participants.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{willing to}} stand in the 1984 elections, the UNO, headed by Arturo Cruz (a former Sandinista), declined participation in the elections based on their own objections to the restrictions placed on the electoral process by the State of Emergency and the official advisement of President Ronald Reagan's State Department, who feared that their participation would legitimize the election process. Among other parties that abstained was COSEP, who had warned the FSLN that they would decline participation unless freedom of the press was reinstituted. Coordinadora Democrática (CD) also refused to file candidates and urged Nicaraguans not {{to take part in the}} election. The Independent Liberal Party (PLI), headed by Virgilio Godoy Reyes, announced its refusal to participate in October. Consequently, when the elections went ahead the U.S. raised objections based upon political restrictions instituted by the State of Emergency (e.g., censorship of the press, cancellation of habeas corpus, and the curtailing of <b>free</b> <b>assembly).</b>|$|E
500|$|Born in Breckenridge, Texas, McNallen {{developed}} {{an interest in}} pre-Christian Scandinavia while in college. In 1969–70 he founded the Viking Brotherhood, through which he printed a newsletter, The Runestone, to promote a form of Heathenry that he called [...] "Asatru". After spending {{four years in the}} United States Army, he transformed the Viking Brotherhood into the Asatrú <b>Free</b> <b>Assembly</b> (AFA), through which he promoted Heathenry within the American Pagan community. He espoused the belief, which he named metagenetics, that religions are connected to genetic inheritance, thus arguing that Heathenry was only suitable for those of Northern European ancestry. A growing membership generated internal conflict within the AFA, resulting in McNallen's decision to expel those with Neo-Nazi and racial extremist views from the organisation. Under increasing personal strain, in 1987 he disbanded the Assembly.|$|E

50|$|The party {{initially}} {{suggested a}} radical agenda {{for changing the}} political, social and economic system in the country.

500|$|HUAC {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} fame and notoriety with its {{investigation into the}} Hollywood film industry. In October 1947, the Committee began to subpoena screenwriters, directors, and other movie industry professionals to testify about their known or suspected membership in the Communist Party, association with its members, or support of its beliefs. It was at these testimonies that {{what became known as}} [...] "the $64,000 question" [...] was asked: [...] "Are you now or have you ever {{been a member of the}} Communist Party of the United States?" [...] Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the Committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the [...] "Hollywood Ten", cited the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and <b>free</b> <b>assembly,</b> which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the Committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for contempt of Congress. Two of the ten were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to the United States in 1976 he {{transformed}} his Viking Brotherhood into the Asatrú <b>Free</b> <b>Assembly</b> (AFA). The sociologist of religion Jennifer Snook described it as [...] "the first national Heathen organization in the United States", while according to the religious studies scholars Michael F. Strmiska and Baldur A. Sigurvinsson, the AFA [...] "established many of the important organizational and ritual structures that remain operative" [...] in American Heathenry into the 21st century. Initially meeting in the backroom of an insurance agency owned by group member Dick Johnson, the group later established a store-front office in Breckenridge, while through the AFA, McNallen continued publishing Runestone and produced booklets on Asatru. He also began conducting religious ceremonies, or blóts, and lectured at Pagan events across the U.S. He established groups known as guilds within the AFA to focus on particular endeavours, such as the Mead Brewing Guild and the Warrior Guild. The latter published a quarterly, Wolf Age, in which McNallen displayed his fascination for warrior ethics.|$|E
500|$|The first May Day {{demonstration}} in Cuba {{was held in}} 1890, and consisted of a march followed by a meeting addressed by 18 anarchist speakers. In the following days, strikes by workers in many industries led to the colonial government once again closing the Círculo de Trabajadores, only to rescind the decision {{when faced with a}} manifesto issued in protest by 2,300 workers. Later that year, 11 anarchists were tried for the murder of Menéndez Areces, a director of the moderate Uníon Obrera (Workers' Union). Though all 11 were found innocent, Captain-General Camilo García Polavieja used the situation as pretext for shutting down production of El Productor, and repression of anarchists in general. In 1892, another labor congress was held in which it reconfirmed its revolutionary syndicalist principles and expressing solidarity with the women in the working class (a new idea for a predominantly male working class that felt competed against by women in the workplace), declaring, [...] "It is an urgent necessity not to forget women, who are beginning to fill the workshops of several industries. They are driven by necessity and by bourgeois greed to compete with us. We cannot oppose it; let us help them." [...] However, the outcome of this was government suppression of the movement by means of deportation, imprisonment, the suspension of the right to <b>free</b> <b>assembly,</b> and closing of organizations' headquarters to quell organizing efforts.|$|E
50|$|Moncreiff {{took part}} in the {{controversy}} which ended in the disruption of 1843. He joined the Free Church in June 1843, and from that date till 1852 he was the minister of Free East Kilbride. He succeeded to the baronetcy and assumed the name Wellwood on {{the death of his father}} in 1851. In 1852 he became minister of Free St. Cuthbert's in Edinburgh, where his grandfather, Sir Henry Moncreiff (1750-1827) had passed fifty years of his ministry. He was appointed joint principal clerk to the <b>Free</b> General <b>Assembly</b> in 1855, was created D.D. by Glasgow University in 1860, and appointed moderator of the <b>Free</b> church <b>Assembly</b> in 1869. In 1862 he was appointed secretary of the Bible Board, and held that office at his death, which took place 4 November 1883.|$|R
6000|$|According to a {{sympathetic}} historian, [...] "on {{the day when}} Charles should abolish bishops and permit <b>free</b> General <b>Assemblies,</b> the western Whigs would become his law-abiding subjects; but till that day they would be irreconcilable." [...] But a Government is not always well advised in yielding to violence. Moreover, when Government had deserted its clergy, and had granted <b>free</b> General <b>Assemblies,</b> the two Covenants would re-arise, and the pretensions of the clergy to dominate the State would be revived. Lauderdale drifted into a policy of alternate [...] "Indulgences" [...] or tolerations, and of repression, which had the desired effect, at the maximum of cost to justice and decency. Before England drove James II. from the throne, but a small remnant of fanatics were in active resistance, and the Covenants had ceased to be dangerous.|$|R

2500|$|As a rule, the {{government}} respects citizens' {{freedom of speech}} and of the press, although {{the government}} has sued newspapers and others for libel. [...] Journalists often publish articles in return for payment. [...] Internet access is unrestricted, although fewer than 1 percent of Liberians are online. [...] Academic institutions operate freely. [...] The right to <b>free</b> <b>assembly</b> is usually respected, though there are exceptions. Liberians enjoy religious freedom. They also enjoy the freedom to travel domestically and abroad, and the right to move abroad and repatriate, but when traveling are sometimes subject to arbitrary searches and extortion by police and immigration officers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} <b>free</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{considered}} {{an aspect of the}} right to freedom of expression. Simply put by Lord Denning, [...] "it is the right for everyone to meet and assemble with his fellows to discuss their affairs and to promote their views". It has traditionally been regarded as a residual right which individuals are free to exercise so long as the law does not preclude them from doing so. According to Dicey, [...] "at no time has there in England been any proclamation of the right to liberty of thought or to freedom of speech, [...] it can hardly be said that our constitution knows of such a thing as any specific right of public meeting". There are no common law rights to hold meetings on public land or in public buildings and the owners of quasi-public spaces such as shopping centres may exclude members of the public. Peaceful meetings may be held on the highway so long as they do not restrict access by other road users.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1970, Tijerina {{was sentenced}} to prison for charges related to the 1967 Tierra Amarilla {{courthouse}} raid. [...] The presiding judge, Garnett Burkes, denied defense claims of double jeopardy. [...] A team of four lawyers spent eighteen months preparing the case, but on {{the opening day of}} the trial, Tijerina dismissed them, opting to defend himself. He was charged with the false imprisonment and assault of Daniel Rivera. Rivera, the prosecution's star witness, admitted under Tijerina's cross-examination that he neither knew federal civil rights laws, nor had he been trained in how to protect peoples' civil rights. He also testified that Tijerina was not to blame for the events at Tierra Amarilla. The Albuquerque Tribune compared Tijerina's courtroom performance with Clarence Darrow's. Dr. Frances Swadesh, a University of Colorado anthropologist, testified that Anglos had used force and legal maneuvers to steal the land. Tijerina based his closing argument on Article 6, Section two of the Constitution, which obligates the government to comply with the terms of international treaties, i.e., the protection of the property rights of land-grantees as provided by articles 8 and 9 of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He continued to assert his constitutional right to place a citizen's arrest on the law enforcement officers who, by their own admission, were ignorant of the law and had violated the Alianza's right of <b>free</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

[...] (Debats, du 10 Novembre, 1723.) So spake the Disfrocked, with a loud voice: next week, Bazire and he lie in the Abbaye; wending, one may fear, towards Tinville and the Axe; and 'people say to me'--what seems to be proving true! Bazire's blood was all inflamed with Revolution fever; with coffee and spasmodic dreams. (Dictionnaire des Hommes Marquans, i. 115.) Chabot, again, how happy with his rich Jew-Austrian wife, late Fraulein Frey! But he lies in Prison; and his two Jew-Austrian Brothers-in-Law, the Bankers Frey, lie with him; waiting the urn of doom. Let a National Convention, therefore, take warning, and know its function. Let the Convention, all as one man, set its shoulder to the work; not with bursts of Parliamentary eloquence, but in quite other and serviceable ways! ...|$|E
