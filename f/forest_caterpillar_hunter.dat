40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} the effects of carbon dioxide (CO 2) -, ozone (O 3) -, and genotype-mediated changes in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) chemis-try on performance of the <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> (Mala-cosoma disstria) and its dipteran parasitoid (Compsilura concinnata) at the Aspen Free-Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) site. Parasitized and non-parasitized <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillars</b> were reared on two aspen genotypes under elevated levels of CO 2 and O 3, alone and in combination. Foliage was collected for determination of the chemical composition of leaves fed upon by <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillars</b> during the period of endoparasitoid larval development. Elevated CO 2 decreased nitrogen levels but had no effect on concentrations of carbon-based compounds. In con-trast, elevated O 3 decreased nitrogen and phenolic glycoside levels, but increased concentrations of starch and condensed tannins. Foliar chemistry also differed between aspen genotypes. CO 2, O 3, genotype, and their interactions altered <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> performance, and differentially so between sexes. In general, enriched CO 2 had little effect on <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> performance under ambient O 3, but reduced performance (for insects on one aspen genotype) under elevated O 3. Conversely, elevated O 3 improved <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> performance under ambient, but not elevated, CO 2. Parasitoid larval survivorship decreased under elevated O 3, depending upon levels of CO 2 and aspen genotype. Additionally, larval performance and masses of mature female para-sitoids differed between aspen genotypes. These results suggest that host-parasitoid interactions in forest systems may be altered by atmospheric conditions anticipated for the future, and that the degree of change may be influenced by plant genotype...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. The {{fecundity}} of the <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> varies considerably {{across its}} geographic range. Field {{data indicate that}} populations in the southern United States (Gulf States) produce nearly twice as many eggs as females from Canada or the Lake States, {{with little or no}} difference in the size of adult females. 2. In controlled rearing experiments, female <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> from the southern United States (Louisiana) had much larger clutch sizes than same sized females from northern populations in Michigan or Manitoba, Canada. Increased fecundity in Louisiana females was achieved through a signi®cant reduction in egg size and a concomitant increase in the allocation of resources to egg production. 3. Comparison of 10 <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> populations spanning a 27 ° latitudinal gradient, validated the results of detailed comparisons among the three populations above by con®rming the strong negative correlation between latitude and clutch size. 4. Neonate <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillars</b> from Manitoba were signi®cantly larger than larvae from either Michigan or Louisiana. Michigan larvae were intermediate in size. It is postulated that large neonates are advantageous in thermally limiting environments. More than three times as many degree-days are available to Louisiana neonates during the ®rst 2 weeks after hatching. A consistently favourable climate during the vulnerable post-hatching period may have allowed the evolution of larger clutches at the expense of neonate size in southern populations. Key words.

50|$|Leaves consist {{largely of}} nondigestible components, {{and it has}} been {{estimated}} that tent caterpillars void as fecal pellets nearly half of the energy they ingest. As a consequence, a colony of caterpillars produces large quantities of fecal pellets. This is particularly noticeable during outbreaks of the <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar.</b> Fecal pellets dropping from treetops in which the caterpillars are feeding create the auditory illusion of rainfall. Tent caterpillars typically have five to six larval instars. It is estimated that the last instar consumes about 80% of all the food taken in by a larva during the whole of its life cycle. Consequently, it is not uncommon for populations of <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillars</b> to go unnoticed until the last instar, when their feeding causes extensive defoliation of trees.|$|R

40|$|Calculation of {{the number}} of eggs per egg mass of the <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar,</b> Malacosoma disstria Hiibner, is {{required}} in survey and population studies.

Hodson (1941) determined the number of eggs in egg masses of the <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> by counting the number of eggs around the circumference and multiplying by the number of rows. This technique is apparently reliable for comparative counts, but because the eggs are frequently laid in oblique rather than straight rows on the twig, counts of both length and circumference are subject to error. In addition, adjacent rows are often offset to form a honeycomb pattern which leads to inaccuracies in length and circumference counts. Because of these shortcomings, we developed a quicker and more accurate method not subject to the effects of oblique or honeycomb egg patterns...|$|R

40|$|Given an {{undirected graph}} G and an integer k ≥ 0, the NP-hard 2 -Layer Planarization problem asks whether G can be {{transformed}} into a <b>forest</b> of <b>caterpillar</b> trees by removing at most k edges. 2 -Layer Planarization was known to be fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter k.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} covering an input graph H with graphs from a fixed covering class G. The classical covering number of H with respect to G is the minimum number of graphs from G needed to cover the edges of H without covering non-edges of H. We introduce a unifying notion of three covering parameters with respect to G, {{two of which are}} novel concepts only considered in special cases before: the local and the folded covering number. Each parameter measures " how far " H is from G in a different way. Whereas the folded covering number has been investigated thoroughly for some covering classes, e. g., interval graphs and planar graphs, the local covering number has received little attention. We provide new bounds on each covering number with respect to the following covering classes: linear <b>forests,</b> star <b>forests,</b> <b>caterpillar</b> <b>forests,</b> and interval graphs. The classical graph parameters that result this way are interval number, track number, linear arboricity, star arboricity, and caterpillar arboricity. As input graphs we consider graphs of bounded degeneracy, bounded degree, bounded tree-width or bounded simple tree-width, as well as outerplanar, planar bipartite, and planar graphs. For several pairs of an input class and a covering class we determine exactly the maximum ordinary, local, and folded covering number of an input graph with respect to that covering class...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: Group living confers fitness benefits but also incurs costs (Despland & Huu 2007). Many lepidopterans spend their larval stages as colonies, which may speed up their development (Shiga 1976; Rothman 1997). Gregarious caterpillars often maintain group cohesion, as well as recruit others to food sources, via silk trails marked with pheromone...|$|R

[...] Not much {{is known about}} the factors that lead to the initiation of <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> outbreaks, although some plausible mechanisms are higher temperatures in the spring, phenological synchrony with their host-plants, and reduced predation enemies [...] [...] Whatever the cause, outbreak densities give rise to cyclic population dynamics, characterized by highest fecundity at peak population density and reduced fecundity for several generations during decline.At low population densities, moths are found mating high above the ground, in the forest canopy. [...] Mating starts late in the day and copulations are short. [...] In contrast, during high-density outbreaks, mating takes place on lower vegetation, presumably because caterpillars descend to forage in less defoliated areas, where they form their pupae. [...] This high population density increases the operational sex ratio and significantly intensifies male-male competition. As a result, copulations begin earlier in the day and last longer in an attempt to minimize sperm competition. In addition, such high densities enhance female opportunities for being selective regarding males.|$|R

40|$|In closed-canopy forests, gap {{formation}} and closure {{are thought to}} be major drivers of forest dynamics. Crown defoliation by insects, however, may also influence understory resource levels and thus forest dynamics. We evaluate the effect of a <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> outbreak on understory light availability, soil nutrient levels and tree seedling height growth in six sites with contrasting levels of canopy defoliation in a hardwood forest in northern lower Michigan. We compared resource levels and seedling growth of six hardwood species before, during and in the three years after the outbreak (2008 - 2012). Canopy openness increased strongly during the <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> outbreak in the four moderately and severely defoliated sites, but not in lightly defoliated sites. Total inorganic soil nitrogen concentrations increased in response to the outbreak in moderately and severely defoliated sites. The increase in total inorganic soil nitrogen was driven by a strong increase in soil nitrate, and tended to become stronger with increasing site defoliation. Seedling height growth increased for all species in the moderately and severely defoliated sites, but not in lightly defoliated sites, either during the outbreak year or in the year after the outbreak. Growth increases did not become stronger with increasing site defoliation, but were strongest in a moderately defoliated site with high soil nutrient levels. Growth increases tended to be strongest for the shade intolerant species Fraxinus americana and Prunus serotina, and the shade tolerant species Ostrya virginiana. The strong growth response of F. americana and P. serotina suggests that recurring <b>forest</b> tent <b>caterpillar</b> outbreaks may facilitate the persistence of shade intolerant species in the understory in the absence of canopy gaps. Overall, our results suggest that recurrent canopy defoliation resulting from cyclical forest insect outbreaks may be an additional driver of dynamics in temperate closed-canopy forests...|$|R
