Woven fabrics have been specifically configured as a balanced weave thereby allowing systematic investigation of the effect of uniaxial tensile stress on the weave.

The characteristic of these fabrics is their specific weaving with selvedges on all four edges of the fabric. The fabric was woven from a course wool yarn of various densities in the weft direction using different weaves and weaving techniques, with a border created by weft thread at the beginning and <b>end</b> of <b>weaving.</b> This is the reason why the fabric looks embossed and compact and is easily recognisable amongst the old hand weaving in these regions.

50|$|Both {{the wires}} and the slots in the reed {{are known as}} dents (namely, teeth). The warp threads pass through the dents after going through the heddles and before {{becoming}} woven cloth.

One or more warp threads may go through each dent. The number of warp threads that go through each dent depends on the warp, and {{it is possible that the}} number of threads in each dent is not constant for a whole warp. The number of threads per dent might not be constant if the weaver alternates 2 and three threads per dent, in order to get a number of ends per inch that is 2.5 times the number of dents per inch, or if the thickness of the warp threads were to change at that point, and the fabric to have a thicker or thinner section.|$|R

The materials used {{are just as}} vague, other than stating wood or metal were used as building materials. The skein that comprised the spring, on the other hand, has been cited specifically as made of both animal sinew and hair, either women’s and horse. Heron and Vegetius consider sinew to be better, but Vitruvius cites women’s hair as preferable. The preferred type of sinews came from the feet of deer (assumedly achilles tendons because they were longest) and the necks of oxen (strong from constant yoking).

50|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{woven fabrics}} are fabrics {{that could be}} formed to near net shape with considerable thickness. There {{is no need for}} layering to create a part, because a single fabric provides the full three-dimensional reinforcement. The 3-D woven fabric is a variant of the 2D weaving process, and it’s an extension of the very old technique of creating double and triple woven cloth. 3D weaving allows the production of fabrics up to 10 cm in thickness.Fibers placed in the thickness direction are called z-yarn, warp weaver, or binder yarn for 3D woven fabrics. More than one layer of fabric is woven at the same time, and z-yarn interlaces warp and woof yarns of different layers during the process. At the <b>end</b> of the <b>weaving</b> process, an integrated 3D woven structure, which has a considerable thickness, is produced. Three-dimensional woven structures can create composite materials with fiber volume fractions around 50% in both 3D unit cell and 3D orthogonal structures.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{spinnability}} of sisal fibres treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and the potential utility of spun yarns in producing a woven fabric for different end uses. Exploratory and experimental approaches were utilised in gathering data for this project. Yarns were spun using a spinning wheel, and subsequently a portable weaving loom was used for weaving the fabric. Fabric softeners were applied on the woven fabric, and later fabrics were evaluated for hand and potential end uses. Major findings revealed that sisal fibres treated with NaOH were successfully spun into yarns using a traditional spinning wheel with the aid of a binding agent. Yarns spun from treated fibres were finer, weaker and highly absorbent. Flexural rigidity was the only significant fabric property that was decreased for fabric made from treated fibres compared to the control fabric. The application of fabric softeners had no significant effect on fabric hand. Subsequently, potential <b>end</b> uses of <b>woven</b> fabric were identified, which included apparel and accessories.

As bots extend and modify the functionality of sites like Wikipedia, but must be continuously operated on computers that are independent from the servers hosting the site, they involve alternative relations of power and code. Instead of taking for granted the pre-existing stability of Wikipedia as a platform, bots and other bespoke code require that we examine not only the software code itself, but also the concrete, historically contingent material conditions under which this code is run.

40|$|AbstractCongested {{conditions}} {{downstream from}} off-ramps often propagate upstream blocking all freeway lanes and affecting traffic {{that does not}} cause the bottleneck. Most efforts to understand this phenomenon have focused on how the queues form and propagate in the freeway, while scant {{attention has been paid}} to the causes of the formation of this type of queue. Exiting traffic often compete with traffic from surface streets for a limited capacity so that if part of this competing traffic is detoured to other streets the off-ramp will see its capacity increased. This paper studies this alternative by modeling what we consider fairly common conditions for the surrounding network. We propose a methodology to determine the flow of competing vehicles to be detoured to underutilized roads in the local network in order to improve the system's capacity and reduce total delays under stationary conditions. We also study the conditions under which this strategy may be beneficial during a rush hour period. The methodology aims at keeping the off-ramp flowing uncongested, eliminating the queue in the freeway and leaving the remaining capacity for the competing traffic. An experiment to test the mechanism was conducted on an urban freeway in Santiago, Chile confirming the opportunity for improvements in the system as a whole. It also showed that when the off-ramp <b>ends</b> in a <b>weaving</b> section, the capacity of this section drops significantly when both approaches reach congestion, emphasizing the importance of preventing these queues from appearing...|$|R
40|$|Esoteric {{and complex}} {{philosophical}} thought have been expressed by using textile terminology in India. The concept {{of time for}} instance is conveyed in the Rig-Veda, the oldest philosophical text, as the weaving of the warp and weft and thus the creation of days and nights. Tantra comes from the word tant, warp, and signifies that which stretches beyond. It is {{in this context that}} I present my paper, 2 ̆ 2 Woven Incantations 2 ̆ 2. The act of weaving in itself is a powerful act. The loin loom used by women throughout the world is strapped to the waist and the tension created by the body is linked with the inner rhythm. As the weaver inhales the tension is built and the weft is beaten into the warp and as she exhales she lifts the reed creating a shed for throwing the warp thread. One of the oldest looms used in Southern Laos uses the human body as the loom. The weaver sits on the floor with her legs stretched in front of her. The outer warp beam is stretched by pushing it out with the feet while the <b>weaving</b> <b>end</b> is strapped to the body. It is an extraordinary skilled operation, which uses the human body as a living yantra, the ancient word for the loom. The very act is like a form of yoga, which controls the bio-rhythm through controlled breathing and disciplined movement of the body, which goes into a state of 2 ̆ 2 dhayana 2 ̆ 2, meditation brought about by the rhythm of weaving echoing that of the body. The woven patterns emerge as a manifestation of introspective concentration. It is no wonder that the act of weaving is very closely linked with their rites of passage...|$|R

Wool was purified and scotched, shook up then it was painted in large boilers and laid on a sacking in a variety of patterns, mostly diamond and a cross shaped. Then they moistened it a little with hot water, wrapped, pressed by hand and knees, and hung up. Then again they pressed it, but mainly this was the business of young men.
