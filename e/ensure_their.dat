5|$|A {{friend of}} Ian Charleson and {{an admirer of}} his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to For Ian Charleson: A Tribute. A {{recording}} of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum. He also {{took part in the}} 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} for another war, the historic peace churches, represented by Friends who understood inner dealings of Washington D.C. politics, attempted to influence new draft bills to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> men could fulfill their duty in an alternative, non-military type of service. On June 20, 1940, the Burke-Wadsworth Bill came before Congress. The arrangements for conscientious objectors were {{almost identical to}} the World War I provisions.|$|E

5|$|In {{their last}} {{game of the}} League season, away to Sheffield United, Small Heath scored first when Foulkes' {{attempted}} clearance rebounded off his teammate Walter Hill into the net, and Mobley extended the lead after a break down the left by Hands. Although United came close to scoring from a second-half scrimmage when the ball appeared to cross the line, Small Heath held on to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> First Division survival with an unexpected victory.|$|E

5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} oil rigs {{in the path}} of the storm. The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost a}} century {{only a few of}} the texts were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> faithfulness to the originals.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as {{a good example of}} a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have been}} financially difficult to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E

5|$|In January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent {{ten days}} at the site {{analyzing}} the temples and making recommendations to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> long-term preservation. In June, Germany agreed to contribute $130,000 to UNESCO for {{the second phase of}} rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, microbiology, structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> survival. This suggestion was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes {{of members of the}} House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who were dominated by his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> election.|$|E

5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E
5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his {{plan of attack}} against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished to use his squadron's frigates in {{the assault on the}} city, the seas were too rough to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> safety close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions under the command of Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and the third group of boats would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} fishery is usually managed under the {{regulations}} of individual nations. In the United States all taking of queen conch is prohibited in Florida and in adjacent Federal waters. No international regional fishery management organization exists {{for the whole}} Caribbean area, but {{in places such as}} Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, queen conch is regulated {{under the auspices of the}} Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC). In 2014, the Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) included queen conch in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol). Species included in the Annex III require special measures to be taken to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> protection and recovery, and their use is authorised and regulated accordingly.|$|E

5|$|The sixteen contestants {{were divided}} into two tribes of eight: Tagi and Pagong. Both tribes fared equally in {{challenges}} but differed in organisational structure. Pagong was dominated by the younger, more carefree members, whereas four contestants on Tagi—Kelly, Richard, Rudy, and Susan—formed an alliance, choosing to vote as a voting bloc to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> safety. When ten players remained—five from each tribe—the tribes merged into one, named Rattana. The alliance strategy proved to be successful, and the four took advantage of the other contestants' lack of voting strategy to gain dominance. There was dissension in the alliance as Kelly was deemed untrustworthy, but she won four consecutive immunity challenges and was ineligible for elimination.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove {{had escaped}} the attentions of vandals until more recently, {{due to its}} lower {{political}} profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a circumferential cut through the bark, in addition to apparent shotgun damage. Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting to saw through one of its trunks, {{though it was not}} thought that the damage was serious enough to kill the affected trunk. As a precaution, in December 2015 arborists installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> stability. In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged trunk which are believed harsh enough to kill the trunk altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most North American institutions, the University of Toronto is a collegiate {{university}} with a {{model that}} resembles those of the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in Britain. The colleges hold substantial autonomy over admissions, scholarships, programs and other academic and financial affairs, {{in addition to the}} housing and social duties of typical residential colleges. The system emerged in the 19th century, as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to <b>ensure</b> <b>their</b> viability. The desire to preserve religious traditions in a secular institution resulted in the federative collegiate model that came to characterize the university.|$|E
