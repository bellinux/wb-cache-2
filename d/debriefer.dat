40|$|BACKGROUND: Performance {{feedback}} or <b>debriefing</b> {{in surgery}} is increasingly {{recognized as an}} essential means to optimize learning {{in the operating room}} (OR). However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence regarding the current practice and barriers to <b>debriefing</b> in the OR. METHODS: Phase 1 consisted of semistructured interviews with surgical trainers and trainees to identify features of an effective <b>debriefing</b> and perceived barriers to <b>debriefing.</b> Phase 2 consisted of ethnographic observations of surgical cases to identify current practice and observed barriers to <b>debriefing.</b> RESULTS: Surgical trainers and trainees identified key features of effective <b>debriefing</b> with regard to the approach and content; however, these were not commonly identified in practice. Culture was recognized as a significant barrier to <b>debriefing</b> across both phases of the study. CONCLUSIONS: There is a disparity between what the surgical community views as effective <b>debriefing</b> and actual <b>debriefing</b> practices in the OR.

40|$|<b>Debriefing,</b> the {{reflective}} activity following an experiential learning exercise, {{has been identified}} as {{the most important part of}} simulation learning and is also important for learning in other activities utilized in nursing education. There is general agreement that <b>debriefing</b> provides learning and improves performance. However, there is little specific evidence about the phenomenon of learning acquired during <b>debriefing,</b> including how it occurs, how it is defined and identified, and how it is evaluated by <b>debriefing</b> facilitators. In addition, there are no instruments or tools specifically measuring learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> Without practical and theoretically grounded tools, simulation activities will continue to lack the element of objective assessment necessary to move evidence-based teaching practices forward. A measure of learning acquired during <b>debriefing,</b> independent of a specific <b>debriefing</b> method and across <b>debriefing</b> types, will aid in the design of future simulation <b>debriefing</b> research that is both rigorous and feasible. To inform future tool development, I conducted a qualitative descriptive study to provide initial evidence regarding the learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> Following Institutional Review Board approval, I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews of nurse educators who facilitate <b>debriefing</b> in pre-licensure nursing programs. The interviews were transcribed and data analysis was completed to provide answers to the research questions using simple descriptive statistics, inductive reasoning processes and content analysis to interpret and structure meaning from the interviews. Study results included the nurse educators’ verbatim definitions of learning as well as simple descriptions of how they measured the learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> Qualitative themes emerging from the interviews describe how nurse educators recognize when students are learning during debriefing; these themes also describe activities that the nurse educators used to promote student learning during <b>debriefing.</b> Nurse educators identified that nursing students are learning during <b>debriefing</b> when they express what they have learned directly, connect past and present learning, plan for future practice experiences, share with peers, experience the “Ah-ha” moment, critically review their actions, display excitement and engagement during <b>debriefing,</b> apply their simulation learning in subsequent clinical and simulation experiences, and display learning in formal and informal assessments. Nurse educators described many activities they used to promote learning when they facilitated debriefings. These activities included utilizing simulation preparation activities, aligning their <b>debriefing</b> practices with a specific <b>debriefing</b> method or learning theory, utilizing intentional <b>debriefing,</b> establishing safety, maintaining a supportive demeanor, encouraging student-led <b>debriefing,</b> engaging the student learner, using <b>debriefing</b> aids, promoting recognition of learning, facilitating to the level of the learner, attending to the <b>debriefing</b> environment, and providing post-debriefing activities. I will use the results of this study to inform future development of an instrument intended to measure learning acquired during <b>debriefing.</b> This study also provides many insights into how nurse educators can facilitate learning during <b>debriefing</b> for pre-licensure nursing student...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: THE COMPETENCY PROFILE OF A TRAUMA <b>DEBRIEFER</b> IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE SERVICE: Trauma {{debriefing}} {{interventions are}} done in the South African Police Service to prevent the onset of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The existing trauma debriefing team rendering this service consists of psychologists, social workers and chaplains. There is currently no selection model or procedure available to select successful trauma debriefers and evidently not all professionals can automatically function effectively in a trauma work environment. The need has thus arisen to develop a competency profile of a successful trauma <b>debriefer</b> from which a selection battery can be develop. Before a profile can be compiled, a job analysis {{has to be done}} to discover the competencies of a trauma <b>debriefer.</b> For {{the purpose of this study}} the functional job analysis method was used and it can be described as: "Who performs what action for wat reason with which tools, equipment or job aids following what instructions. " The information gathered from questionnaires to debriefers, questionnaires to victims of trauma, the critical incident method and a focus group were used to compile a job description for a trauma <b>debriefer.</b> Information was also obtained regarding the competency potential of a successful trauma <b>debriefer</b> specifically concerning knowledge (capacity) and personality traits (dispositions). Ten different trauma <b>debriefer</b> competencies were identified and discussed in conjunction with the mentioned competency potential. The given profile can now form the basis for the development of a selection battery for a successful trauma <b>debriefer.</b> AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Trauma-ontlonting in die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie diens word gedoen om Posttraumatiese Stresversteuring sover moontlik te voorkom. Trauma-ontlonters, wat uit sielkundiges, maatskaplike werkers en kapelane bestaan, word gebruik om die diens te lewer. Daar bestaan egter geen keuringsmodel vir die keuring van die traumaontlonters nie. Die literatuur en die praktyk het dit bewys dat nie alle professionele persone noodwendig effektiewe traumawerkers is nie. Die nodigheid het dus ontstaan om 'n bevoegdheidsprofiel van 'n suksesvolle ontlonter saam te stel en daaruit 'n keuringsbattery te ontwikkel. Alvorens 'n profiel saamgestel kan word, moet 'n posontleding gedoen word om inligting oor die bevoegdhede van die trauma-ontlonter te bekom. Vir die doeleindes van hierdie studie is die funksionele posontledingsmetode gebruik wat beskryf kan word as: "Who perform what action for what reason with what tools, equipment or job aid following what instruction. " Om die inligting te bekom is van vraelyste aan ontlonters, vraelyste aan getraumatiseerde lede, kritieke insident metode en 'n fokusgroep gebruik gemaak.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> on task management of anesthesiologist assistant students {{through the use of}} high-fidelity anesthesia crisis simulation scenarios. This information describes an evaluation of student learning that is valuable in student educational and workplace competency. Method: A total of 18 graduate students in an anesthesiologist assistant program voluntarily participated in two anesthesia simulation scenarios separated by one of two <b>debriefing</b> methods (oral <b>debriefing</b> versus video-aided oral <b>debriefing).</b> Task management scores of the scenarios were assessed through the Anesthetists’ Nontechnical Skills system. Task management scores after the pre-intervention scenario were compared to the scores after the post-intervention scenario. The effectiveness of video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> was studied using a within-subjects analysis. The comparison of video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> to oral <b>debriefing</b> was examined with a between-subjects analysis. Results: The results showed a significant improvement in the intervention group from the initial assessment to the subsequent assessment in task management (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). However, results did not show a statistically significant difference between the two <b>debriefing</b> methods after a second anesthesia crisis scenario (p= 0. 21). Conclusion: The research study found that task management during anesthesia crisis scenarios improved after video-aided oral <b>debriefing.</b> No difference was found when comparing the improvement in task management between <b>debriefing</b> methods. Therefore, video-aided oral <b>debriefing</b> was comparable to oral <b>debriefing</b> in improving task management in this study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> in maritime training. For this purpose, the scope was divided into two focal areas: the process of post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> and instructions in post-simulation <b>debriefing.</b> For each focal area, three research questions have been formulated and used as a support to give the study direction. In the matter of the process of post-simulation <b>debriefing,</b> the aim of the research questions was to identify the structural components of the <b>debriefing</b> process. As for the instructions in post-simulation-debriefing, the aim was to understand how the subject was taught. Theory: The theoretical background presents a panoramic view of <b>debriefing,</b> which includes the origin and concept of <b>debriefing,</b> the process of <b>debriefing</b> as well as the critical aspects of <b>debriefing.</b> As for the origin and concept of <b>debriefing,</b> the theoretical background depicts how historical roots have shaped various concepts of <b>debriefing.</b> Subsequently, an assortment of various conceptual frameworks, models and strategies provides perspectives on the process of <b>debriefing.</b> Henceforth, the subsection titled “critical aspects of debriefing” describe crucial features of previous research. This section presents perspective on instruction, elements of <b>debriefing,</b> how concepts and elements of <b>debriefing</b> can be understood, teaching in <b>debriefing</b> and standards of best practice, leadership in <b>debriefing</b> as well as a view of the contemporary position of previous research. Method: This study chose an educational environment of maritime training using Bridge Operations Simulators. Exercises or tasks were conducted in these simulators, where the <b>debriefing</b> sessions were held after a simulation-based exercise or task. This study was an extension of a research project and focused on approximately 16 hours of video data, where each video clip was between 2 - 12 minutes, involving three instructors at different occasions and in total involved 10 - 20 students. The study had an inductive approach, used video as a data collection method and was based on an observational approach. The data material was systematically managed, where the selected data was based on the relevance of the research objectives. Subsequently, the analysis method consisted of procedures in the shape of coding and transcripts. Results: The study resulted in several findings. First, the structure of post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> in maritime training consisted of both a general process as well as a specific process. The general process included three main phases, such as the initial phase, the central phase and the final phase. In turn, each phase involved several key steps that formed the specific process of post-simulation <b>debriefing.</b> These key steps emerged as the introduction of the <b>debriefing</b> session, overviewing the simulation-based exercise, framing and defining the problem, specifying the simulation-based scenarios, problem analysis and problem solutions, key lessons and summaries, the closures of <b>debriefing</b> and finally, the purposes with and goals in <b>debriefing.</b> Despite this, during the <b>debriefing</b> process, procedures that involved instructional guidance, the contrasts between general and specific information as well as various forms of generalizations were prominent features. As a consequence, these procedures verified that the various practices, for instance, troubleshooting, evaluation and generalizations, consistently occurred. It confirmed that the key steps in post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> process, in its consecutive order, were not affirmed. Rather, the process of post-simulation <b>debriefing</b> was flexible and consisted of versatility...|$|R

At least 1 member of nursing staff was released from clinical duties to participate in the session. Other allied professionals were encouraged to attend. Each session required 1 confederate, 1 <b>debriefer</b> and 1 person to run the manikin. Scenarios were designed to explore both technical and non-technical aspects of the topic and were delivered in an ICU side-room that is permanently set up with a manikin. Debriefing was provided using the ´good judgement´ model. Quantitative and qualitative feedback was sought after each session 1.

40|$|Introduction: Simulation is {{an active}} {{learning}} strategy used in health care education to reinforce skill and behavior acquisition. To achieve the desired learning objectives, simulation experiences must have a purposeful design including sound pre-briefing and debriefing strategies. Purpose: This platform will present {{an example of a}} patient simulation performed in a hybrid musculoskeletal physical therapy course including the development and adaption to a hybrid course. Description of Innovation: Students engaged in a 3 -part hybrid simulation experience consisting of online prebriefing, face-to-face simulation and debriefing, and online reflection with individual feedback. Prebriefing consisted of a posted patient case complete with pertinent medical history documents. The face-to-face patient interactions and debriefings were performed by course instructors who served as both standardized patient and <b>debriefer.</b> In the face-to-face portion, students received immediate feedback on performance. The final step included documentation and future planning for the patient with individual instructor feedback. The simulation experience was aligned with the demands of the course’s final assessment: a triple jump practical examination. Outcomes: Course outcomes, strengths and weakness of the experience, and student perceptions will be presented. Discussion: Simulation can enrich traditional classroom strategies by purposefully engaging students in scenarios that enhance psychomotor skills, affective behaviors, and clinical reasoning in a low risk environment. Student achievement on course assessments and realization of course objectives are potential benefits of including simulation in a musculoskeletal physical therapy course...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Psychological {{debriefing}} is {{a crisis}} intervention for use {{with people who are}} exposed to stressful events within their work. Research on crisis interventions is controversial, and further studies in this field are important to establish appropriate interventions for emergency workers. Debriefing has become an area for debate due to evidence of its benefits showing beneficial and negative outcomes, or no outcome at all. This study aims to qualitatively investigate the experience of the role of Critical Incident <b>Debriefer</b> in a Fire and Rescue Service in the North West of England. METHODS OF RESEARCH: A phenomenological approach was used to collect data via Collaborative Inquiry (CI) group meetings with the debriefers. The recorded CI meetings were transcribed into text and the transcripts were analysed using applied thematic analysis. A reflective diary was utilised to keep experiences, thoughts, feelings and opinions visible and an acknowledged part of the research. RESULTS: Review and analysis of the participants’ experiences identified six themes; policy concerns; organisational concerns; CID training; psycho-education; culture and the future of CID. CONCLUSION: These findings identified positive and negative elements of the CID process from the perspective of debriefers. Attitudes towards CID appear to be improving, however, debriefers feel they do not receive appropriate training, which corresponds with the findings of the Cochrane Review (2002) and suicide within the fire service is a serious concern...|$|E

RECENT FINDINGS There is {{a general lack of}} standardization in terminology and methods used for <b>debriefing</b> that limits evaluation. <b>Debriefing</b> interventions generally take two different formats. Hot <b>debriefing</b> is one where individuals or teams are provided with <b>debriefing</b> immediately after the event. Although perhaps the most widely used and easiest to implement, research evidence for its effectiveness is scant. Cold <b>debriefing,</b> where individuals or teams are provided with feedback sometime after the event, is associated with improvements in process and patient outcomes. Such feedback usually involves the use of objective performance data, such as defibrillator downloads or videotape records. Before and after cohort studies have found that both verbal <b>debriefing</b> in groups and individual written feedback seem to be associated with an improvement in performance. SUMMARY <b>Debriefing</b> is a useful strategy to improve resuscitation performance, but the optimal delivery method remains unclear. Future high-quality research is required to identify the most effective form of <b>debriefing...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAim of the studyTo {{explore the}} concept of <b>debriefing</b> {{bystanders}} after participating in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation attempt including (1) bystanders’ most commonly addressed reactions after participating in a resuscitation attempt when receiving <b>debriefing</b> from medical dispatchers; (2) their perception of effects of receiving <b>debriefing</b> and (3) bystanders’ recommendations for a systematic <b>debriefing</b> concept. MethodsQualitative study based on telephone <b>debriefing</b> to bystanders and interviews with bystanders who received <b>debriefing.</b> Data was analyzed using the phenomenological approach. ResultsSix themes emerged from analysis of <b>debriefing</b> audio files: (1) identification of OHCA; (2) emotional and perceptual experience with OHCA; (3) collaboration with healthcare professionals; (4) patients outcome; (5) coping with the experience and (6) general reflections. When evaluating the concept, bystanders expressed positive short term effect of receiving <b>debriefing</b> and a retention of this effect after two months. Recommendations for a future <b>debriefing</b> concept were given. ConclusionDebriefing by emergency medical dispatchers to OHCA bystanders stimulates reflection, positively influencing the {{ability to cope with}} the emotional reactions and the cognitive perception of own performance and motivates improvement of CPR skills. Importantly, it increases confidence to provide CPR in the future. Implementation of telephone <b>debriefing</b> to bystanders at Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres is a low complexity and a low cost intervention though the logistic challenges have to be considered...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{discusses}} {{the process of}} co-constructing a prototype pedagogical model for working with youth from socially vulnerable backgrounds. Participants and settings: This six-month activist research project was conducted in a soccer program in a socially vulnerable area of Brazil in 2013. The study included 17 youths, 4 coaches, a pedagogic coordinator and a social worker. An expert in student-centered pedagogy and inquiry-based activism assisted as a <b>debriefer</b> helping in the progressive data analysis and the planning of the work sessions. Data collection/analysis: Multiple sources of data were collected, including 38 field journal/observation and audio records of: 18 youth work sessions, 16 coaches’ work sessions, 3 combined coaches and youth work sessions, and 37 meetings between the researcher and the expert. Findings: The process of co-construction of this prototype pedagogical model was divided into three phases. The first phase involved the youth and coaches identifying barriers to sport opportunities in their community. In the second phase, the youth, coaches and researchers imagined alternative possibilities to the barriers identified. In the final phase, we worked collaboratively to create realistic opportunities for the youth to begin to negotiate some of the barriers they identified. In this phase, the coaches and youth designed an action plan to implement (involving a Leadership Program) aimed at addressing the youths’ needs in the sport program. Five critical elements of a prototype pedagogical model were co-created through the first two processes and four learning aspirations emerged in the last phase of the project. Implications: We suggest an activist approach of co-creating a pedagogical model of sport for working with youth from socially vulnerable backgrounds is beneficial. That is, creating opportunities for youth to learn to name, critique and negotiate barriers to their engagement in sport {{in order to create}} empowering possibilities...|$|E
40|$|Program evaluators are {{sometimes}} requested {{to help their}} clients identify ways to use evaluation findings, but little guidance for this task has been provided in the literature. How might evaluators grapple with this dilemma? This article discusses the use of peer debriefing as a method for helping evaluators during {{the final stage of}} the evaluation of a curriculum in a school of a large state university and presents the implications of these findings for program evaluators and qualitative researchers. The authors employ an impressionist tale format to discuss the impact of the peer debriefing process on the peer <b>debriefer,</b> the principal investigator, and the project director. The method is found to be helpful to evaluators who face issues of roles, the use of expertise, and interpersonal dynamics. &dquo;Debriefing is a useful-if sobering-experience to which to subject oneself; its utility, when properly engaged, is unquestionable. &dquo; (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 309) Program evaluators, like qualitative researchers, often are faced with dilemmas as they complete their studies. They commonly grapple with questions about how their findings should be presented to their clients, how political realities within client organizations might influence the use of the findings, and how they can exit studies in a caring and graceful manner. What is the role of evaluators as projects end, and how can they help their clients explore the use of evaluation findings effectively? One way to assist both evaluators and researchers with these dilemmas is through peer debriefing (see Lincoln & Guba, 1985), a process that has seldom been used for this purpose. We discuss the use of peer debriefing at the end Authors ’ Note: The paper on which this article is based was originally presented at th...|$|E

40|$|Early {{data from}} North America {{supports}} {{the use of}} educational cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> as a strategy {{to improve the quality}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the hospital setting. As some <b>debriefing</b> approaches are challenging to deliver in the NHS setting, there was a need to develop <b>debriefing</b> approaches that are both effective and suited to NHS working practices. This thesis is modelled on the Medical Research Council framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Undertaken between October 2011 and January 2015, it describes the development and feasibility assessment of three cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> approaches, which were specifically designed to be deliverable in NHS hospitals. Development work comprised three work packages (systematic review, process evaluation, qualitative study). These studies provided evidence to support the use of cardiac arrest <b>debriefing,</b> but showed that weekly group <b>debriefing</b> is undeliverable in many NHS hospitals. Through qualitative work, I identified six distinct mechanisms by which <b>debriefing</b> may affect clinical practice. Synthesis of these data led to the development of three cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> approaches (monthly group <b>debriefing,</b> individual oral <b>debriefing,</b> written feedback). We tested the feasibility of delivering these interventions by implementing them in three NHS hospitals (one intervention per hospital). In a before/after study, it was demonstrated that, despite practical challenges, interventions were deliverable in NHS hospitals. However, they were found to have no effect on either CPR quality or patient outcome. This finding was attributed to high performance in study hospitals at baseline. This thesis demonstrates that the developed cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> interventions are deliverable in NHS hospitals. It has also generated important new theory about the mechanisms by which <b>debriefing</b> may affect clinical practice. This thesis lays the foundation for future work to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these cardiac arrest <b>debriefing</b> interventions...|$|R
