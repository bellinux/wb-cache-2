40|$|As plenary speaker for the ASIS&T 2010 Annual Meeting, Lucy Suchman based her {{presentation}} on a reference by author N. Katherine Hayles asserting that information {{has lost its}} body. Efforts to restore information’s body must recognize the references and context of the information to bring the information back {{to a point of}} meaning. In exploring the importance of context for meaningful information, Suchman drew comparisons to the human work behind information, the agent critical to initiate an action, the work meaningful through indirect interactions with an object at a distance. She made further parallels to conversations with a disembodied <b>head,</b> <b>remote</b> control warfare and robotic health care – all interactions with machines, but with humans as invisible agents. Communications research, Suchman indicated, must be mindful of the connection between information and its body in order to fully understand information content. Steve Hardi...|$|E
40|$|The module has a movable {{vibrator}} head (2) with {{at least}} two plates (6, 8). One plate (8) carries a holder (10) for parts or tools. The two plates are parallel to a base of the vibrator <b>head</b> <b>remote</b> from the workpiece and are driven in oscillation along a longitudinal direction so that the tool holder vibrates in a plane. Each plate has a through opening (18, 20) for a rotary drive connection from the holder to a drive unit (24) {{on the other side of}} the plate from the workpiece. The plate on the workpiece side rotatably encloses the holder. The plates can be positioned wrt. each other and the head base for fine positioning. The positioning and oscillating drives for the plates are each provided by lifting magnets (28, 30) interacting with a sprung return device (36, 38).

5000|$|The Spidercam {{operates}} {{with four}} motorized winches positioned at each corner {{at the base}} of the covered area, each of which controls a Kevlar cable connected to a gyro-stabilized camera-carrier, or dolly. By controlling the winding and unwinding of the cables, the system allows the dolly to reach any position in the three-dimensional space. The inputs of the Spidercam [...] "pilot" [...] are processed by software which forwards the commands to the winches via fiber optic cables. Two of the Kevlar cables also have fiber optic cables woven into them to carry commands to the camera and the <b>remote</b> <b>head,</b> and bring the camera's high definition signal back to the control station. The <b>remote</b> <b>head,</b> which houses the camera, provides pan and tilt movement and includes the lens remote which controls focus, zoom and irising.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Community-acquired {{recurrent}} {{bacterial meningitis}} in adults {{is a relatively}} rare disease. All previous data were derived from small retrospective case series. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated episodes of recurrent bacterial meningitis in a nationwide cohort study in The Netherlands. RESULTS: Thirty-four episodes of recurrent bacterial meningitis were identified among 31 patients; 3 patients experienced 2 episodes during the study period. The mean age was 43 years, and 25 (74 %) of 34 episodes occurred in men. Predisposing conditions were involved in 26 (77 %) of 34 episodes; the most common predisposing conditions were <b>remote</b> <b>head</b> injury (17 [53 %] of 32 episodes) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (9 [32 %] of 28 episodes). Lumbar puncture revealed an individual CSF indicator of bacterial meningitis for almost all episodes (88 %). The outcome was death for 5 (15 %) of 34 episodes; 1 additional patient had a suboptimal score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. CONCLUSION: We conclude that most patients with recurrent meningitis are male and have predisposing conditions, which, in most cases, are <b>remote</b> <b>head</b> injury or CSF leakag...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The <b>remote</b> <b>head</b> for controllably discarding a cut to length fiber strand, comprises a roller conveying device (2), a first transport channel (4) arranged in conveying direction towards the roller conveying device, with a guidance for an endless fiber strand, where the transport channel comprises an opening (3) in which a separation unit (5) arranged on the height of the opening is interfered for cutting the fiber strand, and a second transport channel arranged in the conveying direction, where both transport channels are moved relative to each other in the conveying direction. The separation unit for discarding the fiber strand is arranged on the height of a column formed through the relative movement of both parts of the channels. A mixing chamber (6) for impregnating the fiber strand is arranged to the transport channel and has a feed line for a matrix material for impregnating the fiber strand. The mixing chamber is dimensioned so that the part of the transport channel turned in conveying direction of the mixing chamber is guidable in the mixing chamber in positive-fit manner. An inlet opening (3) for air is provided between the roller conveying device and the transport channel in the wall of the transport channel and/or in the mixing chamber.
