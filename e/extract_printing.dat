50|$|Godwin began {{thinking}} about Political Justice in 1791, {{after the publication}} of Thomas Paine's Rights of Man in response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). However, unlike most of the works that Burke's work spawned in the ensuing Revolution Controversy, Godwin's did not address the specific political events of the day; it addressed the underlying philosophical principles. Its length and expense (it cost over £1) made it inaccessible to the popular audience of the Rights of Man and probably protected Godwin from the persecution that other writers such as Paine experienced. Nevertheless, Godwin became a revered figure among radicals and was seen as an intellectual leader among their groups. One way in which this happened is through the many unauthorized copies of the text, the <b>extracts</b> <b>printed</b> by radical journals, and the lectures John Thelwall gave based on its ideas.|$|R
50|$|The orchestrator is told {{in advance}} {{the number of}} {{instruments}} {{he or she has}} to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a Romantic music era-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget independent film may only be able to afford a 20 performer chamber orchestra or a jazz quartet. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically <b>extracted,</b> <b>printed,</b> and delivered to the scoring stage.|$|R

Extraction techniques presented in this study could be applicable to other PWA geometries with similar locking devices. Ground-based extractions also benefit from the techniques and extraction tool requirements presented in the study.

40|$|Access {{control systems}} using {{biometric}} identification readers are becoming common within critical infrastructure and other high security applications. There {{is a perception}} that biometric, due {{to their ability to}} identify and validate the user, are more secure. However, biometric systems are vulnerable to many categories of attack vectors and there has been restricted research into such defeat vulnerabilities. This study expands on a past article (Brooks, 2009) that presented a defeat evaluation methodology applied to high-security biometric readers. The defeat methodology is represented, but applied to both fingerprint and back-of-hand biometric readers. Defeat evaluation included both physical and technical integrity testing, considering zero-effort to adversarial complex attacks. In addition, the evaluation considered the whole device and not just the biometric extraction and storage device. The study found a number of common vulnerabilities in the various types of biometric readers. Vulnerabilities included the ability to spoof optical readers with another person’s <b>extracted</b> <b>print,</b> use of inanimate objects to enrol and validate, defeat of live detection and the ability to by-pass the biometric reader. Optical sensors appeared the least secure, with capacitive the most secure. An awareness of the vulnerabilities and limitations of biometric readers need to be propagated, as such readers should not be considered high-security by default. A...|$|R

40|$|Ligand-dependent {{activation}} of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway leads to a diverse array of biological and toxicological effects. The best-studied ligands for the AhR include polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, the most potent of which is 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). However, as new AhR ligands are identified and characterized, their structural and physiochemical diversity continues to expand. Our identification of AhR agonists in crude extracts from diverse materials raises questions as to the magnitude and extent of human exposure to AhR ligands through normal daily activities. We have found that solvent extracts of newspapers from {{countries around the world}} stimulate the AhR signaling pathway. AhR agonist activity was observed for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol, and water <b>extracts</b> of <b>printed</b> newspaper, unprinted virgin paper, and black printing ink, where {{activation of}} luciferase reporter gene expression was transient, suggesting that the AhR active chemical(s) was metabolically labile.
