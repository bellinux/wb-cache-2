30|$|When a DC side fault occurs, the insulated-gate bipolar {{transistors}} of the inverter will be blocked under self-protection. At this time, the capacitor voltage Udc {{is greater than}} the peak value of the inter-phase voltage of the AC side. Additionally, the AC side system cannot supply power to the DC side system through the <b>free-wheel</b> <b>diodes.</b> The DC side system can be regarded as a circuit structure in which the capacitor discharges to the short-circuit point. After the capacitor voltage drops below the peak value of the inter-phase voltage of the AC side, the <b>free-wheel</b> <b>diodes</b> will turn on, and will most likely be damaged by the fault current [3]. Therefore, the SI-FCL that provides ample time for the breaker to clear the fault should limit the fault current and delay the voltage drop time of the capacitor before the <b>free-wheel</b> <b>diodes</b> turns on.|$|R

The switching characteristics and losses are investigated under different parameters both in a hardware and a simulation.

40|$|High-speed {{permanent}} magnet (PM) brushless dc (BLDC) motor often needs a continuous rotor position signal for dynamic phase-advancing control, whist {{such kind of}} position signal cannot be directly obtained from the conventional Hall effect sensors or via the traditional back-EMF-based sensorless control strategy. Furthermore, during high-speed operation, the inverter <b>free-wheeling</b> <b>diodes</b> may conduct for more than 30 elec-deg, obscuring the back-EMF zero- crossings. Hence, the traditional back-EMF-based sensorless control strategy becomes unworkable. To overcome these problems, a new sensorless control method is proposed in this paper.

40|$|Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) {{are popular}} power {{electronic}} switching devices with several advantages. However, {{they have been}} known to fail in the field when subjected to significant variations in power dissipation – known as power cycling. In the work presented here, a novel alternating-current (AC) power cycling test method for IGBTs together with their <b>free-wheeling</b> <b>diodes</b> is proposed and verified. A review of previous work revealed that the parameter that most affects IGBT lifetime under power cycling conditions is the variation in its junction-case temperature difference. Through simulation, the behaviour of a conventional single phase inverter (H-bridge) using simple pulse width modulation (PWM) control was quantified, and the effect of switching frequency and load power factor was studied. Results of the simulations and literature review were used to develop design criteria for a new AC test circuit. The new AC test circuit (a modified version of the conventional H-bridge) was then designed and its performance compared to the criteria and to the simulation results of the conventional circuit. The circuit was then built and its performance was validated. The circuit complied with the performance criteria, in particular the desired variation in 7 jc, to an adequate degree of accuracy. The proposed test circuit is novel for several reasons. The stresses on devices used in a conventional H-bridge using a high power factor inductive load are reproduced using a low power factor inductive load, considerably reducing the energy cost of running such a test. IGBT switching losses are not actively reduced, as is normal practice, but instead are actively increased to generate the required losses. <b>Free-wheeling</b> <b>diodes</b> are also tested, but do not have significant switching losses, as the nature of the test circuit dictates that these be transferred to the IGBTs. The main drawback of the proposed test circuit is that a larger number of devices are needed; however, this tradeoff is necessary to obtain the energy cost savings provided by this circuit...|$|R

40|$|After a brief {{introduction}} about {{fuel cell}} systems, and their modelling, this paper proposes a possible solution to emulate a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM-FC) system {{by using a}} DC-DC buck converter. The fuel cell system, including all its auxiliaries and related control systems, is emulated by a buck converter realized experimentally and controlled in the DSPACE environment. The realization of the buck converter allows the behaviour of any fuel cells to be easily emulated since only the modification of the control law of the switch is necessary. The proposed emulator can be applied easily to other fuel cell systems if the polarization curve has the same current rate and maximum power. In this way {{it is possible to}} utilize the converter and perform the necessary tests to optimize a fuel cell system by avoiding the waste of hydrogen and the purchase of cells as well as any cell damage. With regard to current other types of emulators, the one presented here has the following characteristics: (1) all the auxiliaries of the system have been considered, each including its own control system, as in a real FCS, (2) the converter is a classical buck converter with a <b>free-wheeling</b> <b>diode</b> and is designed to have a high bandwidth and to be practically always in conduction mode (discontinuous mode appears only at very low currents) (3) the voltage control is made by a space-state controller, able to fix properly the closed loop poles of the system, thus guaranteeing the desired bandwidth of the control system and (4) it can be used in laboratory as a stand-alone low-cost system for design and experimental purposes.

The feasibility of this approach has already been shown, however, a sophisticated control method is required for applying it in applications with varying currents, temperature and device parameters.

40|$|SiC Schottky Barrier diodes (SiC SBD) {{are known}} to oscillate/ring in the output {{terminal}} when used as <b>free-wheeling</b> <b>diodes</b> in voltage-source converters. This ringing is due to RLC resonance among the diode capacitance, parasitic resistance, and circuit stray inductance. In this paper, a model has been developed for calculating the switching energy of SiC diodes {{as a function of}} the switching rate (dIDS/dt of the commutating SiC MOSFET) and temperature. It is shown that the damping of the oscillations increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing dIDS/dt. This in turn determines the switching energy of the diode, which initially decreases with decreasing dIDS/dt and subsequently increases with decreasing dIDS/dt thereby indicating an optimal dIDS/dt for minimum switching energy. The total switching energy of the diode can be subdivided into three phases namely the current switching phase, the voltage switching phase, and the ringing phase. Although the switching energy in the current switching phase decreases with increasing switching rate, the switching energy of the voltage and ringing phase increases with the switching rate.

This paper presents a converter using a gate drive with a negative biased gate voltage on the low-side FET to improve the dV/dt robustness. The resulting much larger voltage drop during the dead time conduction is a concern as it can quickly overcharge the bootstrap capacitor voltage. This paper demonstrates that with a negative biased gate voltage, {{the rise in the}} bootstrap capacitor voltage is predominantly caused by the change in effective dead time conduction due to a variation in output load. A spice model to estimate the change is presented and verified. This paper also found that a change in the bootstrap capacitor voltage must be prevented as it leads to a significant change in turn-on dynamics, resulting in higher dV/dt stress with an increase in output load.
