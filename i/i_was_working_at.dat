2500|$|On October 9, 2007, Weitz {{revealed}} that the final three chapters from Northern Lights had been moved to the film's potential sequel, The Subtle Knife, {{in order to provide}} [...] "the most promising conclusion to the first film and the best possible beginning to the second," [...] though he also said less than a month later that there had been [...] "tremendous marketing pressure" [...] to create [...] "an upbeat ending." [...] (The San Francisco Chronicle found this [...] "truncated" [...] ending abrupt.) [...] Author Pullman publicly supported these changes, saying that [...] "every film has to make changes to the story that the original book tells— not to change the outcome, but to make it fit the dimensions and the medium of film". In addition to removing the novel's unsettling ending, the film reverses the order in which Lyra travels to Bolvangar, the Gobbler's outpost, and then Svalbard, the armoured bears' kingdom. (Neither deviation from the book features in Scholastic Publishing's The Golden Compass: The Story of the Movie novelization.) In July 2009, Weitz told a Comic Con audience that the film had been [...] "recut by , and my experience with it ended being quite a terrible one”; he also told Time.com that he had felt that by [...] "being faithful to the book <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> odds with the studio". In 2011, Pullman told an audience at the British Humanist Association annual conference that he was also disappointed by this decision, and hoped that a director's cut of the film would be released some day including the footage cut by New Line.|$|E

He has sided {{with me on this}} new conception of the fugue, especially the expositions. He loved its little harmonies". The suite was finished on September 6, and thanks to his current notoriety he was able to sell it to Rouart, Lerolle & Cie three days later. It was published soon afterwards.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Murdstone and Grinby's {{in the same}} common way, and with the same common companions, and with {{the same sense of}} unmerited {{degradation}} as at first. But I never, happily for me no doubt, made a single acquaintance, or spoke to any of the many boys whom I saw daily in going to the warehouse, in coming from it, and in prowling about the streets at meal-times. I led the same secretly unhappy life; but I led it in the same lonely, self-reliant manner. The only changes I am conscious of are, firstly, that I had grown more shabby, and secondly, that I was now relieved of much of the weight of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber's cares; for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their present pass, and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived for a long while out of it. I used to breakfast with them now, in virtue of some arrangement, of which I have forgotten the details. I forget, too, at what hour the gates were opened in the morning, admitting of my going in; but I know that I was often up at six o'clock, and that my favourite lounging-place in the interval was old London Bridge, where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses, watching the people going by, or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water, and lighting up the golden flame {{on the top of the}} Monument. The Orfling met me here sometimes, to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and the Tower; of which I can say no more than that I hope I believed them myself. In the evening I used to go back to the prison, and walk up and down the parade with Mr. Micawber; or play casino with Mrs. Micawber, and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama. Whether Mr. Murdstone knew where I was, I am unable to say. I never told them at Murdstone and Grinby's.|$|E

60|$|But now, on reflection, {{a dreadful}} sinking assails me, {{that this was}} not really work.

My so-called labours were just M'Connachie running away with me again. Still, I have sometimes worked; for instance, I feel that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> this moment.
