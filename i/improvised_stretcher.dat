5|$|His career ended unhappily on Australia's {{first ever}} tour to the West Indies. He took match figures of 2/126 in the First Test in Kingston, Jamaica in a high-scoring win. These {{were to be}} his last Test wickets as he took a total of 0/60 in the Second Test in Trinidad. He was {{retained}} for the Third Test but injured himself early in the match while fielding and neither batted nor bowled. He was injured for the next month and missed the Fourth Test but returned for the Fifth. Early {{on the first day}} he suffered yet another knee injury as he changed direction while attempting to catch a Clyde Walcott pull shot. His teammates Alan Davidson and Peter Burge removed a bench from the dressing room wall and used it as an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> to carry Johnston from the ground; his Test career ended without bowling or batting in either of his last two matches. His final Test wicket had been that of Glendon Gibbs in the second innings of the First Test. In six first-class matches for the tour, he managed only nine wickets at 51.00.|$|E
500|$|Lying in the {{aircraft}} for some two hours, {{he was found}} by two patrolling British Army soldiers and carried two miles (3km) on an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> made of their Enfield rifles and Army issue winter coats—made after instruction from Lock. By this point, Lock had lost so much blood that he was unconscious, and so unable to feel the additional pain of being dropped three times, once into a dyke of water. After being transferred to the Princess Mary’s Hospital at RAF Halton, {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 17 December 1940, the citation read: ...|$|E
2500|$|The ranges were {{explored}} more thoroughly {{in the first}} half of the 20th century: the Greenwood family, pastoralists in the area, had explored the edges in the twenties and thirties, discovering Fern Chasm, but it was not until expeditions by Warren Bonython and others in the late 1940s that the Plateau and main central ranges were investigated and explored. On Bonython's first journey onto the Blue Range in 1946 several kilometres south of Benbonyathe Hill, one of his two companions, Bob Crocker, slipped and broke his leg, which resulted in Bonython walking more than twenty kilometres to Balcanoona station to organise a rescue effort: in the end Bob was carried off the [...] high range by <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> in a seven-hour marathon.|$|E
50|$|In {{wilderness}} or combat conditions, it may {{first be}} necessary to stabilize the patient prior to moving them to avoid causing further injury. In such situations, evacuation may involve carrying the victim some distance on <b>improvised</b> <b>stretchers,</b> a travois, or other improvised carrying gear.|$|R
50|$|A {{party of}} seven searchers located Hull and Cole {{early on the}} 18th. Using <b>improvised</b> <b>stretchers,</b> they were brought to Glen Valley. Hull began to recover but little hope was held for Cole, who was delirious and badly frostbitten. Cole died late {{on the night of}} the 19th.|$|R
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans <b>improvised</b> <b>stretchers</b> from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|R
60|$|The {{arrival of}} M. le Comte de Cambray, {{accompanied}} by a doctor and two men carrying an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher,</b> broke the spell of silence that had fallen on this strange scene of pathetic failure which seemed but an humble counterpart of that great and irretrievable one which was being enacted at this same hour far away {{on the road to}} Genappe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suddenly {{round the}} corner of the house a group of men appeared, as though they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the grass, in a compact body, bearing an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> in their midst. Instantly, in the {{emptiness}} of the landscape, a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, streams of human beings--of naked human beings--with spears in their hands, with bows, with shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into the clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook, the grass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive immobility.|$|E
60|$|Meantime, {{the exodus}} had begun. Carretas full of ladies and {{children}} rolled swaying across the Plaza, with men walking or riding by their side; mounted parties followed on mules and horses; the poorest were setting out on foot, {{men and women}} carrying bundles, clasping babies in their arms, leading old people, dragging along the bigger children. When Charles Gould, after leaving the doctor and the engineer at the Casa Viola, entered the town by the harbour gate, all those that had meant to go were gone, and the others had barricaded themselves in their houses. In the whole dark street {{there was only one}} spot of flickering lights and moving figures, where the Senor Administrador recognized his wife's carriage waiting {{at the door of the}} Avellanos's house. He rode up, almost unnoticed, and looked on without a word while some of his own servants came out of the gate carrying Don Jose Avellanos, who, with closed eyes and motionless features, appeared perfectly lifeless. His wife and Antonia walked on each side of the <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher,</b> which was put at once into the carriage. The two women embraced; while from the other side of the landau Father Corbelan's emissary, with his ragged beard all streaked with grey, and high, bronzed cheek-bones, stared, sitting upright in the saddle. Then Antonia, dry-eyed, got in by the side of the stretcher, and, after making the sign of the cross rapidly, lowered a thick veil upon her face. The servants and the three or four neighbours who had come to assist, stood back, uncovering their heads. On the box, Ignacio, resigned now to driving all night (and to having perhaps his throat cut before daylight) looked back surlily over his shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} hour and a half, Pitsenbarger {{attended}} to wounded soldiers, hacking splints out of snarled vines and building <b>improvised</b> <b>stretchers</b> out of saplings. When the others began running low on ammunition, he gathered ammunition from the dead and distributed them to those still alive. Then, he joined the others with a rifle to hold off the Viet Cong. Pitsenbarger was killed by Viet Cong snipers later that night. When his body was recovered the next day, one hand still held a rifle and the other clutched a medical kit.Although Pitsenbarger didn't escape alive, nine other men did, partially thanks to his courage and their devotion to duty.|$|R
2500|$|On completion, she was {{assigned}} to New Guinea waters as an anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort ship {{for the duration of}} 1944; during this time the ship sailed [...] and was active for over 10,000 hours. On 20 October 1944, the corvette was called to assist an American patrol under heavy mortar fire near Maffin Bay in Dutch New Guinea. Glenelg’s whaler was deployed to help move the American wounded; although swampled, the boat was dragged ashore by her crew, with seating and flooring boards used as <b>improvised</b> <b>stretchers</b> to move the wounded to the American-controlled bank of the Woske River. Glenelg, under the guidance of two US Army personnel standing on the beach, fired 31 rounds from her [...] main gun at the Japanese attackers, and was later praised by the patrol's senior officer as the decisive factor in allowing the patrol to withdraw with all wounded, leaving five dead behind.|$|R
60|$|The footmen advanced. The crowd, {{which was}} growing rapidly and was {{watching}} almost in silence, awed, pressed {{as close as}} it dared upon these gentlemen. Mainwaring procured a couple of cloaks and <b>improvised</b> a <b>stretcher</b> with them. Of this he took one corner himself, Gascoigne another, and the footmen the remaining two. Thus, as gently as might be, they bore the wounded man from the enclosure, through the crowd that had by now assembled in the street, and over the threshold of Stretton House.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was carried}} on an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> {{manufactured}} from guns to [...] "Nugents" [...] pub in Newcastle, {{at the foot}} of the mountains. He was later brought to the hospital in Clonmel, and died that evening at 8 p.m. Lynch was laid to rest two days later at Kilcrumper Cemetery, near Fermoy, County Cork.|$|E
50|$|At {{a certain}} moment the search looks like having gotten {{to a dead}} end - a vital hint had been written {{on the door of}} an outbuilding, but the door is not there any more. It turns out, however, that the door in {{question}} was used as an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> on which a wounded rebel was carried to a neighbouring village during the Polish 1863 uprising against Russian rule - and that after this use, the door had been installed at the village church, where Adam duly finds it and writes down the clue.|$|E

60|$|The ways of {{the prairie}} dwellers are in some respects modern and crudely new; but the Highland {{servants}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and the French half-breed voyageur have between them left us a dowry of quaint belief and superstition; and the growl of the thunder and the black darkness made a due impression on {{most of those who}} brought Redmond home. For my part I was thankful when a lonely log-house loomed up ahead and the wagon came to a standstill. Four men, <b>improvising</b> a <b>stretcher,</b> took up their burden, and halted as Sergeant Mackay and another, neither of whom seemed to care about his errand, knocked on the door.|$|R
2500|$|Instead of {{settling}} down {{at home in}} what was most expected (a spinsterhood dedicated to caring for her mother), Kenny continued {{to work as a}} nurse from her mother's home, often being brought to her patients in the sidecar of a motorcycle or by automobile. When a family friend's daughter Sylvia was injured by falling into the path of a horse-drawn plough, the friend called Kenny for help. Kenny <b>improvised</b> a <b>stretcher</b> from a cupboard door, fastened Sylvia to it and accompanied her the [...] to Dr.McDonnell's Toowoomba office. Sylvia recovered, primarily owing to Kenny's careful attention during that transport. Kenny improved the stretcher for use by local ambulance services, and {{for the next three years}} marketed it as the [...] "Sylvia Stretcher" [...] in Australia, Europe and the United States. She turned the profits over to the Australian Country Women's Association, which administered its sales and manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|The {{farmer and}} farmhands rescued the injured {{people from the}} wrecked aircraft. Two of the {{passengers}} were able to extricate themselves from the wreckage but the other 11 passengers were more seriously injured. They had been thrown forwards in the accident, one woman had been forced through {{the side of the}} fuselage. The local doctor attended and assisted in the evacuation of the injured from the scene. Hurdles were <b>improvised</b> as makeshift <b>stretchers</b> and the injured were taken into the barn until ambulances arrived from Ashford, Hythe and Lympne. They were taken to hospital in Folkestone. Many of the injured suffered multiple fractures.|$|R
50|$|While she {{was waiting}} to board the ship, Lucheni ran {{over to her and}} slammed his body against hers, {{penetrating}} her chest with a sharp needle file (which is now part of the Sisi Museum exhibition at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna). Not realising she was hurt because of her extremely tight corset, and wanting to board as quickly as possible, Elisabeth got to her feet straight away and boarded the steamer. The vessel departed but quickly turned around when it was realised that Elisabeth was injured. She was carried back to the Beau-Rivage hotel on an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher</b> and two doctors were summoned, but they pronounced her dead at 2:10 pm.|$|E

5000|$|Impressed by Henry's helpfulness, Kent {{decides that}} Scouting {{would be a}} good {{influence}} on his spoiled brat of a son, Peter (Darryl Hickman). Compelled to join Henry's troop, Peter initially scoffs at the other Scouts as a [...] "bunch of pantywaists" [...] and antagonizes everyone by shirking his duties and playing a number of pranks to sabotage Henry's troop at the camporee. He even feigns a sprained ankle while hiking, to get the other Scouts to carry him on an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher.</b> After he is challenged to a fistfight by a Scout he has taunted and is roughed up off-screen, a reformed Peter strives to win acceptance by his fellows and help his troop win the competition. Having learned the meaning of Scout's honor the hard way, he begins to appreciate Henry's standing up for him when no one else wanted him around.|$|E
25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a <b>stretcher</b> <b>improvised</b> from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|R

When Franz Joseph received the telegram informing him of Elisabeth's death, his first fear was that she had committed suicide. It was only when a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, that he was relieved of that notion. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and the answer was that whatever procedures were prescribed by Swiss Law should be adhered to.|$|R
5000|$|From the steamboat, Marlow {{observes the}} station in detail and is {{surprised}} to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around {{the corner of the}} house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an <b>improvised</b> <b>stretcher.</b> The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are [...] "unsound". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.|$|E
