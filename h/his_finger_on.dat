5|$|From the {{apartment}} {{he shares with}} his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, drooping look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} home game {{in nearly a}} month, the Patriots faced the Broncos, winners of 16 of the last 19 games between the two teams, on Monday Night Football; earlier that day, the Patriots placed Maroney on injured reserve with a {{shoulder}} injury after he had missed two of the team's last three games, and activated offensive lineman Stephen Neal from the physically unable to perform list. After winning the coin toss, the Patriots deferred their pick {{to the start of}} the second half; the Broncos elected to receive. On the opening series, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler injured <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the first play, but led the Broncos into Patriots territory, where running back Andre Hall, who replaced injured starter Michael Pittman two plays prior, fumbled at the Patriots' 30-yard line; Patriots defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith's recovery gave the Patriots the ball at their own 32-yard line to begin their first drive. A 29-yard reception by Watson brought the Patriots into the Broncos' red zone, where the drive ended and a 31-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 3–0 lead. On the fourth play of the Broncos' ensuing drive, Hall fumbled again; this time, a scramble for the ball pushed it 25 yards in the Patriots' favor to the Broncos' 37-yard line, where Mayo recovered it. A Broncos unnecessary roughness penalty on the play gave the ball to the Patriots at the Broncos' 22-yard line, but after failing to make a first down, a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 6–0.|$|E
25|$|Willem van Moerbeke, {{known in}} the English {{speaking}} world as William of Moerbeke (c. 1215–1286) was a prolific medieval translator of philosophical, medical, and scientific texts from Greek into Latin. At the request of Aquinas, so it is assumed—the source document is not clear—he undertook a complete translation {{of the works of}} Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the Politics (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. The reason for the request was that the many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation had originated in Spain (see Gerard of Cremona). These earlier translations were assumed to have been influenced by the rationalist Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Moerbeke's translations have had a long history; they were already standard classics by the 14th century, when Henricus Hervodius put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> their enduring value: they were literal (de verbo in verbo), faithful to the spirit of Aristotle and without elegance. For several of William's translations, the Greek texts have since disappeared: without him the works would be lost. William also translated mathematical treatises by Hero of Alexandria and Archimedes. Especially important was his translation of the Theological Elements of Proclus (made in 1268), because the Theological Elements is one of the fundamental sources of the revived Neo-Platonic philosophical currents of the 13th century. The Vatican collection holds William's own copy of the translation he made of the greatest Hellenistic mathematician, Archimedes, with commentaries of Eutocius, which was made in 1269 at the papal court in Viterbo. William consulted two of the best Greek manuscripts of Archimedes, both of which have since disappeared.|$|E

He wanted the release to sound more like the music he had recorded with Loose Fur, although he [...] "couldn't put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> why." [...] Tweedy wanted the album to advance the sound of Wilco {{in a similar fashion}} as Being There and Summerteeth. He became irritated by Wilco drummer Ken Coomer because Coomer disliked playing consistent drum patterns each time that the band played a song. Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett also soured on Coomer because of the drummer's lack of patience and consistency. Although he briefly considered adding Kotche as a secondary percussionist, Tweedy decided to replace Coomer with his Loose Fur bandmate: ...|$|E

[...] This effect is now done electronically using DSP, but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together. [...] As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the flange of one of the players (hence [...] "flanger"), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect. [...] Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its tachometer was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum. [...] This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.|$|E
2500|$|Alpay {{returned}} to the Aston Villa team {{for the beginning of}} the 2003–04 season. In his first home game against Charlton Athletic, he was booed when walking on to the pitch by his own fans. However Alpay went on to score the first goal of that game. In consequence to his earlier booing, Alpay's goal celebration served to mock the Aston Villa fans by placing <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> his mouth. He was again dropped due to their angry reaction. The Turkish defender was then made public enemy number one in England in late 2003 after a run-in with David Beckham during the Euro 2004 qualifier in Istanbul. He first confronted the England skipper after his first-half penalty miss, glowering over him and rubbing heads with him {{in full view of the}} referee. He followed that up by prodding a finger into Beckham's face as the players came off the pitch at half-time, sparking a tunnel brawl. Due to the angry reactions in England, his contract was terminated by Aston Villa on 23 October. Club chairman Doug Ellis declared: ...|$|E

2500|$|Australia {{were set}} 223 {{to win and}} retain the Ashes and their hopes must have been high even after Snow yorked Ken Eastwood for a duck. Unfortunately for England Snow had to retire after two overs when he smashed <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the wooden {{boundary}} fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. Stackpole was caught off a thick edge by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out, much to the disappointment of England skipper Ray Illingworth who said [...] "It was really unbelievable". Stackpole hit 2 sixes and 6 fours in his 67, but received little support {{as the rest of}} the team folded. Illingworth took 3/39 off 20 eight ball overs and accounted for Stackpole, Redpath and Greg Chappell, d'Oliveira took 2/15 and Underwood 2/28 on a spinning wicket and Australia were all out for 160 to lose by 62 runs. The last wicket was that of Terry Jenner caught by Keith Fletcher off Derek Underwood, after which the England team chaired Ray Illingworth off the field in celebration.|$|E

Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|At Sydney, Terry Jenner retired {{hurt when}} he ducked into a short {{delivery}} from Snow {{in the first}} innings. Umpire Lou Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] {{and that he would}} complain to the A.C.B. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was grabbed by a drunk [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series agreed that they had no hard feelings. To avoid injury to his team, Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. The England manager Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Alan Barnes of the A.C.B. demanded that they return immediately or they would forfeit the match and the Ashes. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital. Jenner returned to bat at 235–8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs. England made 302 in their second innings and set Australia 223 to win. Snow took a wicket in his first over, but smashed <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the wooden boundary fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. England's spinners did the job, dismissing Australia for 160 to win by 62 runs and regain The Ashes while Snow was on the operating table. He recovered in time to join in [...] "the champagne-filled, beer-laden, hangover-inducing rejoicings of Sydney". Snow's 31 wickets (22.83) was the most by an England bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33. No England bowler after Snow has taken 25 wickets in a Test series in Australia.|$|E
