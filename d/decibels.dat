5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 <b>decibels</b> in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 <b>decibels</b> in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 <b>decibels.</b> The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness <b>decibels</b> during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} have become critical of Hyde Park as a concert venue, {{due to the}} sound levels, and have campaigned for a maximum sound level of 73 <b>decibels.</b> In June 2012, Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney found their microphones switched off after Springsteen had played a three-hour set during the Park's Hard Rock Calling festival, and overshot the 10:30pm curfew time.|$|E

5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 <b>decibels,</b> comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E
5|$|The end-fire array trades a few <b>decibels</b> {{of output}} power for directionality, so it {{requires}} more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 {{at one of the}} stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E

5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 <b>decibels.</b> Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in <b>decibels.</b> In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 <b>decibels.</b> An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E

50|$|The German study {{concluded}} that aircraft noise clearly and significantly impairs health. For example, a day-time average sound pressure level of 60 <b>decibel</b> increasing coronary heart disease by 61% in men and 80% in women. As another indicator, a night-time average sound pressure level of 55 <b>decibel</b> increased {{the risk of heart}} attacks by 66% in men and 139% in women. Statistically significant health effects did however start as early as from an average sound pressure level of 40 <b>decibel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{cases where}} the unit value of the {{reference}} is stated, the <b>decibel</b> value is known as [...] "absolute". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the <b>decibel</b> value is considered relative.|$|R
25|$|Study {{results of}} the {{long-term}} acoustic benefits of rubberized asphalt are inconclusive. Initial application of rubberized asphalt may provide 3–5 <b>decibels</b> (dB) reduction in tire-pavement source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 <b>decibels</b> (dB) in total traffic noise level reduction (due to the other components of traffic noise). Compared to traditional passive attenuating measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), rubberized asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic benefits at typically much greater expense.|$|E
25|$|Months after Tom McGrath filed a suit {{on behalf}} of {{business}} owners and residents against the noise ordinance enacted by the city to push away motorcycle rallies, the Myrtle Beach city council increased the noise limit. Motor vehicles were limited {{to a level of}} 89 <b>decibels</b> while the engine is running at idle speed, but now motor vehicles may operate as high as 99 <b>decibels</b> which is more in alignment with national standards.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} scales used when expressing a ratio in <b>decibels</b> depending {{on the nature of}} the quantities: field quantity ratio or power quantity ratio. (Field quantity ratio is also referred to as root-power ratio or amplitude ratio.) When expressing power quantities, the number of <b>decibels</b> is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities. That is, a change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10dB change in level. When expressing field quantities, a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20dB change in level. The extra factor of two is due to the logarithm of the quadratic relationship between power and amplitude. The decibel scales differ so that direct comparisons can be made between related power and field quantities when they are expressed in <b>decibels.</b>|$|E

To attenuate the noise, the park's design includes 20- to 30-foot high hills between Piers 2–5. This hill runs along {{the entire length of}} the Greenway Terrace and reduces noise pollution in the park up to 75 percent, from 75 <b>decibels</b> to 68 <b>decibels.</b> This hill is formed by salvaged material from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's East Side Access project in Midtown Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|One {{piece of}} {{equipment}} replaced only a month after WES began operations is its train horn. The FRA requires all trains operating on heavy rail lines to sound their horns for at least 15 seconds at a minimum level of 96 <b>decibels</b> (from 100 feet) as they approach crossings. For the rush hour-only schedule used when WES began operation, that meant over a thousand blasts a week along its route, starting as early as 5:30am. Complaints about the noise caused TriMet to replace the original 150-decibel Nathan horns with 75-decibel Leslie horns for a fleetwide cost $5,000. The new horns, which met the minimum requirements, still led to complaints. TriMet asked the FRA for a waiver, proposing that they install yet another horn— {{similar to that used}} on MAX Light Rail— that would sound at 80 <b>decibels</b> and be accompanied by bells that would ring at 60 <b>decibels</b> continuously as the train neared a crossing. However, the FRA turned down this request, citing safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} expressing a ratio as a level in <b>decibels</b> {{depends on whether}} the {{measured}} property is a power quantity or a field quantity; see Field, power, and root-power quantities for details.|$|E
