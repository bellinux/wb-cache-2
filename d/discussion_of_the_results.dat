500|$|In April 1996, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco {{ruled that}} state trial judge Ito {{had given the}} jury faulty {{instructions}} [...] about the law regarding fraud. The conviction was overturned. In December 1996, the same Court of Appeals ruled {{that some of the}} jurors in the federal case might have been influenced by their knowledge and <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the state case, and threw out the federal conviction. Keating was freed after 4½ years in prison; he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was the thing he was proudest of. He was said to have gotten along well with other prisoners and served as best man at weddings for some that he met there.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{conditions}} {{are known to}} be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small. In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function. One of these studies, published in 2003, explicitly concluded: [...] "We found that improvement in binocularity, including stereopsis, can be obtained in a substantial portion of adults." [...] That article was published together with a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> among peers in which the scientific and social implications of the medical treatment were addressed, for example concerning the long-term relevancy of stereopsis, the importance of avoiding diplopia, the necessity of predictable outcomes, and psychosocial and socioeconomic relevance.|$|E

50|$|The book {{contains}} 40 {{readings and}} each corresponds {{to an important}} psychology-related publication. Readings are further organized into 10 chapters that correspond to major areas of study in psychology. Individual readings all contain similar sections {{for each of the}} 40 studies; they include sections on theoretical propositions behind the study, methods used in the study, results of the study, <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results,</b> subsequent research on the same topic, and recent research that cites the original publication.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{remainder}} <b>of</b> {{this article}} is structured as follows. The subsequent section sets the foundations and presents the identified research gap.

This is followed by <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> theoretically grounded artefact. A short reflective discussion on implications, limitations and future research concludes the article.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{applications}} of advanced tools of modern variational analysis and generalized differentiation to problems of optimistic bilevel programming.

50|$|In any {{discussion}} of the theoretical ramifications of a single experiment, it must be readily admitted that many alternative explanations are allowable, and that no single experiment is by itself justification to set aside a tremendously successful theory. But it must be emphasized that the simplest explanation of the ADR results leads to a conclusion that is damaging to the special theory of relativity. Indeed, it {{was the author of}} special relativity himself who, together with Podolsky and Rosen, first proposed a similar test, and the EPR reasoning was as simple and straightforward as the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> presented herein.|$|E

50|$|The remit of UNGEGN is to {{deal with}} the {{problems}} of domestic and international standardization of geographical names, and to offer suggestions and recommendations for (mainly linguistic) standardization. Being one of the seven expert groups of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, UNGEGN is mandated to follow up on the implementation of resolutions and to continue activities between the United Nations Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names held every five years. UNGEGN aims to emphasize the importance of the standardization of geographical names at the national and international levels, to show the benefits of this, and to assist countries in standardization of geographical names where it is lacking. Furthermore, UNGEGN facilitates and encourages the <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of work on national standardization and arising issues, the dissemination of bestpractices, and a wide user community awareness of nationally authorized geographical names.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goals of}} Study 3 were to test if the CNS could predict real life {{decisions}} and to further establish the validity. The researchers hypothesized that students studying environmental studies would score higher than psychology, math, or chemistry students since {{the former are}} already showing motivation to study the environment. The authors report in their <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> that the CNS does in fact capture a personality trait that is relevant in real life decisions. It {{should also be noted}} that a factor analysis was done in Study 3 and it differed from Studies 1 and 2, suggesting an inconsistency in factor structure. [...] The goals of Study 4 were to investigate how the CNS explains the motivations behind positive ecological behavior and to compare the CNS to more current work on the subject of well-being. The researchers also hypothesized that the CNS would correlate with life satisfaction and also with biospheric values. They were trying to provide more predictive validity for the CNS. Results showed that the CNS did correlate with a measure of life satisfaction as well as a measure of biospheric value orientation.|$|E
50|$|Herschel made {{accurate}} {{records of}} his observations of shooting {{stars in a}} long series of manuscript notebooks. He also accomplished important work in the summation, reduction, and <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of other observers with whom he corresponded {{in all parts of the}} world. With Robert P. Greg he formed extensive catalogues of the radiant points of meteor streams, the more important of these being published in the Reports of the British Association for 1868, 1872, and 1874. A table of the radiant points of comets computed by Herschel alone is in the Report for 1875. He was reporter to the committee of the British Association on the 'observations of luminous meteors,' and from 1862 to 1881 drew up annually complete reports of the large meteors observed, and of the progress of meteoric science. For the British Association (1874-81) he prepared reports of a committee, consisting of himself, his colleague at Newcastle, George A. Lebour, and John T. Dunn, which was formed to determine the thermal conductivities of certain rocks. For the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, he prepared the annual reports on meteoric astronomy each February from 1872 to 1880 and contributed many other important papers to the Notices. In a June 1872 paper, he showed the connection between meteors (the Andromedids) and comets (Biela's Comet), and he predicted the shower which recurred on 27 November of that year. Herschel acquired great precision in noting the paths of meteors among the stars. From his determination of the radiant point of the November Leonids, Giovanni Schiaparelli deduced the identity of their orbit with that of Tempel's Comet of 1866, 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. In 1864 and 1873 he observed the bright green colour of two respective Geminid meteors.|$|E
