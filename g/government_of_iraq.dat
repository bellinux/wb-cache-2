5|$|MEF {{commander}} Major General Richard Zilmer {{responded to}} press queries about {{the statement that}} Anbar Province was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces. He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

50|$|The Iraqi Local Governance Law Library in Arabic المكتبة القانونية العراقية للحكم المحلي {{contains}} {{legal documents}} considered {{relevant to the}} sub-national <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Besides national laws that have a significant bearing on sub-national governance, this Library also contains the growing body of local laws, orders, decisions, and regulations now being published by provinces in monthly legal gazettes. It {{is intended to be}} an up-to-date, authoritative, carefully classified and searchable repository of original legal documents in Arabic with the best available translations in English. The Iraq Local Governance Program (LGP III), a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded project implemented by RTI International, originally developed this library to clarify the relationship between the federal government and local <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The LGP III Law Library Team worked to compile an extensive law library, gathering Arabic copies of ministerial directives that have been enacted into law (statutes), administrative directives, administrative regulation, executive orders, and court cases relevant to the sub national government in Iraq, and then uploading the documents to the website. Selected English translations were added that met the translation quality standards of the Law Library Team. The library is currently being maintained by volunteers.|$|R

25|$|The {{establishment}} of a new civilian <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> was complicated by religious and political divisions between the majority Shi'ite population and the formerly ruling Sunni Arabs. Moreover, {{many of the people}} in Saddam's ruling Ba'ath Party were perceived as tainted by the association by some parties. In northern Iraq, Kurds had already had effectively autonomous rule for 12 years under the protection of the no-fly zone.|$|E

The Baath party under Saddam Hussein engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards.

50|$|Accountability for all {{serious or}} gross {{violations}} of {{international human rights}} law and international humanitarian law is essential to ensure justice, provide redress to the victims and prevent future infringements. The <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Syrian Arab Republic {{have the responsibility to}} protect the individuals under their jurisdiction and ensuring justice and accountability in acts of grave crimes. Domestic courts in Iraq and Syrian Arab Republic have jurisdiction over all violations committed within their territories whether by nationals or foreigners. However, as there have been concerns regarding the judicial systems in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the involvement of the International Criminal Court. Its main purpose for intervention would be to investigate and prosecute the crimes allegedly committed by ISIL. As neither Iraq nor the Syrian Arab Republic are parties to the Rome Statute, the Court has no territorial jurisdiction over the crimes committed in their territory. In the Special Rapporteur report in 2015, the Special Rapporteur called on the <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the Syrian Arab Republic to become parties without delay to the Rome Statute and to accept the jurisdiction of the Court over the current situation under article 12 (3).|$|R

25|$|Throughout Petraeus's {{tenure in}} Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq {{endeavored}} {{to work with}} the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population.

25|$|Regional {{autonomy}} {{had originally}} been established in 1970 {{with the creation of}} the Kurdish Autonomous Region following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and leaders of the Iraqi Kurdish community. A Legislative Assembly was established and Erbil became the capital of the new entity which lay in Northern Iraq, encompassing the Kurdish authorities of Erbil, Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah. The one-party rule which had dominated Iraq however meant that the new assembly was an overall component of Baghdad's central government; the Kurdish authority was installed by Baghdad and no multi-party system had been inaugurated in Iraqi Kurdistan, and as such the local population enjoyed no particular democratic freedom denied {{to the rest of the}} country.|$|E

25|$|Events in Greece {{provoked}} a pro-Axis faction {{to take over}} the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Wavell, hard pressed on his other fronts, was unwilling to divert precious resources to Iraq and so it fell to Claude Auchinleck's India Command to send troops to Basra. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, saw Iraq as vital to Britain's strategic interests and in early May, under heavy pressure from London, Wavell agreed to send a division-sized force across the desert from Palestine to relieve the besieged British air base at Habbaniya and to assume overall control of troops in Iraq. By the end of May Quinan's forces in Iraq had captured Baghdad and the Anglo-Iraqi War had ended with troops in Iraq once more reverting to the overall control of GHQ in Delhi. However, Churchill had been unimpressed by Wavell's reluctance to act.|$|E

After a series of public criticisms of King Saud by an array of Syrian political figures, including al-Azm, Michel Aflaq and Akram al-Hawrani, Saud froze Syrian assets in Saudi Arabia and withdrew his ambassador from Syria in protest. In response to the crisis between the two countries, an alarmed Quwatli ordered Asali to publicly distance his government from the anti-Saudi views of some in the Syrian Parliament and press, and to publicly apologize to Saud. In addition, Quwatli personally issued a government order {{to shut down the}} communist newspaper Al Sarkha.|$|R
