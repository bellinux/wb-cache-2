30|$|The {{optimization}} CPE {{allows the}} expansion of shorter prefixes into multiple equivalent larger prefixes. Before building an IPv 4 FIB, we use this technique to ensure there are only prefixes of length 20, 24, and 32. The first group is stored in a direct lookup array (DLA), while {{the other two are}} stored in separate sets consisting of one BF and one HT (G 1 and G 2, respectively). The DLA is a flat array with 220 entries that <b>stores</b> the next <b>hops</b> associated to 20 -bit prefixes. When using this structure, the lookup algorithm will sequentially search G 2 and G 1 (starting from G 2, since it stores the longest prefixes) and, if the LPM is not found, the next <b>hop</b> <b>stored</b> in the DLA position indexed by the first 20 bits of the input address is returned (it may be the default route).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Multihop {{transmissions}} over wireless mesh networks present limited end-to-end (E 2 E) data rates, {{as every}} hop waits {{for an entire}} packet to arrive before starting retransmission. That is, the E 2 E data rate drops when every <b>hop</b> <b>stores</b> and then forwards packets, thus making such transmissions unsuitable for multimedia applications. In this work, {{in order to increase}} data rates, we present an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio transceiver capable of concurrently transmit and receive (cTxRx) packets. However, concurrently receiving and transmitting comes at the cost of a channel model with increased interference level. Herein, we explain a new interference model and propose a transceiver that compensates for it. We describe the transceiver mathematically and analyze its performance via simulations. Also, we demonstrate that the E 2 E data rate exceeds that of current multihop transmissions, thus allowing multimedia traffic to be transmitted over a multi-hop wireless mesh network. I...|$|R

The fact that source addresses in Internet datagrams cannot be trusted makes the IP Internet inherently vulnerable to DoS and DDoS attacks. The Internet forwarding plane is open to attacks to the privacy of datagram sources, because source addresses in Internet datagrams have global scope. The fact an Internet datagrams are forwarded {{based solely on the}} destination addresses stated in datagram headers and the next <b>hops</b> <b>stored</b> in the forwarding information bases (FIB) of relaying routers allows Internet datagrams to traverse loops, which wastes resources and leaves the Internet open to further attacks.  We introduce PEAR (Provenance Enforcement through Addressing and Routing), a new approach for addressing and forwarding of Internet datagrams that enables anonymous forwarding of Internet datagrams, eliminates many of the existing DDoS attacks on the IP Internet, and prevents Internet datagrams from looping, even in the presence of routing-table loops...|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the new law was {{enforced}} in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, and anybody else who broke the moral code. The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed. Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes, and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it was a different story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and <b>hops</b> <b>stores</b> popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling malt extract syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} hops is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} content of alpha bitter acids. Maintaining it with minimum losses lies within the competence of both the hop grower and processor depending on how they follow the optimum harvest technology, storage conditions, and post-harvest hop processing. That indicator is considerably affected by the hop storage method, i. e. whether the warehouse is air-conditioned or not, {{as well as the}} storage duration. The alpha bitter acid content should not be reduced during storage. The objective of this paper is an analysis of the alpha bitter acid content in the Saaz hop variety in a technological sequence of operations starting with drying at the grower and finishing with six-month storing at the processor, with three storage variants: an air-conditioned warehouse, non-conditioned warehouse, and a variant in which the square bale is moved after 60 days from a non-conditioned warehouse into an air-conditioned warehouse. The analysis of samples to identify the alpha bitter acid content was carried out by means of the ASBC Hops- 6 and the HPLC EBC 7. 7 methods. Practically in all cases the alpha content declines, although if a square bale is placed in an air-conditioned warehouse this decline is the lowest depending on the storage duration. The economic analysis shows a significant profit referring to the price of alpha contained in 1 t of <b>hops</b> <b>stored</b> in an air-conditioned warehouse.

50|$|Accordingly, Song and Perrig {{propose the}} {{following}} traceback scheme: instead of encoding the IP address interleaved with a hash, they suggest encoding the IP address into an 11 bit hash {{and maintain a}} 5 bit <b>hop</b> count, both <b>stored</b> in the 16-bit fragment ID field. This {{is based on the}} observation that a 5-bit hop count (32 max hops) is sufficient for almost all Internet routes. Further, they suggest that two different hashing functions be used so that the order of the routers in the markings can be determined. Next, if any given hop decides to mark it first checks the distance field for a 0, which implies that a previous router has already marked it. If this is the case, it generates an 11-bit hash of its own IP address and then XORs it with the previous hop. If it finds a non-zero hop count it inserts its IP hash, sets the hop count to zero and forwards the packet on. If a router decides not to mark the packet it merely increments the hop count in the overloaded fragment id field.|$|R

40|$|Abstract To support {{communication}} among hundreds of cores on a chip, on-chip communication must be well organized. In the embedded systems using such a chip, the communication patterns can be profiled and routing can be well planned off-line. Source routing, with many advantages over distributed routing, {{will be very}} suitable in such contexts. However, source routing has one serious drawback of overhead for storing the path information in header of every packet. This disadvantage becomes worse as {{the size of the}} network grows. In this thesis we propose a technique, called Junction Based Routing (JBR), to remove this limitation. In the proposed technique, path information for only a few <b>hops</b> is <b>stored</b> in the packet header. With this information, either the packet reaches the destination, or reaches a junction from where the path information for on-ward path is picked up. There are many interesting issues related to this approach. Two important issues related to JBR, namely, number and position of junctions and path computation for efficient deadlock free routing are discussed and solved in this thesis work. Increase in path length by using the minimum number of junctions, link load distribution while computing paths, path encoding for JBR and packet format in JBR are also discussed. A few tools have been developed in MATLAB to analyze the various aspects of JBR. A simulator has been also developed to evaluate the performance of JBR with simple source routing. Outline of the architecture for a junction is also proposed. The results of simulation-based experiments show that the performance of JBR is similar to source routing. JBR is compared with source routing and the simulationbased results show that latency does not increase so much using junctions. Throughput also does not level off significantly. Header flit in JBR can carry payload data and this improves the performance of JBR in terms of throughput and latency compared to source routing which needs to store large path information. We observe improvement in throughput as compared to basic source routing when payload is very small.

To reduce the variability in these evaluations, we developed a digital-image evaluation system for in vitro-stored plantlets. This study compares the standard visual evaluation system with a digital analysis system to determine if digital analysis can effectively quantify the health of diverse Humulus germplasm. Eight cultivars of Humulus lupulus L. were stored on standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with iron alone (EDTA chelated) and on MS iron with 100 or 200 mg l 21 sequestrene 138 iron (EDDHA chelated). Digital images of the upper two nodes of each plantlet were evaluated for red, green, blue, green/red ratio, and modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI R 2 G/R þ G). Evaluation of each plantlet for MNDVI values showed consistent significant differences for all treatments only at the upper node. Significant differences for visual and the MNDVI values among the three iron treatments were observed at the upper node {{of most of the}} eight hop cultivars. Regression analysis of the upper node MNDVI values vs. whole-plant visual ratings showed positive correlations for most cultivars.

40|$|The figure depicts {{selected}} {{aspects of}} a six-legged robot that moves by hopping {{and that can be}} steered {{in the sense that it}} can be launched into a hop in a controllable direction. This is a prototype of hopping robots being developed for use in scientific exploration of rough terrain on remote planets that have surface gravitation less than that of Earth. Hopping robots could also be used on Earth, albeit at diminished hopping distances associated with the greater Earth gravitation. The upper end of each leg is connected through two universal joints to an upper and a lower hexagonal frame, such that the tilt of the leg depends on the relative position of the two frames. Two non-back-driveable worm-gear motor drives are used to control the relative position of the two frames along two axes 120 apart, thereby controlling the common tilt of all six legs and thereby, further, controlling the direction of hopping. Each leg includes an upper and a lower aluminum frame segment with a joint between them. A fiberglass spring, connected via hinges to both segments, is used to <b>store</b> <b>hopping</b> energy prior to launch into a hop and to cushion the landing at the end of the hop. A cable for loading the spring is run into each leg through the center of the universal joints and then down along the center lines of the segments to the lower end of the leg. A central spool actuated by a motor with a harmonic drive and an electromagnetic clutch winds in all six cables to compress all six springs (thereby also flexing all six legs) simultaneously. To ensure that all the legs push off and land in the same direction, timing- belt pulley drives are attached to the leg segments, restricting the flexing and extension of all six legs to a common linear motion. In preparation for a hop, the spool can be driven to load the spring legs by an amount corresponding to a desired hop distance within range. The amount of compression can be computed from the reading of a shaft-angle encoder that indicates the amount by which the spool has been turned. When the robot is ready to hop, the electromagnetic clutch disengages the motor from the spool, thus releasing the cable restraints on the springs and allowing the springs to extend all six legs simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{classical}} store-and-forward routing has {{and will}} continue to be the most important routing architecture in many modern packet-switched communication networks. In a packet-switched network, data is sent in the form of discrete packets that traverse hop-by-hop from a source to a destination. At each intermediate <b>hop,</b> the router <b>stores</b> and examines the packets it receives then forwards them to the next hop until they reach the correct destinations according to some pre-defined routing algorithms. Importantly, the intermediate routers do not modify but simply store and forward the contents of the packets. In contrast, a new generalized approach to routing called Network Coding (NC) allows the intermediate routers to modify and combine packets from different sources and destinations in such a way that increases the overall throughput. The core idea of NC allowing the intermediate nodes in a network to perform data processing has a wide range of applications well beyond its initial application to routing, impacting different disciplines from distributed data storage and security to energy efficient sensor networks and Internet media streaming. To that end, this dissertation aims to develop the theories and applications of NC via four main thrusts: 1) Energy efficient NC techniques for sensor networks, 2) Novel NC techniques and protocols for Internet video streaming, 3) Stochastic data replenishment for large scale NC-based distributed storage systems, 4) Real-world implementation of NC-based distributed video streaming system. In thrust one, we describe a novel cross-sensor coding technique that combines network topology and coding techniques to maximize the life-time of a sensor network, by addressing the uneven energy consumption problem in data gathering sensor networks where the nodes closer to the sink tend to consume more energy than those of the farther nodes. Our approach is based on the following observation from the sensor networks using On-Off Keying and digital transmission: transmitting bit " 1 " consumes much more energy than bit " 0 ". Our proposed coding technique exploits this difference to reduce the communication energy by limiting the number of bits " 1 " in the output codeword (low-weight codeword) and to use NC-based cross-sensor coding technique to equalize the communication energy among the nodes. This cross-sensor coding scheme can significantly extend the network lifetime as compared with traditional (binary) coding by solving the energy-consumption unfairness problem. The theoretical and experimental results confirm that transmission energy can be reduced substantially (e. g., a factor of 15) and the unequal energy consumption among nodes can be practically eliminated. In thrust two, we describe a rate distortion aware hierarchical NC technique and transport protocol for Internet video streaming. We begin by proposing a NC-based multi-sender streaming framework that reduces the overall storage, eliminates the complexity of sender synchronization, and enables TCP streaming. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Network Coding (HNC) technique that facilitates scalable video streaming to combat bandwidth fluctuation on the Internet. This HNC technique enables receiver to recover the important data gracefully in the presence of limited bandwidth which causes an increase in decoding delay. Simulations demonstrate that under certain scenarios, our proposed NC techniques can result in bandwidth saving up to 60...|$|R
