5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of <b>delaying</b> <b>the</b> initiation of levodopa therapy and so <b>delaying</b> <b>the</b> onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E

40|$|The back {{bias voltage}} on a {{functional}} circuit is controlled through a closed loop process. A delay element receives a clock pulse and produces a <b>delay</b> output. <b>The</b> <b>delay</b> element is advantageously constructed {{of the same}} materials as the functional circuit so that the aging and degradation of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element parallels <b>the</b> degradation of the functional circuit. As <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element degrades, <b>the</b> transistor switching time increases, increasing <b>the</b> time <b>delay</b> of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> output. An AND gate compares a clock pulse to an output pulse of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element, <b>the</b> AND output forming a control pulse. A duty cycle of the control pulse is determined by <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> time between <b>the</b> clock pulse and <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element output. <b>The</b> control pulse is received at the input of a charge pump. The charge pump produces a back bias voltage which is then applied to <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and to the functional circuit. If <b>the</b> time <b>delay</b> produced by <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element exceeds <b>the</b> optimal <b>delay,</b> <b>the</b> duty cycle of the control pulse is shortened, and the back bias voltage is lowered, thereby increasing the switching speed of the transistors in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and reducing <b>the</b> time <b>delay.</b> If <b>the</b> throughput of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element is too fast, the duty cycle of the control pulse is lengthened, raising the back bias voltage produced by the charge pump. This, in turn, lowers the switching speed of the transistors in both <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and <b>the</b> functional circuit. The slower switching speed in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element increases time delay. In this manner, the switching speed of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element, and of the functional circuit, is maintained at a constant level {{over the life of}} the circuit...|$|R

5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully <b>delaying</b> <b>the</b> project by <b>delaying</b> <b>the</b> release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E
