40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the agricultural {{risk management system}} in the Netherlands, applying a holistic approach that considers the interactions between all sources of risk, farmers’ strategies and policies. The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, marketable intermediate risks that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The main risk-related policies in the Netherlands are implemented {{as part of the}} EU policy framework. Specifically, national policies focus on the management of catastrophic risks by promoting public-private partnerships, such as Livestock <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Fund,</b> to manage the costs of livestock epidemics. The mutual insurance companies specialised in the coverage of specific types of risks are also promoted, with some of them receiving start-up capital and re-insurance support. The recently launched subsidised multi-peril yield insurance exploits the new opportunities created by the EU framework. agricultural policy, muti-peril insurance, pest and disease risk, risk-management, risk perceptions, Livestock <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Fund...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of horses and horse breeds, semi-feral animals are those which are often untrained but usually owned by individuals. They are allowed to run in a natural state {{approaching}} that of wild conditions, but are periodically rounded up for assorted reasons, such as to wean foals, administer routine or <b>emergency</b> <b>veterinary</b> care, and so on. An example is the Camargue horse of France. Truly feral horses, such as the American Mustang or Australian Brumby have domesticated ancestors, but generally have no human ownership and live in essentially wild conditions, though they may also occasionally be rounded up for various management purposes. A true wild horse can only be a horse without any domesticated ancestors. The only living, truly wild horse is the Przewalski's horse.|$|R

"Mia", an 18 month-old, {{spayed female}} mixed breed dog, {{presented to the}} Triage Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) approximately 24 hours following involvement in a road traffic accident. Initial assessment and stabilization was accomplished at a local <b>emergency</b> <b>veterinary</b> clinic. Mia was then transferred to CUHA for additional diagnostics and treatment. Diagnostics at CUHA revealed pulmonary trauma as well as multiple pelvic fractures and a left femoral fracture. The femoral fracture was plated; the ilial fracture fragment, which involved the cranial aspect of the acetabulum was excised. This paper discusses "Mia's" pre and post surgical treatment, the decision making process in choosing an effective treatment strategy for the pelvic fracture patient, and some common coincidental injuries found in patients sustaining pelvic fractures.

40|$|Acute gastric {{dilatation}} and volvulus is {{a potentially}} catastrophic condition affecting dogs that requires immediate emergency medical and surgical treatment and intensive postoperative care {{to optimize the}} chance of a successful outcome. 1 The reported lifetime likeli-hood of developing GDV is 24 % in large-breed show dogs and 21. 6 % in giant-breed show dogs. 2 On the basis of recent studies, the mortality rate for GDV in dogs ranges from 10 % to 33 %. 2 – 7 The high incidence of GDV, together with a high mortality rate, makes GDV one of the leading causes of death for large- and giant-breed dogs. 2 Effective preventative measures, coupled with rapid owner recognition and <b>emergency</b> <b>veterinary</b> treatment of GDV are essential to reduce the devastat-ing impact of this condition.

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{research}} investigating the motivators and barriers to vaccinating dairy cattle. Veterinary surgeons {{have been identified}} as important sources of information for farmers making vaccination and disease control decisions, as well as being farmers’ preferred vaccine suppliers. Vets’ perception of their own role and communication style can be at odds with farmers’ reported preferences. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate how dairy farmers perceived the role of vets in implementing vaccination strategies on their farm. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 dairy farmers from across Britain. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Analysis revealed that farmers perceive vets to have an important role in facilitating decision-making in all aspects of vaccination, including the aspects of vaccine distribution and advice on implementation. This important role is acknowledged by farmers who have regular veterinary contact, but also farmers with solely <b>emergency</b> <b>veterinary</b> contact. Given this finding, future work should investigate the attitudes of vets towards vaccination and how they perceive their role. Combining this knowledge will enable optimisation of vaccination strategies on British dairy farms...|$|R

50|$|Social {{interaction}} among the homeless is impacted by pet ownership. Many homeless pet owners reported {{that having a}} dog facilitated conversation, {{but at the same}} time having a dog had a negative impact on their ability to find housing because homeless shelters, rental housing, and subsidized government housing continue to have strict regulations against allowing pets to reside with their homeless owners. Some action is being taken by social institutions to address the issue. San Francisco initiated a program which addressed both homelessness and animal shelter overcrowding: WOOF - Wonderful Opportunities for Occupants and Fidos. Started in August 2012, the homeless are given a dog that would otherwise be euthanized, to foster until a permanent home can be found. The homeless are trained to care for the dogs and will receive a weekly stipend. In addition to dog training lesson, the foster owners received training in job readiness, communication skills, banking and health care. All pet food and care is provided by the shelter.

40|$|Veterinary {{services}} are a vital component of excellent animal care practices. A full-time staff veterinarian {{is recommended for}} all types of wildlife facilities; however, in cases where this is not practical, a consulting/part-time veterinarian should be under contract. In these cases the contracted veterinarian should make at least twice monthly inspections of the animal collection and be available for any <b>emergencies.</b> <b>Veterinary</b> coverage also should be available so that any indications of disease, injury, or stress may be responded to in a timely manner. Protocols for the use and security of drugs used for veterinary purposes should be formally written and available to animal care staff.

40|$|The idea to use pet health {{insurance}} {{as the subject}} of my thesis came to me {{through a combination of}} my major in insurance and my dog Guen. I was watching her play one day when {{it occurred to me that}} if she were ever in an accident or in need of some type of <b>emergency</b> <b>veterinary</b> care, I would be unable to cover that expense. My next thought was that I wished I could get {{health insurance}} for her. The more I considered this idea, the better it sounded to me. It sounded so good in fact, that I began t wonder if this type of insurance was not already available and I was just unaware of it. When I began some research in the area and discovered that pet health insurance was available, I began asking other people I knew if they had been aware that this product existed. Most were not. After this I quickly concluded that this topic would be a good one for my thesis. It is one that relates to my area of study, many are unaware of its existence, and I think that people, and their pets, could benefit from knowing more about it. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
