5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of <b>deciding</b> matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically in extra time to create more space and <b>deciding</b> the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for <b>deciding</b> a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E

5|$|After <b>deciding</b> {{to begin}} work on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with {{assistance}} from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, <b>deciding</b> to price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the coin acceptors, joysticks, wiring, and casing. Pitts build the computer hardware and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The display adapter for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the coin acceptors were sourced from jukebox manufacturer Rowe International, and the joysticks found at a military surplus store as remainders from B-52 bomber controls.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{who should}} <b>decide</b> the corporation tax rate under {{the situation in}} which a local public good has a spillover effect and the central government cannot realize residents’ actual preference of the public good. This paper makes the following conclusions. When a local government <b>decides</b> the tax rate, it has an incentive to not only <b>decide</b> an inadequate tax rate because of the incentive to free-ride but also an incentive to <b>decide</b> an excessive tax rate because of the tax export effect. As such, because the incentive to <b>decide</b> an excessive tax rate is dominant, the local government <b>decides</b> a tax rate higher than the socially optimal one. With regard to the problem of who should <b>decide</b> the tax rate, this paper demonstrates the following: when the spillover effect is large (small), the local (central) government should <b>decide</b> the corporation tax rate. This result is unlike those in previous studies...|$|R
