40|$|Abstract. Transformations using {{retiming}} and resynthesis {{operations are}} the most important and practical (if not the only) techniques used in optimizing synchronous hardware systems. Although these transformations have been studied extensively for over a decade, questions about their optimization capability and verification complexity are not answered fully. Resolving these questions may be crucial in developing more effective synthesis and verification algorithms. This paper settles the above two open problems. The optimization potential is resolved through a constructive algorithm which determines if two given finite state machines (FSMs) are transformable to each other via retiming and resynthesis operations. Verifying the equivalence of two FSMs under such transformations, when the history of iterative transformation is unknown, is proved to be PSPACE-complete and hence just as hard as general equivalence checking, contrary to a common belief. As a result, we advocate a conservative design methodology for the optimization of synchronous hardware systems to ameliorate verifiability. Our analysis reveals some properties about initializing FSMs transformed under retiming and resynthesis. On the positive side, established is a lag-independent bound on the length increase of <b>initialization</b> <b>sequences</b> for FSMs under retiming. It allows a simpler incremental construction of <b>initialization</b> <b>sequences</b> compared to prior approaches. On the negative side, we show that there is no analogous transformation-independent bound when resynthesis and retiming are iterated. Fortunately, an algorithm computing the exact length increase is presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Due to {{increases}} in design complexity, routing a reset signal to all registers is becoming more difficult. One way {{to solve this problem}} is to reset only certain registers and rely on a software <b>initialization</b> <b>sequence</b> to reset other registers. This approach, however, may allow unknown values (also called X-values) in uninitialized registers to leak to other registers, leaving the design in a nondeterministic state. Although logic simulation can find some X-problems, it is not accurate and may miss bugs. A recent approach based on symbolic simulation can handle Xs accurately; however, it is not scalable. In this work we analyze the characteristics of X-problems and propose a methodology that leverages the accuracy of formal X-analysis and can scale to large designs. This is achieved by our novel partitioning techniques and the intelligent use of waveforms as stimulus. We applied our methodology to an industrial design and successfully identified several Xs unknown to the designers, including three real bugs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

In order to provide services to a customer, the CM goes through an <b>initialization</b> <b>sequence</b> consisted of several stages. Among these several stages, Initial Ranging, IP Connectivity, Transfer Operational Parameters & Registration with the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) are main four stages. In the Initial Ranging phase, the CM acquires the downstream and upstream channels. Acquisitions of these channels are important as they provide a unique communication link between the CM and the CMTS. While in IP connectivity phase, the CM acquires the IP address from the CMTS, which will give the CM a unique identity among all other network elements. In the Transfer Operational Parameters phase, the CM will obtain configuration file from the CMTS, which will inform the about the services it has to provide to customer. In addition, in Registration phase, the CM registers with the CMTS. After completion of this <b>initialization</b> <b>sequence,</b> the CM comes online and it will be capable to provide voice, video and data services to the customer. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the two transition phases pursued by a CM and these two phases are Initial Ranging and Transfer Operational Parameters.
