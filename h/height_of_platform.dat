50|$|On the {{forecourt}} of Karlsruhe Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) {{there is}} a four-track station for trams and Stadtbahn DC-powered trains. Here there are platforms {{on both sides of}} the tracks. In the future, the heights of the platforms on the right hand side will remain at 34 cm (the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> for trams) and on the left they will be lifted to 55 cm. This will make possible level access to all modern trains.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the train draft at actual {{passing of the}} type E 954 Shinkansen high-speed test train on the platform of a station with no passing tracks to investigate the effect of train draft. Based {{on the results of}} those measurements, we checked if the wind speed was within the permissible limit from the perspective of safety and examined the need to reduce train draft intensity by means such as increasing the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> safety fences. Furthermore, we carried out measurements at stations and tests using models to establish a quantitative evaluation method for the pressure variation in a fully covered shed when a high-speed train enters. Then we proposed an evaluation formula based on that method. Train Draft Generating Mechanism 2 There are two types of mechanism for train draft. One is wind by pressure variation caused around the moving car body as a train runs due to air viscosity (Fig. 1). The other is wind by compression waves generated when the front part of a train passes. The former is generally observed in many sections, including open sections; the latter is observed in tunnels and at fully covered shed. Train draft caused at one passing of a train can be broken down into the three aspects shown in Fig. 2. 1) · Source flow: Flow put off from the front part of a train in the front and side directions · Boundary layer flow: Flow along the car body side due to friction · Wake: Flow in the area of lower pressure at the rear part of a trai...|$|E

50|$|In {{competitive}} diving, FINA takes regulatory {{steps to}} ensure that athletes are protected from the inherent dangers of the sport. For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> which divers may compete on.|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Ashwin was {{victim of}} an {{accident}} that made him an amputee. He participated in a marathon in Mumbai soon after the accident. He floated a petition to change the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> in Mumbai suburban train stations, that ended in victory.|$|R
25|$|A laser {{altimeter}} uses a lidar (see above) {{to measure}} the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the instrument <b>platform</b> above the surface. By independently knowing the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> {{with respect to the}} mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{standard}} <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> in Russia; {{they are}} 200 and 1100 mm above rail heads. 1100 mm high platforms are gradually changing to 550 mm platform height. 200 mm platforms are used primarily on lines with either small passenger flow or using double-decker trains.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{experiment}} was an exposure of reaction of heart rate of {{students on the}} increase of rate of musical accompaniment. 89 students of the first course took part in experimental employments. <b>Height</b> <b>of</b> step <b>platform</b> 15 - 20 centimetre. The large reaction of heart rate is exposed considerably on the increase <b>of</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> step <b>platform</b> (on 18, 3 %), what at growth of music rate (on 8, 5 %). Also appeared, that 14 from 89 students have weak functional preparedness: already {{at the rate of}} music of 138 - 142 shots in a minute and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> step <b>platform</b> 15 centimetre, heart rate for them attained an age-dependent maximum (on the average 207 shots in a minute). It is recommended to utillize in employments the increase of intensity only in the limited volume: increase of music rate to 142 - 45 shots in a minute or <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> step <b>platform</b> to 20 centimetre...|$|R
50|$|The Tower in {{the central}} part of the city reaches 72 m (including the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> {{is also a}} {{consideration}} when considering the loading gauge of passenger trains. Where the two are not directly compatible, steps may be required which will increase loading times. Where long carriages are used on a curving platform, gaps will occur between the platform and the carriage door, causing additional risk. Problems increase where trains of several different loading gauges and train floor heights use the same platform.|$|R
50|$|On 11 June 1928, a 750 volt third rail, {{installed}} {{at the side of}} the track, was brought into operation on the suburban tracks. Since initially insufficient trains were available for electrical operations, mixed diesel and electrical operations continued until 20 March 1929. The electrification involved extensive work, including the adaptation of the signalling and the raising <b>of</b> the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> from 760 to 960 millimetres. A sub-station was built west of the station. This electric suburban service has been branded as the S-Bahn since 1 December 1930.|$|R
5000|$|RailPac {{suggests}} in {{a report}} that changes to the 8 and 25 in platform height standard are happening.Another problem is the proposal for the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> for new stations. The US Federal Department of Justice (DOJ) wants to have platforms 15 in above {{the top of the}} rails. At this time, most are 8 in high (except on the Northeast Corridor). [...] the US DOJ is {{still in the process of}} creating the proposal, but the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is treating it like an existing rule.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to the low}} <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> {{there is}} a large {{difference}} in height between the platform and the train step, making boarding and alighting from trains difficult for older people and people with a disability.|$|R
50|$|On 22 April 2015 {{the station}} {{suffered}} significant flooding due to inclement weather, with the flood water nearly reaching the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform.</b> A {{time lapse video}} of CCTV from the station was released publicly showing the rising flood water.|$|R
5000|$|As the fad progressed, {{manufacturers}} like Candie's {{stretched the}} envelope {{of what was}} considered too outrageous to wear, while others, like Famolare and Cherokee of California, introduced [...] "comfort" [...] platforms, designed to combine the added <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> with the support and comfort of sneakers, or even orthopedic shoes, {{and by the time}} the fad finally fizzled in the late 1980s, girls and women of all ages were wearing them. It may also be a by-product of this fad that Scandinavian clogs, which were considered rather outrageous in the late 1960s and early 1970s, had become classic by the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Brackwede {{station has}} six tracks. The {{platform}} for tracks 5 and 6 was completely renovated for Expo 2000 and the reactivation of the Osnabrück-Bielefeld railway to Osnabrück; the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> {{was raised to}} 76 cm and given weather protection. The remaining tracks have a <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> 38 cm.|$|R
25|$|Except for the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>platforms</b> (mostly on the T Third Street line), F Market & Wharves line {{cars are}} fully {{compatible}} {{with the rest of}} the Muni Metro system. Indeed, the cars can be privately chartered and are operated all over the system.|$|R
50|$|In April 2011, {{the island}} {{platform}} was lengthened to accommodate longer suburban passenger trains, {{by raising the}} <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> around the old station building. On 28 April 2011, passenger trains began stopping under the station building shelter {{for the first time}} since 1993.|$|R
50|$|The line is {{electrified}} {{and built}} as a single-track, except for the two-track section between Aalen and Goldshöfe. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> some <b>platform</b> edges is below the minimum standard of about 38 cm above the rails and the central <b>platforms</b> <b>of</b> smaller stations are only accessible by crossing the tracks on plank crossings.|$|R
5000|$|Hagiharatenjin Station (...) is {{a railway}} station in Higashi-ku, Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. After an {{accident}} {{at the door}} of a local train in 2007, the platform display was reconstructed, and then the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platforms</b> were raised in 2008 and elevators were installed in 2009.|$|R
50|$|As {{the game}} progresses, the player is given {{different}} configurations <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> rings to jump and stand on. The video game also uses a spinning knob {{that is used}} to move a mouse-like cursor around the playing field so you can judge where the discs will deflect off the walls and on later levels the knob can be pulled up or pushed down depending on the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The walls at {{the back}} of the track are made of white panels on which {{large-scale}} images of different plants and animals are attached. This artistic design was produced by the Munich-based artist Martin Fengel who has included all the motifs <b>of</b> Moosach. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> walls is 7.80 metres.|$|R
50|$|Also {{numerous}} highrise {{buildings have}} observation decks, sometimes even a restaurant. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> these <b>platforms,</b> {{which can be}} glassed or open-air depend on the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the building, where they are most common on the utmost floor. As a rule the access, that nearly always requires the payment of an admission fee, is possible by elevator and is only possible at dedicated opening times.|$|R
50|$|The {{acquisition}} of the CSR rolling stock was also accompanied {{by a series of}} works on all three lines, both to accommodate the new trains such as with the electrification of the Buenos Aires - La Plata segment on the Roca Line, but also general improvements. On top of the emergency improvements undertaken following the Once Tragedy, some of these improvements included the modernisation of stations, raising the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> to match the new trains, incorporating train protection systems, creating new underpasses and rail infrastructure improvements, some of which were also undertaken by the City of Buenos Aires. However, not all works were finished by the time the CSR EMUs arrived on their respective lines, and some works continued on while they were already functioning.|$|R
50|$|Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)A lidar uses a laser (light {{amplification}} by {{stimulated emission}} of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors {{to measure the}} backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using {{the speed of light}} to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere. Laser Altimeter A laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the instrument <b>platform</b> above the surface. By independently knowing the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} end <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> {{will be used}} by long-distance and regional trains in the future. The entrance <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> will be adapted for this traffic by reducing the platform height to 76 cm by raising the track; the platform itself will remain unchanged. It is planned to extend the platform to around 300 m and two raised entrance areas will be created for S-Bahn trains.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} the first MTR station to have {{automatic}} platform gates (APG) installed on the edge <b>of</b> its <b>platforms.</b> These gates range from [...] to [...] the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> screen doors found in other MTR stations. In line with ground level and above-ground MTR stations, Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort Station are not air conditioned, and rely on their open architecture to keep the temperature low.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from these}} unusual features, the station also lacks a track 2. In the past, the {{designation}} track 2 was allocated to a passing loop not {{equipped with a}} platform. However, in 2006, as part of work done to increase the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platforms</b> to 55 cm, this track was provided with a platform and renamed track 1, and the former platform 1 was removed.|$|R
50|$|The Sea Quest {{was built}} by Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff for BP {{at a cost of}} £3.5 million and {{launched}} on 8 January 1966.The entire structure was 320 ft high and weighed 150,000 tons, including three legs each 35 ft in diameter and 160 ft long that could be partially filled with water to control the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> above the sea.|$|R
50|$|When the Tri-Rail {{system was}} first under construction, {{the station was}} located {{directly}} west of the airport's main runway, west of and next to I-95. However, concerns by the Federal Aviation Administration about the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> when planes were on approach prevented the station from ever being opened {{and moved to the}} Tigertail Avenue location. Remnants of both defunct stations remain adjacent to the tracks.|$|R
50|$|Alsfeld {{station has}} three {{platform}} tracks. Track 1 {{is located on}} the 183 metre-long platform next to the entrance buildings and tracks 2 and 3 are on a 191 metre-long island <b>platform.</b> The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> both <b>platforms</b> is 76 cm, which allows easy access to the train. The island platform can be reached via a pedestrian subway, which is not barrier-free. In addition to the platforms, a rarely used siding remains.|$|R
50|$|The stone {{platforms}} (기단, Gidan) {{used for}} several of Sungkyunkwan’s buildings {{are made of}} rectangular granite slabs fit together into a rectangular structure. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platforms</b> symbolizes {{the importance of the}} buildings. Much of the stonework from the original construction of the buildings remains exposed. There is also a sizeable percentage that is still present but has been buried beneath the structures due to time and renovations/reconstructions.|$|R
50|$|Level Boarding - The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the bus <b>{{platform}}</b> and the BRT station platform {{are at the}} Doors and Bus Interface same level. Passengers do {{not have}} to climb steps to board the bus, a feature similar to metro rail.|$|R
50|$|The New York City Subway's R36 WF order, {{used on the}} 7 {{service from}} 1962 to 2003, had a floor <b>height</b> <b>of</b> 45 in Above Top of Rail (ATR). It {{inferred}} with newer cars that New York City Subway A Division (IRT) trains and platforms are all 45.5 in, while B Division (BMT/IND) floor and platform height {{is very close to}} 44.875 in. However, since the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> some <b>platforms</b> visibly varies by several cm across short distances - these numbers must be understood as approximations.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} four tracks, three <b>of</b> which are <b>platform</b> tracks. Tracks 1 and 2 {{are used by}} trains to and from Freiburg. Usually these trains run on track 2. Track 3 is used by trains to and from Donaueschingen. Tracks 2 and 3 are located on an island platform, which is a reached by a {{passenger}} underpass. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platforms</b> above the railhead is 38 cm. The usable length and current use is as set out below.|$|R
50|$|The station came to {{national}} prominence in 2008 {{when it was}} chosen as the initial site for the installation of an experimental ramp to raise the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> to improve access to modern rolling stock. Christened the Harrington Hump, the ramp was built for £25,000 - 10% of the estimated cost of the conventional rebuilding that would have otherwise been required to make the platform fully DDA compliant. The modular design has since been deployed at several other rural stations across the UK where the cost <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> upgrades would otherwise have been considered prohibitive.|$|R
