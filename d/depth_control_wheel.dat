40|$|Abstract: Small {{cylindrical}} object navigating near free-surface {{is subject}} to wave disturbance. Wave disturbance can dramatically influence the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> of the near-surface navigating object. A self-regulating fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is proposed to keep the small cylindrical object navigate at the expected depth under free-surface disturbance. The near-surface dynamic model of the cylindrical object is presented and the fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is modeled. The results obtained {{by a series of}} hardware-in-loop simulations demonstrate that the self-tuning fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is valid to keep the small cylindrical object navigate steadily in the expected depth under free-surface disturbances...|$|R

2500|$|Torpedo <b>depth</b> is a <b>control</b> problem; good <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> {{requires}} more than just measuring the torpedo's <b>depth.</b> A <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> system that used just depth (measured by a hydrostat) to control the elevators would tend to oscillate around the desired depth. Whitehead in Fiume supplied many of the world's navies, and it had trouble with <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> until it developed the [...] "balance chamber" [...] with pendulum (pendulum-and-hydrostat control). The balance chamber had water pressure push against a disk that was balanced by a spring. [...] "The inclusion of a pendulum stabilized the mechanism's feedback loop."

50|$|Investigators {{with the}} Civil Aeronautics Board {{determined}} that the cable physically connecting the first officer's <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> to the aileron boost unit had disconnected.

The cables attaching the pilots' <b>control</b> <b>wheels</b> to the aileron boost unit had been removed two months before the accident during routine maintenance; a safety cable that held part of the assembly together had not been replaced when the cables were hooked back up. The contact slowly separated, until it completely failed during the takeoff sequence.|$|R

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal <b>wheel</b> <b>control.</b> One or more torque arms may be added to provide supplementary <b>wheel</b> <b>control,</b> particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the <b>wheels,</b> improving <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|R
50|$|For general {{submersion}} or surfacing, submarines use {{the forward}} and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which {{are filled with}} water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick <b>control</b> of <b>depth,</b> submarines use smaller <b>Depth</b> <b>Control</b> Tanks (DCT) - also called hard tanks (due {{to their ability to}} withstand higher pressure), or trim tanks. The amount of water in <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> tanks can be <b>controlled</b> to change <b>depth</b> or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. <b>Depth</b> <b>control</b> tanks may be located either near the submarine's center of gravity, or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting trim.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> of an {{unmanned}} semi-submersible vehicle (USV), the submersible depth of which should not exceed 3 meters to make the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> performance robust to environmental disturbances. <b>Depth</b> <b>control</b> performance, including overshoot values and static state error of depth, should be limited within pre-determined limits; otherwise, a venture issue may occur in the USV system. Therefore, achieving the desired performance even with unexpected sea wave disturbances to the USV system remains a challenge. Moreover, some model parameters are unknown. The control parameters of the improved identification state feedback control are presented for the USV diving plane control. Lake trials are performed to validate that the suggested controller has good control performances and strong immunity to couple state surge speed and the lake environments...|$|R

40|$|During a {{constant}} depth maneuver of an {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV), its pitch attitude and stern plane deflections create forces and moments to achieve equilibrium in the vertical plane. If an AUV has a proportional controller only in its <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> loop, then different weights or centers of gravity will cause different steady-state depth errors at trimmed conditions. In general, a steady-state depth error can be eliminated by adding an integral controller in the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> loop. However, an improper integrator {{may lead to a}} bad transient response, even though the steady-state depth error can finally be eliminated. To remove the steady-state depth error, this study proposes methods that adjust the depth command and add a switching integral controller in the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> loop.

2500|$|The ERCO 310, which {{included}} a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at College Park Airport and was soon renamed the [...] "Ercoupe". The easy-to-fly design included unique design features, including a large glazed canopy for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new Continental A-65 horizontal. Lacking rudder pedals, the Ercoupe was flown using only the <b>control</b> <b>wheel.</b> A two-control system linked the rudder and aileron systems, which controlled yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>controlled</b> the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both {{on the ground and}} in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for rudder pedals. A completely new category of pilot's license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a rudder pedal.|$|R
