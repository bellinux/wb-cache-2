40|$|Purpose: A recent <b>field</b> <b>safety</b> <b>notice</b> from TomoTherapy {{detailed}} the underdosing of small, off-axis targets when receiving high doses per fraction. This {{is due to}} angular undersampling in the dose calculation gantry angles. This study evaluates a correction method to reduce the underdosing, to be implemented in the current version (v 4. 1) of the TomoTherapy treatment planning software. Methods: The correction method, termed 2 ̆ 2 Super Sampling 2 ̆ 2 involved the tripling {{of the number of}} gantry angles from which the dose is calculated during optimization and dose calculation. Radiochromic film was used to measure the dose to small targets at various off-axis distances receiving a minimum of 21 Gy in one fraction. Measurements were also performed for single small targets {{at the center of the}} Lucy phantom, using radiochromic film and the dose magnifying glass (DMG). Results:Without super sampling, the peak dose deficit increased from 0...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In vitro human {{diagnostic}} (IVD) company recalls are {{a common}} practice aimed to either minimize a potential error or eliminate an existing failure. In this case report, we aim to provide a critical analysis of a recent IVD recall {{and to provide a}} practical framework about what to do when an IVD company recalls product(s) based on the International Organization for Standardization - ISO 15189 : 2012 standard. Case report: In 2014, Abbott Laboratories® (Green Oaks, IL) published an urgent <b>field</b> <b>safety</b> <b>notice</b> regarding a product recall (Architect Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) Assay List Number 8 K 25) with immediate action required. The IVD company explained the reasons for the recall as follows: i) Abbott has confirmed that a performance shift in the Architect Intact PTH assay has the potential to generate falsely elevated results on patient samples; ii) results generated with impacted lots may demonstrate a positive shift relative to those generated with previous reagent and/or calibrator lots. This issue may also impact established Architect Intact PTH reference ranges; iii) the magnitude of shift averages approximately 13 % to 45 %; iv) Abbott Architect Intact PTH controls do not detect the shift; and v) all current reagent, calibrator, and control inventory are impacted. The recall could have resulted in ~ 40, 000 inaccurate laboratory tests reported by 18 laboratories from Italy (Lombardy region). Conclusion: IVD company recalls have a serious impact on the patient safety and require a thorough investigation and responsible approach to minimize the possible damage. Medical laboratories accredited according to the ISO 15189 standard have procedures in place to manage such situations and ensure that patient safety is maintained when such recalls are issue...|$|E
40|$|Background Medical {{devices are}} used widely for {{virtually}} every disease and condition. Although devices {{are subject to}} regulation, the number of recalls, the clinical data requirements for regulation and the impact on patient safety are poorly understood. Methods The authors defined a device using European directives and used publicly available information on the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority website {{to determine the number}} of devices recalled from January 2006 to December 2010. Two reviewers independently assessed <b>Field</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Notices</b> and Medical Device Alerts. The authors wrote to manufacturers to obtain further information and clinical data, and summarised data by year, Conformité Européenne classification, indication, and Food and Drug Administration recall system of severity. Results In total, 2124 <b>field</b> <b>safety</b> <b>notices</b> were issued over the 5 -year period, an increase of 1220 % (62 in 2006 to 757 in 2010). 447 Medical Device Alerts were issued in the same period, and 44 % were assessed as a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death. The authors wrote to 192 manufacturers of withdrawn devices and received 101 (53 %) replies; only four (2. 1 %) provided the clinical data the authors requested. A lack of available transparent data prevented full analyses of the safety impact. Of the highest-risk recalled devices, more than half were related to the cardiovascular system (25 %) or musculoskeletal system (33 %), and 88 % (95 % CI 80 % to 97 %) were assessed as a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death. For low-risk devices, the figure was 34 % (95 % CI 26 % to 42 %). Conclusion The number of medical devices subject to recalls or warnings in the UK has risen dramatically. A substantial number of these devices may have caused serious adverse effects in patients and contributed to healthcare costs. Significant problems exist in the UK with a lack of access to transparent data and a registry of the highest-risk devices...|$|R

40|$|Background: Innovations {{play the}} {{key role in}} the success of {{orthopaedic}} surgery. However, even minor modifications in the established concepts and proven designs may result in disasters. The endemic of modular femoral neck fracture (24 cases of about 4000 implanted) in fully modular total hip arthroplasty, popular in our country for the last 20 years, seems to challenge us with such an unfortunate consequences. The aim of this report was to analyze the extent and the causes of the problem {{on the one hand and}} to propose possible solutions on the other. Methods: Literature search for problems associated with Profemur Z (or earlier versions with the same taper-cone design) fully-modular femoral stem made of titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) was performed, and hip arthroplasty registries were searched to evaluate the failure rates of the mentioned design. Mechanisms of failure were studied to get in-depth understanding of this particular hip reconstruction device. Results: Since 2010 onwards, several case reports on catastrophic modular femoral neck fractures of Profemur Z were published. Te frst Slovenian case was described in 2012. The first two larger series with modular femoral neck fractures were published in 2016. Te Australian Joint Replacement Registry was the first to discover increased revision rates due to fractures of this hip reconstruction system. Public Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (JAZMP) received frst two reports regarding Profemur Z modular neck complication from abroad in 2010, the first Slovenian report was received in 2012, and altogether 7 reports from Slovenian hospitals were received until December 2016. Corrosion at the neck-taper interface, where two equal or diﬀerent materials are subject to constant wear in the presence of body ﬂuids, is assumed to be responsible for the unacceptable high failure rate. Conclusions: Manufacturers are responsible to produce and market only safe devices. However, orthopaedic surgeons should carefully monitor any adverse eﬀect of innovations. JAZMP took adequate measures only after having received an urgent <b>field</b> <b>safety</b> corrective <b>notice</b> from the manufacturer in 2015 indicating that all lots of long modular necks made from cobalt-chromium alloy should be withdrawn. Tis should be viewed in concordance with the fact that the regulatory agency of the Republic of Slovenia was not receiving vigilance reports accurately and was thus unaware of the extent of this complication. A national arthroplasty registry would probably warn orthopaedic community on this questionable innovation earlier. Regulatory bodies should therefore establish such a registry as soon as possible, for the benefit of our patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} sentencing {{outcomes for}} contravention of family violence intervention orders in Victoria over two periods: 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 to 2011 – 12. Summary This report examines sentencing outcomes for contravention of family violence intervention orders over two periods: 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 to 2011 – 12. It also examines sentencing outcomes for contravention of family violence <b>safety</b> <b>notices,</b> which became available in December 2008 upon {{the commencement of}} the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 (Vic). The Use of Family Violence Intervention Orders and <b>Safety</b> <b>Notices</b> (Chapter 2) Underlying trends {{in the use of}} intervention orders and <b>safety</b> <b>notices</b> have influenced sentencing outcomes for contravention. The nature and extent of intervention order use has changed significantly, particularly since the introduction of the Family Violence Protection Act in 2008. Since 2004 – 05, there has been: 	an 82. 2 % {{increase in the number of}} intervention orders made by the Magistrates’ Court 	a 72. 8 % increase in reports of family violence incidents to Victoria Police 	a 295. 4 % increase in the number of children named as protected persons on intervention orders. Children now represent the single largest category of protected persons (46. 1 % of protected persons in 2011 – 12) 	an increase in family violence intervention orders initiated by Victoria Police. By 2011 – 12, the majority (67 %) of intervention orders were initiated by Victoria Police. In 2004 – 05, a minority (41 %) of intervention orders were initiated by Victoria Police. Sentencing Outcomes for Intervention Order and <b>Safety</b> <b>Notice</b> Contravention (Chapter 4) The sentencing outcomes for contravention of intervention orders have changed significantly. Between 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 to 2011 – 12 : 	Fines, adjourned undertakings and community orders remained the most common sentences for intervention order contravention, but the distribution of these sentences changed markedly. 	Fines were imposed in 25. 8 % of cases (a decline of 30. 5 %), adjourned undertakings were imposed in 23. 4 % of cases (an increase of 27. 1 %) and community orders were imposed in 19. 2 % of cases (an increase of 9. 1 %). 	The sentencing outcomes for <b>safety</b> <b>notice</b> contravention were very similar to the sentencing outcomes for intervention order contravention. 	The use of fines declined by 34 % in cases where the contravention offence was the only offence sentenced, and by 32 % in cases where co-occurring offences were sentenced alongside the contravention offence. Accordingly, there was a shift away from fines even when controlling for wider criminality. 	For repeat intervention order contravention (that is, where an offender had previously been sentenced for contravening an intervention order), the use of fines almost halved and custodial sentences increased. As a result, imprisonment became, by a small margin, the most common sentence in repeat contravention cases (21. 7 % of cases). 	The shift away from fines was unique to contravention offences and did not reflect broader sentencing trends in the Magistrates’ Court. Explaining the Change in Sentencing Outcomes (Chapter 5) Based on consultations with stakeholders, the Council concludes that a change in sentencing practices – rather than a change in the nature of the contravention behaviour – is responsible for the most recent sentencing outcomes. Stakeholders consistently remarked on a cultural shift in the response to family violence by key criminal justice institutions, particularly the courts and police. The legislative and procedural reforms of the past five to ten years have brought about this process of cultural change. These reforms include: 	the introduction of the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 (Vic); 	procedural changes by Victoria Police, particularly pursuant to the revised Code of Practice for the Investigation of Family Violence, published in 2010; and 	the increasingly specialised nature of family violence decision-making and service provision in the Magistrates’ Court. Stakeholders commented that there is now a deeper understanding of the nature of family violence on the part of magistrates and police, which has in turn affected the sentences imposed for intervention order and <b>safety</b> <b>notice</b> contravention...|$|R
