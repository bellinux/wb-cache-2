5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) {{leaves his}} trailer for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear growling outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd).

5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between April and August 1995, Brock {{returns to}} New York City in prusuit of supervillain Carnage after learning about Carnage Unleashed, {{a video game}} based on Carnage's rampage in Maximum Carnage (1993). Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people playing the game. He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage in cyberspace, before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, reasoning that death is what <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> <b>A</b> subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: Sinner Takes All.|$|E
25|$|The {{etiquette}} surrounding {{using the}} fireplace for communication is not explicitly {{addressed in the}} series. Dumbledore tells Harry it is not polite for a wizard to apparate (appear out of thin air) directly into another wizard's house. However, Harry uses floo powder to cause his head into Grimmauld Place unannounced. On the other hand, we see Severus Snape call Lupin's name and tell him <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> word before speaking to Remus Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, {{but the truth is that}} he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.|$|E
25|$|On Christmas Day, Gavin texts Sharon {{and later}} arrives at her house, saying he has missed her. Sharon hurries {{him out and}} he leaves her a present. He also visits her in {{hospital}} when her son Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) {{is involved in a}} car crash. He invites her to Hong Kong but she declines, promising to still keep in touch and thanking him for the present. When Sharon tells Gavin that she is ending her marriage to Phil, he visits her, offering his support. She rejects him and the gift he has left for Dennis, saying she does not want liars in her life, but he insists he has never lied to her and reminds her of his offer to join him overseas, insisting that he will have a steady job and that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> second chance of having a family. Sharon and Dennis later join Gavin.|$|E
25|$|Jake {{constantly}} {{worries about}} Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent {{in his next}} fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro {{in front of the}} local Mob boss, Tommy Como, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.|$|E

25|$|On Apokolips, Darkseid and Desaad {{discuss the}} coming of a time with {{existence}} being recreated with Darkseid as the architect. Darkseid has {{what appears to be}} a chess-board with pieces representing the Joker, Donna Troy, Green Arrow, the Flash, Holly Robinson, Batman, Jason Todd, Hawkman, Killer Croc, Martian Manhunter, Superman, Wonder Woman, OMAC, Jimmy Olsen, Nightwing, Duela Dent, and Black Adam. Later, as the New Gods Lightray and Sleez are killed by an unknown, mysterious figure, Darkseid converses with a concubine and Desaad. When the concubine comments on Darkseid showing a moment of weakness, Darkseid kills her and tells Desaad to remove the vocal cords from the next concubine. The conversation is witnessed by Forager of New Genesis, who is spying on them to see if Darkseid is responsible for the recent murders of the New Gods. Forager is attacked by a guard and escapes. The Deep Six are killed soon afterwards by the same mysterious figure. Darkseid shows knowledge of the New Gods dying across the galaxy and the mystery figure killing them, and decides to use the New Gods as pawns in a complex scheme intended to result in his rule of the entire Multiverse. Mary Marvel is brought before Darkseid, who tells her that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> sorcerer and that she is it. When she refuses his offer, they briefly fight before Desaad arrives and distracts Darkseid long enough for Mary to escape. Eclipso assures Darkseid that she will bring Mary back. Darkseid later restores Mary's powers and orders her to capture Jimmy Olsen. Later, Darkseid is about to siphon Jimmy's superpowers out of him before his son Orion emerges from a boom tube and apparently kills him after ripping his heart out. The Monitor Solomon places a chess piece of Darkseid onto the Source Wall as a memento of his victory.|$|E
500|$|After practice, Sparky appears and mounts another male dog. The next day, after class, Stan {{asks his}} teacher Mr. Garrison what a {{homosexual}} is, prompting Mr. Garrison {{to claim that}} [...] "gay people are evil". As a result, Stan attempts to make his dog heterosexual. Later, Sparky overhears a frustrated Stan ranting about how <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> butch dog instead of a gay dog. This prompts Sparky to run away to the mountains, ending up at Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.|$|E
500|$|The {{manifesto}} {{included a}} clampdown on corruption {{and a new}} Ministerial Code, which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. Brown also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> [...] "better constitution" [...] that is [...] "clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today". He planned {{to set up an}} all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between Whitehall and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops are sent into action in future.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{examined}} issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent {{in much of}} Hemingway's work. He was interested in cross-gender themes, as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women. In his fiction, a woman's hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender. Brett, with her short hair, is androgynous and compared to a boy—yet the ambiguity {{lies in the fact}} that she is described as a [...] "damned fine-looking woman." [...] While Jake is attracted to this ambiguity, Romero is repulsed by it. In keeping with his strict moral code <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> feminine partner and rejects Brett, among other things, because she will not grow her hair.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent. [...] Nennius, a ninth-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of}} the Hwicce, which was along the Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. [...] If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> hot bath, it will be hot". [...] Bede also describes hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius.|$|E
500|$|While heading back, Peter hears {{an alarm}} {{coming from a}} {{landfill}} and investigates. It ends up being a trap and he is attacked with sonic blasts by Montana, now wearing the suit and calling himself [...] "Shocker". When he is close to moving in for the kill, one of the thugs used as bait, Alex O'Hirn, accidentally gives Spider-Man time to recover. Shocker then knocks him into a machine and, satisfied, leaves via helicopter. Spider-Man, however, survives but his paycheck was torn to shreds. The next day after school, where Harry is outraged with him over missing out on studying, Peter goes to replace his check at the Bugle where assistant editor Joe Robertson suggests getting a better camera. After Jonah takes a photo of Spider-Man covered in garbage as Peter's submission, Peter goes after O'Hirn and his partner Flint Marko as Spider-Man. He defeats them and tells them to inform Shocker <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> rematch.|$|E

500|$|Chapter one, titled [...] "Gadgets a go-go," [...] {{begins with}} the {{inventor}} Cid presenting Chocobo {{with a pair of}} [...] "Jet-Blades" [...] and offers Chocobo a chance to take a test-run with them on the racetrack behind his lab. After the race, Mog the Moogle drops in and asks Cid about the progress of the racing machine he'd commissioned. Cid promises to bring the machine by tomorrow, but later confides to Chocobo he'd forgotten it. The next day, after presenting the doubtful Mog with his scooter, Chocobo and Mog race. After Chocobo wins, Mog confronts Cid over his vehicle's poor performance, but Cid replies that Chocobo won because of the differences in their abilities (i.e., Chocobo's [...] "Dash"). He explains that the secret of Chocobo's [...] "Dash" [...] ability is the Blue Crystal on his leg-ring. Mog mulls over his inferior [...] "Flap" [...] ability and decides <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> Blue Crystal as well, so Cid recommends that the two go on an adventure to find out the secret of the Blue Crystal.|$|E
500|$|Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone {{asserted}} that [...] "This is 100 percent {{having to do}} with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem—and he's cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians." [...] According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had [...] "heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E
500|$|Dwight, who dresses up as Belsnickel, {{has one of}} the {{warehouse}} workers, Nate, dress up as Belsnickel's assistant, [...] Zwarte Piet, before the office vetoes the idea, feeling that it is racist. Dwight presents the camera with a picture of he and his brother celebrating Christmas, and a version of the same photo decorated {{in the style of the}} 1999 science fiction film The Matrix. When Jim is trying to convince the office to do Dwight's idea, he mispronounces one of the German character's names, calling him [...] "Hufflepuff", one of the four houses of the magical school Hogwarts from the book series Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling. Creed Bratton (a fictionalized version of the actual Creed Bratton) mentions that, for this years party, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Tapas Swiss Miss"-themed party, which is a combination of Spanish tapas and Swiss Miss hot cocoa. Andy, via email, tells Erin that he saw the 2012 movie Life of Pi, an adaptation of the book of the same name. He also notes that he wants to see the first part of Peter Jackson's 2012 film [...] Pete and Kevin make several references to the film Die Hard by quoting lines from the movie, with Erin and Pete eventually watching the movie.|$|E

500|$|Bath {{may have}} been the site of the Battle of Badon (500 AD), in which King Arthur is said to have {{defeated}} the Anglo-Saxons. The town was captured by the West Saxons in 577 after the Battle of Deorham; the Anglo-Saxon poem The Ruin may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. A monastery was founded at an early date– reputedly by Saint David although more probably in 675 by Osric, King of the Hwicce, perhaps using the walled area as its precinct. Nennius, a 9th-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of the}} Hwicce along the River Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> hot bath, it will be hot". Bede described hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius. King Offa of Mercia gained control of the monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter.|$|E
500|$|On December 31, 1999, Quahog {{prepares for}} New Year's Day (which {{is the last}} New Year's Day of the {{millennium}}), and the family has been invited to Joe's millennium party. At a store, {{a man in a}} chicken suit asks Peter if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> coupon, but Peter refuses, recalling the time he got a bad coupon from Ernie the Giant Chicken and started a massive fistfight. The man then warns Peter that the world will end because of the Y2K problem, so Peter locks himself and the family in their basement in hazmat suits. Just after midnight, the Y2K bug hits, causing a worldwide nuclear attack The Griffins remain unharmed, and as they look for survivors, they discover that Joe has been melted into his driveway, his son Kevin has been vaporized, and Quagmire and Cleveland have been stitched together and are now called [...] "Clevemire" [...] (or [...] "Quagland"), and Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons have eaten Tricia Takanawa. Starving, Peter immediately eats all the dehydrated meals, without adding water. Peter recalls that the snack food Twinkies are the only food that can survive a nuclear holocaust, so the family travels to Natick, Massachusetts, in hopes that the Twinkie factory has survived.|$|E
500|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{coronation}} of Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg (Heinrich George), a man much beloved by his Swabian people, who swears an oath to obey {{the laws of the}} dukedom [...] "according to the traditional Württemberg loyalty and honesty." [...] However, the Duke soon becomes frustrated because the Württemberg Diet (the provincial council) refuses him the funds needed to maintain a lifestyle comparable to his neighboring sovereigns; in particular, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> personal bodyguard, an opera company, and a ballet company. Lacking funds even to purchase coronation gifts for the Duchess (Hilde von Stolz), the Duke sends a courtier to Frankfurt to borrow money from Joseph Süß Oppenheimer (Ferdinand Marian). Süß shows the emissary jewels and jewelry that are obviously beyond the Duke's means and then says that it would be his honor to provide the Duke with jewelry at a substantial discount. However, Süß insists on presenting the items to the Duke personally despite a ban against Jews (Judensperre) entering the city that has been in force for over a century. Armed with a pass from the Duke, Süß cuts his hair, shaves his beard, and dons [...] "Christian" [...] clothes so that he can enter Württemberg disguised as a Christian. As his carriage gets into an accident, Süß gets a lift from Dorothea Sturm (Kristina Söderbaum) to the city.|$|E
