500|$|The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers, {{each have}} their own {{individual}} influences and playing style. Dave Murray {{is known for his}} legato technique which, he claims, [...] "evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, and I liked that style of playing." [...] Stating that he [...] "was inspired by blues rock rather than metal," [...] Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a [...] "melodic player." [...] Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's [...] "rhythmic" [...] sound.|$|E
500|$|After touring in Europe and North America {{for several}} years with Lilith Fair, Lhasa moved to France in 1999 to join her sisters in Pocheros, a circus/theatre company. Lhasa sang in the troupe's show called [...] "La Maison Autre" [...] ("The Other House"). Living out of {{trailers}} with her sisters and traveling from place to place, Lhasa said it was [...] "like when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up." [...] She eventually reached Marseille, where she started writing songs again. After composing enough material, Lhasa returned to Montreal with her new songs to produce her second album, The Living Road, which was released in 2003. While La Llorona had been entirely in Spanish, The Living Road included songs in English, French and Spanish.|$|E
500|$|The Chariot is {{frequently}} called a Christian band, which Scogin agreed {{with in a}} 2005 interview: [...] "We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band. We are not ashamed of our beliefs but we don’t force feed people what we believe either." [...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't. It wasn't like, 'Oh, they don't believe the same thing I do,' [...] People care {{too much about the}} fashion of it all. To me, a band's either good or they ain't, and that's the only thing that should matter." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{developing}} new characters {{for the sixth}} season of Desperate Housewives, showrunner Marc Cherry and his writing staff aimed to create a housewife who would {{be different from the}} other female characters on the series. Cherry stated that he [...] "wanted someone who didn't seem suburban, who has a tough, blue-collar exterior." [...] The staff ultimately decided upon an Italian New Yorker. Cherry stated that part of his inspiration for the character came from his childhood neighbors. He explained, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up in Huntington, Calif., two Italian families from the Bronx moved in across the street. We were so WASPy, so middle American. They had their own ethnic identity. It was an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Cherry insisted that Angie was not replacing the deceased Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan) as a main housewife but would instead be the focus of the season's mystery.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

500|$|Many live {{instruments}} were {{used during the}} album's production, especially violin. Milian named [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] {{one of her favorite}} songs on the album. It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, I found people were always trying to label me. The first day of school it would be like 'Here comes this girl all dressed up. She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me.

500|$|Since Carey {{intended}} #1's {{to serve}} as a sign of gratitude to her fans, the album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums. The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' [...] "Sweetheart" [...] (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album Daydream, and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, [...] "I was thinking of the old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a really cute record. Young girls'll like it the way I liked it when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up." [...] Another new song featured on #1's was [...] "When You Believe", which Carey said was included because she felt it was [...] "a miracle" [...] that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song [...] "When You Believe" [...] for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt. Carey and Houston were shown the film separately, and both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project. In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding [...] "When You Believe" [...] and working with Whitney Houston: ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

500|$|Following her {{comeback}} {{with lead}} single [...] "Applause" [...] from the album, Gaga performed few {{songs from the}} record at the iTunes Festival in London in September 2013. One of the songs, known as [...] "I Wanna Be with You", was performed as an acoustic version on the festival; Gaga called it an ode to her fans and about how much she had missed them while recuperating from the surgery. The song, later renamed to [...] "Dope", was written by Gaga, Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, Dino Zisis and Nick Monson and produced by Gaga and Rick Rubin. Described by Gaga as an electronic ballad, [...] "Dope" [...] was revealed to be [...] "the evolution of a fan song that became a deep confession in me." [...] In an interview with Kiss FM (UK) Gaga said that [...] "Dope" [...] was the most personal song she had ever created. Feeling that the album needed something more autobiographical and confessional and a song which would show her vulnerable side, Gaga worked with Rubin who let her do the song {{in the way she}} wanted and just assisted in recording it. He had contacted Gaga for producing the track, while she was on her sabbatical; Gaga consulted with Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, her main producer for Artpop and then decided to enlist Rubin's help. [...] "'Dope' is actually about me battling all sorts of addiction since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up", she explained to the interviewers.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like.
