40|$|ABSTRACT: Trees in the {{production}} systems can effectively reduce hot weather-induced stress in the Brazilian Midwest. High temperatures cause changes in animals daily routine, and trees into pastures can promote benefits. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the behavior of dairy heifers in silvopastoral systems in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. A herd of 24 crossbreed heifers (3 / 4 and 7 / 8 Holstein/Zebu), 350 kg average weight, was evaluated over three seasons. Piatã grass was managed under three shade levels: full-sun, moderate-shade, and intensive-shade provided by 10 to 12 m high Eucalyptus trees. Behavior data were collected every 15 minutes from 8 : 30 h to 16 h. Shade availability significantly impacted heifer behavior, mainly affecting <b>grazing</b> frequency and <b>time</b> during the hottest hours.

40|$|Development of {{selection}} objectives for beef cattle requires {{consideration of the}} available feed resources. In production systems with access to liberal quantities of harvested feeds of relatively high quality, selection to improve economic efficiency will normally favor animals with high genetic potentials for the primary production traits. However, these highly productive types may also have relatively high maintenance requirements and be less efficient when nutrient restrictions prevent expression of genetic differences in appetite. This, important genotype × environment interactions may be observed. In range environments, animals may be restricted {{in the amount of}} forage that can be harvested. These restrictions usually arise from an inability of the animal to increase <b>grazing</b> <b>times</b> or geed intake rates beyond certain levels imposed by the sward and by innate animal requirements for rest and rumination. In addition, maintenance requirements are often elevated in range environments, thereby further limiting the increases in productive capacity that can be accommodated.

The nature of these relationships must be considered in the development {{of selection}} criteria...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} skill {{for developing a}} targeted grazing program is patience and commitment. However, understanding livestock and plant responses to grazing are critical in developing a targeted grazing program. The program should have a clear statement {{of the kind of}} animal, timing and rate of grazing necessary to suppress troublesome plants and maintain a healthy landscape. The grazing application should 1) cause significant damage to the target plants 2) limit damage to desired vegetation and 3) be integrated with other control strategies. First, to cause significant damage to targeted plants requires understanding when the target plant is most susceptible to grazing damage and when they are most palatable to livestock. Target plant palatability depends on the grazing animals inherited and developed plant preferences (i.e. the shape of sheep and goat’s mouths make them well suited for eating broad leaf weeds). Goats are also well designed for eating shrubs. Second, target plants often exist in a plant community with many desirable plants. The challenge is to select the correct animal, <b>grazing</b> <b>time</b> and grazing intensity to maximize the impact on the target plant while reducing it on the associated plant community. Finally, management objectives, target plant species, weather, topography, plant physiology, and associated plant communities are among the many variables that can determine treatment type and duration. Well-developed targeted grazing objectives and an adaptive management plan that takes into account other control strategies need to be in place.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{length of the}} allowed <b>grazing</b> <b>time</b> (Experiment 1), length of {{starvation}} time and placement in the rumen of inert bulk material before grazing (Experiment 2) on liquid and particulate rumen pool sizes, composition and fermentability was investigated. In Experiment 1, four lengths of allowed <b>grazing</b> <b>time</b> (1. 00, 1. 75, 2. 50 and 3. 25 h) after overnight starvation were compared. The allowed <b>grazing</b> <b>time</b> had no significant effect on total and liquid rumen pool sizes after grazing but did affect (P < 0. 05) dry-matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) rumen pool sizes. The non-significant diferences between the volatile fatty acid (VFA) rumen pool sizes before and after 1 h of grazing may indicate a delay in {{the availability of the}} more rapidly fermentable substrate for the microorganisms. The total VFA remen pool sizes increased significantly (P < 0. 01) with the allowed <b>grazing</b> <b>time,</b> which suggests that these fermentation products may be involved in the control of the <b>grazing</b> <b>time</b> in later stages during the day. Experiment 2 consisted of a factorial combination of two lengths of starvation before grazing (16. 5 and 2. 5 h) and the presence or absence in the rummen of 12. 5 kg of a synthetic indigestible material. The duration of starvation before grazing did not affect significantly the particulate, ammonia and VFA rumen pool sizes after grazing except for propionic acid, which was reduced (P < 0. 09) by the longer starvation time. The inclusion of inert bulk material in the rumen before grazing significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) the total, Liquid DM, OM, and ammonia rumen pool sizes but not the VFA rumen pool sizes after grazing.

[...] The little changes they do make in their diet cause them to be in a poor state when winter finally arrives.

[...] It is difficult for elk to forage in the winter due to snowfall and lack of suitable live plants. Even without nutrient deficiency from changes in summer foraging patterns, their body conditions deteriorate (Christianson and Creel, 2010).

40|$|Growing {{pearl millet}} and cowpea in {{combination}} with raising ruminant livestock is widely practiced in the Sahel. In this farming system, livestock feeding depends mostly on rangeland, fallows and cropland grazing. Nutritional constraints to grazing ruminants stem primarily from feed scarcity and seasonal fluctuations in feed supply associated with low rainfall and poor soil fertility. Low feed quality exacerbates the effects of feed scarcity and seasonality. Some herd management practices result in decreased <b>grazing</b> <b>times</b> and feed intake and (or) increased energy expenditures for walking. Land tenure and use tights, among other socioeconomic factors, constrain the nutrition of livestock by limiting herd mobility and access to feed resources. Expansion of copping areas onto rangeland may result in higher overall feed yields but limits feed availability and access to grazing lands during the rainy season. Nutrition of livestock can be improved with better herd and range management practices, increasing {{the quantity and quality}} of feed produced on range and cropland and by using feed supplements. These options need to be profitable and compatible with the resource endowment and production objectives to be adopted by farmers. Policies and institutional arrangements are also required to facilitate herd mobility and access to water and grazing land and to solve and prevent conflicts among users of these resources...|$|R
