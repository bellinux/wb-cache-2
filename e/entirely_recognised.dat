Within {{the last two}} hours I have [...] accepted the office of secretary for the colonies, succeeding Lord [...] Stanley, who resigns. The last twenty-four have been very anxious [...] hours. Yesterday afternoon (two hours after Holy Communion) Lincoln [...] came {{to make an appointment}} on Peel's part. I went to meet him in [...] Lincoln's house at five o'clock. He detailed to me the [...] circumstances connected with the late political changes, asked me [...] for no reply, and gave me quantities of papers to read, including [...] letters of his own, the Queen's, and Lord J. Russell's, during the [...] crisis. This morning I had a conversation with Bonham [the party [...] whipper-in] upon the general merits, but without telling him [...] precisely what the proposal made to me was. Upon the whole my mind, [...] though I felt the weight of the question, was clear. I had to [...] decide what was best to be done now. I arrived speedily at the [...] conviction that now, at any rate, it is best that the question [...] should be finally settled; that Peel ought and is bound now to try [...] it; that I ought to support it in parliament; that if, in deciding [...] the mode, he endeavours to include the most favourable terms for [...] the agricultural body that it is in his power to obtain, I ought [...] not only to support it, by which I mean vote for it in parliament, [...] but likewise not to refuse to be a party to the proposal. I found [...] from him that he <b>entirely</b> <b>recognised</b> this view, and did feel [...] himself bound to make the best terms that he believed attainable, [...] while, on the other hand, I am convinced that we are now in a [...] position that requires provision to be made for the final abolition [...] of the corn law. Such being the state of matters, with a clear [...] conscience, but with a heavy heart, I accepted office. He was [...] exceedingly warm and kind. But it was with a heavy heart.... I [...] have seen Lord Stanley. 'I am extremely glad to hear you have taken [...] office,' said he. We go to Windsor to-morrow to a council--he to [...] resign the seals, and I to receive them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final round}} was called Next Lines, {{in which the}} host will speak a line of a song and the team must name the next line of the song. Often the songs chosen will be ones {{mentioned}} in earlier rounds and ones recorded by panel members. In the latter case, guests often prove incapable of reciting the lyrics to their own songs; for example, Romeo Stodart of The Magic Numbers failed <b>entirely</b> to <b>recognise</b> a line from a song which he joked was [...] "like the B-side from our first single".|$|R
5000|$|The {{nature of}} the air {{operation}} will frequently determine the type of medical control required, and in most cases, the available skill set of a typical paramedic. As a result, those operating in this environment will often be permitted to exercise more latitude in medical decision-making. Most systems operate almost <b>entirely</b> off-line, using <b>recognised</b> protocols for almost all procedures and only resorting to on-line medical control when protocols have been exhausted. Some Medical escort operations have full-time, on-site medical coordinators with relevant backgrounds ...|$|R
2500|$|A review from Alan Bisbort {{printed in}} The Daily Tar Heel had a {{headline}} that deemed the album [...] "cosmic hokum". Bisbort wrote about his criticisms of its concept {{and the idea}} of the group, [...] "who went East, got a shot of knowledge, came back West, had lots of money at their disposal ... and decided to cut an album guaranteed to give shortcut answers to the question for the multitude". He did not dismiss the album <b>entirely,</b> and <b>recognised</b> the group's musical talents. Tom Von Malder, for The Daily Herald, thought Yes [...] "seldom disappoints", but named Tales an exception, with [...] "Ritual" [...] being the only track that lives up to the strong material on Close to the Edge and Yessongs as it is the [...] "most cohesive, most lyrical of all". He thought the remaining three sides have some good music, but are too scattered, and claimed the album's concept is [...] "a bit too obtuse for a rock album". Holly Spence, in the Lincoln Evening Journal, called Tales a unique and creative album that displays an [...] "inventive combination of sounds and rhythms" [...] that is more interesting than the [...] "dull repetitive noise" [...] that she thought was typical of rock music at the time.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} gastric {{emptying}} in the preterm infant has been {{hampered by the}} absence of a suitable, valid technique. We have evaluated gastric antral clearance using serial ultrasonic measurement of the antral cross sectional area (ACSA). The study was easy to perform, providing successful results in 15 of 17 low birth-weight infants, with feed volumes of 8 - 31 ml/kg. ACSA was closely related to intragastric volume (mean (range) r = 0. 96 (0. 89 - 0. 99)). Measurements were reproducible: mean (SE) coefficient of variation was 7. 7 % (1. 1). Gastric antral clearance was observed as a fall in ACSA that began shortly after completion of the feed and returned to prefeed values at a variable rate. The pattern of gastric antral transit was <b>entirely</b> consistent with <b>recognised</b> patterns of gastric emptying and half gastric antral clearance times ranged from 20 - 63 minutes. Ultrasonic measurement of gastric antral clearance is a new technique allowing the study of gastric emptying in the preterm infant...|$|R
