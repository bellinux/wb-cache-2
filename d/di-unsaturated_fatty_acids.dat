Expression {{of the gene}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the synthesis of ricinoleic acid and very low levels of <b>di-unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the L. lindheimeri and castor bean oleate 12 -hydroxylase enzymes {{to those of the}} L. fendleri bifunctional oleate 12 -hydroxylase:desaturase and oleate 12 -desaturase enzymes from 32 diverse species identified a single amino acid (M 295) that was conserved in the hydroxylases and different but also conserved in the desaturases and the bifunctional enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that this residue was most likely not involved in determining the catalytic outcome of the hydroxylation/desaturation reaction. Transformation of an Arabidopsis fad 2 /fae 1 mutant line with the L. lindheimeri hydroxylase gave further evidence that this enzyme, like the castor oleate 12 -hydroxylase, is primarily a fatty acid hydroxylase and should not be considered bifunctional. Total hydroxy fatty acid content of up to 18 % of seed fatty acids was measured in homozygous transformants.

40|$|Paraoxonases (PONs) are a {{small family}} of {{antioxidant}} enzymes whose antiatherogenic activity is well known. The aim {{of the present study}} was the evaluation of the effects of moderate aerobic training on their expression using a rat model. In order to discriminate between PON 1 and PON 3 enzymatic activity, we took advantage of some differences in their substrate preferences. PON 1 and PON 3 enzymatic activities and their protein levels were analyzed in plasma and in liver microsomes, and their mRNA levels in the liver. Exercise training did not affect PON 1 expression or enzymatic activity but increased PON 3 mRNA, protein levels, and enzymatic activity. Training also induced variations in plasma membrane composition, including an increase in polyunsaturated and a decrease in mono- and <b>di-unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> On the other hand, acute exercise inhibited PON activities while increasing PON 3 protein content in liver microsomes and reversing the relative composition in mono-, di-, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that physical stress, by altering membrane composition, may impair PON release from liver membranes. In conclusion, we documented, for the first time, the presence of PON 3 in rat serum and, notably, found that the upregulation of PON 3, rather than PON 1, appears to be associated with physical training...|$|E

However, little is known about the role of the endogenous enzymes in cold-sensitive species such as cotton. Delta 12 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> desaturases (FAD 2), known to participate in adaptation to low temperatures through acyl chain modifications were used in gene expression studies in order to identify parameters of plant response to low temperatures. The induction of microsomal delta 12 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> desaturases at an mRNA level under cold stress in plants is shown here for first time. Quantitative PCR showed that though both delta 12 omega 6 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> desaturase genes FAD 2 - 3 and FAD 2 - 4 identified in cotton are induced under cold stress, FAD 2 - 4 induction is significantly higher than FAD 2 - 3. The induction of both isoforms was light regulated, in contrast a third isoform FAD 2 - 2 was not affected by cold or light. Stress tolerance and light regulatory elements were identified in the predicted promoters of both FAD 2 - 3 and FAD 2 - 4 genes. <b>Di-unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> species rapidly increased in the microsomal fraction isolated from cotton leaves, following cold stress.

40|$|AbstractTraditional diets {{of people}} living in the Mediterranean basin are, among other components, very rich in extra-virgin olive oil, the most typical source of visible fat. Olive is a priceless source of {{monounsaturated}} and <b>di-unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> polyphenolic antioxidants and vitamins. Oleuropein is the main glycoside in olives and is responsible for the bitter taste of immature and unprocessed olives. Chemically, oleuropein is the ester of elenolic acid and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl ethanol, which possesses beneficial effects on human health, such as antioxidant, antiatherogenic, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The phenolic fraction extracted from the leaves of the olive tree, which contains significant amounts of oleuropein, prevents lipoprotein oxidation. In addition, oleuropein has shown cardioprotective effect against acute adriamycin cardiotoxicity and an anti-ischemic and hypolipidemic activities. Recently, oleuropein has shown neuroprotection by forming a non-covalent complex with the Aβ peptide, which is a key hallmark of several degenerative diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson. Thus, a large mass of research has been accumulating in the area of olive oil, in the attempt to provide evidence for the health benefits of olive oil consumption and to scientifically support the widespread adoption of traditional Mediterranean diet as a model of healthy eating. These results provide a molecular basis for some of the benefits potentially coming from oleuropein consumption and pave the way to further studies on the possible pharmacological use of oleuropein to prevent or to slow down the cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E

PCC 7942. Wild-type cells synthesized saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, whereas desA+ cells, which had been transformed with the desA gene for the Δ 12 acyl-lipid desaturase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, also synthesized <b>di-unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Incubation of wild-type and desA+ cells with 0. 5 m NaCl resulted in the rapid loss of the activities of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the Na+/H+ antiport system both in light and in darkness. However, desA+ cells were more tolerant to salt stress and osmotic stress than the wild-type cells. The extent of the recovery of the various photosynthetic activities from the effects of 0. 5 m NaCl was much greater in desA+ cells than in wild-type cells. The photosystem II activity of thylakoid membranes from desA+ cells was more resistant to 0. 5 m NaCl than that of membranes from wild-type cells. These results demonstrated that the genetically engineered increase in unsaturation of fatty acids in membrane lipids significantly enhanced {{the tolerance}} of the photosynthetic machinery to salt stress. The enhanced tolerance was due both to the increased resistance of the photosynthetic machinery to the salt-induced damage and to the increased ability of desA+ cells to repair the photosynthetic and Na+/H+ antiport systems...|$|E
40|$|In the aerobic cell, oxygen can be {{converted}} {{into a series of}} reactive metabolites, together called as "reactive oxygen species" (ROS). This large group include both radical and non-radical species such as superoxide anion (02 "), hydroxyl radical (" 0 H), H 202, nitric oxide (N 0 ') and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). ROS are generated in very small amounts at all stages of aerobic life, and probably have a role in cellular regulation. However, their formation in excess leads to toxicity and damage to tissues. This situation, called 'oxidative stress', is responsible, atleast in part, to the pathophysioiogy of a number of disease states such as inflammation, arthritis, cancer, ageing, ischemia-reperfusion and several neurodegenerative disorders. Compared to other organs in the animal body, brain tissue is more vulnerable to oxidative stress. This is due to three major reasons; (1) brain has a high oxygen consumption (2) high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and iron, that can promote lipid peroxidation, and (3) low levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The inability of neurons to regenerate also contributes to exacerbate an oxidant damage in the brain. The main objective of this investigation was to identify biochemical systems in the brain that are susceptible to ROS, on the following two issues: 1. What are the targets for the action of H 2 O 2 and NO in the glycolytic cycle, the major route for the oxidation of glucose in brain? 2. What are the targets for the action of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their oxidative metabolites among the enzymes of phosphoinositide cycle (PI cycle), the ubiquitous signal transduction event in the brain? Using sheep brain cytosol, it was found that among the various glycolytic enzymes, only glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) was inhibited by H 2 O 2. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from sheep brain and its inactivation with H 202 was studied in detail. Commercial preparations of rabbit skeletal muscle GAPD was also used in this study. An unusual requirement of glutathione for the complete inactivtion of the enzyme by H 2 O 2 was observed. The H 2 O 2 -inactivated GAPD was partially reactivated by prolonged treatment with thiol compounds. Using CD-spectral analysis, a significant change was found in the secondary structure in H 2 O 2 -treated GAPD. GAPD was inactivated by NO only in presence of high concentrations of DTT and after prolonged incubation. The N 0 -inactivated GAPD was partially reactivated by treatment with thiol compounds. A new activity, namely ADP-ribosylation (ADPR) emerged in the NO-treated mammalian, but not in yeast. GAPD, ADPR activity could be generated in GAPD through NO-independent treatments such as incubation with NADPH and aerobic dialysis. During NADPH treatment no loss of dehydrogenase activity occurred. Thus, it was concluded that loss of dehydrogenase activity and emergence of ADPR in NO-treated GAPD were not correlated but coincidental, and that NO treatment yielded small amounts of modified-GAPD that had ADPR activity. In the brain, onset of ischemia is characterized by a significant elevation in free fatty acid (FFA) levels, predominantly, arachidonic acid (AA). It is suggested that AA can be oxidised to its metabolites like prostaglandins and 15 -hydroperoxy arachidonic acid (15 -HPETE) and some of these might exert toxic effects during reperfusion. Using whole membranes or tissue slices prepared from rat brain, effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their oxidative metabolites on five enzymes of PI cycle namely PI synthase, PI and PIP kinases, agonist-stimulated PLC and DG kinase was studied. Hydroperoxides of linoleic- and arachidonic acids inactivated PI synthase selectively among the PI cycle enzymes. Interestingly, AA selectively stimulated DG kinase in neural membranes. Docasahexaenoic acid (DHA) a highly unsaturated fatty acid found in the brain, also stimulated DG kinase activity while saturated, mono-and <b>di-unsaturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were ineffective. It was concluded that AA and DHA have a role in modulating neural DG kinase. The data presented in the thesis indicate that ROS have selective targets in cells and the consequent protein modifications can be used to modulate cellular functions under normal and oxidative stress conditions...|$|E

The <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> profile of freshwater fish species include minor amounts of odd-number, branched-chain, and even-number <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> as well as saturated components, the monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The major saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were C 14 : 0 and C 16 : 0. The C 18 : 1 is the prominent monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> while the C 18 : 2 is the dominant polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> compositions showed prominence in C 18 : 3 n- 3 and C 18 : 2 n- 6. The overall significance of this study had been its revelation that freshwater fish are good source of omega- 6 essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The high percent of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in freshwater fish gives them an advantage in curing processing...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are major sources of fat in the human diet, but there are few detailed reports on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of retail milk, trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in particular, and how these change throughout the year. Semi-skimmed milk was collected monthly for one year from five supermarkets and analysed for <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition. Relative to winter, milk sold in the summer contained lower total saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (SFA; 67 vs 72 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and higher cis-monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (MUFA; 23 vs 21 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and total trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (6. 5 vs 4. 5 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> concentrations. Concentrations of most trans- 18 : 1 and - 18 : 2 isomers also exhibited seasonal variation. Results were applied to national dietary intakes, and indicated that monthly variation in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of milk available at retail has limited influence on total dietary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> consumption by UK adults...|$|R
40|$|Exogenously {{supplied}} long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{have been}} shown to markedly alleviate the inhibition of phototrophic growth of cultures of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides caused by the antibiotic cerulenin. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated C 18 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were most effective in relieving growth inhibition mediated by cerulenin. Medium supplementation with saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (C 14 to C 18) failed to influence the inhibitory effect of cerulenin. The addition of mixtures of unsaturated and saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to the growth medium did not enhance the growth of cerulenin-inhibited cultures above that obtained with individual unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> as supplements. Resolution and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> analysis of the extractable lipids of R. sphaeroides revealed that exogenously supplied <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were directly incorporated into cellular phospholipids. Cells treated with cerulenin displayed an enrichment in their percentage of total saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> irrespective of the presence of exogenous <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Cerulenin produced comparable inhibitions of the rates of both <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and phospholipid synthesis and was further found to preferentially inhibit unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis...|$|R
50|$|The LCAD enzyme catalyzes most of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> beta-oxidation {{by forming}} a C2-C3 trans-double bond in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> LCAD works on {{long-chain}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> typically between C12 and C16-acylCoA. LCAD {{is essential for}} oxidizing unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> such as oleic acid, but seems redundant in the oxidation of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
40|$|Buffalo milk is the world’s {{second most}} widely pro- duced milk, and {{increasing}} attention {{is being paid}} to its composition, particularly the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile. The ob- jectives {{of the present study}} were (1) to characterize the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of Mediterranean buffalo milk, and (2) to investigate potential sources of variation in the buffalo milk <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile. We determined the profile of 69 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> traits in 272 individual samples of Mediterranean buffalo milk using gas chromatogra- phy. In total, 51 individual <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were identified: 24 saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> 13 monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and 14 polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The ma- jor individual <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in buffalo milk were in the order 16 : 0, 18 : 1 cis- 9, 14 : 0, and 18 : 0. Saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were the predominant fraction in buffalo milk fat (70. 49...|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition for fats {{differs from that}} of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> dietary cholesterol, and trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> than an unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule is broken down and categorized {{based on the number of}} carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Palmitic acid is a commonly studied example of the saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fish (Labeo coubie, Citharinus citharus, Hyperopisus bebe, Mormyrops anguilloides, Mormyrus rume, Orechromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Clarias gariepinus, Clarias anguillaris, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clariheterobranchus, Lates niloticus and Hydrocynus forskalii) were studied for their oil <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> composition. Identification and {{quantitative}} measurement of fish oils <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were carried out by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. GC-MS was applied on <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> methyl esters. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were identified in order of their retention time. Saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (SFA), monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (MUFA), polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (PUFA) formed {{a large proportion of}} total lipids. Multi-methyl branched, methyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> contributed a smaller proportion. It can be concluded that these fish oils are excellent sources of essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> omega- 6 and omega- 9...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of five wild edible {{mushroom}} species (Agrocybe cylindracea, Coprinus comatus, Lactarius deliciosus, Suillus collinitus and Tricholoma myomyces) {{collected from}} different regions from Anatolia were determined. The <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{were identified and}} quantified by gas chromatography and studied using fruit bodies. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition varied among species. The dominant <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in fruit bodies of all mushrooms was cis-linoleic acid (18 : 2). Percentage of cis-linoleic acid in species varied from 36. 29 - 66. 72 %. The other major <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were, cis-oleic, palmitic and stearic <b>acids,</b> respectively. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> analysis of the mushrooms showed that the unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were at higher concentrations than saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
