30|$|Ecosystems can be {{classified}} as either fire-dependent or non-fire-dependent based on their evolutionary history of exposure to fire (Mutch 1970). Fire-adapted habitats like the long-leaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern United States (Gilliam and Platt 1999) and the chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems of California (Keeley 1987) are well known for their resilience to fire and even promote fire through their inherent <b>flammable</b> <b>properties</b> (Bond and Keeley 2005). Animals living in these ecosystems also have adaptations to recurring fire {{that allow them to}} persist under such a significant disturbance regime (Mushinsky 1985, Russell et al. 1999).|$|R
5000|$|Michael George Zabetakis (7 July 1924 - 21 January 2005) was a {{fire safety}} {{engineering}} specialist. He received his PhD in chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh in 1956. [...] In 1965 he published data for flammability limits, autoignition, and burning-rate data for more than 200 combustible gases and vapors in air and other oxidants, {{as well as of}} empirical rules and graphs {{that can be used to}} predict similar data for thousands of other combustibles under a variety of environmental conditions. [...] The work remains one of the most widely cited sources of flammability data. Despite its age it was still in 1999 considered the standard reference. [...] Zabetakis often uses flammability diagrams to show <b>flammable</b> <b>properties</b> of fuel-air-nitrogen mixtures. Zabetakis was the first superintendent of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fires are}} one of the key factors that play a {{significant}} role influencing and shaping the forest ecosystems. In a natural ecosystem where the fire took place, it is known that many plant species demonstrate various adaptations at the point of survival or self-renewal after the fire. A number of hypotheses put forward that a direct impact of fire severities and the ignition time of fire on the plant (fuel characteristics) combustibility is associated with physical properties of plants. However, prior studies that prove a relationship between <b>flammable</b> <b>properties</b> of plants and survival of the plants after fires are quite insufficient. In this review paper, the relationship between fire and phenolic compounds that {{have an effect on the}} flammability, and the relationship between flame geometry and the ignition time of the chemical components in forest fire were examined...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} two decades ago, fullerene family has drawn remarkable attention {{because of their}} unique electrical, thermal, optical, mechanical and <b>flammable</b> <b>properties.</b> They {{have been widely used}} to improve polymer properties. These nanofillers produce huge interfacial areas between the polymer and the fillers. Despite the intensive research on fullerene nanocomposites, understanding {{of the importance of the}} filler-polymer interface is still limited and further investigation of the structure-property relationships is needed. This dissertation probed influence of nanoparticles on polymer tracer diffusion and molecular weight dependence of composite mechanical properties, and developed a coated particle process to obtain composites with high electrical conductivity. ^ Deuterated polystyrene (dPS) diffusion in nanoparticle/polystyrene (PS) nanocomposites was measured by an elastic recoil detection method. We used single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and C 60 as nanofillers and found that the nanofillers have a significant influence on polymer tracer diffusion. When the tracer molecules (Rg) are larger than the fillers (RCNT), the tracer diffusion coefficient exhibits a minimum as a function of filler concentration. In contrast, the tracer diffusion in nanocomposites is constant when the tracer chains are smaller than the fillers. A trap model simulation was developed to understand the minimum diffusion coefficient. ^ The load transfer mechanism from polymer matrix to fillers were studied by tensile testing and Raman spectroscopy in SWCNT/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposite fibers. Without strong filler-polymer interactions, effective load transfer is limited to small strains, and Raman peak shift and stress-strain curve of composite fibers are reversible, suggesting an elastic deformation. Beyond this strain region, the load transfer is nonlinear because of a slippage at the polymer-filler interface. The stress on nanotubes reaches a maximum and then decreases with further increase in the strain. ^ A coated particle process (CPP) method was developed to prepare nanocomposites with a cellular filler structure. The fillers are SWCNTs and PMMA is used as polymer matrix. Compared with the coagulated nanocomposites with well dispersed SWCNTs, the CPP-made nanocomposites have a higher electrical conductivity (2 orders higher), a smaller percolation threshold (50 %). ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is a key}} step of {{quantitative}} risk analysis (QRA) to estimate ignition probability of flammable materials after leakage accidents. This paper reviews the available literature and expert opinion on how to evaluate and determine ignition probability value, and it was detailedly discussed on the main influencing factors of ignition probability, including <b>flammable</b> material <b>properties,</b> mass flow rate of flammable materials spillage, ignition resources and ignition controls. Moreover, the operational and practical ignition probability value could be estimated from the all way of classifications of flammable material, mass flow rate, ignition resources, hazardous areas and ignition prevention and control measure. Furthermore, the more practical ignition probability model was put forward that the ignition probability was the maximum value of the probability decided by material properties (PMP), mass flow rate(PQ) and ignition resources(PIS) with the factor of preventing and controlling ignition (KIC). Finally, the further research was proposed to assign some feasible weigh factors of the ignition probability for flammable materials after leakage accidents...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{fire has}} been seen as an {{important}} modeler of ecological systems, especially through the history of fire-adapted systems (e. g., savannas and Mediterranean ecosystems). Nevertheless, hot deserts in the southwestern US (the Sonoran and Mojave) are thought to be non-fire adapted systems due to the scarce woody plants and insufficient vegetation cover to carry fire. Over the last few decades, however, fire have become more prevalent within the mentioned deserts because of the recent invasions of exotics grasses that now sufficiently provide a continuous plant coverage that is able to spread fire through the landscape. To date, however, fire effects on desert ecosystems remain unclear. I this dissertation I examined the impact of fire in changing the spatial distribution of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in burned areas of the Sonoran Desert (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, I assessed the effects of fire on changing the availability of soil nutrients, comparing burned and unburned areas of the Mojave Desert. In Chapter 4, I moved forward and investigated flammability characteristics of desert plant species, and how these properties were related to the spread of fire. Overall, I found that (i) fire changed the spatial pattern of L. tridentata shrubs that survived the fire, compared to areas not affected by fire; (ii) over the short term (i. e., 6 months after fire) there was an increment of soil nutrients (N and K) within burned areas, compared to unburned areas, but over the long-term (i. e., 7 years after fire) N and K decreased, especially under the canopy of L. tridentata shrubs; and (iii) native plant species exhibited flammability characteristics that confer them properties of 2 ̆ 2 igniters 2 ̆ 2 of thicker fuels, whereas exotic invasive species presented <b>flammable</b> <b>properties</b> of 2 ̆ 2 spreaders 2 ̆ 2 of fire. In summary, the interplay of the three major ideas described above provided insights about the potential novel plant-fire dynamics in the southwestern US deserts. Given the flammable characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 spreaders 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 igniters 2 ̆ 2, the prevalence of wildfires may be continued over time. While fire can kill large sections of L. tridentata shrubs, this phenomenon would provide more openness in the landscape to be colonized by exotic invasive species. Over the long-term, and as soil nutrients tend to decrease within burned areas, {{it would be difficult for}} native species, including L. tridentata shrub, to recover after fire. Thus, heterogeneous fertility islands once associated with Larrea shrubs may disappear and become replaced by more uniform nutrient landscapes, dominated by exotic invasive grasses...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} concern about {{accidental}} releases and dispersion of toxic and flammable industrial chemicals into the atmosphere. Their toxic effects and/or <b>flammable</b> <b>properties,</b> combined with their widespread use and transport through urban areas, make most industrial chemicals very dangerous. Many industrial chemicals are transported and stored as pressurized liquefied gases in large quantities. The chemical, petrochemical and petroleum industries, {{as well as}} regulatory agencies, need realistic dispersion simulations for risk analysis purposes. If accidentally released into the atmosphere, a pressurized liquefied gas suffers a rapid de-pressurisation {{and as a consequence}} boils violently. This process {{is referred to as the}} flashing process. Complete flashing results in the formation of a two-phase jet with high momentum. Some of the droplets may deposit on the ground and form a pool which gradually evaporates. This thesis presents the development of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology for studies of pressurized liquefied gas releases into the atmosphere. The methodology is implemented in the CFD model FLACS. The performances of existing source term models in predicting recent experimental observations are assessed. It is found that the energy balance model gives the best predictions for the mass flow rate at the exit orifice. Uncertainties are present in the quality of the predictions for the size distribution of droplets and it is recommended to perform sensitivity studies. Investigation of the dispersion of heavy particles in isotropic turbulent flows by means of the Kinematic Simulation approach allows emphasizing the importance of the inertia and crossing trajectory effects. An Euler-Euler approach based on the assumption of homogeneous flow, namely the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM), and an Euler-Lagrange approach are implemented in the FLACS CFD model in order to simulate two-phase flows. The two-phase flow models are validated against laboratory scale experiments. Improvements of the current FLACS models for liquid spreading and evaporation on the ground are developed and an algorithm is implemented in order to solve the equations of the pool model on a user-defined uniform grid. Obstructed and non-obstructed large-scale experiments are simulated with the new methodology. The validation of the methodology with both the HEM and the Euler- Lagrange approaches is shown to be relatively successful. Its simplicity of use makes the HEM approach very attractive for industrial applications. The Euler-Lagrange approach has a wider range of physical applications and provides more options to characterize the dispersed phase and its interaction with the continuous phase. This approach should be used when the HEM approach reaches its limitations. </p...|$|R
