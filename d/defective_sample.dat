Such dry process is a key prerequisite for chemical functionalization applications or for organic electronics compatibility, and opens the possibility to integrate graphene electrodes with thermally or chemically sensitive materials, as well as substrates incompatible with lithography processing. Patterning and metal evaporation are performed through a multi-step mechanical stencils methodology, and low temperatures magneto transport measurements are used to validate devices with preserved electrical fingerprints of graphene. This is particularly critical for the argon beam milling process step.

Those wafers exhibit an effective lifetime of up to 1720 μs locally for a phosphorous concentration of 2 • 1015 cm- 3 and a wafer thickness of about 100 μm. In these wafers the most detrimental defects are stacking faults with polycrystalline silicon inclusions. Comparing two samples with stacking faults densities differing by one order of magnitude revealed a difference in average effective minority carrier lifetime of also one order of magnitude (reduction from more than 1500 μs down to 111 μs for the <b>defective</b> <b>sample).</b> A solar cell fabricated from a 200 μm thick epitaxial wafer of low stacking fault density and a phosphorous concentration of 3 • 1016 cm- 3 reaches an independently confirmed efficiency of 20 %, an open circuit voltage of up to 658 mV, a short circuit current density of up to 39. 6 mA/cm 2 and a fill factor of up to 76. 9 %.

RNA-seq {{measures}} RNA expression {{levels in}} a biological sample using high-throughput cDNA sequencing, producing counts {{of the number}} of reads aligning to each gene. Noise in RNA-seq read count data is commonly modelled as following a negative binomial distribution, where the variance is a quadratic function of the expression level. However many statistical, machine learning, and visualization methods work best when the noise in a data set has equal variance. Varistran is an R package that uses Anscombe's (1948) variance stabilizing transformation for the negative binomial distribution to transform RNA-seq count data, so that the noise has equal variance across all measured gene expression levels. The transformed data may be treated as log 2 transformed gene expression levels, but with variability reduced at low read counts. Varistran also includes a function to open a Shiny report with simple diagnostic visualizations, including a plot to assess how effective the variance stabilization was, a biplot of samples and genes, and a heatmap.

40|$|Abstract: Automatic visual {{inspection}} of wire ropes {{is an important}} but challenging task. Anomalies in wire ropes usually are unobtrusive and their detection is a difficult job. Certainly, a reliable anomaly detection is essential to assure {{the safety of the}} ropes. A one-class classification approach for the automatic detection of anomalies in wire ropes is presented. Different well-established features from the field of textural defect detection are compared to context-sensitive features extracted by linear prediction. They are used to learn a Gaussian mixture model which represents the faultless rope structure. Outliers are regarded as anomaly. To evaluate the robustness of the method, a training set containing intentionally added, <b>defective</b> <b>samples</b> is used. The generalization ability of the learned model, which is important for practical life, is exploited by testing the model on different data sets from identically constructed ropes. All experiments were performed on real-life rope data. The results prove a high generalization ability, as well as a good robustness to outliers in the training set. The presented approach can exclude up to 90 percent of the rope as faultless without missing one single defect. ...|$|R
40|$|Anomaly Detection in Wire Ropes is an {{important}} problem. Detecting suspicious anomalies in the rope surface is challenging because {{of the variety of}} its visual appearance caused by reflections or mud on the rope surface. This hinders the discrimination between uncritical variations and small defects within the rope surface enormously. The fact that nearly no <b>defective</b> <b>samples</b> are available to train a supervised system relates this problem to the concept of one-class classification (OCC). In this work we show how to utilize one-class classification with Gaussian processes (GP) to detect anomalies in wire ropes. The method allows modeling the distribution of non-defective data in a non-parametric manner. Furthermore, it is really easy to implement (few lines of code), embedded in a Bayesian framework, and can be used with arbitrary kernel functions. Therefore, it is suitable {{for a wide range of}} defect localization applications. Our experiments, performed on two real ropes, demonstrate that the GP framework for OCC clearly outperforms former approaches for anomaly detection in wire ropes. The obtained results are comparable with or even outperform those obtained with the Support Vector Data Description, which is the state of the art reference in the field of one-class classification. ...|$|R

40|$|Wire ropes {{are exposed}} to huge {{external}} powers every day. Unfortunately, {{this can lead to}} structural anomalies or even defects in the rope formation. A defective rope bears a high risk for human life. This motivates the strict rules summarized in the European norm [1], which instruct a regular inspection of wire ropes. Recent approaches to defect detection in surfaces or fabrics mostly are lim-ited to texture analysis [2]. Usually not enough <b>defective</b> <b>samples</b> are available in advance. Therefore texture-based approaches are often combined with one-class classification, also called novelty detection [3]. In [4] anomaly detection in wire rope data was performed using linear prediction as feature extraction com-bined with a multi-channel one-class classification strategy. However, all these approaches are not able to detect structural changes in the rope structure. Thus, we propose a new approach for model-based detection of surface defects and structural deviations from the normal rope geometry. A wire rope is composed of strands which itself are composed out of single wires. Every wire can be described by a helix and a mathematical description of the rope geometry can be given by the space curve of the j-th wire in the i-th strand: sWi,j (t, rW, LW, nW) = rW · cos(t 2 p...|$|R
40|$|Bound {{electronic}} excitations play a {{major role}} in the electrodynamics of insulators and are typically described by the concept of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons. The former represent hydrogenic electron-hole pairs delocalized over several unit cells of a crystal and they occur in materials with high dielectric constant; the latter correspond to a correlated electron-hole pair localized on a single lattice site and they mostly prevail in molecular solids. Between these two extremes, an intermediate type of excitons exists, typically referred to as charge-transfer excitons. A prototypical system in which these rare quasiparticles have been theoretically predicted but never experimentally confirmed is the anatase polymorph of TiO 2, which is one of the most promising material for light-energy conversion applications. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission and optical spectroscopies, along with ab initio state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, to demonstrate that the direct optical gap of anatase TiO 2 is dominated by a charge-transfer exciton band rising over the continuum of indirect interband transitions. In particular, we find that the lowest exciton possesses a two-dimensional nature and is characterized by a giant binding energy of ~ 300 meV. The universality of these findings is proven in highly <b>defective</b> <b>samples</b> used in light-energy conversion applications, by interrogating these systems out-of-equilibrium via ultrafast two-dimensional UV spectroscopy...|$|R
