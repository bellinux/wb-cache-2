50|$|Inline three {{engines are}} common in <b>diesel</b> engined <b>tractors,</b> {{as well as other}} {{agricultural}} machinery. Nearly all manufacturers of <b>diesel</b> <b>tractors</b> have had models with three-cylinder engines. Perhaps the best known example of any kind of three-cylinder diesel engine is the Perkins AD3.152 that was used in Massey Ferguson 35 tractors, as well as in Fordson Dexta and several other tractors. This engine was also used for marine and stationary applications. Other manufacturers include Nuffield(BMC), Bolinder-Munktell/Volvo BM, International Harvester, John Deere, Deutz-Fahr, Ford and many others.|$|R

50|$|In 1932, IH {{produced}} {{their first}} diesel engine, in the McCormick-Deering TD-40 crawler. This engine started on gasoline, then switched over to diesel fuel. Diesel engines of this era {{were difficult to}} start in cold weather, and using gasoline allowed the engine to start easily and thoroughly warm up before making the switch to diesel in all weather conditions. In 1935, this engine was put in the International Harvester WD-40, becoming the first <b>diesel</b> <b>tractor</b> on wheels in North America (the world's first <b>diesel</b> <b>tractor</b> was the German Benz-Sendling BS 6, introduced in 1922).|$|E

As Yanmar diesel engines continued to gain in popularity, the Universal Atomic Four gasoline engines continued to lose market share rapidly.

5000|$|Established in 1979, Auto Tractors Ltd. (ATL) had a {{manufacturing}} plant at Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and were making tractors with [...] Leyland engines. It was established with 40% state {{money and the}} remainder an IDBI Bank loan. Production began in September 1981, but with severe supply problems and an outmoded product they only produced 2,380 tractors in their nearly ten years of existence. This was less than the projected production {{for the first two}} years alone. The company and assets were sold to automaker Sipani in 1991, who focused on producing <b>diesel</b> <b>tractor</b> engines (at over five times the rate of ATL themselves) but built some tractors as well.|$|E

The new engine was considerably smoother and was also available in a version with higher output, , and the model was now called the JA2. In 1968 BLMC was formed, and as a result about fifty JA2s were equipped with the less-than-reliable 2.1-litre Land Rover diesel engine. A variety of other available engines followed, from Ricardo, Peugeot, Renault, Indenor, and others.|$|E

5000|$|Although IHC's {{very first}} diesel-engine tractor was a [...] "Standard" [...] model WD-40 built from 1935-1940, {{the very first}} [...] "Farmall" [...] <b>diesel</b> <b>tractor</b> was the model MD {{released}} in 1941. Like many agricultural and construction/industrial diesel engines of the time, the early IHC diesels were not direct-start; the operator started the engine on gasoline, then manually switched it to diesel fuel after warming up the entire engine. This two-in-one engine design, {{also known as a}} [...] "gas-diesel," [...] was unique to IHC agricultural products from 1935-1958 and IHC construction/industrial products from 1935-early 1960s. Other companies used different yet elaborate means to crank & warm their diesels, such as a pony motor, compressed air, hot bulb, or black powder, among other things. The Farmall Super MD, Super M-TA Diesel, 400 Diesel, and 450 Diesel used the same IHC gasoline-start engine design as the MD, but with larger displacement (more cubic inches). The first Farmall tractor with a direct-start diesel was the model 350, which appeared in 1956. The 350 could also be ordered with a gasoline or LP-gas engine. The 350's direct-start diesel engine was built by Continental Motors. IH subsequently developed their own line of new direct-start diesel engines for the 460 and 560 tractors starting in 1958. Large competitors such as Deere and Caterpillar lagged at least two years behind IH in offering direct-start diesel products.|$|E
