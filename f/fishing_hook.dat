25|$|Their float was {{stocked with}} biscuits, chocolate, Horlicks tablets, Bovril pemmican, 22 gallons (100 litres) {{of water and}} 2 gallons (9 litres) of massage oil for use against exposure. There was also a sail, which they rigged as a {{makeshift}} shelter. After three days of rough weather the sea calmed and the raft drifted. The men's health deteriorated, but the ration cans had keys to open them, and from one of these White improvised a <b>fishing</b> <b>hook.</b> He untwisted the fibres of a rope and made them into a fishing line. With this they caught about 50 fish, which they ate raw. This gave the survivors both protein and nutritious fish oil, which improved their health and did much to keep them alive.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>hook</b> or fishhook is {{a device}} for {{catching}} fish either by impaling {{them in the}} mouth or, more rarely, by snagging {{the body of the}} <b>fish.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> have been employed for centuries by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the <b>fish</b> <b>hook</b> was chosen by Forbes {{as one of the top}} twenty tools in the history of man. <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. There is an enormous variety of <b>fish</b> <b>hooks</b> in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the <b>fish</b> <b>hook.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing).|$|R
