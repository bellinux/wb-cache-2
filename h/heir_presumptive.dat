5|$|On 30 December 1777, Maximilian Joseph, {{the last}} of the junior line of Wittelsbach, died of smallpox, leaving no children. Charles IV Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no {{legitimate}} children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive.</b> Across Bavaria's southern border, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend. His agreement with the heir, Charles Theodore, to partition the territory neglected any claims of the <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive,</b> Charles August.|$|E
5|$|The 28 June 1914, {{assassination}} of Austro-Hungarian <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> Archduke Franz Ferdinand precipitated Austria-Hungary's {{declaration of war}} against Serbia. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the Central Powers against the Entente coalition and starting World War I.|$|E
5|$|For much of Ernest's reign, the <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was {{his only}} sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became {{increasingly}} more clear that Ernest would be childless, {{the possibility of a}} personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, a reality that was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union. Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother's second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest's <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> on 14 December 1861, when his older brother the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) renounced his succession rights.|$|E

5|$|Michael was <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> until 12 August 1904, {{when the}} birth of Tsarevich Alexei to Nicholas and Alexandra {{provided}} an heir apparent. Michael again became second-in-line to the throne, but was named as co-regent for the boy, along with Alexandra, {{in the event of}} Nicholas's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the {{succession}} marked Louis' reign. Elizabeth was long considered barren, and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king's death. Her brother-in-law Stephen was <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> {{until his death in}} 1354, when his son John replaced him. However, John also died in 1360. A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365, but the child died the next year. For a few years, John's sister, Elizabeth, was treated as <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated. Things suddenly took a different course after Elizabeth had three daughters in quick succession; Catherine was born in July 1370, Mary in 1371, and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374. Elizabeth is known to have written a book for the education of her daughters, a copy of which was sent to France in 1374. However, all copies have been lost.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his birth, his {{paternal}} grandfather Alexander II was still the reigning Emperor of All the Russias. Michael was fourth-in-line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line and, in 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive.</b>|$|E

5|$|Born as {{the seventeenth}} {{child of the}} dispossessed Robert I, Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911. Charles became <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1914 after the {{assassination}} of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the old emperor's death.|$|E
5|$|Since 1714, Britain {{had shared}} a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under Salic law women were {{excluded}} from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British dominions, Hanover passed instead to her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who became King of Hanover. He was her <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> until she married and had a child.|$|E
5|$|Aimery of Lusignan died on 1 April 1205 and a {{few months}} later, his widow (Alice's mother), Isabella I, also died. Isabella I's fourteen-year-old {{daughter}} from her second marriage to Conrad of Montferrat, Maria, ascended the throne with Isabella I's half-brother, John of Ibelin, acting as regent. As the new queen's eldest half-sister, Alice became <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive.</b> She was placed under the guardianship of her maternal grandmother, Maria Komnene, according to historian Bernard Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|Peace was {{restored}} with {{the mediation of}} Henry I of Jerusalem, who persuaded both Leo and Bohemond to renounce their claims to suzerainty over each other. Leo's occupation of Bagras was confirmed. Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, married Leo's niece and <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive,</b> Alice. Raymond died in early 1197, but his widow {{give birth to a}} posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. The almost sixty-year-old BohemondIII sent Alice and her son to Armenia, showing {{that he did not want}} to acknowledge his infant grandson's right to succeed him in Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The untangling of his {{accounts}} {{dragged on}} until 1819, prolonged by his enemies at the Navy Office {{and his own}} fiscal incapacity. At length a balance of £220,000 was found against him, but by this time his career was hopelessly ruined. He left office as a groom of the bedchamber in 1815, but retained his vice-admiralty sinecures until his death. In 1824, he became <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> to the Earldom of Clarendon but died in 1827 without inheriting it.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} in London as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and she was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive.</b> She began to {{undertake}} public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an {{ambassador}} to the English court to put the case for Mary as the <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that {{to do so would}} invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor. However, Elizabeth assured Maitland that she knew no one with a better claim than Mary. In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France.|$|E
5|$|Princess Andrew {{returned}} to Great Britain in April 1947 {{to attend the}} November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> of King George VI. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring. On {{the day of the}} wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI. For the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew sat at the head of her family {{on the north side of}} Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the death}} of Charles II without {{legitimate}} issue in February 1685, the Duke of York became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. Mary was playing cards when her husband informed her of her father's accession, {{and that she was}} <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive.</b> When Charles's illegitimate son Monmouth assembled an invasion force at Amsterdam, and sailed for Britain, William informed James of Monmouth's departure, and ordered English regiments in the Low Countries to return to Britain. To William's relief, Monmouth was defeated, captured and executed, but both he and Mary were dismayed by James's subsequent actions.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{of royal}} blood, his family was {{relatively}} obscure and lived a comparatively normal life by royal standards. In 1852, however, George's father was designated the <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> to the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark, and the family became princes and princesses of Denmark. George's siblings were Frederick (who succeeded their father as King of Denmark), Alexandra (who became wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom {{and the mother of}} King George V), Dagmar (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Emperor Nicholas II), Thyra (who married Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale) and Valdemar.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was born}} in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no {{legitimate}} children. Her father, James, was thus <b>heir</b> <b>presumptive</b> to the throne. His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Three years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Anne's sister and Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III of Orange became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.|$|E
