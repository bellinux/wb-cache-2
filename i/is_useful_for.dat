5|$|Helium, {{mixed with}} a heavier gas such as xenon, <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> thermoacoustic {{refrigeration}} due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number.

5|$|Thallium iodide is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} additive in metal-halide lamps, often together {{with one or two}} halides of other metals. It allows optimization of the lamp temperature and color rendering, and shifts the spectral output to the green region, which <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> underwater lighting.|$|E
5|$|The 10B isotope <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> {{capturing}} thermal neutrons (see neutron cross section#Typical cross sections). The {{nuclear industry}} enriches natural boron to nearly pure 10B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure 11B.|$|E

5|$|This {{generalization}} <b>is</b> <b>useful,</b> <b>for</b> example, if y(t) is {{the position}} vector of a particle at time t; then the derivative y(t) is the velocity vector of the particle at time t.|$|E
5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> this task.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} vision, {{digital images}} are partitioned into small square pixels, {{each of which}} has its own color. The dual graph of this subdivision into squares has a vertex per pixel and an edge between pairs of pixels that share an edge; it <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> applications including clustering of pixels into connected regions of similar colors.|$|E

3000|$|..., n and μ all show {{very weak}} T dependencies. These results could <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> devices which can {{maintain}} their characteristics {{over a wide}} range of temperature.

50|$|Levetiracetam has {{not been}} found to <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> {{treatment}} of neuropathic pain, nor for treatment of essential tremors.

5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a {{detector}} of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.|$|E
5|$|Pure long-fibre Sphagnum moss is an {{excellent}} potting medium, though combinations involving {{any of the following}} – peat, perlite, vermiculite, sand, lava rock, pumice, Osmunda fibre, orchid bark and horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant.|$|E
5|$|Related by {{periodic}} trends, rhenium has {{a similar}} chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> radiopharmacy, where {{it is difficult to}} work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{trapping}} cold atoms, optical lattices {{have been}} widely used in creating gratings and photonic crystals. They <b>are</b> also <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> sorting microscopic particles, and may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> assembling cell arrays.|$|R

40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis {{was applied to}} human gait patterns to investigate the role and relative importance of temporal versus spatial features. Datasets consisted of various limb and body angles sampled over increasingly long time intervals. We find that spatial and temporal cues may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> different aspects of recognition. Temporal cues contain information that can distinguish the phase of the gait cycle; spatial cues <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> distinguishing running from walking. PCA and related techniques may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> identifying features used by the visual system for recognizing biological motion...|$|R
5|$|Semiconductor {{detectors}} made {{of single}} crystal high-purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security. Germanium <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy X-ray applications. Crystals of high purity germanium {{are used in}} detectors for gamma spectroscopy {{and the search for}} dark matter. Germanium crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 fan {{features}} dovetailed {{fan blades}} which {{allows them to}} be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/SNECMA claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability.

5|$|The {{exponential}} function is defined for all integer, fractional, real, and complex values of x. In fact, the matrix exponential is well-defined for square matrices (in which case this exponential identity only holds when x and y commute), and <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> solving systems of linear differential equations.|$|E
5|$|The lens <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> deliberative shots by {{landscape}} {{photographers and}} other skilled artists.

5|$|Beryllium oxide <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> many {{applications}} {{that require the}} combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
