25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{underground}} dams: a sub-surface and a sand-storage dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an impervious layer (such as solid bedrock) up to just below the surface. They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi. It must be strong, as floods will wash over its crest. Over time, sand <b>accumulates</b> <b>in</b> <b>layers</b> behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent evaporation. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the dam body, or by means of a drain pipe.|$|R

Conclusions, which are the result of a thought experiment, show that Schwarzschild [1] was correct: A singularity develops at the event horizon of a newly-formed black hole.

50|$|The {{residing}} magma {{starts to}} cool, {{with the higher}} melting point components such as olivine crystallizing out of the solution, particularly near to the cooler walls of the chamber, and forming a denser conglomerate of minerals which sinks (cumulative rock). Upon cooling, new mineral phases saturate and the rock type changes (e.g. fractional crystallization), typically forming gabbro, diorite, tonalite and granite or gabbro, diorite, syenite and granite. If magma resides in a chamber for a long period, then it can become stratified with lower density components rising {{to the top and}} denser materials sinking. Rocks <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> <b>layers,</b> forming a layered intrusion. Any subsequent eruption may produce distinctly layered deposits, for example the deposits from the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius include a thick layer of white pumice from the upper portion of the magma chamber overlaid with a similar layer of grey pumice produced from material erupted later from lower down in the chamber.|$|R

However, except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was devitrified (loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle), the entire sheet is melded together. Inside Calabozos, the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts. Instead, erosion ate away at it, in the form of acid leaching, and broke down much of its pumice content. Still, the rock layer here contains five to 30percent phenocrysts, and has high levels of devitrification and lithic content.|$|R

Higher ozone mixing ratios were found northeast of the Santiago Basin and included east of the Aconcagua Valley (~ 70 km from Santiago) suggesting that photochemical pollution produced in Santiago is capable of passing through the Chacabuco mountain chain (~ 1. 3 km) and have impact downwind from the regions with the largest NOx and VOC emissions.

40|$|Numerous {{signs of}} renal {{dysfunction}} such as proteinuria, crystalluria and microhematuria {{as well as}} a variety of other renal syndromes may characterize the course of HIV infection and lead to renal failure. It is estimated that approximately 1 % to 2 % of patients starting dialysis suffer from HIV-associated renal disease. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) occurs in about 10 % of HIV-infected subjects with a distinct predilection for Blacks and Hispanic individuals. This nephropathy is characterized by glomerular basement membrane thickening, wrinkling and folding, segmental or global collapse of the glomerular tufts, increase in the Bowman space, and podocytes abnormalities. Large podocytes filled with protein droplets often <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> <b>layers</b> around the collapsed areas forming the pseudocrescents. Tubular atrophy, interstitial inflammation and different degree of fibrosis are generally associated with the glomerular damage. Until antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available, HIVAN was characterized by a rapid renal function decline and progression to end-stage renal disease. Aside from the HIV direct injury to the nephron, numerous experimental observations lend support to the notion that Angiotensin II contributes to podocytes damage and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) {{as well as a}}ngiotensin recepto...|$|R

25|$|If the coated optic is used at non-normal {{incidence}} (that is, {{with light}} rays not {{perpendicular to the}} surface), the anti-reflection capabilities are degraded somewhat. This occurs because the phase <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the <b>layer</b> relative to the phase of the light immediately reflected decreases as the angle increases from normal. This is counterintuitive, since the ray experiences a greater total phase shift <b>in</b> the <b>layer</b> than for normal incidence. This paradox is resolved by noting that the ray will exit the layer spatially offset from where it entered and will interfere with reflections from incoming rays that had to travel further (thus accumulating more phase of their own) {{to arrive at the}} interface. The net effect is that the relative phase is actually reduced, shifting the coating, such that the anti-reflection band of the coating tends to move to shorter wavelengths as the optic is tilted. Non-normal incidence angles also usually cause the reflection to be polarization-dependent.|$|R
