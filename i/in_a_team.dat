Gasparotto yielded the jersey to Di Luca after stage 2, when Di Luca finished higher-placed in the mass finish, but took it back again after stage 3 when he contested the sprint and finished eighth. Finally, after stage 4, the six-way tie involving the Liquigas riders who finished together in the team time trial was broken, as Di Luca won the stage into Montevergine and took the pink jersey again.|$|E

He scored his first goal in a 2–1 win over Chester City on 6 November 2007. He extended his stay at Bradford City {{until the end of the}} season in January 2008. Despite signing a new contract, injury kept Rhodes out of the side at the start of 2008 until 23 February when he scored his second Bradford goal in a 3–1 victory at Notts County after coming on as substitute. His performance in the Notts County victory earned him a place in the starting side three days later when he again scored in a 3–2 win against Rotherham United. On 29 April, he was one of 13players released by manager Stuart McCall. Rhodes played a total of 30games for Bradford, but started only 11 of those, scoring three goals.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce was {{appointed}} manager of Bolton Wanderers following Colin Todd's departure, who had resigned in protest at {{the sale of}} Per Frandsen as the club attempted {{to raise funds for}} the new Reebok Stadium. He inherited a talented squad, which included Eiður Guðjohnsen, Jussi Jääskeläinen, Mark Fish, Claus Jensen, Dean Holdsworth, Bo Hansen, Michael Johansen, and Ricardo Gardner. However he was forced to sell Andy Todd, son of Colin Todd, after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown's jaw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> bonding session. Despite being in {{the bottom half of the}} table when he took over, Bolton reached the 1999–2000 Division One play-offs, losing to Ipswich Town, and had an eventful run to the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals, only missing out on the 2000 FA Cup Final after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Aston Villa. He blamed referee Barry Knight for the play-off defeat, who he accused of being biased against Bolton. Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten-year contract, though the terms of the contract only entitled him to a one year's compensation pay if he was sacked.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E
