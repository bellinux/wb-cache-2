5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Labor's fourth consecutive defeat in the 2004 federal election it was widely speculated that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, {{but she did not}} do so. Gillard had been spoken of as a potential future leader of the party for some years, but never stood in a leadership contest. After Mark Latham resigned as Labor Leader in January 2005, Gillard appeared on ABC's Australian Story in March 2006, after which an Ipsos Mackay poll conducted <b>for</b> <b>Network</b> Ten's Meet the Press found that more respondents would prefer Gillard to be Labor Leader; she polled 32% compared with Beazley's 25% and Kevin Rudd's 18%. Although she had significant cross-factional support, she announced on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership, allowing Beazley to be elected unopposed.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained <b>for</b> <b>Network</b> Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E

The purpose {{outlines the}} need <b>for</b> a <b>network</b> <b>for</b> energy efficiency. Second, the proposed structure <b>for</b> a <b>network</b> <b>for</b> energy efficiency in the maritime industry is presented.

The need for an aim and objectives <b>for</b> a <b>network</b> <b>for</b> energy efficiency in the maritime industry is also discussed. Third, the steps {{needed in order to}} create a network are presented. These include the formation of a core group of companies willing and able to commit funds to the creation of the network, as well as creating an executive board in charge of the <b>network.</b> Also, methods <b>for</b> funding the <b>network</b> are discussed. Finally, the conclusion puts the proposed structure in context with the purpose <b>for</b> starting a <b>network</b> <b>for</b> energy efficiency...|$|R
5|$|The {{television}} industry in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} Croatian Regulatory Authority <b>for</b> <b>Network</b> Industries (HAKOM). HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition {{and the interests of}} service users in the field of electronic communication services and infrastructure, while contributing {{to the development of the}} internal market of the European Union. HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia. Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of minors, restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, profanity, use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programmeadvising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively. The restriction does not apply to educational, documentary, science or news programming.|$|E
