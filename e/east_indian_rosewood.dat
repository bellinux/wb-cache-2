After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay. The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, {{had been taken from}} a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers. Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to [...] "wing it." ...|$|E

40|$|Positive and {{negative}} (facilitative and competitive) interactions of plants are important issues in autecology {{and can be}} evaluated by the spatial pattern analysis in plant ecosystems. This study investigates the intraspecific interactions of <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb.) trees in <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> Reserve of Khuzestan province. Three 150 m × 200 m plots were selected and the spatial locations of all <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewoods</b> (239 trees) were specified. Structurally different summary statistics (nearest neighbour distribution function D(r), K 2 -index K 2 (r), pair correlation function g(r), and O-ring O(r)) were also implemented to analyze the spatial pattern of the trees. The distribution of <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> trees significantly followed inhomogeneous Poisson process (α= 0. 05). The results of D(r) and K 2 (r) showed that the maximum distance to nearest tree was 12 m and density was decreased to this scale. The results of g(r) and O(r) also revealed the significant aggregation of <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> trees at scales of 1. 5 to 4 m (α= 0. 05). In general, {{it was concluded that}} <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> trees had positive intraspecific interactions in <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> Reserve of Khuzestan province and their aggregation showed their facilitative effects on one another...|$|R

5000|$|Rosewoods {{are often}} used in the back and/or sides of guitars and mandolins and fretboards on guitars.

5000|$|Traditionally, steel-string guitars {{have been}} made of a {{combination}} of various [...] "tonewoods", or woods that have pleasing resonant qualities when used in instrument-making. Foremost are Sitka spruce, the most common, and Alpine and Adirondack spruce, the most sought-after, woods for the making of guitar tops. The back and sides of a particular guitar are typically made of the same wood; Brazilian or <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> and Honduras mahogany are traditional choices, however, maple has been prized for the figuring that can be seen when it is cut in a certain way (such as [...] "flame" [...] and [...] "quilt" [...] patterns). A common non-traditional wood gaining popularity is sapele, which is tonally similar to mahogany but slightly lighter in color and possessing a deep grain structure that is visually appealing.|$|E
50|$|For years, Brazilian Rosewood was the {{industry}} standard as the best wood for the backs and sides of guitars. Unfortunately, the export of Brazilian Rosewood has been restricted due to the endangerment of the species. Much of the Brazilian Rosewood used for guitars is of poor quality, and the inflated price of the wood has caused many luthiers to search for alternative tonewoods. There are many other good very dry woods for guitar construction. In fact, of the surviving Torres instruments, the most common back and side wood used was maple. Many guitars made today use <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Rosewood</b> {{because it is a}} close substitute for Brazilian Rosewood, is readily available in high-quality, and has desirable characteristics as tonewood. There are many other woods with the characteristics to make excellent guitars and are excellent alternatives: cocobolo, maple, bubinga (African Rosewood), African Blackwood, Camatillo Rosewood, Spanish Cypress (used exclusively for flamenco guitars), granadillo, ebony, satinwood, ziricote, among others, are excellent choices for backs and sides.|$|E
50|$|From 1984 to 1987, the {{standard}} Explorer's body wood varied between mahogany and alder. The neck wood would vary between maple and mahogany and the fretboard wood varied between <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood</b> and ebony. Other additions to this model included rear-loaded pickup cavities, no pickguard, and control knobs {{arranged in a}} triangle pattern (rather than a straight line as on the original model).|$|R
5000|$|Jay Lichty creates all the {{instruments}} by hand using {{a wide variety}} of domestic and exotic hardwoods including <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood,</b> Brazilian rosewood, pau ferro, cocobolo, lacewood, hormigo, koa, mahogany, ziricote, ancient kauri, maple, claro walnut and others for the instrument bodies. Types of wood used for the soundboards include lutz, englemann, sitka, Adirondack spruces, Western red cedar, sinker redwood, koa, and mahogany.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, many musicians, {{including}} Clarence White and Eric Thompson preferred Martin guitars {{built before}} World War II to more recent guitars {{of the same}} model. The prewar guitars had a different internal bracing pattern consisting of scalloped braces (the later ones were tapered rather than scalloped), with the x-brace forward-shifted to about an inch of the soundhole, producing better resonance, and tops made from Adirondack red spruce rather than Sitka spruce. After 1969, the rosewood components, including the backs and sides of some models, were changed from Brazilian <b>rosewood</b> to <b>Indian</b> <b>rosewood,</b> due to restrictions {{on the sale of}} Brazilian rosewood. The D-28s and D-35s (introduced in the mid-1960s {{to make use of the}} more narrow pieces of wood, by using a three-piece back design) are now very sought-after on the vintage guitar market, fetching sums in the neighborhood of $5,000-$6,000. The same models from the early 1970s, with <b>Indian</b> <b>Rosewood</b> backs and sides, generally sell for less than $2,500.|$|R
