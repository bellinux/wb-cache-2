5|$|Because of {{the quality}} of his {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's book about the U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built {{on a scale of one}} <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> the foot. Tiny Town, with water mains and electric lights, was laid out on streets like a real city.|$|E

25|$|Nottinghamshire was mapped {{first by}} Christopher Saxton in 1576, the first fully {{surveyed}} {{map of the}} county was by John Chapman who produced Chapman's Map of Nottinghamshire in 1774.

25|$|Gene {{effects may}} often be {{dependent}} on the environment. Such interactions are known as G×E interactions, in which {{the effects of a}} gene allele differ across different environments. Simple examples would include situations where a gene multiplies the effect of an environment: perhaps adding 1inch to height in high nutrient environments, but only half an <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> height in low-nutrient environments. This is seen in different slopes of response to an environment for different genotypes.|$|E
25|$|Pontiac's second {{generation}} V8 engines shared numerous similarities, allowing many parts to interchange from its advent in 1959 to its demise in 1979. Sizes ranged from 287 cubic <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> 455 cubic inch. This similarity (except the 301 & 265) makes rebuilding these engines relatively easier. This feature {{also made it}} possible for Pontiac to invent the modern muscle car, by the relatively simple process of placing its second largest-displacement engine, the 389 cid, into its mid-size car, the Le Mans, creating the Pontiac LeMans GTO.|$|E

Among other structures, large reservoirs, important for conserving water in a climate with rainy and dry seasons, and elaborate aqueducts, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> the mile, are most notable. Biso Kotuwa, a peculiar construction inside a dam, is a technological marvel based on precise mathematics that allows water to flow outside the dam, keeping pressure on the dam to a minimum.|$|E

25|$|Before the Hodgson Committee, the {{metrication}} {{process was}} already in operation. One example was the Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency for Great Britain, which initiated the Retriangulation of Great Britain in 1936, using metric measures. A metric National Grid was then {{used as the basis}} for maps published by the Ordnance Survey from World War II onwards, the War Office maps having had a metric grid since 1920. The Ordnance Survey decided on full metrication in 1964. The best-selling 1 <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> the mile range of maps started being replaced with the 1:50000 range in 1969. The metrication of Admiralty Charts began in 1967 as part of a modernisation programme. , road and street maps with primary scales in inches per mile were still being produced by the company Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} common object was a stone star with a hole through the middle. They were found {{everywhere}} between Ibarra and Riobamba. The majority have six rays (and none have more), proceeding symmetrically from the center, and the whole are fashioned alike upon each side. A certain number have only five rays, and occasional examples are irregular in shape. All are pierced by a hole, which has been drilled from the two sides, {{and the size of}} this varies considerably. In dimensions they range from three to five inches in diameter and from three-quarters of an <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> two inches in thickness. Their weight is from five to twenty ounces. The larger part are made from basaltic rock and gabbro. Objects of this class were also cast in metal but these are now rarely found in Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 4.0L V6 mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic transmission. The V6 powertrains were unchanged from {{those used in}} 2005–2009 Mustangs. Though the 2010 Mustang V-6 retained a single exhaust outlet, {{the diameter of the}} tip had been increased one-half of an <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> three inches. The 2010 Mustang included new spring rates and dampers to improve ride quality and control and Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and stability control system standard. Newly standard on the base Mustang were 17-inch painted aluminum wheels while 18-inch wheels continue to be optional (except for V8 models, where 18-inch wheels were mounted by default). Other new available features and options for the 2010 Mustang included Ford SYNC, dual-zone automatic climate control, an updated navigation system with Sirius Travel Link, a capless fuel filler, a reverse camera system to aid in backing up, and an updated version of the V6 Pony Package.|$|E

25|$|On 15 May 1809, Baker and Tartar chased a Danish {{privateer}} sloop near Felixberg on {{the coast}} of Courland. The sloop was armed with two 12-pounders on slides and two long 4-pounders, and carried a crew of 24. Her crew ran her ashore and then left her, taking their muskets up behind some sand hills where some local civilians joined them. Baker, concerned that the schooner might harm British trade, sent in his boats to bring her out or destroy her. The British cutting out party boarded the privateer, without loss despite the small arms fire from the beach, got her off the shore, and turned her guns on the beach. While the boarding party was securing the vessel, one of the men fortunately discovered a lighted candle set in a powder cartridge in the magazine and extinguished it when it had only a half an <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> burn. The privateer's magazine contained about a hundredweight of powder; had it exploded it would have killed the boarding party. The prize crew then brought the sloop off. The privateer was probably Felix.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Roberts {{calls the}} island Crokatoa in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of war Peacock {{anchored}} off the north end, also visiting Long Island, {{in search of}} inhabitants, fresh water, and yams. It was found difficult to effect a landing anywhere, owing to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, {{were found on the}} eastern side of Krakatoa, 150 feet from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine Lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; others, cabbages from an <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> three feet in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 season, {{driving for}} Penske, Busch scored one win at Bristol Motor Speedway in the Food City 500, his fifth win at the track. Busch celebrated the victory by {{getting out of}} his car and making a snow angel on the track, due to snow that had fallen at the track that weekend. He also won six poles and had seven top fives and twelve top ten {{finishes}} but finished 16th in the final standings. He also made his Busch Series debut for Penske in the No. 39 Dodge at Texas Motor Speedway, winning in his first race. He ran six more races that season and picked up a second win at Watkins Glen International by holding off Robby Gordon on the final lap. Gordon and Busch on the final lap struggled for the win but it resulted in Busch holding onto the lead in the outer-loop to seal up the win. In victory circle Busch thanked Gordon for a fight for victory and said that the struggle reminded him of his 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington when Ricky Craven beat Busch by one <b>inch</b> <b>to</b> win the race after a 2 lap-long struggle to the checkers.|$|E
