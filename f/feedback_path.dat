25|$|One {{uniqueness}} of this whistle {{compared to the}} others described is that {{the length of the}} <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> can be chosen arbitrarily. Although the channels are divided by a wedge shape, edge tone operation is avoided by the Coandă effect. The second figure on the right shows results from one study indicating a constant Strouhal number with Reynolds number. The data had been normalized to a reference value.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{current drawn}} into the {{operational}} amplifier from the power supply {{can be used as}} inputs to external circuitry that augment the capabilities of the operational amplifier. For example, an operational amplifier may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external pushpull amplifier can be controlled by the current {{into and out of the}} operational amplifier. Thus, the operational amplifier may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> to include a large output signal well outside of those bounds.|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} of transformation and canonical form {{have been used}} in analyzing linear systems. These ideas are extended to nonlinear systems. A coordinate system and a corresponding canonical form are developed for general nonlinear control systems. Their usefulness is demonstrated by showing that every feedback linearizable system becomes a system with only <b>feedback</b> <b>paths</b> in the canonical form. For control design involving a nonlinear system, one approach is to put the system in its canonical form and approximate by that part having only <b>feedback</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R

By employing a three-phase LSSD clocking scheme and complemented by a novel ATPG method, our approach achieves industrial quality testability with significantly less area overhead testing {{the same number}} of faults compared to full-scan LSSD.

25|$|There are two {{different}} types of whistle tones - hole tones and edge tones. A hole (or 'oriﬁce') tone is produced by a fast-moving cylinder (or 'vena contracta') of air that interacts with the slow-moving anulus of air surrounding it. Instability in the boundary layer leads to perturbations that increase in size until a <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> is established whereby specific frequencies of the resonance chamber are emphasized. An edge tone, on the other hand, is generated by a thin jet of air that strikes an obstacle. Vortices are shed near the point of disturbance in the ﬂow, alternating {{on each side of the}} obstacle or 'wedge'.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} sound {{generated}} by flow over cavities {{at high speed}} has been well funded {{by the federal government}} so a considerable amount of effort has been made. The problem relates to flow over aircraft cavities in flight such as bomb bays or wheel wells. Flow over a cavity in a surface can result in excitation of a feedback loop and nearly pure tones. Unlike the edge tone noted above, the cavity edge is typically square, but also can be an edge as part of a thin structural shell. Cavities can be separated into shallow or deep ones, the difference being that for deep cavities a Class III (acoustical) <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> may be controlling. Shallow cavities are addressed here and are those in which the cavity length L is greater than the cavity depth D.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum tubes {{may have}} or develop defects in {{operation}} that make an individual tube unsuitable {{in a given}} device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. Microphonics refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from {{the ends of the}} heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for many purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the many}} {{problems}} that {{can be caused by}} parasitic coupling are reducing bandwidth, degrading passband flatness, reducing amplifier output power, increasing reflections, worsening noise figure, causing amplifier instability, and providing undesirable <b>feedback</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|R
25|$|The black {{lines are}} the <b>feedback</b> <b>paths.</b> If the fluid {{is in the}} lower channel, some fluid is fed back to the jet origin via the black tube and pushes the jet to the upper channel.|$|R
30|$|A {{feed forward}} neural network has no <b>feedback</b> <b>paths</b> and inputs are {{processed}} {{in the forward}} direction. For forecasting GHI, we have implemented a three-layer feed forward neural network consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.|$|R
2500|$|Analog {{phase locked}} loops are {{generally}} built with an analog phase detector, {{low pass filter}} and VCO placed in a negative feedback configuration. A digital phase locked loop uses a digital phase detector; it may also have a divider in the <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> or in the reference path, or both, {{in order to make}} the PLL's output signal frequency a rational multiple of the reference frequency. [...] A non-integer multiple of the reference frequency can also be created by replacing the simple divide-by-N counter in the <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> with a programmable pulse swallowing counter.

2500|$|Some PLLs {{also include}} a divider between the {{reference}} clock and the reference input to the phase detector. [...] If the divider in the <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> divides by [...] and the reference input divider divides by , it allows the PLL to multiply the reference frequency by [...] [...] It might seem simpler to just feed the PLL a lower frequency, {{but in some cases}} the reference frequency may be constrained by other issues, and then the reference divider is useful.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} oscillator {{can be made}} from a klystron tube, by providing a <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> from output to input by connecting the [...] "catcher" [...] and [...] "buncher" [...] cavities with a coaxial cable or waveguide. [...] When the device is turned on, electronic noise in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again. [...] Because of the high Q of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the resonant frequency of the cavities.|$|E

50|$|A fully {{differential}} amplifier (FDA) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with differential inputs and differential outputs.

40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in programming methodology, industry still faces major problems {{in developing and}} maintaining E-type software - software that implements computer applications in the real world. The paper suggests that a possible constraint on software process improvement arises {{from the fact that}} the global software process that includes technical, business, marketing, user and other activities constitutes a multi-loop, multi-level feedback system. To change the characteristics of such a system requires one to consider, design or adapt and tune both forward and <b>feedback</b> <b>paths</b> to achieve the desired changes in externally visible behaviour. It should, therefore not come as a surprise that the overall improvements achieved fall far below expectations.

50|$|As {{with all}} {{electronic}} oscillation, motorboating occurs {{when some of}} the output energy from an amplifying device like a transistor or vacuum tube gets coupled back into the input circuit of the device (or possibly into an earlier stage of the amplifier circuit) with the proper phase for positive feedback. This indicates there is an unwanted <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> through the circuit from output to input of an amplifying stage. The technical conditions for oscillation, given by the Barkhausen stability criterion, are that the total gain around the feedback loop (comprising the amplifying device and the <b>feedback</b> <b>path)</b> at the oscillation frequency must be one (0 dB), and that the phase shift must be a multiple of 360° (2π radians). Since most amplifying devices, transistors and tubes, are inverting, with the output signal 180° opposite in phase from the input, the <b>feedback</b> <b>path</b> must contribute the other 180° of shift.|$|E

40|$|Basic hand grips and sensor {{interactions}} that a dextrous robot hand will need {{as part of}} the operation of an EVA Retriever are analyzed. What is to be done with a dextrous robot hand is examined along with how such a complex machine might be controlled. It was assumed throughout that an anthropomorphic robot hand should perform tasks just as a human would; i. e., the most efficient approach to developing control strategies for the hand would be to model actual hand actions and do the same tasks in the same ways. Therefore, basic hand grips that human hands perform, as well as hand grip action were analyzed. It was also important to examine what is termed sensor fusion. This is the integration of various disparate sensor <b>feedback</b> <b>paths.</b> These <b>feedback</b> <b>paths</b> can be spatially and temporally separated, as well as, of different sensor types.
