500|$|Too Much Too Soon {{was titled}} after the {{biography}} {{of the same name}} on actress Diana Barrymore. According to music journalist Jon Savage, the title was [...] "more than applicable to the Dolls themselves" [...] because of alcoholism and other issues among the band members, including Thunders's heroin use and Nolan's contraction of hepatitis. A dedication to Barrymore was printed in the album's gatefold LP. For its front cover, the group eschewed the <b>drag</b> <b>image</b> that their first album had presented and they had developed a reputation for in favor of a fake concert shot. During the shoot, Thunders held a doll in his arm as if to strike it against his guitar to add shock value.|$|E

500|$|Davidson further theorizes that Þorgerðr's name {{may have}} {{originally}} been Gerðr, reasons that this form {{is what is}} found in early skaldic verse, and, further, {{that this is one}} of the names given for the goddess Freyja. Davidson points out that Haakon may have later turned to the same goddess soon before he met his death, when he hid in the earth beneath a swine in Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar (collected in Heimskringla) chapter 48, and that this could symbolize a mound of Freyja, one of whose names means [...] "sow" [...] (Old Norse sýr). Davidson theorizes that the account of Olaf I of Norway <b>dragging</b> Þorgerðr's <b>image</b> out of its temple after Haakon's death, and burning it next to a depiction of Freyr (Freyja's male twin), further supports this view.|$|R

MTSCC is a subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which {{is characterized by a}} polymorphous histology, wherein the spindled epithelial cell is an inherent carcinomatous component. We report the case of a 57 -year-old man presenting with loin pain and <b>dragging</b> sensation. <b>Imaging</b> revealed a large mass arising from the left kidney. Radical nephrectomy was performed, and histopathology revealed spindle cell elements of MTSCC with low-grade cytology, which occasionally blended with tubular structures in variable mucinous stroma admixed with spindle sarcomatoid cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism, associated with significant necrosis and mitoses of up to 5 / 10 high-power field. A final diagnosis of MTSCC along with high-grade areas consistent with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation was made.

40|$|Educators {{know that}} {{students}} create better projects {{when they are}} personally invested in the material (Brookhart, Bronowicz 2003; McInerney 2008; Braxton 2008). The rewards are particularly significant when students can exercise some degree of creativity {{in the process of}} developing their projects (Su 2009). Possibly this is a result of engaging both hemispheres of the brain (Tatar 2009), or otherwise simply a reflection of the human preference to employ creativity in any endeavor, including “work” related ones. One tried-and-true avenue for creative expression is through the use of stories or narratives. Simply including a narrative component may provide enough creative ammunition for students to feel that a particular assignment can be more interesting (Clark 2010), if their work is to be wrapped around a narrative format, such as a short story in favor of an essay or formal writing. But there are numerous free technology tools available today that take the process one step further, by injecting different editing options and high-end production values. Students do not merely assemble a story in words. They can now do it primarily with images, and many of the slideshow services online allow for text captions, dynamic transitions, special effects, and relevant animations. Students become videographers and directors as much as they function as storytellers. The slideshow builders thus do a better job than “old fashioned” essay/short story assignments at meeting the need of 21 st century students, many of whom arrive at institutions of higher learning with at least an already-ingrained interest in such tools, if not explicit experience. Kizoa (www. kizoa. com) offers a simple menu-driven, Flash-based interface for users to craft slideshows with uploaded images, added text, transitions, animations, special effects, and music selected from their limited online repository or uploaded in mp 3 format. Users <b>drag</b> <b>images</b> and any desired effects onto a timeline at the bottom of the screen, in a workflow reminiscent of most software used to edit home movies. The service is free, but much of the content (transitions, effects) provided are classified as premium content; to actually use or share a slideshow using that content, the user would need to upgrade to a paid account. If the slideshow was built using only the free content (which is a more limited selection), the slideshow can be shared on Facebook, or a URL can be sent by email. Once on the webpage, a user will also find code for embedding the slideshow into a blog or webpage. The Flash-based product cannot be downloaded; it must be kept current at Kizoa and linked to for the intended audience to view...|$|R

While a shaved head on a man relates to virility, a shaved head on a woman typically connotes androgyny, especially when combined with traditionally feminine signifiers.

Similarly, gay men sometimes incorporate a shaven head into their overall look, particularly amongst the bear subculture. Specifically, the stereotypical [...] "Castro clone" [...] look commonly shave their heads in order to project a homoerotic ultra-masculine <b>image.</b> <b>Drag</b> queens have sometimes adopted shaven heads, again, to express a genderqueer image.

25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5¼-inch drives and all 3½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could <b>drag</b> the <b>image</b> of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of large scale {{images from the}} Internet has made the research on image search attract a lot of attention. Text-based image search engines, e. g., Google/Microsoft Bing/Yahoo! image search engines using the surrounding text, have been developed and widely used. However, they suffer from an inability to search image content. In this paper, we present an interactive image search system, image search by color map, which can be applied to, but not limited to, enhance text-based image search. This system enables users to indicate how the colors are spatially distributed in the desired images, by scribbling a few color strokes, or <b>dragging</b> an <b>image</b> and highlighting a few regions of interest in an intuitive way. In contrast to the conventional sketch based image retrieval techniques, our system searches images based on colors rather than shapes, and we, technically, propose a simple but effective scheme to mine the latent search intention from the user’s input, and exploit the dominant color filter strategy to make our system more efficient. We integrate our system to existing Web image search engines to demonstrate its superior performance over text-based image search. The user study shows that our system can indeed help users conveniently find desired images...|$|R

The effect of passive control of the vehicle drag cannot be negligible to reach new standards in the automotive pollution domain. One technique {{to act on the}} drag reduction is the optimization of the sideview mirrors. This study presents results obtained in the DynFluid Laboratory wind tunnel.

Melamine foam is placed in the equator of half-spheres with different thickness (2. 5 % and 10 % of the diameter). For speeds ranging from 25 km/h to 115 km/h (ReD = 55, 000 to ReD = 252, 000 with D = 12 cm), a porous half-sphere is able to reduce the drag coefficient.

50|$|Metabolomic Pathway Analysis, {{shortened}} to MetPA, is a freely available, user-friendly {{web server}} {{to assist with}} the identification analysis and visualization of metabolic pathways using metabolomic data. MetPA makes use of advances originally developed for pathway analysis in microarray experiments and applies those principles and concepts to the analysis of metabolic pathways. For input, MetPA expects either a list of compound names (identified as statistically significant or significant perturbed) or a metabolite concentration table with phenotypic labels (i.e. sick vs. healthy). The list of compounds can include common names, HMDB IDs or KEGG IDs with one compound per row. Compound concentration tables must have samples in rows and compounds in columns. MetPA’s output is a series of tables indicating which pathways are significantly enriched (along with accompanying statistics) as well as a variety of graphs or pathway maps illustrating where and how certain pathways were enriched. MetPA’s graphical output uses a colorful Google-Maps visualization system that allows simple, intuitive data exploration that lets users employ a computer mouse or track pad to select, <b>drag</b> and place <b>images</b> and to seamlessly zoom in and out. Users can explore MetPA’s output using three different views or levels: 1) a metabolome view; 2) a pathway view; 3) a compound view.|$|R
40|$|Two parameterizations of {{turbulent}} {{boundary layer}} processes at the interface between an ice shelf and the ocean beneath are investigated {{in terms of their}} impact on simulated melt rates and feedbacks. The parameterizations differ in the transfer coefficients for heat and freshwater fluxes. In their simplest form, they are assumed constant and hence are independent of the velocity of ocean currents at the ice shelf base. An augmented melt rate parameterization accounts for frictional turbulence via transfer coefficients that do depend on boundary layer current velocities via a drag law. In simulations with both parameterizations for idealized as well as realistic cavity geometries under Pine Island Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, significant differences in melt rate patterns between the velocity-independent and velocity-dependent formulations are found. While patterns are strongly correlated to those of thermal forcing for velocity-independent transfer coefficients, melting in the case of velocity-dependent coefficients is collocated with regions of high boundary layer currents, in particular where rapid plume outflow occurs. Both positive and negative feedbacks between melt rates, boundary layer temperature, velocities, and buoyancy fluxes are identified. Melt rates are found to increase with increasing <b>drag</b> coefficient inline <b>image,</b> in agreement with plume model simulations, but optimal values of Cd inferred from plume models are not easily transferable.
