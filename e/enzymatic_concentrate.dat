40|$|Mixing is {{an energy}} {{demanding}} process {{which has been}} previously shown to affect <b>enzymatic</b> hydrolysis. <b>Concentrated</b> biomass slurries are associated with high and non-Newtonian viscosities and mixing in these systems is a complex task. Poor mixing can lead to mass and/or heat transfer problems as well as inhomogeneous enzyme distribution, both of which can cause possible yield reduction. Furthermore the stirring energy dissipation may impact the particle size which in turn may affect the enzymatic hydrolysis. The objective of the current work was to specifically quantify the effects of mixing on particle-size distribution (PSD) and relate this {{to changes in the}} enzymatic hydrolysis. Two rather different materials were investigated, namely pretreated Norway spruce and giant reed...|$|R
40|$|Summary- Diprion pini L is a sawfly whose larvae cause sudden, {{brief and}} {{spectacular}} defoliation on Pinus sylvestris. In France, bivoltine populations in lowland areas and univoltine populations in mountain areas cohabit, all living in forests located at varying distances from each other. The char-acteristics of the diapause of mountain populations {{are different from}} those of lowland populations. Six natural populations were studied using enzymatic electrophoresis to identify markers reflecting genetic heterogeneity in the French D pini populations: three lowland (Rambouillet, Romorantin, Lor-ris) and three mountain populations (Saint-Just-Saint-Rambert, Ceillac, Fontchristianne). The study of <b>enzymatic</b> polymorphism <b>concentrated</b> on six loci: three polymorphic esterase loci, a monomor-phic malate dehydrogenase locus, a monomorphic and a polymorphic amino-peptidase loci. The determination of genetic distance between populations did not allow us to discriminate between bivoltine lowland populations and univoltine mountain populations. The populations fell into two sub-groups: those from the Alps and Rambouillet, and those from central France (Lorris, Romorantin an...|$|R
30|$|The {{supernatant}} {{of liquid}} cultures of E. coli clones expressing wild-type rCelStrep and the selected mutants was concentrated {{by using the}} stirred ultrafiltration Amicon® system (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) with a 3 [*]kDa polyethersulfone membrane. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>enzymatic</b> extract {{was used to determine}} the optimum temperature and pH and thermo-resistance of the cellulase activity. The pH dependence of enzyme activity was determined between pH 4.0 and 6.0 by dissolving AZO-CMC in the appropriate sodium acetate buffer at 50  °C. The temperature dependence of enzyme activity was determined between 40 and 60  °C in sodium acetate buffer pH 6.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a series}} of small studies on the production of omega- 3 concentrates from salmon by-products. Because raw material must be of highest quality for the production of nutraceuticals (i. e. omega- 3 capsules), spoilage rates and fatty acid composition changes were examined by applying different handling and pretreatment procedures. Further, different <b>enzymatic</b> methods for <b>concentrating</b> omega- 3 fatty acids from oil were compared. The results provided important insight and will be used as part of larger initiatives on the creation of a Biorefinery strategy for the province’s aquaculture waste. The knowledge and experience gained by the Bioprocessing team and the fine-tuned analytical methods, especially GC (Gas Chromatography) will be highly valuable for academic and industry use in future projects...|$|R
40|$|Current studies about lipase {{production}} {{involve the}} use of agro-industrial residues and newly isolated microorganisms aimed at increasing economic attractiveness of the process. Based on these aspects, the main objective of this work is to perform the partial characterization of enzymatic extracts produced by a newly isolated Penicillium crustosum in solid-state fermentation. Lipase extract presented optimal temperature and pH of 37 A degrees C and 9 - 10, respectively. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>enzymatic</b> extract showed more stability at 25 A degrees C and pH 7. The enzymes kept 100 % of their enzymatic activity until 60 days of storage at 4 and - 10 A degrees C. The stability under calcium salts indicated that the hydrolytic activity presented decay {{with the increase of}} calcium concentration. The specificity under several substrates indicated good enzyme activities in triglycerides from C 4 to C 18. CAPES/PROCADCAPES/PROCADCNPqCNPqIntecnialIntecnia...|$|R
40|$|Urease, {{purified}} {{from the}} dehusked seeds of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.), was characterized for formation of polymorphic {{forms of the}} enzyme using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and activity staining techniques. The purified enzyme tended to form multimeric forms with three species of molecular mass of approximately 540, 600 and 700 kDa, respectively. <b>Enzymatic</b> activity was <b>concentrated</b> in the 540 kDa form and the polymorphic forms showed low (600 kDa) or no (700 kDa) catalytic activity. The formation of the polymorphic forms was a function of increasing salt concentration and presence of hydroxyl reagents. The multimeric forms had sulfhydryl bridges connecting them; addition of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (5 mM) resulted in formation of the basic unit of 540 kDa and loss of the higher molecular mass forms. Unlike urease from soybean or jack bean, no 240 kDa form was observed {{in any of the}} conditions studied...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} the {{production}} of cellulases from pretreated sugarcane bagasse by the filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum IOC 3844 and their application in the hydrolysis of this same substrate, for a future use in second-generation ethanol production. The production of cellulases was optimized, which resulted in high enzymatic activities after 42 hrs of process in an instrumented bioreactor (CMCase 27, 017 U x L- 1; FPase 1, 225 U x L- 1; and &# 946;-glucosidase 609 U x L- 1). The <b>enzymatic</b> extract was <b>concentrated</b> by using a hollow fiber membrane filtration system. The concentrated extract was applied in the hydrolysis of pretreated sugarcane bagasse, after 28 hrs of enzymatic reaction, displaying a similar catalytic performance of that attained with a commercial enzymatic preparation (hydrolysis efficiency of roughly 50 %). Finally, the enzymatic extract was partially characterized {{in terms of the}} molecular weights of the main activities of the enzymatic pool. Electrophoretic analysis identified eleven protein bands; six of them were related to CMCase activity and revealing molecular weights that varied from 48 to 78 kDa, and two bands were associated with &# 946;-glucosidase activity and having molecular weights of 75 and 85 kDa...|$|R
40|$|Water {{hyacinth}} biomass is {{a potential}} substrate {{for the production of}} ethanol which can be conveniently used as a gasoline additive as an octane booster and improve the vehicle emissions. The present study is focused on isolating and screening indigenous fungi for the hydrolysis of water hyacinth in the lignocellulosic conversion process. The initial cellulose activity was measured as ICMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) index which was found to be max at pH= 5. Crude enzymes extracted after solid state fermentation (SSF) in an effort to reduce the cost of ethanol production, which needs lesser infrastructure and relatively less skilled manpower besides being able to use cheaper raw materials for enzyme production. The cellulytic and xylanytic activity was monitored using water hyacinth as substrate. Out of several isolates screened, best result was recorded up to 131. 995 mg/g of reducing sugar and xylose yield up to 210. 4 mg/g of WHB. <b>Concentrated</b> <b>enzymatic</b> hydrolysate of WHB containing reducing sugars and xylose was used for ethanol fermentation. The maximal ethanol yield was 2. 217 g/l using Pichia stipitis, 2. 163 g/l using Candida shehatae and 1. 925 g/l using Saccharomyces cerevisae. Fungal isolate F 6 provided the best yield as well as total extracellular enzyme production in comparison to other fungal strains, so identification of the fungal sample to its nearest species was undertaken. Fungal strain F 6 (Alternaria alternate) was sequenced and the genomic DNA information was submitted to gene bank NCBI and an unique accession no JQ 781696 was assigned...|$|R
30|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{synthesis}} of carrier-free immobilized biocatalysts by cross-linking of enzyme aggregates has appeared as a promising technique. Cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) present several interesting advantages over carrier-bound immobilized enzymes, such as highly <b>concentrated</b> <b>enzymatic</b> activity, high stability of the produced superstructure, important production costs savings {{by the absence of}} a support, and the fact that no previous purification of the enzyme is needed. However, the published literature evidences that a) much specific non-systematic exploratory work is being done and, b) recovered activity calculations in CLEAs still need to be optimized. In this context, this contribution presents results of an optimized procedure for the calculation of the activity retained by CLEAs, based on the comparison of their specific activity relative to their free enzyme counterparts. The protocol implies determination of precipitable protein content in commercial enzyme preparations through precipitation with ammonium sulphate and a protein co-feeder. The identification of linear ranges of activity versus concentration/amount of protein in the test reaction is also required for proper specific activity determinations. By use of mass balances that involve the protein initially added to the synthesis medium, and the protein remaining in the supernatant and washing solutions (these last derived from activity measurements), the precipitable protein present in CLEAs is obtained, and their specific activity can be calculated. In the current contribution the described protocol was applied to CLEAs of Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase, which showed a recovered specific activity of 11.1 % relative to native lipase. The approach described is simple and can easily be extended to other CLEAs and also to carrier-bound immobilized enzymes for accurate determination of their retained activity.|$|R
40|$|The non - <b>enzymatic</b> {{browning}} of <b>concentrated</b> apple juice, {{honey and}} their diluted systems was investigated. The effects of temperature, αw and / or the initial reactant concentration on colour change of both food systems {{were evaluated by}} spectrophotometric absorbance measurements (A 420). The kinetics of brown pigment formation in both systems was described by the logistic model, while the fitting of secondary models revealed the following: a) the modified Arrhenius model was the most appropriate in describing the combined effect of the above mentioned factors on browning reaction kinetic constants; b) the browning reaction rates can be adequately predicted under conditions differing from those used in the initial experimental design; and c) the final combined dynamic model that was developed can predict the extent of non-enzymatic browning of both products under dynamic conditions of fluctuating temperature protocols, usually applied in the food industry. The development of a microbial TTI system {{was based on the}} microbial growth and metabolism of a lactic acid bacteria strain in a model substrate system (glucose consumption, lactic acid production and the following pH drop progressively lead to the color change from red to yellow of a chemical chromatic indicator which also exists in the system). The study of the TTI kinetics (under isothermal storage conditions) showed that the pH and colour change of the TTI followed closely the bacterial growth. The end point of the TTI coincided with a bacterial population similar to that observed at spoilage levels and with activation energy almost identical to the one of the lactobacillus strain growth. Furthermore, the desired end point of the TTI at a certain temperature can be achieved by appropriate adjustment of the initial microbial concentration of the inoculated in the system microorganism. The developed microbial TTI system was successfully applied to monitor the quality status of minced beef packed under modified atmosphere with the end point of the TTI coinciding with the time of sensory rejection point of the product during its storage under either isothermal chilled temperature conditions or under low temperature periodic changing protocols. ...|$|R
