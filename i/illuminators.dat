5|$|Netherlandish <b>illuminators</b> had an {{important}} export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. <b>Illuminators</b> responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{started the}} {{systematic}} {{collection of books}} after the arrival of his first librarian, Galeotto Marzio, a friend of Janus Pannonius from Ferrara in around 1465. The exchange of letters between Taddeo Ugoleto, who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed {{to the development of}} the royal library because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts. Matthias also employed scriptors, <b>illuminators,</b> and book-binders. Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of Europe's largest collections of books when he died.|$|E
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and <b>illuminators,</b> noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The most {{usual way}} in the 15th century for a patron to {{commission}} a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only {{a certain number of}} masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan guilds to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book <b>illuminators.</b> For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a number of schools {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript <b>illuminators.</b> They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E

40|$|This {{protocol}} {{describes a}} large-volume <b>illuminator,</b> which {{was developed for}} optogenetic manipulations in the non-human primate brain. The <b>illuminator</b> is a modified plastic optical fiber with etched tip, such that the light emitting surface area is > 100 x that of a conventional fiber. In addition to describing {{the construction of the}} large-volume <b>illuminator,</b> this protocol details the quality-control calibration used to ensure even light distribution. Further, this protocol describes techniques for inserting and removing the large volume <b>illuminator.</b> Both superficial and deep structures may be illuminated. This large volume <b>illuminator</b> {{does not need to be}} physically coupled to an electrode, and because the <b>illuminator</b> is made of plastic, not glass, it will simply bend in circumstances when traditional optical fibers would shatter. Because this <b>illuminator</b> delivers light over behaviorally-relevant tissue volumes (≈ 10 mm 3) with no greater penetration damage than a conventional optical fiber, it facilitates behavioral studies using optogenetics in non-human primates.

40|$|An <b>illuminator</b> with a micro {{scanning}} slit array for NA 0. 75 lithography {{system has}} been proposed in this paper. In this <b>illuminator,</b> the beam is shaped by a diffractive optical element (DOE), a zoom and axicon lenses. The beam is homogenized by a micro intergrator rod array. The micro scanning slit array is used to substitute for the traditional internal rema. A micro lens array and a condenser image the micro scanning slit array onto the mask. This <b>illuminator</b> needs no illumination lens group and reduces {{the effect of the}} vibration introduced by the internal rema. The <b>illuminator</b> is designed and simulated.

50|$|The {{phase angle}} varies from 0° to 180°. The value of 0° {{corresponds}} to the position where the <b>illuminator,</b> the observer, and the object are collinear, with the <b>illuminator</b> and the observer {{on the same side}} of the object. This is known as astronomical opposition. The value of 180° is the position where the object is between the <b>illuminator</b> and the observer. Values less than 90° represent backscattering; values greater than 90° represent forward scattering.|$|R

25|$|In a {{world before}} the printed book, {{fidelity}} to the original in transcribing of books by hand {{was the only thing}} that maintained the Bible and other works of literature for posterity.

25|$|He was presumably born in Nijmegen, {{then in the}} Duchy of Guelders, {{which was}} bought by Philip the Bold in 1473, {{and is in the}} modern Netherlands. He {{probably}} trained there in the workshop of his father, the artist Willem Maelwael (his uncle was also an artist), and is recorded as an artist in 1382. He was the uncle of the famous manuscript <b>illuminators,</b> the three Limbourg brothers, whom he introduced to Philip's service around 1400. Malouel also worked as an illuminator, but seems mostly to have produced larger works.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the medal is also clear {{from the number of}} Renaissance sculptors, <b>illuminators</b> and {{painters}} who used Pisanello's portrait of John almost as a stock type for figures from distant lands or times. Piero della Francesca is perhaps the most celebrated artist in this respect. In his fresco of Constantine leading his troops into battle by the Milvian Bridge in The History of the True Cross series of frescos in Arezzo, the portrait and headgear of Constantine is clearly modeled on Pisanello's medal. Piero also used Pisanello's portrait of John to depict Pontius Pilate in his Flagellation of Christ.|$|E

25|$|Objects in {{precious}} {{materials such}} as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, {{much more so than}} monumental sculpture — we know the names of more makers of these than painters, <b>illuminators</b> or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in enamel, became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral by Nicholas of Verdun. The bronze Gloucester candlestick and the brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at Hildesheim Cathedral, the Gniezno Doors, and the doors of the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona are other substantial survivals. The aquamanile, a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic zoomorphic forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.|$|E

Syadvada is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.|$|E
500|$|There was {{considerable}} overlap between panel painting and illumination; van Eyck, van der Weyden, Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures. In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin's work was {{often used as}} a source in this way, for example in the [...] "Hours of Raoul d'Ailly". Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women. The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities {{of some of the}} more significant <b>illuminators</b> are lost.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} factors led to the {{popularity}} of Netherlandish <b>illuminators.</b> Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in {{the region in the}} centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's [...] "library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.|$|E
