30|$|The cited {{differences}} in the performances of TEOS on Globigerina Limestone and Giallo Terra di Siena, considering that higher improvements are obtained for GL which has a lower quartz content than GS, might be ascribed to the different formulations used: the commercial product based on white spirit was actually {{more effective than the}} alternative TEOS formulation based <b>on</b> <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (having however the advantage of being less toxic). Hence, TEOS efficacy confirmed to be highly dependent on the solvent type [13]; when <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is used, TEOS performances are comparable to those of HAP, while the formulation in white spirit leads to better mechanical performances.|$|R

This cross-sectional study {{was based on a}} prospective occupational cohort in south China, which focusing on occupational risk factors related cardiovascular health problems. A total of 283 participants (200 low <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposed workers and 83 controls) was finally enrolled in this study. Linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship between arterial blood pressures and low level <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure. We used mediation method to explore possible mediated roles of neurogenic factors. Systolic blood pressure (SBP, 123 ± 10 vs. 118 ± 11), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, 79 ± 7 vs. 74 ± 7) and mean blood pressure (MBP, 93 ± 8 vs. 89 ± 9) were different between the exposed group and the control group (p < 0. 01). After adjusting for covariates, the difference was still significant. Besides, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and smoking had an interactive effect on DBP and MBP (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Hospital {{infections are}} {{still one of}} the main causes of death. These infections may be {{transferred}} from one patient to another or through medical devices. The prevalence of hospital-acquired infection is 6 %- 12 %. This rate increases to about 65 % in some underdeveloped countries. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of <b>Isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and Ethanol in disinfection in pediatrics ward and neonatal intensive care unit. Methods &amp; Materials: In this trial, 116 specimens were collected from medical devices before and after disinfecting with <b>Isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and Ethanol. In order to assess the exact effect of these two disinfectants, some of the medical devices were exposed directly to microorganism colonies and then were disinfected using <b>Isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> or Ethanol. Samples were cultured on Petri dishes. Results: The results of cultured specimens before disinfection showed that some microorganisms such as Staphylococcus, Escherichia-Coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter were grown on medical devices. After disinfection, only two microorganisms grew (staphylococcus and Escherichia-Coli) on devices that were disinfected with Ethanol; and there were no growth on the devices that were disinfected with <b>Isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the <b>Isopropyl</b> <b>Alcohol</b> is more effective in disinfecting than the Ethanol.

40|$|Despite {{a number}} of studies on the efficacies of {{antiseptics}} for the prevention of blood culture contamination, it still remains unclear which antiseptic should be used. Although the combination of povidone-iodine and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> has been traditionally used in many institutions, the application of povidone-iodine needs extra time, and {{there is little evidence that}} this combination could have an additive effect in reducing contamination rates. To elucidate the additive efficacy of povidone-iodine, we compared two antiseptics, 70 % <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> only and 70 % <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> plus povidone-iodine, in a prospective, nonrandomized, and partially blinded study in a community hospital in Japan between 1 October 2007 and 21 March 2008. All blood samples for culture were drawn by first-year residents who received formal training on collection techniques. Skin antisepsis was performed with 70 % <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> plus povidone-iodine <b>on</b> all inpatient wards and with only 70 % <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the emergency department. For the group of specimens from inpatient wards cultured, 13 (0. 46 %) of 2, 797 cultures were considered contaminated. For the group of specimens from the emergency department cultured, 12 (0. 42 %) of 2, 856 cultures were considered contaminated. There was no significant difference in the contamination rates between the two groups (relative risk, 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 41 to 1. 98; P = 0. 80). In conclusion, the use of a single application of 70 % <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is a sufficient and a more cost- and time-effective method of obtaining blood samples for culture than the use of a combination of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and povidone-iodine.
