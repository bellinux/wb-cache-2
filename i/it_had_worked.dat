25|$|When these federal pay for {{performance}} systems failed, many were surprised because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> so {{well within the}} private sector. Much of this failure was attributed {{to the fact that}} most of the research on pay {{for performance}} had been done in the private rather than public sector. These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms.|$|E

Council deputy leader Alan Mattingly said that the majority of councillors would go to jail rather than cut services. It was soon clear that there was a significant split in the Labour group as Leader Jack Hart told a council meeting on 28 March that the Government would not increase their spending limit and urged members to be realistic. His ally, councillor David Gilles, proposed a budget of £151.5m. Alan Mattingly by contrast urged the council to stand firm and despite Hart's support the budget was defeated by 18 to 35; a budget proposed by the SDP was voted down by 20 to 33.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee {{sent its}} report advocating {{passage of the}} {{proposal}} to the full Senate. The Judiciary Committee had approved the proposal {{by a vote of}} 11 to 6. The six members who opposed the plan, Democratic Senators James Eastland of Mississippi, John Little McClellan of Arkansas, and Sam Ervin of North Carolina, along with Republican Senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska, Hiram Fong of Hawaii, and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, all argued that although the present system had potential loopholes, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> well throughout the years. Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the measure were about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the proposal to pass the full Senate. He called upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided Republican senators to support the proposal. However, Nixon, while not reneging on his previous endorsement, chose not to make any further personal appeals to back the proposal.|$|E

Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E
500|$|These {{activities}} affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report {{noted the}} lack of [...] "any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute" [...] to match the return to peacetime, remembering the [...] "academic tranquility of the prewar years", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities. The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.|$|E

500|$|The group {{continued}} to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter Frank Barsalona, and generally avoided festivals, but made an important exception with the Woodstock Festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500. The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During [...] "Pinball Wizard", Abbie Hoffman took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of John Sinclair before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during [...] "See Me, Feel Me", the sun rose, almost as if on cue. Two weeks later, the group played the second Isle of Wight Festival, {{using one of the}} largest live PAs available. Though media attention was on Bob Dylan playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, [...] "We know that the stage act we had, with Tommy in it, would work under any circumstances, because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> many times on tour." ...|$|E
500|$|Valiente {{was born}} Doreen Edith Dominy on 4 January 1922 at Colliers Wood in the Southern English town of Mitcham, Surrey. Her father, Harry Dominy, was a civil engineer, {{and he lived}} with her mother Edith in Colliers Wood. Harry came from a Methodist {{background}} and Edith from a Congregationalist one, however Doreen was never baptised, as was the custom of the time, due to an argument that Edith had had with the local vicar. Doreen later claimed {{that she had not}} had a close or affectionate relationship with her parents, whom she characterised as highly conventional and heavily focused on social climbing. During her childhood they moved to Horley in Surrey, and it was there [...] according to her later account [...] that she had an early spiritual experience while staring at the moon. From there, her family moved to the West Country and then to the New Forest. In either late 1934 or 1935, Doreen's mother left her father and took her to live with maternal relatives in Southampton. Valiente first began practicing magic aged 13, performing a spell to prevent her mother being harassed by a co-worker; she came to believe that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked.</b> Her early knowledge of magical practices may have derived from books that she found in the local library. Her parents were concerned by this behaviour and sent her to a convent school. She despised the school and left it at the age of 15, refusing to return. She had wanted to go to art school, but instead gained employment in a factory, before moving on to work as a clerk and typist at the Unemployment Assistance Board.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, Henry Ford's enthusiasm for reentering the tractor market was growing, {{but he still}} {{did not have a}} design or {{features}} that could ensure a runaway, market-changing success. His idea for a tractor with one large drive wheel was extensively developed, but the prototypes did not perform well. Various people who worked on it have wondered whether it was just a ruse to mislead Ford's competitors about his real intentions for a coming model, but it seems that he was quite serious about it and was probably disappointed that it did not work out; if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked,</b> {{it would have been a}} powerful fulfillment of his penchant for simplicity and very low cost.|$|E
2500|$|A {{survey of}} 500 British Muslims {{undertaken}} by Channel 4 News in 2007 found that 24% believed the four bombers {{blamed for the}} attacks did not perform them. In 2006, the government had refused to hold a public inquiry, stating that [...] "it would be a ludicrous diversion". Prime Minister Tony Blair said an independent inquiry would [...] "undermine support" [...] for MI5, while {{the leader of the}} opposition, David Cameron, said only a full inquiry would [...] "get to the truth". In reaction to revelations about the extent of security service investigations into the bombers prior to the attack, the Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, said: [...] "It {{is becoming more and more}} clear that the story presented to the public and Parliament is at odds with the facts." [...] However, the decision against an independent public inquest was later reversed. A full public inquest into the bombings was subsequently begun from October 2010. Coroner Lady Justice Hallett stated that the inquest would examine how each victim died and whether MI5, if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> better, could have prevented the attack.|$|E
