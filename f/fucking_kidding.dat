500|$|Although other labels {{expressed}} interest in Taking Back Sunday, Victory encouraged them to record an album. Tell All Your Friends was recorded {{over a period of}} two weeks in December 2001 at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studio in New Jersey with producer Sal Villanueva. The sessions ended up costing $10,000. The band arrived without a drum set, presuming that the studio would have one. Engineer Tim Gilles said, [...] "No major studio in America has their own [...] set. You've gotta be <b>fucking</b> <b>kidding</b> me". The group wanted to re-record [...] "Your Own Disaster" [...] from their demo, but was unable to due to time and money constraints. Instead, it was re-recorded for Taking Back Sunday's next album, Where You Want to Be (2004). Villanueva contributed guitar work and co-mixed the recordings with Rumblefish. The album was engineered by Gilles, Erin Farley, and Arun Venkatesh, with mastering by Gilles at Surgical Sound.|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was {{performing}} at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing [...] "Basket Case", {{because he believed}} the group's time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen {{in the rear of}} the audience was labeled [...] "1 Minutes Left", saying [...] "You're not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be <b>fucking</b> <b>kidding</b> me!". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a [...] "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that [...] "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas" [...] also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the Chicago Bulls had gaffed Bird's {{complimentary}} tickets. Prior to tip-off, Bird confronted Bulls coach Doug Collins on the sideline, informed Collins {{about the}} ticket situation, {{and asked him}} what the visitor scoring record was, vowing to break it. As the game started, the Bulls defended Bird with Ben Poquette, a Caucasian forward. Bird, who was known to take insult when an opposing team put a white player on him, laughed at Collins, [...] "Ben Poquette? Are you <b>fucking</b> <b>kidding</b> me?" [...] Bird had 33 at the half and ended up scoring 41 points.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 the Sea Org {{moved to}} shore in Clearwater, Florida. Quentin was {{assigned}} to operations there but was often absent. Police discovered him unconscious in his car in Las Vegas on October 28, 1976, without any identifying documents. L. Ron Hubbard was furious at the news, shouting, [...] "That stupid <b>fucking</b> <b>kid!</b> Look what he's done to me!" [...] Quentin died two weeks later without having regained consciousness.|$|R
5000|$|Chaney {{entered the}} conference mid-speech, accusing Calipari of {{manipulating}} the referees. When Calipari attempted {{to respond to}} the accusations, Chaney yelled, “Shut up goddammit!”, and proceeded to charge the stage, before being stopped by security. While being held back, Chaney shouted, [...] "When I see you, I'm gonna kick your ass!". As security restrained Chaney, he repeatedly yelled, [...] "I'll kill you!" [...] and angrily admitted telling his players to [...] "knock your <b>fucking</b> <b>kids</b> in the mouth." [...] Chaney received a one-game suspension for the incident. Chaney has recently praised Calipari's coaching ability and defended him over the Derrick Rose controversy at the University of Memphis.|$|R
2500|$|Cantrell is {{critical}} of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. Cantrell stated, [...] "There are two things {{you never want to}} get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we're {{going to be talking about}} this for awhile". [...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are <b>fucking</b> <b>kids,</b> there’s a huge problem".|$|R
2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, guest star Dylan McDermott spoke {{about being in}} the second season of American Horror Story, [...] "I loved doing the show. It's like being home for me. We talked about it I think early in the season. He [...] called me over the summer and {{we were trying to}} figure out what was the best plan and in what capacity. I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered he called me and he explained it to me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He explained to me what my character was going to be and I was like, 'Are you <b>fucking</b> <b>kidding</b> me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E

5000|$|On their collaboration, Nguyen says [...] "She was {{everything}} I needed her to be: a steward in support. I didn’t {{want to put}} 'Millionaire' on the record because it felt too vulnerable, and she said, 'Are you <b>fucking</b> <b>kidding?</b> Of course we’re putting it on the record'—which is what I needed." ...|$|E
5000|$|We've known Wanga {{since he}} was a street kid. He lives in this house in Cape Town and squats on a farm. This year, Wanga was {{supposed}} to go to one of these rituals because he wasn't circumcised. We thought maybe he just shouldn't go because 60 <b>kids</b> <b>fucking</b> died this year because their penises didn't work properly afterward and shit. So I asked him what would happen if he didn't go to the bush, {{and he said that he}} wouldn't be a man and he wouldn't be able to speak to the other men. So I asked him why he was speaking to me and he said, [...] "Because you're cool, Ninja." [...] Then he looked at my tattoo and said he wanted to be [...] "Evil Boy for life." [...] Ninja ...|$|R
500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's <b>fucking</b> rubbish. <b>Kids</b> don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|R
5000|$|RUFKM?, is an {{abbreviation}} for [...] "Are You <b>Fucking</b> <b>Kidding</b> Me?" [...] in Internet slang. It {{was first used}} in text messaging but is now widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication, and even face-to-face communication. It {{is one of many}} initialisms for expressing reactions to absurd situations and stories like FML? ("Fuck My Life"). The abbreviations RUFKM and FML have become so common that entire websites are dedicated to sharing stories about situations that make you say RUFKM? or FML? ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{separate}} digital single {{was released}} after the song won Miller-Heidke and partner Keir Nuttall first prize at the International Songwriting Competition.

It included the previously unreleased song, [...] "Are You <b>Fucking</b> <b>Kidding</b> Me?", recorded at one of her concerts on the Caught in the Crowd Tour. Due to the potential confusion between the two releases, the initial release is named Caught In the Crowd - EP on Miller-Heidke's iTunes Store.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{songs on}} the single were {{recorded}} during the Allroy Sez sessions in November and December 1987 at Third Wave Recording in Torrance, California, with Stevenson and Richard Andrews acting as record producers. Smalley later recalled that Stevenson was demanding and meticulous in the recording of [...] "Just Perfect":I had to sing [...] "Just Perfect" [...] for like four hours in the studio until he got the take he wanted. I said [...] "Dude, I’m really hungry. Let’s take a little break and I’ll come back to it." [...] He comes back with this big Snickers bar, tapes {{it to the other}} side of the glass and says [...] "When you’re done you can have it!" [...] I’m like [...] "Oh my god, are you <b>fucking</b> <b>kidding</b> me? Alright, fucking push play." ...|$|E
