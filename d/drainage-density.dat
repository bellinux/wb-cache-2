40|$|Sustainable Forest District (DFS) is a {{geo-economic}} {{and social}} complex that aims the integration between local development and activities based in forest sustainable exploration. This work {{was developed in}} the scope of PIME project (Projeto Integrado MCT-EMBRAPA) created to evaluate the social, economic and environmental impacts of the DFS created along BR- 163 road. Contributing to the biodiversity study group, this paper presents the methodology and the results from terrestrial ecoregions mapping for the BR- 163 DFS. The Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm, based on neural network technique, used GIS layers of altitude, slope, <b>drainage-density,</b> tree cover percentage (MODIS TREE), and latitude as environmental variables for the mapping. The distribution of SOM layers-components indicated absence of spatial correlation between the selected variables. After final edition, the ecoregions map divided the area of 167, 174 km 2 of the DFS in 14 ecoregions. Altitude and latitude variables, considered as climate variable proxies, were mainly responsible for the north-south ecoregions subdivision. <b>Drainage-density</b> variable was responsible for defining ecoregions along Tapajos River. In general, the Kappa value obtained from the discriminant analysis (0. 8) indicates good separability between ecoregions limits. The BR- 163 DFS ecoregion map is available for free download, in order to obtain feedbacks from other dataset comparisons, and to promote discussions about local environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity.
