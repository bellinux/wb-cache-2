40|$|PROGRAM/PROJECT DESCRIPTION: WSDDM is a {{graphical}} {{depiction of}} a real-time, 60 -minute now-cast of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed/direction for the 10 km region surrounding an airport. This graphic provides vital information on weather parameters integral to the <b>ground</b> <b>de-icing</b> and airport surface clearing decision making process. I. TRAINING REQUIREMENTS...|$|E
40|$|NASA's {{program in}} {{aircraft}} icing research and technology is reviewed. The program {{relies heavily on}} computer codes and modern applied physics technology in seeking icing solutions on a finer scale than those offered in earlier programs. Three major goals of this program are to offer new approaches to ice protection, to improve our ability to model the response of an aircraft to an icing encounter, and to provide improved techniques and facilities for ground and flight testing. This paper reviews the following program elements: (1) new approaches to ice protection; (2) numerical codes for deicer analysis; (3) measurement and prediction of ice accretion {{and its effect on}} aircraft and aircraft components; (4) special wind tunnel test techniques for rotorcraft icing; (5) improvements of icing wind tunnels and research aircraft; (6) <b>ground</b> <b>de-icing</b> fluids used in winter operation; (7) fundamental studies in icing; and (8) droplet sizing instruments for icing clouds...|$|E
