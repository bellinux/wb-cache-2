40|$|Abstract Background Cigarette {{taxation}} {{has been}} perceived by academics and policy-makers {{as one of}} the most effective ways of reducing the use of cigarettes. On January 1 2002, the Taiwan government imposed a New Taiwan (NT) $ 5 per pack tax earmarked for the purpose of tobacco control. This study uses a survey collected prior to taxation to assess public attitudes toward cigarette taxation, public beliefs about the effectiveness of cigarette taxation at reducing cigarette use and public opinions about the allocation of this tax revenue. Methods Data were drawn from a national face-to-face interview on cigarette consumption in 2000. A total of 3, 279 adults were aged 18 to 64 years; 49. 9 % of whom were male and 50. 1 % female, and with a smoking prevalence of 49. 1 % and 4. 1 %, respectively. The attitudes toward cigarette tax were analysed using multi-logit regressions. We analysed by logistic regression the potential changes in smoking behaviour that smokers might make in response to the five NT (New Taiwan) dollar <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> on cigarettes per pack. We summarized public opinions about the allocation of <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> revenue using descriptive statistics. Results Current smokers (OR = 0. 34) and former smokers (OR = 0. 68) were less likely to support the cigarette tax than non-smokers. A favourable attitude toward the tax was positively associated with personal monthly income, especially among females. Among male smokers, the possibility of reducing/quitting smoking in response to the five-NT-dollar tax was negatively associated with the monthly expense for smoking. The two most frequently-suggested areas to receive money from the revenue collected from the <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> were health education and cancer subsidy. Conclusions Smoking status and economic factors determine the attitude and potential responses of people toward the cigarette tax. Taiwan's five NT-dollar <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> for cigarettes may have only a limited effect upon the reduction in cigarette use. </p...|$|E

Despite enthusiastic and widespread bipartisan support for tax reform laws that would eliminate special–interest loopholes, the legislative process has been paralyzed {{when it comes to}} passing these laws.

The paper studies the implications of desirability of earmarked and general fund based upon economic stabilization in a two-sector growth model. Regardless of the nature of public goods, <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> contributes to aggregate stabilization, while general fund may be destabilizing and cause fluctuations. The underlying mechanism in favor of earmarked taxes against general fund is that general fund creates intersectoral externalities and strategic complementarities that is sufficiently large to exert endogenously persistent and recurring fluctuations in aggregate activities in the absence of shocks to fundamentals. Earmarked taxing generates only sector-specific externalities that are too small to exert local indeterminacy. In a calibrated version, we compute the level of long-run welfare and the results reflect favorably upon the use of earmarked taxing. ...|$|E

This research used two methods to collect original data. The first method consisted of using a sample household survey and household diary records to collect data on OOP payment prospectively over a two-month period from a random sample of 600 households in central Taiwan. Using the individual as the unit of analysis, we obtained a total of 1062 sample subjects. To ascertain the quality and accuracy of survey data, the claim records of the bureau of NHI were merged with the survey data. These data were analyzed by a two-part model, with a probit model for use of health care and an ordinary least-squares model for OOP payments. Results of this research indicate that on average an individual's annual OOP payment for medical care was € 247, which is substantial, compared with the average € 144 for per capita NHI <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax.</b> Finally, results of model estimation indicate that supplemental health insurance and household income were positively associated with any use of health care, while household income was also positively associated with OOP payment for health care.

The decisions basic to the Swedish social insurance system and thus to the Swedish Welfare State were made during the 1910 s. A universal pension insurance system was decided upon in 1913. This was the world's first universal public insurance system. Pensions were provided both in cases of disability and of a person reaching the age of 67. Important factors explaining this decision were that Sweden had the oldest population in the Western world and thus high expenditures for poor relief, and that as the reporting and taxation of individual incomes had just been introduced it became possible to finance a universal pension system by means of compulsory contributions by the individual (a special <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax).</b> The establishment of a pension insurance system {{provided the basis for}} a system of insurance for work-related injuries, in 1916.

The presence of a pension insurance system and insurance for work-related injuries pointed to the need for a sickness insurance system. This was designed to deal with simple cases of injury as well as with more serious cases of illness or injury that could lead to disability. A proposal was presented in 1919.

In the second part we analyse the principles of the bill on fiscal federalism proposed by the Council of Ministers in August 2007, and discuss its expected effects on the financing of municipalities. We mainly refer to the problems of financial coordination between the different levels of government, and the fiscal autonomy of municipalities.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>earmarking,</b> or hypothecation, {{refers to}} the {{assigning}} of receipts either from a single tax base, or as a proportion from a wider pool of revenue, to a specific end use; it contrasts with general fund financing of expenditure from consolidated receipts. The idea has been seized on both by {{those who want to}} defend the public sector who think it would make taxation popular and by those who want to cut public spending who expect the opposite effect. Earmarking may be applied in a strong or substantive sense, or in a weak or nominal sense. In the strong case, revenue determines expenditure, or at least revenue must match expenditure, and there may be associated referendums on the amount of spending and the tax rate. In the weak case, earmarking is purely formal — undertaken to make the system more transparent and to inform the taxpayer of the cost of a service. Earmarking may also be wide, covering a whole spending programme, or narrow, for a specific project within a programme. The principal example of earmarking (nominal) in the UK today is National Insurance contributions (NICs) which go to the National Insurance Fund out of which contributory benefits are paid.
