They are: retrieval, insertion, deletion, and drill. The report first reviews the history, the types, the advantages/disadvantages, {{and the effectiveness}} of CAI. It then examines CAI for computer science such as CAI on programming and CAI on algorithms. The properties and advantages of B-trees algorithms are also discussed. Next, the walkthrough insertion lesson describes four sub-lessons in each lesson from the user's standpoint. Four sub-lessons are: introduction, tutor, simulation/drill, and conclusion. The internal design of the program describes the BTAP package from the programmer???s standpoint. Finally, critiques and future enhancements are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2016 NBA preseason on October 4, 2016, an {{overhauled}} <b>graphics</b> and <b>animation</b> <b>package</b> debuted for ESPN's NBA telecasts. The graphics have been formatted {{to fit the}} full 16:9 letterbox presentation. With the updated graphics came a revamp of the co-branded NBA on ESPN logo, which replaced variations of the original logo {{that had been used}} since its 2002 debut. Moreover, the revamped NBA on ESPN logo is displayed as an overlay in the upper-left corner of the screen during instant replays. The score bar is significantly larger than the previous one, which was used since the 2013 NBA Western Conference Finals, and has been streamlined. Notably, the timeout indicators were changed from the [...] "lights" [...] that were used since the 2010-11 season to a numerical representation. Also, the [...] "stats bar" [...] was moved from underneath the score bar to the right side of it. Additionally, an updated composition of ESPN's theme [...] "Fast Break" [...] was introduced for the regular season, replacing the original composition that had been used since the 2004-05 NBA season, yet the postseason version remained the same.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 27 - 29) The {{thesis is}} {{a prototype of}} a general purpose <b>animation</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>package</b> designed to help the user to write animation program. Considering that most users in the university are familiar with PASCAL language, the package was written in PASCAL. In the thesis, four programs have been developed. The first one is 'lib. p', which is library procedures and functions, {{and it is the}} core part of the package. The second is 'main. p', which has all the library procedures declared as 'external' procedures. It also contains an initialization subroutine and few other procedures. There are two sample application programs as well: 'demo. p' calls most of library subroutines to demonstrate their usage. 'deform. p' shows how to use the package to develop an animation program. Since the two application programs are simple and straightforward, they provide good examples to show the user how to use the graphics package. The Graphics package is written on the Chromatics 7900...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer <b>graphics</b> <b>animation</b> systems {{provide the}} ability to {{integrate}} on-site engineers * expertise into design systems as well as construction management processes. Computer <b>graphics</b> <b>animation</b> improves coordination and communication among engineering, construction and client organizations. The expedited communication leads to a substantial improvement of quality and productivity in the AEC industry. Computer <b>graphics</b> <b>animation</b> {{makes it possible to}} move through the design objects and view the proposed facility interactively in virtual environment. In this way, all participants can work as a team beyond their specific interests. A collaborative work environment is created. The paper introduces the application of computer <b>graphics</b> <b>animation</b> as a tool for the construction management in terms of computer integrated construction, evaluates the role and proposes recommendations for the application. Several pilot trials have been implemented on a dam construction project, on a currently on-going industrial district readjustment project in Osaka, Japan, and on a highway reconstruction project in Kobe...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{developing}} a graphic design learning module based on technology and hearing-impaired student learning styles. The Design and Development Research methodology introduced by Richey and Klein (2007) involving three phases {{was used in this}} study. Data from the first phase, the needs analysis, were collected through questionnaires administered on 58 hearing-impaired students in Special Vocational Secondary School and Polytechnic, while semi-structured interviewed were conducted on five academic instructors in graphic design and hearing-impaired field using purposive sampling method. Findings from the closed-ended questions were analyzed by descriptive statistic while the open-ended responses were subjected to thematic analysis. The data from the second phase were obtained through the Fuzzy Delphi technique of 24 experts in special education, education technology, curriculum and graphic design fields. Analysis relied on the experts’ responses to the questionnaire based on a five-point Fuzzy Linguistic Likert Scale. The threshold ‘d’ value was calculated to determine the experts’ consensus on all questionnaire items. The phase two of development involved refinement of lesson plans and web designs with the “Introduction of <b>Graphic</b> <b>Animation,</b> <b>Graphic</b> <b>Animation</b> Framework, <b>Graphic</b> <b>Animation</b> Composition, <b>Graphic</b> <b>Animation</b> Creation and <b>Graphic</b> <b>Animation</b> Documentation” topics. The phase three, the effectiveness testing, was conducted using pretest and posttest on students’ knowledge while post-test on <b>graphic</b> <b>animation</b> skills project were assessed on 15 hearing-impaired students. Furthermore, usability testing was done through retrospective on 10 hearing-impaired students who had used the graphic design learning module with one interpreter. Semi structured interview responses were analyzed thematically. The findings show that there was a need to develop a graphic design module for hearing-impaired based on technology and learning styles. The majority of the students agreed that <b>graphic</b> <b>animation</b> is most difficult course compared to others. In addition, index learning styles score indicated that hearing-impaired students have different learning styles. According to the academicians, learning module based on student-impaired learning style was yet to be implemented and thus, these findings supported the relevance of graphic design module development for the hearing-impaired students. The findings in the phase two of design study showed that the experts achieved unanimous consensus with the threshold ‘d’ value ≤ 0. 2, exceeded 75...|$|R
