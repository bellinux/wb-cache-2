25|$|The {{greatest}} issue {{related to}} Internet privacy internationally {{is that of}} data collection. At this point in time, the U.S. and the European Union had separate sets of privacy policies, making it increasingly difficult for companies such as Google to exist globally without violating such policies. Google {{is just one example}} of a large company whose primary <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money by serving their product, web browsing, to consumers. Consumers, however, are concerned with the quality of that product and their privacy. Online data collection by search engines allows Internet businesses to track consumer’s online roadmap, everything from the sites they visit to the purchases they make. This poses problems globally to those who are web users around the world, especially in a world where there is no overarching privacy policy. The general consensus of this issue regarding international privacy violations at the time of Fleischer’s U.N. address is that, since the Internet is global, the privacy policies should also be global and unified.|$|E

25|$|Earthquake {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such structures {{more resistant to}} earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures {{that will not be}} damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake {{engineering is}} the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.|$|E

Kotecha reflected: [...] "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it sound like anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult".

The game takes place over the course of seven days, and the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> choices that keep the player characters alive. At first, the player can only play through the game as the character Cocoro Fuyukawa; after surviving a week as her, they also get to play as Satoru Yukidoh.

[...] Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development. Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda's greater goal of [...] "Reinvention", where the team's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> [...] "a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity". Howard spoke of the need to avoid repetition, to avoid merely adding [...] "some new features and content, and keep doing that", describing that path as [...] "a good way to drive your games into the ground."

500|$|Ten by Eight, stylized as 10×8, is {{a puzzle}} video game by Action Button Entertainment where players match tiles. It was {{released}} on July 31, 2013 in North America for PlayStation Mobile—the PlayStation Vita and compatible devices. International editions followed. Players align similarly colored blocks and trace the path they create when aligned. The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the longest path possible, and bonus points are awarded for paths that connect the screen's edges. Star blocks act as power-ups that extend combos, such that a chain of green tiles can link to a chain of red tiles using a star block. Points can be spent on new character unlocks, including some from Ziggurat, that have no gameplay function. Ten by Eight has three modes of play. In endless mode, rocks around the grid block possible paths and can only be cleared by making paths that envelop the rocks. The game ends if a rock fully crosses the grid. The zen mode has no rocks or time limit. The timed mode sets a several-minute restriction on gameplay and has no rocks. Rogers produced an [...] "infomercial-style trailer" [...] for the game, which VG247 called one of his signature moves and that IndieGames.com called [...] "glorious".|$|E

500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and {{has no interest in}} what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E
