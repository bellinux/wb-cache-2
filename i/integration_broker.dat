The Internet of things, digitization and globalization are pushing continuous {{growth in the}} integration market. However, setting up integration systems today is still largely a manual endeavor. Most probably, future integration will need to leverage more automation {{in order to keep}} up with demand. This paper presents a first version of a system that uses tools from artificial intelligence and machine learning to ease the integration of information systems, aiming to automate parts of it. Three models are presented and evaluated for precision and recall using data from real, past, integration projects. The results show {{that it is possible to}} obtain F 0. 5 scores in the order of 80 % for models trained on a particular kind of data, and in the order of 60 %- 70 % for less specific models trained on a several kinds of data. Such models would be valuable enablers for <b>integration</b> <b>brokers</b> to keep up with demand, and obtain a competitive advantage. Future work includes fusing the results from the different models, and enabling continuous learning from an operational production system...|$|R

40|$|Ontologies {{have become}} an {{important}} means for structuring information and information systems and, hence, important in knowledge {{as well as in}} software engineering. However, there remains the problem of engineering large and adequate ontologies within short time frames in order to keep costs low. For this purpose, we present the TEXT-TO-ONTO Ontology Learning Environment, which is based on a general architecture for discovering conceptual structures and engineering ontologies from text. Our Ontology Learning Environment supports as well the acquisition of conceptual structures as mapping linguistic resources to the acquired structures. 1 Introduction Ontologies 1 have shown their usefulness in application areas such as intelligent information <b>integration,</b> information <b>brokering</b> and natural-language processing, to name but a few. However, their wide-spread usage is still hindered by ontology engineering being rather time-consuming and, hence, expensive. Our system TEXT-TO-ONT [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Service {{oriented}} {{architecture is}} an architectural principle that positions IT services {{as the primary}} means through which business services are offered by the organization to its ecosystem. Therefore, SOA offers the prospect of better alignment of Academic and Administrative goals and Information Technology (IT) solutions in Education Organizations. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe SOA in detail with considering all the approaches, concepts and methodologies that surrounds architectural model of SOA. Service based application development, frameworks and other related requirements are discussed in this paper in order to have a complete and accurate figure of SOA and be competent in utilizing service orientation concepts in enterprise application development. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a method for publishing services hosted by computer systems for the use of other computer systems. This method can be used to integrate applications and is therefore called Service-Oriented Integration (SOI). Integration brokers are a traditional method of integrating different kind of systems by sending messages from one system to another. This paper gathers requirements for an <b>integration</b> <b>broker</b> in Service-Oriented Architecture and presents framework that can be used to build SOI architecture. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{the context}} of the {{explosive}} growth of the IT dispersion, the importance of enterprise integration has developed significantly. Enterprise integration takes a strategic and coordinated view of an organization’s integration needs. Enterprise integration is suited where an organization’s business requirements dictate the need for the real-time processing of complex business processes across different IT applications and parts of the enterprise. Enterprise integration solutions typically involve some form of <b>integration</b> <b>broker</b> that coordinates the flow of information from one IT application to another. Importantly, however, organizations should not underestimate the many technical and management challenges that need to be overcome in order to achieve enterprise integration success. Information technology has known a continuous expansion in terms of the sphere of applicability and use of the informational products, but also in the development of new business opportunities created by the transition to the digital economy. The enterprise integration can be defined as the strategic consideration of the process, methods, tools and technologies associated with achieving interoperability between IT applications both within and external to the enterprise to enable collaborative business processes. Importantly, enterprise integration is not purely about technology integration. Enterprise integration also includes a consideration of business processes that cut across various IT applications, and so provides the overarching basis for technology integration, taking into consideration the managerial and technical challenges that must be overcomes in order to achieve a full applications and processes integration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of the {{fundamental}} requirements for solutions {{to succeed in the}} business-to-business e-commerce domain is the ability to integrate seamlessly or inter-operate with diverse systems. In other words, the services offered by a business should be easily accessible by any consumer or business using the Internet infrastructure and standard protocols. A framework is needed by which new E-services can be created, or existing non-Internet services can be converted to E-services. Also, since these E-services are good candidates to be part of business workflows, a facility is needed to make them support and participate in such workflows. This paper describes BizBuilder, our E-services framework used to create these E-services. BizBuilder addresses the issue of transactions in particular and facilitates managing both synchronous and long-running E-services that can participate in workflows. Additionally, BizBuilder provides suitable support to register E-services to a Universal Description, Discovery and <b>Integration</b> (UDDI) enabled <b>brokering</b> community. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{creation}} of enterprise management information systems with the property of behavior. Behavior of information system is considered from the standpoint of its functions targeted expansion; the need for them arises from the variability of the external and internal environment. To create a system with behavior, integrated information systems are encouraged to be used constructed from highly specialized, low functional applications. Classification criteria of information systems with behavior are proposed by a set of functions, by options of control transfer to the application, by the integration level of information system components. Classification is revealed by integration levels of information system components. Within the classification four options for structural models of information systems are suggested. The first option is based on the <b>integration</b> of message <b>brokers</b> with achieving of automatic data transfer and the launch of the relevant applications. The second option is based on an integrated database that enables applications to operate in accordance with established regulations. The third version of the integration is carried out on the level of services and gives the possibility to build structures with preliminary uncertain configuration of intern applications for the actual problem solution. The fourth option is based on integration level of the interpretation of metadata for distributed database systems and applications that interact with these databases. The system behavior comes into existence in case of new application automatically exchanges input and output data with the other components of information system and has the possibility of flexible parameter setting of functions interaction...|$|R
40|$|Organisations {{are making}} {{increasing}} use of web applications and web-based systems {{as an integral part}} of providing services. Examples include personalised dynamic user content on a website, social media plug-ins or web-based mapping tools. For these types of applications to have maximum use for the user where the applications are fully functional, they require the integration of data from multiple sources. The focus of this thesis is in improving this integration process with a focus on web applications with multiple sources of data. Integration of data from multiple sources is problematic for many reasons. Current integration methods tend to be domain specific and application specific. They are often complex, have compatibility issues with different technologies, lack maturity, are difficult to re-use, and do not accommodate new and emerging models and integration technologies. Technologies to achieve <b>integration,</b> such as <b>brokers</b> and translators do exist, but they cannot be used as a generic solution for developing web-applications achieving the integration outcomes required for successful web application development due to their domain specificity. It is because of these difficulties with integration, and the wide variety of integration approaches that there is a need to provide assistance to the developer in selecting the integration approach most appropriate to their needs. This thesis proposes GIWeb, a unified top-down data integration methodology instantiated with a framework that will aid developers in their integration process. It will act as a conceptual structure to support the chosen technical approach. The framework will assist in the integration of data sources to support web application builders. The thesis presents the rationale for the need for the framework based on an examination of the range of applications, associated data sources and the range of potential solutions. The framework is evaluated using four case studies...|$|R
