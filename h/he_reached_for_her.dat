6000|$|... "So--help--me--God!" [...] he whispered, {{with blood}} thick in his voice. Then darkly, as one groping, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> with shaking hands. [...] "Y'u--y'u white-throated hussy!... I'll ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{night as}} she was passing his chair <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and caught her and drew her down upon his knee. [...] "Sit ye down a wink. Ye're always on the move like a flibberty-bidget." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> arm and at {{the same}} instant {{something}} clashed against the bars of one of the windows, crashing them inward to the floor, to be followed almost simultaneously by a human figure which dove headforemost into the room, its head enveloped in the skin window hangings which it carried with it in its impetuous entry.|$|E
50|$|While drunk, Captain Jonsen makes {{a sexual}} {{overture}} to Emily. She bites his hand before anything happens, {{but she is}} frightened by the look in Jonsen's eye as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> The author gives no explicit details <b>for</b> <b>her</b> fright, just a veiled description from Emily's point of view. Emily later suffers an injury to her leg, in an accident caused by Rachel, and is confined to the captain's cabin. Meanwhile, Margaret, who has become alienated from the other children, becomes Otto's concubine and moves into his cabin.|$|R
5000|$|An {{official}} music video, {{directed by}} Sanji, {{was released on}} in May 2008. The video is two parallel stories in which a protagonist (both represented by Morissette) tries to change the world. The first vignette follows Alanis as she attempts to hand out fliers promoting positivity and openness. She is rejected by passers by at each turn. Frustrated, she notices a missed call {{on her cell phone}} from an apparent ex-love interest. She angrily texts him, [...] "I said don't call me." [...] Inside her heart, another Alanis (dressed in red), replays scenes of being frustrated with the love interest, keeping her distance in bed and literally pushing him away when <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> swiftly <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but she eluded him. She {{laughed as}} she circled around the table. “Catch her!” Porportuk {{commanded}} the Indian with the rifle, who stood near to her. But as the Indian stretched forth {{his arm to}} her, the Eldorado king felled him with a fist blow under the ear. The rifle clattered to the ground. Then was Akoon’s chance. His eyes glittered, but he did nothing.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{when all}} was about in {{readiness}} {{for a fresh}} start, she rose to her feet. Kells's bay was not tractable at the moment. Bill held out Joan's bridle to her and their hands touched. The contact was an accident, but it resulted in Bill's grasping back at her hand. She jerked it away, scarcely comprehending. Then all under the brown of his face she saw creep a dark, ruddy tide. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> then--put {{his hand on her}} breast. It was an instinctive animal action. He meant nothing. She divined that he could not help it. She had lived with rough men long enough to know he had no motive--no thought at all. But at the profanation of such a touch she shrank back, uttering a cry.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{with hands}} like claws, {{as if he}} meant to tear her, rend her. Joan was helpless, weak, terrified. Those shaking, {{clutching}} hands reached for her throat and yet never closed round it. Kells wanted to kill her, but he could not. He loomed over her, dark, speechless, locked in his paroxysm of rage. Perhaps then came a realization of ruin through her. He hated her because he loved her. He wanted to kill her because of that hate, yet he could not harm her, even hurt her. And his soul seemed in conflict with two giants--the evil in him that was hate, and the love that was good. Suddenly he flung her aside. She stumbled over Pearce's body, almost falling, and staggered back to the wall. Kells had {{the center of the}} room to himself. Like a mad steer in a corral he gazed about, stupidly seeking some way to escape. But the escape Kells longed for was from himself. Then either he let himself go or was unable longer to control his rage. He began to plunge around. His actions were violent, random, half insane. He seemed to want to destroy himself and everything. But the weapons were guarded by his men and the room contained little he could smash. There was something magnificent in his fury, yet childish and absurd. Even under its influence and his abandonment he showed a consciousness of its futility. In a few moments the inside of the cabin was in disorder and Kells seemed a disheveled, sweating, panting wretch. The rapidity and violence of his action, coupled with his fury, soon exhausted him. He fell from plunging here and there to pacing the floor. And even the dignity of passion passed from him. He looked a hopeless, beaten, stricken man, conscious of defeat.|$|E
50|$|At the concert, {{she learned}} her crush is the vocalist while her rescuer is the guitarist. She found it odd when {{everyone}} in the crowd chanted for Ryuji, with courage she started chanting loudly for Hiro (thinking that was the name is of her crush which later {{it turns out to}} be the name of the guitarist.) As a dare, Ryuji urged Hiro to take Rina on a date. The crowd changed and Hiro jumped off the stage and carries Rina away to an undisclosed location. It appears that she passed out after all that drama. When she woke up she sees a different aspect of Hiro though they did not know each other that well, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Lucy, I told you," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "He {{forced her}} to marry him. They had Lucy's father in jail. Dick got him out. Oh, {{it was all a}} scheme to work on the poor girl. She thought it was to save her father.... Why, Dick paid her father. I made him tell me... yes, Dick Hardman in his frock coat and high hat! But when I drove him out to get his gun, he forgot that high hat." ...|$|R
60|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but {{she fled}} {{away from him}} to Mrs. Van Wyck, at whose feet she made frenzied appeal, and whose knees she tried to clasp. But the lady stepped back and gave {{permission}} with her eyes to Canim. He gripped Li Wan under the shoulders and raised her to her feet. She fought with him, in a madness of despair, till his chest was heaving with the exertion, and they had reeled about over half the room.|$|R
5000|$|Caer Ibormeith was the Celtic {{goddess of}} sleep and dreams.In Irish mythology, Caer Ibormeith was a {{daughter}} of Prince Ethal Anbuail of Sid Uamuin in Connacht. In Óengus’s dream, which lasted over a year, Caer Ibormeith stood beside his bed though when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> she would disappear. Every alternate Samhain she would turn to human form for one celtic day, which begins at sunset, and after that, she would revert back into being a swan, in which form she would remain for a year before becoming human again the following Samhain.|$|R

5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying <b>her</b> instead. When <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|R
5000|$|Tara begins {{staying with}} Jax at the clubhouse after {{shooting}} Kohn because being {{at her house}} makes her uncomfortable. When Jax and Tara are kissing at the hospital, Wendy sees them and later confronts Tara. The next day, Jax goes with Clay, Tig and Opie to make an arms deal with the Mayans in Oakland. The One-Niners attack the deal, however, and they escape while the Mayans and Niners fight. Clay and Tig had {{made a deal with}} the Niners, but didn't inform Jax or the others; the Niners were supposed to eliminate the Mayans after the SOA left, but they decide to take them out also. Later that night, Abel is released from the hospital and a party is held in celebration. Tara again kisses Jax at the party, purposely in plain view for Wendy to see. Jax then pulls Tara aside, and asks her not to flaunt their relationship in front of a newly recovered Wendy, and [...] "to be cool with whatever this is." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and she seems to draw back in a way that indicates a PTSD reaction resulting in her slapping his face. Tara storms out. When Opie leaves the party, he takes his wife's car to take his children home in, and his wife takes his pick-up truck. Tig thinks Opie is driving the truck and shoots Donna.|$|R
5000|$|Back in the Manor's parlor, they unmask the Mastermind. Shaggy {{initially}} {{believes that}} it's the mysterious groundskeeper but he then appears and rants about how 'it's always the spooky groundskeeper'. The gang then {{discover that the}} Mastermind {{is in fact the}} Professor himself. Velma, confused, says that the clues do not add up. [...] "If you ask me, someone's playing a nasty trick - a trick of the light!" [...] she announces. She holds her glasses up to a mirror to reveal Holly working the controls of a machine behind a wall. Shaggy is puzzled, as Holly is standing right next to him. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but when his arm goes through her, the gang realizes that Holly is a hologram - the real Holly was the Mastermind all along. Holly was in the Mastermind costume the entire time- she used one of the Professor's inventions {{to get back to the}} Mansion from the Secret Lab and put the Professor into the costume. Because Daphne kept Holly [...] "up to date on all of their cases," [...] it was fairly simple to recreate all of their old foes. Holly admits that she wanted Mystery Inc. to come, arrest her uncle as the Mastermind, and leave so she could take the credit for his hologram machine and become rich. Scooby and the gang successfully close another case while Shaggy goes to a table full of food only to find out that it is a hologram controlled by Scooby.|$|R
50|$|At breakfast, Claire, the narrator, {{is shocked}} to learn her husband Stuart and his three buddies found {{the body of a}} girl washed up on the rivershore upon {{arriving}} in the afternoon for their yearly camping trip, as reported by the morning newspaper. Instead of reporting the body to the police right away, the four enjoy their vacation fishing, eating, and drinking whisky as they sit by the fire. As the quartet packs up the next morning, Stuart uses a payphone to call the body into the police. Claire feels distanced from her husband and cannot stop wondering about the dead girl, whom she feels connected to. She believes Stuart and his friends could have killed her perhaps.

On her way to the funeral, a man in a pickup truck pulls her over and asks to talk to her, wants to make sure she's safe.

5000|$|This is {{the final}} part of the series, and Kaitlyn, Lewis, Rob and Anna are {{trying to create a}} plan to defeat Mr Zetes. Gabriel has joined Mr. Zetes, and he finds the other four psychics one night with Tony, at Marisol's house. Gabriel tries to attack Kaitlyn and the others to get the shard of the last perfect crystal they are hiding, as he knows it will destroy Mr Zetes and his {{personal}} rise to power. However Gabriel holds back because of his feelings for Kaitlyn, and leaves without the shard. Kaitlyn then leaves the others without telling them, as she believes she can independently infiltrate the Institute by using Gabriel's feelings <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She finds Gabriel after he rescues her from a man attacking her, and she lies to him by telling him that she left everything for him and that she wants to be on his side; the 'winning side'. Gabriel brings her to the Institute, and she is settled in with the previous psychics from project [...] "Black Lightning", to create a psychic strike team. These phsychics are Sabrina Jessica Gallo (Bri), Laurie Frost (Frost), Paul Renfrew (Renny) and John MacCorkendale (Jackal Mac), all of which are mentally twisted and psychic vampires because of the crystal. Kaitlyn tries to convince them all that she is on their side, whilst gathering information on them and trying to find the location of Mr Zetes crystal. Gabriel becomes suspicious of Kait when she refuses to share her energy with him, and he believes she is a spy and threatens to kill her if she gets in his way of his rise to power, after which he shuns <b>her</b> <b>for</b> Frost and regards her coldly. Kaitlyn passes the Institute's test by committing a felony of $20 million with the psychic strike team, which leads them to trust <b>her,</b> except <b>for</b> Gabriel who is waiting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to get caught out as a spy. Kaitlyn is eventually caught by Mr Zetes when she cracks the code for the location of the crystal, and he puts her in an isolation tank, where he hopes she will be driven to insanity. Gabriel becomes worried about Kaitlyn when he can no longer feel her presence in the psychic link and <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> out <b>for</b> <b>her</b> with his telepathy. He helps her preserve her mind by showing her memories and communicating with her, and they both confess their true depths of feelings for each other. When Mr Zetes takes Kaitlyn out the isolation tank, he realises his plan has not worked and he takes Kaitlyn to the crystal to destroy her mind. Rob, Anna, Lewis and Tamsin from the fellowship of the crystal, turn up to rescue them, and they succeed in destroying the crystal and Mr Zetes when Gabriel unites the shard with the evil crystal. When the crystal is shattered, Joyce's mind and the other psychic's minds are returned to them, and they realise the mistakes they made in joining Mr Zetes. After that, Kaitlyn realises her affections have shifted from Rob to Gabriel and she is torn between the two, but when Rob is healing Gabriel's injuries from the crystal, he finds cuts and burns on Gabriel's arm and he realises that he had been hurting himself to stay in contact with Kait when she was in isolation. He asks Gabriel if he loves Kaitlyn and he admits he does, so Rob lets go of Kaitlyn and gives her and Gabriel his blessings to be together, and Kait telepathically gives Anna blessings to be with Rob as she knows they are meant to be together. The story ends with Frost and Jackal Mac running away, while Bri, Renny and Joyce decide to go with Tamsin to the Fellowship of the People of the Crystal. Rob, Anna and Lewis also decide to go to the People of the Crystal, as they believe they can help there and Rob feels it's his destiny to heal there, and Marisol returns after being healed by the shard of the crystal. The final scene is of Lewis taking a photograph of everyone linked together ...|$|R
