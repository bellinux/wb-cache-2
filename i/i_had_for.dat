500|$|I was {{listening}} to the radio and heard 'Genius of Love', and I hadn't heard it in a long time. It reminded me of growing up and listening to the radio and that feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Fantasy." [...] I initially told Dave about the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were really into it.|$|E
500|$|After Speaker's death, Cobb said, [...] "Terribly depressed. I {{never let}} him know how much I admired him when we were playing against each other... It was only after we finally became {{teammates}} and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker of the underlying respect <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> him." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, [...] "He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and know how to play the hitters." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, [...] "It {{was a unique}} feeling that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> [...] I {{would have done anything}} for him." [...] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how [...] "blindingly" [...] in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs. Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she [...] "knew right away that I found him irresistible." [...] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.|$|E

After trading a series of emails, he {{received}} Yorke's vocals by email. The track was titled before Yorke had written lyrics. He had decided to keep the original title, which Ellison appreciated, saying: [...] "He also kept the same name <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> it, which really {{meant a lot to}} me. All of the song titles mean something, and that one does for sure." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{three months}} since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, {{in which a}} letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by {{one or two of}} them taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I never be. The other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>for</b> that, as I have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my own {{discretion}} (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that approves his art.|$|E
2500|$|Okereke is {{extremely}} shy. He has expressed disdain for interviews, asking one interviewer from Skyscraper magazine, [...] "Why {{is it important}} to know what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> breakfast? Or who I went to bed with? Or what sneakers I am wearing? If it's relevant to understanding my music, then so be it. But if it's purely to satisfy the media's obsession with celebrity, then no thanks. I don't want to play that game." [...] The focus of one interview with NME in July 2005 was largely {{to do with his}} dislike of being interviewed. In it he implied that the media placed deliberate emphasis on conflicts between bands {{and did not want to}} be drawn into such publicity, saying that [...] "public feuding between bands is completely pointless." [...] Okereke has also said, [...] "people think that I hate being approached but that's not true" [...] in NME on 15 September 2005. In 2005 Okereke appeared on the front cover of Australian queer zine They Shoot Homos Don't They? ...|$|E

2500|$|Theile {{arrived in}} Rome as an outsider, despite being the {{defending}} champion as he had not regained his form of four years prior, with Robert Bennett and Frank McKinney of the United States posting faster times. This {{appeared to be the}} case in the heats, with Theile posting the third fastest time behind the American duo. In the semifinals, Bennett was unable to repeat his earlier performance and Theile won, while McKinney won the other semifinal, also in a time slower than Theile. Theile was confident approaching the final, recounting [...] "I had great faith in myself and my abilities. I had a short, sharp peak, which meant that I had to save everything for that burst and then exert everything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> precisely that moment." [...] Theile attacked at the outset in the final, as was his style, and held a slender lead at the 50-metre mark over McKinney and Bennett. Theile made a good turn, lengthening his lead to half a body length, before holding off a late surge to claim consecutive gold medals, defeating McKinney by just 0.2 s, setting a new Olympic record in the event. For the first time, the 4×100-metre medley relay was contested at the Olympics, and combining with Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton, the Australians finished well behind the Americans to win the silver medal.|$|E
2500|$|Maugham's father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was {{a lawyer}} who handled the legal affairs of the British embassy in Paris. Since French law {{declared}} that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, technically on British soil. His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in Chapter 6 his literary memoir, The Summing Up: [...] "...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum {{there is a long}} list of his legal works. [...] He wrote only one book that was not of this character. [...] It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I {{have not been able to}} get hold of a copy since. [...] I wish <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>for</b> I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was." [...] His family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, Viscount Maugham, enjoyed a distinguished legal career and served as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939.|$|E
