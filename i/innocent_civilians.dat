5|$|About 25 {{people were}} arrested {{in the first few}} days, {{including}} 196 workers; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks. Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led to the death of <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians.</b> The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
5|$|The team {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} the playing experience and difficulty of the extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered {{the difficulty of the}} first game {{to be part of the}} franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians</b> but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November, a {{batch of}} three {{companies}} was deployed to the Badgam area on patrol duties. Their objective was to check the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, {{two of the three}} deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00pm. At 2:35pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but counter-fire was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians.</b> Suddenly, a tribal lashkar (English: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of Gulmarg. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to the enemy fire as he ran from one post to the other.|$|E
5|$|Soviet rule of Estonia was re-established by force, and sovietisation followed, {{which was}} mostly {{carried out in}} 1944–1950. The forced {{collectivisation}} of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949. All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. An armed resistance movement of 'forest brothers' was active until the mass deportations. A total of 30,000 participated or supported the movement; 2,000 were killed. The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths. Among those killed on both sides were <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians.</b> Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953; from 1956–58, {{a large part of}} the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia. Political arrests and numerous other crimes against humanity were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s. After all, the attempt to integrate Estonian society into the Soviet system failed. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s, regain their independence in 1991, and then rapidly develop a modern society.|$|E

25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians</b> by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Whoever that commits such barbaric acts of terror {{in the name of}} liberation struggle should not be tolerated. The killing of <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians</b> and destroying their properties couldn't be justified by any standard. I am of the view that a democratic unity on the basis of justice and equality would be of much benefit to the people of Oromia.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of defining terrorism {{and all are}} subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians</b> being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems {{with the use of}} the term persist.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Punjab deteriorated into anarchy with {{a rise in}} government correuption and police brutality. By the early 1990s, {{after many years of}} violence across Punjab, the activists' struggle for Khalistan had lost much of the sympathy given after the assault on the Golden Temple due to mass Indian media propagating nationalism against the cause, and what little armed resistance remained was eliminated and forced underground. In the following years there was concern over the apparent human rights abuses conducted by the central and state government against Sikhs, many of them <b>innocent</b> <b>civilians,</b> and many human rights organisations were not allowed in the Punjab at the time, and some are not even allowed there to this day.|$|E

After the war, the Singapore government erected several memorials with some at the former massacre sites.
