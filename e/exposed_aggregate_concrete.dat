When a bypass for motorway E 4 in Uppsala (Sweden) was built, cement concrete was therefore selected as the wearing course. It {{is well known that}} noise characteristics of cement concrete surfaces may be poor unless a suitable texture is created. Earlier, the Swedish Road Administration has used the <b>exposed</b> <b>aggregate</b> technique to create a favourable surface texture on newly laid cement concrete on some motorways in Sweden, with both good and poor results. This time a special aggregate grading of the top layer was selected, attempting to combine the desire to have excellent durability against the wear of studded tyres in winter, and the desire to limit tyre/road noise emission from the motorway. Being a bypass, this motorway at some locations run rather near to suburban areas where noise immission might become a serious issue. Noise measurements were made with the CPX method, using four test tyres. The results on the <b>exposed</b> <b>aggregate</b> cement <b>concrete</b> (EACC) were compared with similar measurements on SMA surfaces with the same maximum aggregate size. As a reference for comparison three SMA 0 / 16 were chosen since this is the surface type that would normally be used on a motorway of this kind. The results indicated approx. 2 - 3 dB(A) lower tyre/road noise emission on the EACC than on the SMA 0 / 16 which was better than expected. In the paper the probable causes of the relatively low noise emission are analyzed. The positive results suggest that with a suitable proportioning of the aggregate in the surface layer and high quality exposure technique, the EACC may be used as a standard technique for texturing of cement concrete...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Germany, diamond {{grinding}} {{is frequently}} {{used to improve}} the evenness and skid resistance of concrete pavement surfaces. Since diamond grinding has been observed to affect tyre/pavement noise emission favourably, the relationship among surface texture, concrete composition and noise emission of concrete pavement surfaces has been systematically investigated. The simulation program SPERoN was used in a parameter study to investigate the main factors which affect noise emission. Based {{on the results of}} the simulations, textured concrete surfaces were produced by using a laboratory grinding machine. As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied. The ability of the textured surfaces to reduce noise emission was assessed from the texture characteristics and air flow resistance of textured surfaces measured in the laboratory. It was found that concrete composition and, in particular, the spacing of the blades affected the reduction in noise emission considerably. The noise emission behaviour of numerous road sections was also considered in field investigations. The pavement surfaces had been textured by diamond grinding during the last years or decades. The results show that diamond grinding is able to provide good, durable noise-reducing properties. Several new pavement sections were investigated using thicknesses and spacings of the blades similar to those used in the laboratory to optimize noise emission reduction. It is concluded that diamond grinding is a good alternative to <b>exposed</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>concrete</b> for the production of low-noise pavement surfaces...|$|E
