40|$|Composition of {{the diet}} of <b>greater</b> <b>lizardfish</b> Saurida tumbil (Bloch, 1795), caught from {{northern}} Kerala, south-west coast of India was studied and described. The stomachs of 1981 specimens were collected between January, 2012 and June, 2014. Analysis of stomach contents based on index of relative importance (IRI) revealed that this species is exclusively piscivorous. Contrary to other benthic predators of the study area, it mainly feeds on pelagic and demersal fishes (IRI = 63. 2), molluscs (IRI = 17. 86), crustaceans (IRI = 18. 33) and other miscellaneous items (IRI = 2. 54). The diet of S. tumbil {{were found to be}} related to the seasonal availability of resources, occurrence of juveniles of certain species and on the migration of fishes from nearby places to the study area. Significant changes in prey items were observed between predator length groups, but a positive, significant relationship was recorded between prey size and predator size (p< 0. 05). Statistical analysis indicated a uniform representation of different diets in the stomach. Maximum similarity in diet between different food items was found in April and November...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anisakid {{nematodes}} {{are common}} parasites of fish, mammals, fish-eating birds, and reptiles with a worldwide distribution, causing diseases in human, fish and important economic losses. Methods: A preliminary epidemiological study {{was carried out}} on Anisakid nematodes larvae in some commercially important fish species to evaluate the anisakid nematode larvae from <b>greater</b> <b>lizardfish,</b> (Saurida tumbil), Japanese thread fin bream (Nemipterus japonicus), crocodile longtom (Tylosurus crocodilus crocodiles) and longfin trevally (Carangoides armatus) from the Persian Gulf of Iran. Result: The collected larvae were identified mainly as the third larval stage (L 3) of Hysterothylacium larval type A, B and C, Anisakis sp., Raphidascaris sp., Pseudoterranova sp. and Philometra sp. (Nematoda: Philometridae). The prevalence of Anisakid larvae infection of examined fishes was 97. 2 % in N. japonicus, 90. 3 % in S. tumbil, 20. 5 % in crocodile longtom and 5. 5 % in longfin trevally. Anisakis type III {{for the first time}} was different from Anisakis type I and Anisakis type II. Discussion: Zoonotic anisakids by high prevalence in edible fish could be a health hazard for people. So health practices should be considered in these areas...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>lizardfish</b> {{is one of}} the {{commercial}} demersal fishes in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. In this study the food preference index (FPI), Fullness index (FI) and stomach contents of Saurida tumbil were evaluated to assess the quantity and kind of food which this species consumes in the study area. The samples were collected monthly from commercial bottom trawl fisheries in main fishing grounds of eastern Strait of Hormuz. A total of 346 specimens were collected during years 2009 - 2010 of which 269 specimens were female and 77 specimens were male. The minimum and maximum total length were 161 and 590 mm, respectively with the highest frequency in length group of 350 - 370 mm. Results showed that 20. 9 % of stomachs were full, 18. 9 % were semi-full and 60. 2 % were empty. The main stomach contents (FPI= 80. 2 %) were fishes and minor stomach contents (FPI= 25. 7 %) were crustacean (Specially crab and shrimp) and cephalopods were found as random food. The minimum and maximum FIs were 2. 5 and 42. 5 in December and September respectively; and the overall CV was 60. 2. The results indicate that this fish is a relatively frugal species which consumes fishes as main food and there is no difference in feeding of male and female...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} 2001 - 2004 four bottom trawl surveys {{were carried out}} in the Gulf of Tonkin to {{investigate}} the aquatic stocks in the Vietnamese sector (67, 370 km 2). The Gulf has tropical characteristics and great diversity of commercial species, but lately fishing pressure seems to have grown excessively. The swept-area cruises followed a stratified random design, with a fixed station grid imposed on four depth intervals between 0 and 100 m, and internationally accepted survey protocols. Three commercially important indicator species which differ in life-history and habit were selected for appraisal using commonly accepted single-species metrics. The methodology for data treatment included spatial statistics (kriging) to describe seasonal trends in distribution, and non-parametric re-sampling (bootstrapping) of station data combined with maximum likelihood analysis of maturation curves to estimate both total and spawning standing biomass. Chinese squid (Loligo chinensis Gray 1849), a small pelagic resource with very high turnover rate, showed a marked decline in standing biomass, from 16, 000 tones in 2001 to 3, 000 tones in 2004 (CV 27 - 14 %). Remarkably, spawning biomass remained at stable 1, 000 tones, and large squid (13 cm ML and above) dominate the population. The <b>Greater</b> <b>lizardfish</b> (Saurida tumbil (Bloch, 1795)), a very valuable, and slow growing, demersal species, showed stable levels of total biomass, at around 3, 000 to 5, 000 tones (CV 13 - 25 %). However, spawning biomass showed a marked 22 % decline to 732 tones in 2004, despite a decrease in the maturation size, which might be a compensatory mechanism. Simultaneously, most of the stock was comprised of fish in the 11 - 24 cm range, and this is a marked constriction from the original 5 - 35 cm range. The Largehead hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus Linaeus, 1785), a large pelagic, has become the major commercial pelagic species in the South China Sea. In the Gulf the total biomass declined from 3, 600 to 2, 600 tones (CV 24 - 29 %), but a highly unreliable estimate (CV 50 %) raises it to 15000 tones in 2004. The estimates of spawning biomass showed equal development, varying from 2, 500 tones in 2001 to 1, 500 tones in 2003, and raising to 4, 000 tones in 2004. Largehead hairtail also shows a marked constriction of sizes in 2004, and the largest sizes are now about 1 / 3 of Lâˆž. Although the squid showed a permanent coastal affinity (20 - 30 m deep) and is exposed to the extremely large and un-controlled coastal fleet year round, it seems to have the best potential for recovery. The Largehead hairtail and the <b>Greater</b> <b>lizardfish</b> showed coastal affinity during the NE monsoon but moved to offshore grounds in the SW monsoon. Management of these transboundary populations is not sole responsibility of Vietnam and requires co-ordination with China in the South China Sea...|$|E
