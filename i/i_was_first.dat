5|$|Auschwitz <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{constructed}} to hold Polish political prisoners, {{who began to}} arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941, and Auschwitz II–Birkenau {{went on to become}} a major site of the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp's gas chambers from all over German-occupied Europe, where they were killed en masse with the pesticide Zyklon B. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1million died. Around 90 percent of those killed were Jewish; approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp. Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 Poles, 23,000 Romani and Sinti, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, and tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of homosexuals. Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and medical experiments.|$|E

In September of that year, {{it was confirmed that}} the game had been delayed into February the following year. The game was released in Japan on February 28, 2002. In an interview, Takahashi confirmed that Western localization would begin following the game's Japanese release. The game was localized for the West by Interone Inc, with English dubbing handled by ZRO Limit Productions and Animaze. The localization process took over a year. While all blood, gore, religious references and bad language were retained in the Western release, one scene between the adult Albedo and the childlike MOMO had its more erotic elements toned down for the Western release. The game released in North America on February 25, 2003. This version, with the English voice work and additional costumes and bonus features, was later released in Japan under the title Xenosaga Episode I Reloaded on November 20, 2003.|$|E

The low-pressure air output from the compressor was ducted {{to each of the}} three rotor blades to the ends of each blade. At the tip of each blade was a combustion chamber where the air was mixed with fuel and ignited. The Ariel had a short tail boom with twin vertical tail surfaces.

STARS I consisted of a Polaris two-stage rocket with a solid-fueled Orbis I stage added to serve as a third stage. STARS II added a fourth stage, called the Operations and Deployment Experiments Simulator (ODES). STARS <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> launched in 1993, and from 2004 onwards has served as the standard booster for trials of the Ground-Based Interceptor. STARS II was only used in two suborbital launches, in 1994 and 1996.|$|E

25|$|A war {{memorial}} {{dedicated to}} the citizens of Derry, Northern Ireland who lost their lives in World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> considered by public leaders in 1919. After several years of efforts at obtaining the necessary funding, the design and location of the monument were approved by the local war memorial committee in April 1925. Vernon March won the commission to build the memorial that he and his brother Sydney March had designed. The Diamond War Memorial is of bronze and Portland stone. In the center, a winged Victory holds aloft a laurel wreath. The tall column on which she stands has the names of the fallen on four sides. At the base of the monument there are two bronze figures on shorter columns, a soldier on one side who represents the Army and a sailor on the other who represents the Navy. The cenotaph is located on The Diamond {{in the center of the}} walled city of Derry. It was unveiled on 23 June 1927.|$|E

500|$|The {{tribe of}} the Polans (Polanie, lit.

Accelerated rebuilding of old tribal fortified settlements, construction of massive new ones and territorial expansion took place during the period ca. 920–950. [...] The Polish state developed from these tribal roots in the second half of the century. According to the 12th-century chronicler Gallus Anonymus, the Polans were ruled at this time by the Piast dynasty. [...] In existing sources from the 10th century, Piast ruler Mieszko <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> mentioned by Widukind of Corvey in his Res gestae saxonicae, a chronicle of events in Germany. [...] Widukind reported that Mieszko's forces were twice defeated in 963 by the Veleti tribes acting in cooperation with the Saxon exile Wichmann the Younger. Under Mieszko's rule (ca. 960 to 992), his tribal state accepted Christianity and became the Polish state.|$|E

2500|$|The Skycar <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The character's first return storyline {{concentrated}} on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). [...] "Clare's a chancer," [...] explains Bissix, [...] "She sees Ian as a route to easy money!" [...] The Sun newspaper reported that [...] "Ian is mesmerised" [...] by Clare's attempts to lure {{him away from}} his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Commenting on the storyline, Bissix said [...] "Clare knows Ian is married! But that makes it more of a challenge." [...] Eventually Clare's true motive was unearthed. After Ian nearly relented to her attempts at seduction, she proceeded to blackmail him. An EastEnders insider said: [...] "Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since {{she returned to the}} Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage just by being alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly old fool than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet." [...] However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to [...] "Stay away from Ian!". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: [...] "Poor Adam. He spent a day staring at my chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was around all the time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> here and we'd done scenes together. Now, instead of this snotty-nosed little girl making Nigel's tea, she was trying to seduce him and get him in his Y-fronts." ...|$|E
