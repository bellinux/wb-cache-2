50|$|KMC Controls {{started with}} {{manufacturing}} pneumatic <b>HVAC</b> <b>control</b> products, including controllers, actuators, valves, {{and other related}} devices. A pneumatic <b>HVAC</b> <b>control</b> circuit operates on air pressure (typically between 3 and 13 psi) and uses mechanical means (actuators) to perform control functions. Pneumatic control systems are still used in many buildings, especially in metropolitan areas, because of their large base of installation throughout the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
