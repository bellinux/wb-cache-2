5|$|International {{regulations}} for the maritime industry are promulgated by {{agencies of the}} United Nations, particularly the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organization</b> and International Labour Organization. Flag states adopt these {{regulations for}} their ships by ratifying individual treaties. One common criticism against flag of convenience countries is that they allow shipowners to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organization,</b> based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce the {{environmental}} impact caused by merchant ships, the <b>International</b> <b>Maritimes</b> <b>Organization</b> is imposing new and stricter regulations on NOx and SOx emissions. Therefore, ships propelled by Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) burning HFO must adopt abatement devices or switch to a cleaner fuel such as MGO. If the use of MGO is considered, a further and more drastic modification of the power system can be analyzed, namely the use of Gas Turbines (GTs) in place of ICEs. GTs are an attractive solution thanks to a reduced weight, size and NOx emissions, but are penalized by a lower electric efficiency. The case of a real cruise ship is considered in the present paper and a detailed quantification of the above mentioned differences is provided by simulating the ship operation for a reference trip...|$|R

To provide a comprehensive outlook on piracy, Part I of this Article describes the history of piracy and its reappearance in the modern world. Part II briefly describes the resurgence of modern-day piracy, first in Southeast Asia and then in Somalia. Part III provides the current international legal framework for battling piracy, by focusing first on the definition of piracy in international law, and then on the existing international legal authority to apprehend and prosecute pirates. Part IV describes the existing options and solutions for fighting pirates, including domestic prosecutions, prosecutions in ad hoc tribuals, regional partnerships, and the aid of <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>organizations.</b> Part V advocates the need to fight piracy more aggressively, explaining the similarity between pirates and terorists. Finally, Part V also advocates the need to rebuild Somalia and its institutions, as this is the only permanent solution to eradicate piracy in this region of the world...|$|R

25|$|JRCC SN is {{organized}} as government agency {{subordinate to the}} Ministry of Justice and Public Security, and is based in Sola. Its search and rescue region of responsibility, defined by the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organization</b> and International Civil Aviation Organization, covers Southern Norway—specified as following the 65th parallel north in the Norwegian Sea and the border between Nord-Trøndelag and Nordland on land. To the north lies {{the responsibility of the}} Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway, based in Bodø. The JRCC SN's geographic borders towards neighboring countries roughly corresponds to that of Norway's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and flight information region. It reaches as far south as the 57th parallel north and as far west as the prime meridian. It has international borders to the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden and covers parts of the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea and Skagerrak. The borders do not necessarily follow the EEZ, so the British oil field Brent falls within Norwegian responsibility and the Norwegian Ekofisk falls within British. There are twenty-one rescue sub-center subordinate JCRR SN—one in each police district.|$|E

To the south lies {{the responsibility of the}} Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway, based in Sola. The JRCC NN's geographic borders towards neighboring countries roughly corresponds to that of Norway's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and flight information region, with exceptions. To the west the border follows the prime meridian and extends as far north as the North Pole. To the east the border runs along the 30th meridian east, although it extend further east for the areas of western Finnmark and its territorial waters which extend east of the meridian. Its extreme eastern point is at 31 degrees 43 minutes east, off the coast of Varangerhalvøya. Thus Svalbard falls within the limits, while Jan Mayen falls outside. The zone covers parts of the Norwegian Sea, the Barents Sea, the Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean. There are seven rescue sub-center subordinate JCRR NN—one in each police district as well as one for Svalbard coordinated by the Governor of Svalbard.|$|E
