5|$|Several early groups, now extinct, {{branched}} {{off from}} neopterygian ancestors before the teleosts appeared. These include the Pachycormiformes and Aspidorhynchiformes of the Mesozoic era. These <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> elongated bodies; some were filter-feeders, while others ate larger prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E
5|$|Research by Jennifer A. Clack and {{her colleagues}} showed that the very {{earliest}} tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This {{is in contrast to}} the earlier view that <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> first invaded the land — either in search of prey (like modern mudskippers) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out — and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> {{two pairs}} of tentacles around the mouth. The dorsal, {{pectoral}} and pelvic scales are small. The sub-adult <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a silver colour. The adults are olive-grey with a golden-brown tint on the scales.|$|R
50|$|This {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> {{dark brown}} triangular saddle-shaped markings along its side, slanted {{at the front}} end of the body and almost vertical toward the tail. The middle saddles are paler in color. Larger <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> paired saddle markings.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{success with}} Britain was {{undermined}} by {{his attempt to}} annex the Dominican Republic, an independent nation unable to pay its debt. Many Americans believed a Caribbean naval base would establish naval dominance and be useful in protecting shipping from piracy in a potential isthmian canal. Anti-imperialist Republicans had previously rejected a Johnson administration treaty to establish a Samaná Bay naval base. Grant took interest in Dominican annexation and sent his secretary, Orville E. Babcock, there to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president. Babcock returned in September 1869 with a draft treaty of annexation, although <b>Fish</b> <b>had</b> not given him any diplomatic authority. Given such authority by Fish, Babcock visited the island nation a second time making a treaty for Dominican annexation and the lease of Samaná Bay. The cabinet discussed the treaties at a meeting on December 21. Fish dismissed annexation, seeing the island as politically unstable. Grant supported it, believing acquisition of the majority-black nation would increase commerce, create a refuge for African Americans, and help to exploit the island's natural resources. He lobbied Sumner in hopes of influencing him to help with passage of the treaties. Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to Grant, but to no avail; Sumner was set against annexation and on June 30, 1870, the Senate rejected the treaties. A congressional investigation headed by Senator Carl Schurz revealed speculators had promoted the treaties' passage. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grant convinced Congress to send a commission to investigate. Although the commission approved Grant's call for annexation in its findings, the Senate remained opposed and Grant was forced to abandon further efforts. Grant retaliated by firing Sumner's friend and Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, while he pressured the Senate to depose Sumner of his chairmanship.|$|E
50|$|These <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> short dorsal fins. The caudal fins {{are deeply}} forked. The eyes are large. Their bodies are scaleless, though rough, bony plates {{are located on}} the tops of their heads. These <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> four pairs of barbels.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> <b>fish</b> {{bones in}} this sense; for instance, eels and {{anglerfish}} do not.|$|R
50|$|While most <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> caudal fins with evenly sized lobes (i.e. homocaudal), flying <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> an {{enlarged}} ventral lobe (i.e. hypocaudal) which facilitates dipping {{only a portion}} of the tail back onto the water for additional thrust production and steering.|$|R

25|$|The later radiations, such {{as those}} of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods, {{involved}} fewer taxa, mainly with very similar body plans.

25|$|A {{great deal}} of effort was spent on Jie’s cuisine and his requirements. Vegetables had {{to come from the}} northwest, <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> to be from the East Sea, {{seasonings}} and sauces had to come from ginger that grew in the south, sea salt had to come from the north. Several hundred people were employed just to supply Jie with his meals. Anyone that got his meal wrong was beheaded.|$|E
50|$|These <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> greatly elongate, slender bodies. These <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> {{three pairs}} of barbels, all similar in length and general appearance. The mouth is ventral. Typhlobelus has a long duck-billed rostrum that {{protrudes}} anteriorly well beyond the bases of the maxillary barbels.|$|R
50|$|All basal {{vertebrates}} breathe with gills. The gills {{are carried}} {{right behind the}} head, bordering the posterior margins {{of a series of}} openings from the esophagus to the exterior. Each gill is supported by a cartilagenous or bony gill arch. Bony <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> three pairs of arches, cartilaginous <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> five to seven pairs, and primitive jawless <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> seven. The vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches, as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a {{long and}} slender body. It also has eight dorsal fin-rays, {{anywhere}} from nine to eleven anal fin-rays, thirteen to fourteen pectoral fin-rays and eight pelvic fin-rays. The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a dark spot of pigment {{at the base of}} its first few dorsal-fins, which distinguishes Lythrurus ardens from similar looking fish in its habitat. In addition, the <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a stripe that fades as it approaches the dorsa fin and several bands of coloration across the back of the fish.|$|R

25|$|Fish {{are very}} diverse animals {{and can be}} {{categorised}} in many ways. This article is an overview of some {{of ways in which}} fish are categorised. Although most fish species have probably been discovered and described, about 250 new ones are still discovered every year. According to FishBase, 33,100 species of <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> been described by April 2015. That is more than the combined total of all other vertebrate species: mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|E
25|$|Isis and {{her sister}} Nephthys went looking for these pieces, but could only find {{thirteen}} of the fourteen. <b>Fish</b> <b>had</b> swallowed the last piece, his phallus. With Thoth's help she created a golden phallus, and attached it to Osiris’s body. She then transformed into a kite, and {{with the aid of}} Thoth’s magic conceived Horus the Younger. The number of pieces is described on temple walls variously as fourteen and sixteen, one for each nome or district.|$|E

5000|$|In Louisiana, the <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> slowly {{taken over}} the waters of New Orleans. The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a high {{salinity}} tolerance (up to 8ppt), but {{it is likely that}} this is caused by the interbreeding of this fish and the Herichthys Carpintis, which makes it an ideal invader for the brackish conditions of southern Louisiana. [...] It is believed that this <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> entered into the New Orleans area through multiple aquarium releases in central Jefferson Parish in 1989. Since the <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a short mating cycle, it did not take long for the fish to make its way through the canal system and into Lake Pontchartrain. [...] Pump stations and Lake Pontchartrain aided to the spreading of the fish into other canals.|$|R

25|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} fishery by value is American lobster and Atlantic sea scallop. The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, {{there are nearly}} 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this species of <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, blue crabs, and clam fisheries. These fisheries are pretty much fully exploited.|$|E
25|$|Anna Karoline {{served as}} a cargo vessel and the cargo changed {{depending}} on what owners she had, {{time of the year}} and where she was stationed. When Ole Vandsvik was one of the owners Anna Karoline started the new year with a voyage to Lofoten to buy fish. The fish was salted on board the vessel and she returned in May to Kiran in Roan where the fish was dried. While the fish was drying the jekt was transporting timber from Namsen to Northern Norway. When the <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> dried the vessel was loaded with stockfish, and sailed to Bergen. The vessel was also used for transporting herring and as sleeping quarters during fishing.|$|E
25|$|It {{was about}} this time that Fish began to indulge in self-harm. He would embed needles into his groin and abdomen. After his arrest, X-rays {{revealed}} that <b>Fish</b> <b>had</b> at least 29 needles lodged in his pelvic region. He also hit himself repeatedly with a nail-studded paddle and inserted wool doused with lighter fluid into his anus and set it alight. While he was never thought to have physically attacked or abused his children, he did encourage them and their friends to paddle his buttocks with the same nail-studded paddle he used to abuse himself. He soon developed a growing obsession with cannibalism, often preparing himself a dinner consisting solely of raw meat and sometimes serving it to his children.|$|E

He played his first rubber at Fribourg against John Isner after Mardy <b>Fish</b> <b>had</b> beaten his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka in the first rubber. After taking the first set, Federer struggled to capitalize on break points and lost the next three sets to Isner, giving the Americans a 2–0 advantage. He next played with Wawrinka in the doubles rubber against top doubles player Mike Bryan and Fish. Federer and Wawrinka won a tight first set, but were run over by Bryan and Fish {{in the next three}} sets, losing the rubber and the match-up. The Americans advanced to the quarterfinals, while Switzerland was relegated to the World Group Play-offs. Federer was scheduled to play Mardy Fish in the first of the reverse singles rubbers, but Federer and Fish were taken off the schedule, as the Americans had already won the match-up.|$|E
25|$|The river below Clayton West {{ceases to}} be a shallow, fast-flowing watercourse, and {{consists}} of deeper pools with a slower flow, which is suitable for various coarse fish as well as trout. By 1974, a modest improvement in water quality had been achieved by treatment of industrial effluent, and some fish managed to exist below the weir at the Star Paper Mill in Barnsley. The weir helped to oxygenate the water, {{and most of the}} <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> been washed downstream from Cannon Hall and Bretton Lakes. During flood conditions, many of the population would be washed further downstream, to be replaced by others from the lakes. A survey in 1982 found gudgeon, minnow and three-spined stickleback, which had increased by 1985, and over 10,000 coarse fish were released as part of a restocking programme. However, most of these were killed by serious pollution incidents that affected the river in 1987 and 1988, and incidents continued for a further three years. The sewage treatment works at Darton and Lundwood, on either side of Barnsley, were largely responsible.|$|E
25|$|Malacca had few {{domestic}} products {{with which to}} trade. It produced small amounts of tin and gold as well as dried fish, yet even the salt for preserving the <b>fish</b> <b>had</b> to be sourced from elsewhere in the region. Basic goods, including vegetables, cattle and fish, were supplied by Malacca's trading partners. Rice, mainly for local consumption, was imported. Much of the mercantile activity in Malacca, therefore, relied on the flow of goods {{from other parts of}} the region. Among Malacca's most crucial functions was its role as both a collection centre for cloves, nutmeg and mace from the Spice Islands and a redistribution centre for cotton textiles from ports in Gujarat, the Coromandel Coast, Malabar Coast and Bengal. Other goods traded in Malacca included porcelain, silk and iron from China and natural products of the Malay archipelago, such as camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, fish roe and seaweed. From the coastal regions on both sides of Malacca Straits came forest products; rattan, resin, roots and wax, and some gold and tin. These goods were then shipped to ports west of Malacca especially Gujarat.|$|E
