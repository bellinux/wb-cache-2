50|$|About 190 metres {{southeast}} of the cemetery are the foundations of what was probably the hotel. The foundation stones enclose an area about 5 metres wide by 13 metres long, and {{seem to have an}} internal partition towards the southern end and a 2-metre extension to the east. A line of stones also extends north from the northwestern corner. South of the foundations is a cleared rectangular <b>earth</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} a {{feasibility study}} focused on filtering American whiskey, matured in new toasted and charred casks, at 25 ºF in order to remove haze which forms when product is diluted from cask strength (62 % ABV) to bottling strength (40 – 50 % ABV). Chill filtration is a process already implemented in the brown spirits industry in order to guarantee the stability of products at different ethyl alcohol concentrations. The filtration trials and cellulose-pad performance were evaluated in terms of economics, turbidity reduction, test time, throughput, color reduction, and shelf life stability. Those trials with satisfactory overall color and stability results were tested {{to determine the best}} performing filtration system. Chill filtration showed better product stability when compared with the current filtration system (consisting of carbon treatment and overnight hold). Two filtration pads were initially tested: a cellulose/diatomaceous <b>earth</b> (DE) <b>pad</b> and a cellulose-only pad. Although the cellulose/DE pad provided excellent stability results, it exhibited low product throughput and excessive color removal. The cellulose-only pads provided overall acceptable product stability, low color removal, and adequate throughput...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a magnetic field}} drift shell-splitting model for the unusual butterfly and head-and-shoulder energetic (E greater than 25 keV) particle pitch angle distributions (PADs) which appear deep within the dayside magnetosphere {{during the course of}} storms and substorms. Drift shell splitting separates the high and low pitch angle particles in nightside injections as they move to the dayside magnetosphere, so that the higher pitch angle particles move radially away from <b>earth.</b> Consequently, butterfly <b>PADs</b> with a surplus of low pitch angle particles form on the inner edge of the injection, but head-and-shoulder PADs with a surplus of high pitch angle particles form on the outer edge. A similar process removes high pitch angle particles from the inner dayside magnetosphere during storms, leaving the remaining lower pitch angle particles to form butterfly PADs on the inner edge of the ring current. A detailed case and statistical study of Charge Composition Explorer/Medium-energy Particle Analyzer observations, as well as a review of previous work, shows most examples of unusual PADs to be consistent with the model...|$|R
40|$|Energetic-particle {{pitch angle}} data and vector {{magnetometer}} data, measured along the Ogo 5 inbound orbit near midnight on three magnetically quiet days, August 2, 4, and 25, 1968, {{were used to}} infer the magnetic tail field configuration for each day. For the first 2 days the particles, when initially detected, showed isotropic pitch angle distributions (PAD's) (indicative of nonadiabatic motions resulting from {{the breakdown of the}} guiding center invariants # and J) but later made rapid transitions to the butterfly PAD (indicative of adiabatic guiding center motion). The lower-rigidity particles made the PAD transitions first and were followed in turn by the higher-rigidity particles as Ogo neared the earth. We have used a simple algebraic model which has allowed us to fit both the magnetic field and the pitch angle transition data. For the latter data fit, the detailed particle trajectories were followed along the model field lines to the neutral sheet. The particles were required to execute adiabatic guiding center motion if they were started from positions on the satellite orbit nearer earth than the point of observed changes inthe PAD. They were required to undergo n nadiabatic motion atsome part of their trajectory if they were started at a point on the satellite orblt farther from the <b>earth</b> than the <b>PAD</b> transition point. The results are presented in terms of model •oefficients for each day. The model fields are plotted, the cross-tail currents are derived, and particle motnon is studied in the model fields. It was found that 79 -keV electrons were i...|$|R
