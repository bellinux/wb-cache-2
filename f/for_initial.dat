5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration of the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided the impetus for their development. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected <b>for</b> <b>initial</b> training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} <b>for</b> <b>initial</b> broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} {{have developed a}} variety of techniques to measure implicit self-esteem. Bosson, Swann, and Pennebaker (2000) examined {{the reliability and validity of}} these measures. Only some implicit measures were reliable, and even these measures failed to show convergent and predictive validity. In contrast, explicit self-esteem predicted subjective well-being (SWB). However, the predictive validity of explicit self-esteem measures may have been inflated because SWB was assessed by means of self-reports. The present article addresses this concern. We correlated self-reports and informant reports of subjective well-being with an ex-plicit (Rosenbergs self-esteem scale) and an implicit measure of self-esteem (preferences <b>for</b> <b>initials).</b> Explicit self-esteem was a significant predictor of all SWB measures. Preferences <b>for</b> <b>initials</b> were not significantly correlated with any of the SWB measures...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{usefulness}} of name-letter preference scores as indirect indicators of self-esteem by exploring whether multiple unsupervised self-administrations of letter rating tasks within {{a short period of}} time yield useful data. We also examined whether preferences <b>for</b> <b>initials</b> and non-initial name-letters tap different aspects of self-esteem. Participants from a community sample (N = 161; 58 men and 106 women, 17 - 67 years, Mage = 34. 57, SD = 13. 28) completed daily letter rating tasks and state self-esteem questionnaires for seven consecutive days. They also completed a trait self-esteem questionnaire on the first measurement day as well as six months later. Preference scores <b>for</b> first-name <b>initials</b> were stronger but more unstable than preference scores for other name-letters. Preferences <b>for</b> first-name <b>initials</b> were primarily associated with directly measured state self-esteem whereas preferences for non-initials were primarily associated with directly measured trait self-esteem even if the latter was measured six months later. We thus showed that preferences <b>for</b> <b>initials</b> and non-initials are not simply interchangeable. Previous letter rating studies, which almost exclusively used initial preferences, should be interpreted in terms of state rather than trait self-esteem. In future studies, researchers should focus on the name-letter preference that reflects the aspect of self-esteem they wish to address. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|The viewers' {{confused}} {{reaction to}} their story {{based on the}} first half, disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira. Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers' attention, and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story. Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse <b>for</b> <b>initial</b> episodes lacking substance. They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first, it created unanswered questions of its own. IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation of details came {{too late in the}} show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins. Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics, it is a shallow good-versus-evil story made complex by its presentation in the first half. They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, König {{suffered}} significant damage. A heavy shell {{penetrated the}} main armored deck toward the bow. Another shell hit the armored bulkhead {{at the corner}} and shoved it back five feet, breaking off a large piece from the armor plate in the process. Shell splinters from another hit penetrated several of the casemates that held the 15cm secondary guns, two of which were disabled. The ammunition stores for these two guns were set on fire and the magazines had to be flooded to prevent an explosion. The ship nevertheless remained combat effective, as her primary battery remained in operation, as did most of her secondary guns; König could also steam at close to her maximum speed. Other areas of the ship had to be counter-flooded to maintain stability; 1,600tons of water entered the ship, either {{as a result of}} battle damage or counter-flooding efforts. The flooding rendered the battleship sufficiently low in the water to prevent the ship from being able to cross the Amrum Bank until 09:30 on 1 June. König was taken to Kiel <b>for</b> <b>initial</b> repairs, as that was the only location that had a floating dry dock large enough to fit the ship. Repairs were conducted there from 4 to 18 June, at which point the ship was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard. König was again ready to join the fleet by 21 July. In the course of the battle, she suffered 45 men killed and 27 wounded, the highest tally for any surviving battleship in the German fleet.|$|E
