5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E

5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling.

Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> <b>like</b> the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E

5|$|Upon its release, Aphrodite was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented it as a return to form for Minogue. However, critics were divided on its production; many felt Price's production helped make the album cohesive, while some felt it made the album sound too similar to Minogue's previous work and lacked innovation. Commercially, Aphrodite was a success. In Minogue's native country Australia, it peaked at number two on the Australian Albums chart, and was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums chart, a feat accomplished by Minogue's debut studio album Kylie (1988) during the same week 22 years prior.

She also became a Guinness World Record-holder for achieving the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry certified Aphrodite platinum.
