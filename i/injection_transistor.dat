40|$|Gallium Nitride {{is rapidly}} {{emerging}} as a promising material for electronic devices in various fields. Since it is a direct bandgap semiconductor {{it can be used}} for highly efficient light emitting devices (Light Emitting Diodes and Laser Diodes) and the possibility of growing alloys containing Aluminum and Indium allow for the selection of the peak wavelength along the whole UV-green part of the radiation spectrum. Moreover, the high electron mobility, the ability of withstand high electric fields and the good thermal dissipation make GaN-based diodes and transistors devices with a good potential for high frequency and power applications. Before final products containing Gallium Nitride devices can permeate the international market, it is required to guarantee that they are reliable enough to have long lifetimes to appeal potential customers, and that their performance/cost relationship is superior compared to other competitors, at least in some specific fields of application. Aim of this thesis is to investigate the strong points of Gallium Nitrides by means of characterization and reliability tests on various different structures (LEDs, laser diodes, blocking diodes, HEMTs, GITs, MISs), in order to analyze the behavior of the material from different points of view. Within this work is reported a detailed study of the gradual degradation of InGaN-based laser diodes and Light-Emitting Diodes submitted to electro-thermal stress. The purpose is to compare the behavior of the two devices by means of electro-optical measurements, electroluminescence characterization, near field emission measurements and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) investigation in order to give {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms involved in LD degradation. Particular attention is given to the role of injection efficiency decrease and non-radiative recombination. The comparison of the degradation kinetics and an analysis of the degradation modes of the two device structures allowed a complete study of the physical mechanisms responsible for the degradation. It was found that the degradation of the devices can be ascribed to an increase of the defect density, which has a strong impact on non radiative recombination kinetics. The activation energy of the detected deep level is 0. 35 - 0. 45 eV. As an effect of combined electrical and thermal stress tests on commercially-available InGaN-based blue laser diodes, it has been found that sometimes there is an initial decrease of the threshold current, which is ascribed to the increase of the activation of p-type dopant, promoted by the temperature and the flow of minority carriers. In order to investigate the effects of the creation of defects, two different commercial blue InGaN-based LEDs were submitted to 3 MeV proton irradiation at various fluencies (10 ^ 11, 10 ^ 12 and 10 ^ 13 p/cm 2). The degradation process was characterized by combined current-voltage (I - V), optical power-current (L - I) and capacitance-voltage (C - V) measurements, in order to investigate the changes induced by the irradiation and the recovery after annealing time at high temperature (150 °C). The experimental data suggest the creation of non-radiative recombination centers near or into the active region of the LEDs, due to atomic displacement. This hypothesis is confirmed by the results of the recovery tests: the increase of the optical power and its correlation with the recovery of the forward current is consistent with the annealing of those defects. Part of the activity on high electron mobility transistors was devoted to the realization of measurement setups in order to carry out novel characterization techniques. Were analyzed the advantages and limitations of the current-transient method used for the study of the deep levels in GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), by evaluating how the procedures adopted for measurement and data analysis can influence the results of the investigation. The choice of the measurement parameters (such as the voltage levels used to induce the trapping phenomena and monitor the current transients and the duration of the filling pulses) and of the analysis procedure (the method used for the extrapolation of the time constants of the processes) can influence the results of the drain current transient investigation and can provide information on the location of the trap levels responsible for current collapse. Moreover, was collected a database of defects described in more than 60 papers on GaN and its compounds, which can be used to extract information on the nature and origin of the traps in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Using this newly developed technique and other more common tests, several reliability and lifetime test were carried out on various structures, in order to gain a better understanding of their problematic aspects and possible improvements. One potential variation is the composition of the gate stack. Degradation tests were performed at Vgs = - 5 V and increasing Vds levels on GaN HEMTs with different gate materials: Ni/Au/Ni, ITO and Ni/ITO. At each step of the stress experiment, the electrical and optical characteristics of the transistors were measured in order to analyze the degradation process. It was found that stress induces a permanent degradation of the gate diode, consisting in an increase in the leakage current. This change is due to the generation of parasitic conductive paths, as suggested by electroluminescence (EL) mapping, and devices based on ITO showed higher reliability. These data strongly support the hypothesis that the robustness is influenced by processing parameters and/or by the gate material, since all analyzed devices come from the same epitaxial wafer. Other than varying the gate material, it is possible to add a p-type layer under the gate in order to achieve normally-off operation. This change produces a benefit in terms of performances, but can give birth to unusual trapping phenomena. It was carried out an extensive analysis of the time and field-dependent trapping processes that occur in GaN-based gate <b>injection</b> <b>transistors</b> exposed to high drain voltage levels. Results indicate that, even if the devices do not suffer from current collapse, continuous exposure to high drain voltages can induce a remarkable increase in the on-resistance (Ron). The increase in Ron can be recovered by leaving the device in rest conditions. Temperature-dependent analysis indicates that the activation energy of the detrapping process is equal to 0. 47 eV. By time-resolved electroluminescence characterization, it is shown that this effect is related to the capture of electrons in the gate - drain access region. This is further confirmed by the fact that charge emission can be significantly accelerated through the injection of holes from the gate. A first-order model was developed to explain the time dependence of the trapping process. Using other deep levels characterization techniques, such as drain current transients, gate frequency sweeps and backgating, several other trap states were identified in these devices. Their activation energies are 0. 13, 0. 14, 0. 25, 0. 47 and 0. 51 eV. During the accelerated lifetime tests of these devices, it was found a variation of the relative amplitude of the transconductance peaks, well correlated with the increase of the electroluminescence. This effect can be explained by the activation of the p-type dopant, a phenomenon which was detected also in laser diodes. It is possible to develop diodes able to withstand very high reverse voltages using a similar structure, deprived of the gate region and with an additional Schottky diode (Natural superjunction). In this case, the activation energies of the detected deep levels were 0. 35, 0. 36, 0. 44 and 0. 47 eV. These values are very similar to the ones found in GITs, and this fact, along with the presence of the p-dopant activation in very different devices, confirms that it is useful to study different structures based on the same material in order to gain more knowledge on its performances, possibilities and reliability aspects...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} charge modulation spectroscopy to investigate the negative and positive charge-induced absorptions in conjugated semiconducting polymers {{as a way to}} experimentally compare the wavefunctions of electrons and holes.   Interactions between light and charges including fluorescence quenching and photocurrent are also explored. Conjugated polymers have an electronic structure with an energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In the neutral ground state, there are no optical transitions at photon energies lower than this gap.   When an excess charge is added to a conjugated polymer, the charge couples with a local structural reorganisation forming a localised entity known as a polaron.   The polaron has two new electronic states within the energy gap symmetrically spaced about the midgap energy.   Typically two new optical transitions between the polaronic states are allowed and can be accessed with sub gap energies. In order to probe the sub gap polaron absorptions charges can be added by electrical injection.   Electrical <b>injection</b> in a <b>transistor</b> configuration provides a controlled way to measure the absorption of a known number of charges in the solid state and without triplet or singlet absorptions complicating the spectra as observed in photo-induced absorption.   By taking advantage of recently developed ambipolar transistors where both holes and electrons can be accumulated in the same device a comparison can be made between the negative and positive polaron wavefunctions.   Two polyfluorene polymers were chosen as examples where quantum chemical calculations predict either the same or different wavefunctions for the electron and hole.   Poly(9, 9 -di-n-octyfluorene) (F 8) is a hydrocarbon-only polymer which is expected to have similar electron and hole wavefunctions, whereas the related co-polymer, poly(9, 9 -di-n-octyfluorene-alt- benzothiadiazole) (F 8 BT) is expected to have an electron wavefunction that is more localized than the hole. The ambipolar transistors used in this thesis are typified by a dominant contact resistance which introduces difficulties in the charge modulation spectroscopy experiment.   New techniques for simultaneous electrical and optical characterisation are developed and new device structures and fabrication processes are introduced in order to overcome a number of artefacts and improve the accuracy of the measurement allowing quantitative comparisons to be made. The increase in transistor or diode current with energy gap illumination and the quenching of fluorescence in the presence of charges is also investigated and a new method for imaging charge trapping and device operation in transistors with luminescent semiconductors is introduced.

40|$|Electronic {{monitoring}} utilizing process-specific Ring Oscillators (RO) is explored as a {{means of}} identifying, quantifying, and modeling sources of variation in circuit performance due to manufacturing and layout design parameters. This dissertation contains the first measured silicon results for the utilization of parameter-specific modification of ring oscillator layouts to electronically monitor particular process variation. Design and testing for this work were made possible through the Berkeley Wireless Research Center. The working circuits were fabricated by ST Micro in a 45 nm fabrication process that was under development. The design was based on a process design kit provided by ST Micro. The lithography simulation was carried out using generic models in Mentor Graphics Calibre. Five systematic process effects were considered: etch, focus, misalignment, and capping layer and Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) stress. In all cases, inverter layouts were modified in order to increase sensitivity to a particular parameter within design rule constraints. For monitoring etch, {{the presence or absence of}} adjacent dummy gates and pre-correction for residual lithographic effects were used. For monitoring gate focus, spillover functions and Pattern Matching were used as an initial guide to place added surroundings to the gate; this was followed by systematic optimization via Mentor Graphics Calibre simulations. A focus sensitivity of 1. 5 times that of a dense gate was achieved. For monitoring gate-to-active misalignment, a set of 5 pre-programmed offsets on an `H-shaped diffusion' was designed. The RO frequency versus offset relationship in design showed a parabolic shape with a speed up of 3. 2 % for 15 nm misalignment. The capping layer and lateral STI stress monitors were designed based on changes in the lateral size of the source and drain, including those of asymmetrical source/drain areas. Seventeen chips were received, packaged, and automatically tested. The measured range of the across-wafer variation was 11. 1 % for control-case RO with minimum sized gate area. For a given monitor on a typical chip, the variation among the 36 RO instantiations normalized to its mean is 0. 2 - 0. 3 %, with the larger value occurring for the smaller gate areas. When these values were multiplied by the square root of the product of 36 instances time 26 transistors per RO, the average threshold slope (AVT) of 2. 3 mV/um was obtained in an equivalent Pelgrom model. The measured RO frequency sensitivity to gate focus monitors shows that they are about 4 % slower than the control ROs. This decrease is attributed to parasitic effects as well as the non-uniform `hour-glass' shape produced at the top and bottom of the gate from the horizontal extensions used to increase focus sensitivity. The pre-programmed gate-to-active misalignment monitors show a 2 - 4 nm overlay error for 17 chips. The fact that the experimental measurements are less sensitive than predicted during the design stage is in part attributed to the fact that the wafer was run under unusually good control without any programmed treatments such as defocus. This observation is supported by the fact that the measured range of RO frequency was typically centered and 1 / 6 - 1 / 4 th of the SS-FF guard band. The unanticipated requirement to apply strong OPC techniques with scatter-bars to the monitor designs in order to guarantee that they would not impact product yield also resulted in considerable sensitivity loss. The Nitride Contact Etch Stop Liner (CESL) strain-induced monitors show a ring oscillator frequency increase of 5. 3 % and 13. 9 % for 1. 8 X and long length source/drain diffusion (LOD) respectively as compared to minimum LOD, after the normalization of raw data to simulation data so as to correct for parasitic effects. This increase is due to increased CESL-induced strain for large LOD. For the same LOD, asymmetrical designs show a 3 % ring oscillator frequency increase for larger source LOD than that of larger drain LOD, indicating <b>transistor</b> <b>injection</b> velocity as well as mobility is important. The random variation of RO circuit performance for a given layout monitor within a chip is examined for 3 sources of variations: changes in gate length (L), gate oxide thickness (Tox), and channel doping (Nch). The strategy here is to make a linear approximation of the measured RO frequency sensitivity to these 3 parameters under 5 distinct combinations of operating voltages and temperatures using the 45 nm PDK BSIM 4 /PSP models. The strategy is implemented using least mean square (LMS) analysis. For all of the blocks, the LMS results indicate that the source of random within-chip variation is dominated by random dopant fluctuations in comparison with changes in L and Tox...|$|R
