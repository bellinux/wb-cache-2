40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the thermodynamic properties of the process of water sorption in <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> seeds. The equilibrium moisture content of <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> seeds was determined by the gravimetric-dynamic method for different values of temperature and water activity. According to the results, increasing the moisture content increases the energy required for the evaporation of water in <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> seeds, and the values of integral isosteric heat of desorption, within the moisture content range of 3. 33 to 11. 30 (% d. b.), varies from 4, 222. 70 to 2, 870. 34 kJ kg- 1. With the elevation in the equilibrium moisture content, there is an increase in differential entropy and Gibbs free energy, which has positive values, demonstrating non-spontaneity in the process of desorption in the seeds. The theory of enthalpy-entropy compensation can be satisfactorily applied to the sorption phenomenon, and the process of water desorption of <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> seeds is controlled by enthalpy...|$|E

40|$|Cover {{crops are}} {{important}} for improving soil quality. However, soil properties usually have some spatial dependence. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of winter cover crops on physical properties of soil and soybean yields using thematic maps. Five winter treatments were used: black oats; intercropping 1 (<b>forage</b> <b>turnips</b> and black oats); intercropping 2 (<b>forage</b> <b>turnips,</b> black oats and common vetch); wheat; and control. Macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density and water content of the soil from 0 - 0. 1 m depths were evaluated after the winter cover crop management. Soybeans were sown over the entire area in the summer after the winter cover crop management, and the soybean yield was determined for each treatment. Maps for each treatment were created and compared to the control treatment using the relative deviation coefficient (RDC). The cover crops improved the total macroporosity of the soil in some regions of the study area. The black oats were more efficient at maintaining higher water content of the soil, {{and it can be}} used to decrease the bulk density...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} evaluate the use of the <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> residue extracted from biodiesel production as alternative protein source for grazing zebu cattle. At the first experiment, the performance of Nellore zebu cattle was evaluated on grazing grass. Twenty four animals were distributed in three treatments and allocated on six paddocks, with four animals each and two repetitions. Treatments consisted of supplements with two levels of <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> residue (7. 5 and 15. 0 % dry matter) and without <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> (control). Pasture availability and quality were also evaluated. At the second trial, degradability of the residue <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> was measured in six rumen fistulated zebu cattle fed basal diet composed by grass coast-cross hay and concentrate (35 % CP) with 15 % of <b>turnip</b> <b>forage.</b> No difference was observed among the treatments for the animal performance, but the steers fed 7. 5 % of <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> residue showed the highest daily gain weight (0. 575 kg DGW). The <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> residue showed high and fast ruminal effective degradability of the dry matter (83. 8 %), crude protein (88. 9 %) and neutral detergent fiber (52. 1 %). In conclusion, the <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> residue can be used as protein source in supplement diet for cattle, shifting the conventional protein sources up to 15 % in supplement with 35 % of total crude protein. Dois experimentos foram realizados visando avaliar o uso do resíduo de nabo forrageiro extraído da produção de biodiesel como fonte de proteína alternativa de suplementos para bovinos de corte em pastejo de gramíneas. No primeiro experimento, avaliou-se o desempenho de bovinos Nelore a pasto (ganho diário de peso), utilizando-se 24 animais, distribuídos em três tratamentos em seis piquetes com quatro animais cada e duas repetições. Os tratamentos consistiram de suplementos com dois níveis do resíduo de nabo forrageiro (7, 5 e 15, 0 % na matéria seca) e sem nabo forrageiro (testemunha). A disponibilidade e qualidade da pastagem foram também avaliadas. No segundo experimento determinou-se a degradabilidade ruminal do resíduo de nabo forrageiro em seis bovinos fistulados no rúmen recebendo dieta basal com feno de gramínea e concentrado com 15 % de nabo forrageiro. Durante todo o período experimental não houve diferença significativa entre os tratamentos, mas observou-se melhor desempenho nos animais suplementados com 7, 5 % de resíduo de nabo forrageiro.

40|$|The {{potential}} of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) to infect and damage cool season crops in the grain belt of New South Wales, Australia, was investigated by serological tests on 24, 689 dicot weed, grain, and forage specimens from 1999 to 2007 and infectivity/pathogenicity tests with six isolates. Natural infection by TuMV was common in Brassicaceae weeds. Infected grain crops included mustard (Brassica juncea), field pea (Pisum sativum), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), and coriander (Coriandrum sativum). <b>Forage</b> (<b>turnip,</b> Brassica rapa) was also infected. None of 9, 816 canola (Brassica napus, at least 19 cultivars) or 1, 967 faba bean (Vicia faba, three cultivars) plants were infected. Six isolates from weeds, mustard, and chickpea were inoculated {{on a range}} of weed and crop species including four B. napus pathotype differential lines. Inoculated Brassicaceae weeds, mustard, field pea cv. ‘Cressy Blue’, coriander, Chinese cabbage (B. rapa), and <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> (B. rapa) were usually infected. Field pea cv. Dundale and radishes (Raphanus sativus) were infected infrequently. Symptoms were severe in mustard, <b>forage</b> <b>turnip,</b> chickpea, and field pea. The reportedly susceptible canola cv. ‘Outback’ displayed only variable infectivity and mild symptoms for five isolates and no infectivity for one isolate. Faba bean, field pea cv. ‘Excell’, and two B. napus differentials appeared to be non-hosts. The results suggest that TuMV strains naturalised in Brassicaceae weeds in NSW in 1999 – 2007 could damage mustard, field pea, and <b>forage</b> <b>turnip,</b> but not canola or faba bean. These NSW strains appeared to be distinct from strains that damage canola in Europe, North America, and Asia...|$|E

Crop rotation {{is a basic}} {{action to}} ensure the viability of no-tillage system; however, it is less accepted and practiced by farmers. Thus, this study aims to verify effects of establishing a crop rotation scheme on chemical and physical properties of soil, on biological and agronomics characteristics of crops and as suppressive effect on the weed community. So, under the no-tillage system, in 2010, the cover crops of dwarf mucuna (Mucuna deeringiana), dwarf pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and sun hemp (Crotalaria juncea), and corn crops were implemented; in 2011, the cover crops of canola (Brassica napus), crambe (Crambe abyssinica) and <b>turnip</b> <b>forage</b> (Raphanus sativus), and soybean crops were implemented. The {{physical and chemical properties}} were determined prior to deployment, after management of cover crops and its harvesting. Changes in the soil were monitored by the determination of organic matter, bulk density, macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity and water content. The quality of cover crops was determined by the characteristics of straw, as dry mass and C/N ratio. The population of weeds was determined after 30 days the cover crops sowing and 30 to 60 days due to the crops development. The assessment was performed with the introduction of random frame, hurled four times by portions. The seedling emergence was determined during the crop harvest. In addition, chlorophyll content and leaf analyses were determined. In the laboratory, after harvesting, it was determined the yield and seeds quality. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four treatments in each experimental year (three cover crops plus one control), with five replicates per treatment, totalizing 20 portions. Results obtained were submitted to ANOVA and means comparison was conducted by the Scott-Knott test at 5 % of probability, using the SISVAR software. Some variables were correlated. In the agricultural year 2010 / 2011, improvements were observed in the physical and chemical soil properties after the management of these plants. There was increase in leaf nitrogen content of maize in treatments with cover crops; and the yield and seed quality were not affected. In agricultural year 2011 / 2012, there was increase in the carbon soil content, however, canola was affected by climatic conditions and crambe influenced negatively soybean. In the two agricultural years, the weeds were controlled by cover crops, which presented adequate soil cover. In general, there was increase in the organic matter content of soil, and the chemical and physical properties presented no consistent changes. Thus, we highlight the necessity of crop rotation systems validated in a regionalized way, according to the different soil and climatic conditions of the State of ParanÃ...|$|R

The experiments were conducted in laboratory and greenhouse using the following species: sunflower (Helianthus annuus), sun hemp (Crotalaria juncea), brachiaria (Urochloa decumbens e Urochloa ruziziensis), millet (Pennisetum americanum), black oat (Avena stringosa), white lupin (Lupinus albus), <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> (Rafanus sativus) and maize (Zea mays). In laboratory the S. frugiperda larval survival varied from 57 %, on L. albus, to 93 % on H. annuus and {{the survival of the}} pre-imaginal phase varied from 45 % on U. decumbens to 81. 6 % on Z. mays. On C. juncea the larval biomass was lower and the development period of the young and larval stage was higher. The adaptation index was less on C. juncea in greenhouse and laboratory. In greenhouse the larval survival at 14 days was similar for all plants and at 21 days was the lowest on C. juncea. There was less accumulation of biomass at 14 days on C. juncea and at 21 days on C. juncea and A. stringosa. Regarding damage, C. juncea presented less susceptibility to Spodoptera frugiperda attack, which together with the other evaluated parameters, indicated this plant as the most appropriate for soil cover before cultivation of maize. 201...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate biological and microbiological attributes in soil under different winter cover crops and nitrogen doses. The experiment was conducted at the Frederico Westphalen-RS campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) in a Rhodic Hapludox soil. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial arrangement (2 x 10) : 10 winter cover crops systems (Fallow [control], black oats, white oats, ryegrass, <b>forage</b> <b>turnip,</b> vetch, white lupine; black oat + forage turnip; black oat + vetch and black oat + vetch + fodder turnip), and two nitrogen rates in the form of urea applied in successive crops of beans common and maize, with four replications. We assessed the biological attributes (Margalef’s richness, Simpson’s dominance, Shannon’s diversity and abundance of organisms) and microbiological (carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient of the soil). The fallow with wild species and white lupine showed greater Simpson’s dominance and abundance of organisms due to the increase in the number of individuals of the order Collembola. Vetch improved the biological attributes of the soil with increase in Collembola abundance and diversity of organisms of soil fauna. The application of nitrogen favored the microbial biomass carbon and reduced the metabolic quotient...|$|E
40|$|Adjusting {{the cover}} crop to the {{agricultural}} {{system is essential}} to reach success during a crop introduction, since this management can influence development, productivity and produced seeds quality. For the soybean cultivar CD 202, traditional, half, and double amounts of crop waste produced by black oats, and a consortium of black oat, common vetch and <b>forage</b> <b>turnip,</b> were evaluated. Tests comprised emergence (emergency speed index (ESI) and emergence rate (ER)), development, field productivity and quality of seeds (germination percentage, accelerated aging, purity, 100 -seed weight, and water content). The experimental design was of split plots and the mean values were compared through the Scott-Knott test at a 5 % significance level, totaling seven treatments with five replications each. No {{differences were found in}} germination percentage, water content, and final height of plants. Some treatments differed in germination and waste use increased ESI; ER was superior for black oats and the best productivity was found under double amount of straw, on both cover crops. The seed strength decreased the under consortium, as shown by accelerated aging under the consortium. The purity of seeds was lower for black oats, decreasing with the least amount of crop waste. The 100 -seed weight was lower with the double amount in oats; however, under the consortium the use of cover crop increased their weight.

40|$|ABSTRACT Water erosion is {{the main}} cause of soil {{degradation}} and is influenced by rainfall, soil, topography, land use, soil cover and management, and conservation practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify water erosion in a Humic Dystrudept in two experiments. In experiment I, treatments consisted of different rates of fertilizer applied to the soil surface under no-tillage conditions. In experiment II, treatments consisted of a no-tillage in natural rangeland, burned natural rangeland and natural rangeland. <b>Forage</b> <b>turnip,</b> black beans, common vetch, and corn were used in rotation in the treatments with crops in the no-tillage during study period. The treatments with crops and the burned rangeland and natural rangeland were compared to a bare soil control, without cultivation and without fertilization. Increasing fertilization rates increased organic carbon content, soil resistance to disintegration, and the macropore volume of the soil, due to the increase in the dry mass of the crops, resulting in an important reduction in water erosion. The exponential model of the ŷ = ae-bx type satisfactorily described the reduction in water and soil losses in accordance with the increase in fertilization rate and also described the decrease in soil losses in accordance with the increase in dry mass of the crops. Water erosion occurred in the following increasing intensity: in natural rangeland, in cultivated natural rangeland, and in burned natural rangeland. Water erosion had less effect on water losses than on soil losses, regardless of the soil management practices...|$|E
40|$|A eficiência do sistema de rotação de cultura requer, entre outrostratamentos, a escolha adequada das espécies a serem instaladas. Culturas vegetais podem apresentar compostos aleloquímicos, os quais são liberados por meio de pelos radiculares, sementes, raízes, colmos e folhas, em quantidades variáveis, capazes de interferir nas culturas subsequentes, comprometendo a produção. Assim, este estudoanalisou o potencial alelopático de aveia-preta (Avena strigosa Schreb) (AP), nabo forrageiro (Raphanus sativus L.) (NF), ervilhaca (Vicia sativa L.) (ER), azevém (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) (AZ) e consórcio (CO - AP+ER+NF) na germinação de sementes e crescimento de plântulas de soja. O experimento foi em laboratório, com substrato deareia, onde foram cultivadas plantas de cobertura, por 30 dias, mantendo os restos radiculares das plantas com e sem restos de parte aérea. Observou-se redução na emergência de plântulas de soja sob CO, AZ e AP. O índice de velocidade de emergência (IVE), a porcentagem de emergência em areia (EA) e a massa fresca de hipocótilo (MFH) foram afetados negativamente pelas plantas de cobertura. In {{order to}} be efficient, the crop {{rotation}} system requires, among other factors, an adequate choice of species to be installed. Vegetalcultures can feature allelochemical compounds, released by root hairs, roots, stems and leaves in variable amounts, which are able to interfere on subsequent cultures, as well as cause a delay in their production. Thus, this study analyzed the allelopathic potentialof black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) (BO), <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> (Raphanus sativus L.) (FT), vetch (Vicia sativa L.)

The remaining root portions of plants were kept with and without the remaining aerial part portions. A reduction was observed on the emergence of soybean plantlets under CO, RG and BO. The emergence speed index (ESI), emergence percentage on sand (ES) and the green mass of hypocotyls (GMH) were negatively affected bycoverage plants, and due to this, another study is essential to verify whether there is an indication of the allelopathic effect...|$|E
40|$|Annual forage {{cropping}} systems are a vital aspect of livestock forage production. One area where this production {{system can be}} enhanced is the integration of novel annual forages into conventional {{cropping systems}}. Two separate projects were conducted to investigate alternative forage options in annual forage production. In the first discussed research trial, two sets of crops were sown following soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain harvest, at two nitrogen application rates 56 and 112 kg ha- 1. The first set of crops were C 4 summer annuals seeded within two weeks of wheat grain harvest and included, brown mid-rib (BMR) sorghum sudangrass, pearl millet, foxtail millet, and tef. The second set of crops included C 3 cool-season annuals sown in early August; these were oats, oilseed radish, and <b>forage</b> <b>turnip.</b> Crops were harvested and analyzed for yield, nitrogen, ash, and fiber content. Results from over a three-year span showed that crops did not consistently differ in any studied variable between the two nitrogen rates. Yield and forage quality characteristics allowed crops to be broken into groups based on livestock dietary requirements and production goals. The second research trial focused on characterizing the forage quality and nutrient removal capabilities of amaranth as compared to other annual forage crops in {{the presence or absence}} of manure application. Conventional crop options included BMR sorghum-sudangrass, maize. Additionally, another potential crop option of oats and chickling vetch were also sown. Results from the forage quality study show that amaranth has superior forage characteristics to conventional crop options with the highest nitrogen content of all crops, and one of the lowest fiber contents, but does not have a high enough yield to allow it to be a replacement for any conventional crop option. Maize had the greatest biomass yield of all crop treatments. In the nutrient removal study amaranth plant tissue nutrient concentrations were highest in Ca, Mg, and K than all other crop treatments. However, when nutrient removal by harvest was analyzed, individual amaranth harvests did not always remove more of certain nutrients in comparison to maize and other crop options. Results demonstrate that novel annual forage crop options can contribute to conventional systems. The crop utilized by the producer depends on production goals and animal dietary requirements. ...|$|E

Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a interferÃncia dos resÃduos culturais de aveia preta e tambÃm do consÃrcio de aveia preta, ervilhaca comum e nabo forrageiro sobre a incidÃncia de plantas invasoras; emergÃncia de plÃntulas, crescimento de plantas e produtividade da cultura de soja; alÃm da qualidade da semente da soja colhida. O experimento foi conduzido em campo, nos anos 2007 / 2008, demarcando-se parcelas de 5 m x 2 m, com 1 m de bordadura entre elas e distribuÃdas em sete tratamentos, ao acaso, com cinco repetiÃÃes cada. Durante o desenvolvimento da cultura, avaliaram-se os parÃmetros: Ãndice de velocidade de emergÃncia, desenvolvimento de planta e incidÃncia de espÃcies invasoras. ApÃs a colheita, em laboratÃrio, foram avaliadas as sementes colhidas pela determinaÃÃo de teor de Ãgua, massa de 100 sementes, pureza, produtividade, porcentagem de germinaÃÃo e vigor. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em esquema fatorial com dois fatores com testemunha e as mÃdias foram comparadas pelo teste de Tukey ao nÃvel de 5 % de significÃncia. Observa-se que as espÃcies invasoras nÃo diferiram estatisticamente entre os tratamentos. De maneira geral, os tratamentos nÃo influenciaram na altura de plantas e aumentaram a produtividade da soja. Entretanto, apresentaram sementes menos vigorosas quando submetidas ao teste de envelhecimento acelerado. A pureza das sementes foi menor quando submetida ao cultivo com aveia preta. A massa de 100 sementes foi alterada pelos tratamentos, sendo maior em cultivo sob aveia preta. Os demais parÃmetros analisados nÃo mostraram diferenÃas estatÃsticas. Conclui-se, portanto, que tais espÃcies sÃo indicadas como alternativa para cobertura de inverno, na rotaÃÃo de culturas com a soja, pois melhoram os aspectos agronÃmicos da cultura. The {{adjustment of}} a cover crop to the agricultural system, with species whose chemical composition has substances {{able to control}} weeds, is a promising alternative to decrease herbicides application in agriculture. So, this trial aimed at analyzing the interference of black oats residues as well as black oat, common vetch and <b>forage</b> <b>turnip</b> consortium on weeds incidence, seeds emergence, seedling emergence, plants development, soybean productivity and its harvested seeds quality. The trial was carried out on field, from 2007 to 2008, with 5 m x 2 m plots and 1 m of border among them, distributed in seven randomized treatments with five replications each. During the crop development, the following parameters were evaluated: emergence speed index, plants development and weeds incidence. After harvest, in the laboratory, harvested seeds were evaluated according to: water content determination, weight of 100 seeds, purity, productivity, percentages of germination and vigor. It was a factorial experimental design with two factors plus one control and the averages were compared by the Tukey test at 5 % level of significance. The weeds species did not differ statistically among the treatments. By and large, the treatments did not influence on plants heights, but increased the soybean productivity. However, the seeds showed less vigor when under the accelerated aging test. The seeds purity was inferior when they were under black oats crop. The weight of 100 seeds was changed by the treatments and they were heavier when grown on black oats. The other analyzed parameters did not show any statistic difference. It is, therefore, concluded that these species are good alternatives as winter covers in soybean crop under rotation system, since they improve the agronomic aspects of this culture...|$|E
