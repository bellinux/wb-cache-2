40|$|In {{the present}} study a new brake setup was {{developed}} to test <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> on an industrial brake with drum diameter of 30 ''. During the tests performed on the setup, the brake undergoes a series of cycles in which the drum is slowed down from service speed to standstill. In each cycle {{the same amount of}} energy is dissipated as during a realistic safety stop. This was obtained by adding a flywheel in the setup so that the system's kinetic energy at service speed matches the energy of the hoisting system dissipated during an emergency stop. Two different brake lining materials were characterized. Both materials were subjected to two test series to study the changes in coefficient of friction over a number of cycles. It was observed that the coefficient of friction of both linings was dependent on the drum temperature. The coefficient of friction of the first material decreased with increasing drum temperature, while the latter had the opposite behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{chemical}} and thermal treatment of flax fibres are developed: dry, wet, thermal, and oxidation process. The appropriate techniques are established. Scaling up to production size is possible, {{and is being}} realized in 2 cases. The aim was to produce technical fibres of constant quality and to modify yarns starting from flax raw material. Application is planned as reinforcement and process fibres in pressed disk and <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> {{as well as in}} pressed and coiled clutch facings for cars, trucks, rail vehicles, and industrial devices. During the project pilot plants were designed and built for the a. m. processes. These were used to produce series of differently modified flax short fibres and yarns which were delivered to the project partners. Based on the requirements and the feed-back of the manufacturers and on accompanying laboratory research pilot plants and techniques have been optimized. Several fibre types from the SETRALIT "t"r"a"d"e"m"a"r"k FT, FNT, and FG series are technically, ecologically, and economically advantageous when used in friction linings as a substitute for asbestos and synthetic fibres. Mixtures of SETRALIT with aramides may be used, too. Use of standard friction linings containing flax fibres in the automative and other industries can be expected in the medium term. The SETRALIT procedures can be applied on all plant fibres like hemp, sisal etc., and are suitable for manufacturing technical short fibres used in other industrial sectors (e. g. construction materials, plastics, gaskets).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} brake lining thickness due to wear on <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> squeal. Brake lining will be worn out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of braking applications. Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of brake lining, i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R

25|$|Natural {{amorphous}} {{and fine}} flake graphite {{are used in}} <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> or <b>brake</b> shoes for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important {{with the need to}} substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market.

50|$|Due to its efficacy, {{chrysotile}} asbestos {{was often a}} component in <b>brake</b> <b>linings.</b> However, studies such as a 1989 National Institutes of Health item showed an uncommonly high proportion of brake mechanics were afflicted with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, {{both of which are}} linked to chrysotile and asbestos exposure.

40|$|Background In Booth v Amaca Pty Ltd and Amaba Pty Ltd, 1 the New South Wales Dust Diseases Tribunal {{awarded a}} retired motor {{mechanic}} 326 640 in damages for his malignant pleural mesothelioma allegedly caused {{by exposure to}} asbestos through working with the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> manufactured by the defendants.

However, as a mechanic he had been exposed to asbestos in <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> on which he worked from 1953 to 1983. Curtis DCJ held at [172] that the asbestos from the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> ‘materially contributed to [the plaintiff’s] contraction of mesothelioma’.

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the <b>brake,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes on the <b>drum</b> allows <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and <b>braking</b> force. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear <b>brakes,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are best}} suited for slower, {{moderate}} use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load.
