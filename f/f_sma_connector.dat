40|$|A novel {{technique}} and a nonthermal soldering method {{to improve the}} performance of AgHT- 8 transparent polymer antennas are proposed in this letter.

Semi-rigid coaxial cables are used to bring the {{electrical}} signal from the BPM feedthroughs to the outside flanges. at the ambient temperature. Every year around 10 cables will lose their signals during the operation. The connection usually failed at the warm end of the cable. The problems were either the solder joint failed or the center conductor retracted out of the <b>SMA</b> <b>connector.</b> Finite element analyses were performed to understand the failure mechanism of the solder joint. The results showed that (1) The SMA center conductor can separate from the mating connector due to the thermal retraction. (2) The maximum thermal stress at the warm end solder joint can exceed the material strength of the Pb 37 /Sn 63 solder material and (3) The magnet ramping frequency (- 10 Hz), during the machine startup, can possibly resonant the coaxial cable and damage the solder joints, especially when a fracture is initiated. Test results confirmed that by using the silver bearing solder material (a higher strength material) and by crimping the cable at the locations close to the <b>SMA</b> <b>connector</b> (to prevent the center conductor from retracting) can effectively resolve the connector failure problem...|$|R
