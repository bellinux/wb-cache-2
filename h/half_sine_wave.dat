In most cases, an impact law has to be introduced to ensure {{the uniqueness of the}} solution: total energy is either not preserved or spurious high-frequency oscillations arise. In this work, the Time Domain Boundary Element Method (TD-BEM) is shown to overcome these issues on a one-dimensional system undergoing a unilateral Signorini contact condition. Unilateral contact is implemented by switching between free boundary conditions (open gap) and fixed boundary conditions (closed gap). The solution method does not numerically dissipate energy unlike the Finite Element Method and properly captures wave fronts, allowing for the search of periodic solutions. Indeed, TD-BEM relies on fundamental solutions which are travelling Heaviside functions in the considered one-dimensional setting. The proposed formulation is capable of capturing main, subharmonic as well as internal resonance backbone curves useful to the vibration analyst.

The beam profile is cold formed sigma sections. Group of beams with different overall member slenderness ratios were studied. Several approaches have been utilized to model the geometric imperfections. First, the elastic buckling modes were considered as the imperfect beam shape.

In this model, the tractor was considered as a rigid body, except for the tires, which were regarded as spring–damper units. The entire passing–over process was divided into four periods as done by Yamamoto and Shimada (1957), and Takeda et al.

It is smaller, lighter, and more versatile than currently available pumps and operates on a servo principle. A rotary valve between the pump and the cuirass varies the rate of extraction of air from the cuirass. The pressure within the cuirass is sensed by a pressure transducer, and the output of this is used to control {{the position of the}} rotary valve by means of a motor so that the pressure within the cuirass follows a predetermined <b>half</b> <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> pattern. The respiratory rate varies from 10 to 30 per minute and the inspiratory to expiratory time (I/E) ratio from 3 : 2 to 2 : 3. Inspiratory pressure varies from 0 to - 50 cm H 2 O and an expiratory pressure of 0 to + 50 cm H 2 O can be imposed. The performance of the new pump was assessed in 21 patients with nocturnal hypoxaemia who were accustomed to external negative pressure ventilation. The mean tidal volume achieved increased with increase in cuirass suction pressure, and changing the I/E ratio from 1 : 1 to 3 : 2 produced a small increase at a cuirass negative pressure at 20 cm water. Comparison of the Newmarket pump with the Cape pump in 14 patients showed that similar tidal volumes were achieved. Overnight monitoring of cuirass pressure in one patient showed more even control of peak negative pressure with the Newmarket pump than with the Cape pump.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is that the ship deck is subjected to uni-axial compression under sagging condition, when in the severe condition, the deck is dynamically loaded in nature, with impact type loads, which is the reason of deck collapse under severe condition. In addition, imperfection probably substantially influences the dynamic response of the impacted deck. Based on nonlinear explicit finite element method, the paper aims at studying the influence of three types of initial geometric imperfection on dynamic response of cross-stiffened deck subjected to in-plane impact. Three types of imperfection are local imperfection on deck plate between stiffeners, imperfection of overall positive deflection of the deck, and imperfection of overall negative deflection of the deck. Impact function is a <b>half</b> <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> function with two parameters, impact duration and amplitude of the impact load. First order natural vibration period of the deck is selected as impact duration. Amplitude of the impact load is selected according to the value of ultimate strength of the deck, and varied by times of the ultimate strength. Strain rate effect and Strain hardening effect of the material are accounted in the analysis. Axial residual displacement {{of the end of the}} deck after impact is selected as dynamic response of the deck. The result shows that dynamic response of deck is sensitive to local imperfection, while not sensitive to overall imperfection under low or moderate level of imperfection magnitude. When imperfection is severe, residual axial displacement of the end of the deck is large, especially amplitude of impact load is somewhat larger than ultimate strength. Among 3 kinds of imperfection, dynamic response of overall negative deflection imperfection is the largest, followed by that of local imperfection, while that of overall positive deflection imperfection is the least. ...|$|E

The design repetition rate is 20 s. The switch is composed of ten Fast High Current Thyristors (FHCTs), which are modified symmetric 4. 5 kV GTO thyristors of WESTCODE. Recent studies aiming at improving the turn-on delay, switching speed and at decreasing the switch losses, have led to test an asymmetric not fully optimised GTO thyristor of WESTCODE and an optimised device of GEC PLESSEY Semiconductor (GPS), GB. The GPS FHCT, which gave the best results, is a non irradiated device of 64 mm diameter with a hold-off voltage of 4. 5 kV like the symmetric FHCT. Tests results of the GPS FHCT show a reduction in turn-on delay of 40 % and in switching losses of almost 50 % {{with respect to the}} symmetric FHCT of WESTCODE. The GPS device can sustain an important reverse current during a short period. This eliminates the need for an anti-parallel diode stack in the final switch. Extrapolation of the test results onto the final switch result in a turn-on delay of 600 ns and 6 J total conduction losses from turn-on to 20 kA peak current. Further tests on the GPS FHCT at 4. 4 kV, 60 kA peak current and a repetition rate of 10 s resulted in a di/dt of 50 kA/ms with a turn-on delay of 700 ns.
