5|$|The {{hurricane}} had {{devastating effects}} on the places it hit. <b>It</b> <b>killed</b> at least 1,000people directly, {{and a total of}} 1,800 people. At that time, it was Mexico's worst natural disaster in recent times. Most of the destruction was in Colima and Jalisco. A preliminary estimate of property damage was $280million (1959USD).|$|E
5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. <b>It</b> <b>killed</b> some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L.

5|$|Cyclone Filao was {{the most}} notable storm of the season, {{originating}} in late February off northern Madagascar. It ultimately struck Mozambique on March1, where <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> about 100people and left $10million in damage (1988USD). In January, both tropical storms Calidera and Doaza crossed Madagascar, the latter of which helped end a drought. Long-lasting Tropical Storm Hely also struck the country in March. The strongest cyclone of the season was Gasitao, which formed {{at the same time}} as Hely and attained peak winds of 150km/h (95mph). The season ended when Tropical Storm Iarisena dissipated northeast of Madagascar in the middle of May.|$|E
5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, <b>it</b> <b>killed,</b> exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{the fourth}} named storm of the 1992 Pacific {{hurricane}} season. The origins of Darby were from a tropical wave which moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 19. It traversed the Atlantic, and moved across Mexico, where it re-emerged in the Pacific on June 29 and became a tropical depression on July 2, a tropical storm on July 5, and a hurricane on July 6. The storm remained well offshore, although <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> three people.|$|E

5|$|Komen's {{rainfall}} in India compounded upon previous floods; {{heavy rainfall}} {{from the storm}} occurred while rivers and dams were overflowing. Rainfall produced a landslide in Manipur state in extreme eastern India, killing 20people. As the storm moved into West Bengal, <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> 10,088livestock while affecting millions of residents. Komen damaged 368,238houses and destroyed another 107,808. Across the state, the storm killed 83people, some related to lightning and snakebites. Flooding covered a portion of National Highway 60 in neighboring Odisha state. The Indian government utilized 121rescue boats to assist stranded residents.|$|E
5|$|Lake Toba is {{the site}} of a massive supervolcanic {{eruption}} estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event. It is the largest known explosive eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, it had global consequences for human populations; <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> most humans living at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east Africa and India, which affects the genetic make up of the human worldwide population to the present.|$|E

5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} {{close to the}} United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several countries along its path, Waka left {{the most significant}} losses in Tonga, where <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> one person and wrought 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, {{and much of the}} nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185km/h (115mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population {{due to the lack of}} fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33years.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{in support}} of the Nam River front in the {{northern}} part of the 25th Division sector were five batteries of the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions, firing 105mm howitzers, and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion which fired 155mm howitzers, for a total of 36 guns. One 155mm howitzer fired from Komam-ni to the area north of Chungam-ni, the route for the NK 6th Division's supplies. Another forward artillery piece kept the Iryong-ni bridge over the Nam under fire. The 25th Division artillery estimated <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> approximately 1,825 North Korean soldiers during the first three days of September. In this critical time, the US Fifth Air Force added its firepower to that of the division artillery {{in support of}} the ground force. Walker attributed the UN victory in this sector directly to the extensive air support his division received in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rosa was {{the only}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to make landfall during the above-average 1994 Pacific hurricane season. <b>It</b> <b>killed</b> at least 4 people in Mexico. Moisture from the hurricane {{was a factor in}} widespread flooding in the U.S. state of Texas that killed 22 people and caused {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in damage in October 1994. The pre-Rosa tropical depression formed on October 8 before degenerating the next day. It reformed on October 10 and steadily strengthened as it approached Mexico. Ultimately peaking as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale right before landfall, Rosa was the final hurricane, nineteenth tropical storm, and second-last tropical cyclone of the 1994 Pacific hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well {{as several}} {{tropical}} depressions, originated from tropical waves that left the coast of Africa. Chloe lasted for 15days, eventually dissipating over France after wrecking a ship offshore northern Spain, killing 14people. Hurricane Doria co-existed with Beulah and Chloe, taking an unusual trajectory over the eastern United States; <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> three people in a boating accident offshore New Jersey. In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three people when it struck Mexico north of Tampico. Tropical Storm Ginger existed in the far eastern Atlantic in early October, and Hurricane Heidi stalled over the northern Atlantic Ocean {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E

In early September, a typhoon {{passed through}} the Bonin Islands south of Japan and later moved near Kyushu; heavy {{rainfall}} caused a reservoir to collapse in Ōita Prefecture, killing 50people. On September18, a typhoon caused a tram collision in Tokyo due to poor visibility, killing 20. Another typhoon struck southern Taiwan on September29, causing 50fatalities. On October19, Wake Island recorded typhoon-force winds {{for the first time}} since observations began five years prior. A strong typhoon passed near Guam on November3 with winds of 200km/h (125mph), damaging most of the buildings on the island and killing five. Three storms affected the Philippines in December, the second of which was the most notable; <b>it</b> <b>killed</b> 63people and left 75,000homeless on Catanduanes.
