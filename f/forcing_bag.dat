This is the first study to use electromyography (EMG) to assess the distance effect, to examine the benefit of a distal external focus of attention beyond a target, and to test the constrained action hypothesis in a stationary, dynamic task. People who did not have much experience in martial arts kicked a <b>force</b> <b>bag</b> while EMG was recorded using different verbally cued foci of attention. The differences in the force-accuracy measure (F-A) and cocontraction between conditions were not significant. Cocontraction and F-A were negatively correlated in the distal external focus condition, but positively correlated in the internal focus condition. These findings suggest that cocontraction may be beneficial in certain circumstances, but not in others...|$|R

40|$|Closed {{flexible}} fish cages {{are proposed}} {{as a new}} concept in marine aquaculture, replacing the conventional net cages {{in order to meet}} ecological challenges related to fish lice and escapes. It is important to understand the response of the cage exposed to current loads. Then more knowledge about forces and deformations on the closed flexible fish cage for different filling levels is needed. A scaled model of a closed flexible fish cage shaped like a half ellipsoid was tested in a towing-tank. Global drag <b>forces</b> and <b>bag</b> deformations were measured for four different filling levels between 70 % and 100 %, and steady current velocities between 0. 04 m/s and 0. 22 m/s in model scale, corresponding to Reynolds numbers in the range Re= 3 – 17 × 104 Re= 3 – 17 × 104. Findings from the experiments showed that the drag force increased for decreasing filling levels.

40|$|The {{internal}} stress distribution of bagged fabric is studied theoretically and experimentally {{to investigate the}} influence of the stress distributions on fabric-residual-bagging deformation. A model is derived by using membrane theory to analyse the stress distributions for isotropic fabrics under different boundary conditions, including consideration of different bagging heights and the friction between the fabric sample and the steel ball deforming the fabric. The results indicate that a non-uniform distribution of meridian stress and a non-continuous distribution of hoop stress, along with bagging height, are important factors that may influence residual-bagging deformation and may cause localised damage of the fabric. To investigate the influence of fabric anisotropy on the bagging behaviour of a fabric, the stress distribution of an anisotropic fabric is studied {{on the basis of the}} measurements of tensile moduli in seven directions by using fabric strips and of the fabric strain calculated from the relation between the geometrical deformation and bagging height of a fabric. The analysis shows that a non-uniform stress distribution along the meridian direction and variation of the tensile angle θ may cause the difference in the yarn stresses between the warp and weft directions, resulting in different bagging shapes. Comparing predicted <b>bagging</b> <b>forces</b> with measured forces, it is found that the method is able to predict the trend of <b>bagging</b> <b>force</b> with some deviations.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} rheological behavior of fabric bagging. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that stress-strain relationships in fabric consist of three essential components: elastic deformation and viscoelastic deformation of fibers and the friction between fibers and yarns within the fabric structure. The nonlinear strain of the fabric, the elastic and viscoelastic deformation of fibers, and interfiber friction during the bagging process have been taken into account in the model. By specifying the fundamental parameters of fiber mechanical properties and yarn-fabric structural features, the model is able to predict fabric bagging behavior under test conditions, such as loading and unloading processes in each cycle, change of <b>bagging</b> <b>force</b> with cycles, relative contributions of the three components (elasticity, viscoelasticity, and frictional forces) in each cycle, and residual bagging height in each cycle. A comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental measurements for two wool fabrics with different structures reveals good agreement between them. The results indicate that the {{mathematical model}} is able to quantitatively simulate fabric bagging rheological behavior and predict fabric bagging performance by specifying basic fiber mechanical properties and yarn-fabric structural parameters.

5000|$|The airbags in {{the vehicle}} are {{controlled}} by a central Airbag control unit (ACU), {{a specific type of}} ECU. The ACU monitors a number of related sensors with{{in the vehicle}}, including accelerometers, impact sensors, side (door) pressure sensors, wheel speed sensors, gyroscopes, brake pressure sensors, and seat occupancy sensors. The bag itself and its inflation mechanism is concealed within the steering wheel boss (for the driver), or the dashboard (for the front passenger), behind plastic flaps or doors which are designed to [...] "tear open" [...] under the <b>force</b> of the <b>bag</b> inflating. Once the requisite 'threshold' has been reached or exceeded, the airbag control unit will trigger the ignition of a gas generator propellant to rapidly inflate a fabric bag.

The airbag's volume {{and the size of the}} vents in the bag are tailored to each vehicle type, to spread out the deceleration of (and thus force experienced by) the occupant over time and over the occupant's body, compared to a seat belt alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{plastic bag}} can claim the dubious distinction of ranking {{among the most}} abundant types of marine debris In the world’s oceans, plastic bags slowly degrade into small pieces, take an unknown {{amount of time to}} mineralize, and harm aquatic life at all depths and in all stages of the degradation process. Whales, sharks, and sea turtles regularly ingest whole floating plastic bags, mistaking them for prey, while sea birds and fish indiscriminately feed upon floating plastic particles. Encounters with floating plastic can also result in entanglement, impairing the mobility of aquatic creatures. Plastic bags cause additional environmental harm when they settle on the sea floor, where they are known to smother sedentary flora and fauna, and thought to disrupt important hydrological processes. Despite the magnitude of the pelagic plastic problem, the continued manufacture and consumption of plastic bags is among the most easily addressed of contemporary environmental problems. This Comment focuses on plastic bags because the environmental harms caused by their mismanagement could be easily prevented. Prohibiting the use of plastic bags would require a relatively painless shift by consumers and have the effect of dramatically reducing environmental degradation. Plastic bags have negligible social benefits and significant environmental costs that are not associated with currently available and easily implemented alternatives. The abundance and reflexive use of plastic bags is thus a feature of contemporary society that can and should be eliminated. To prevent the environmental harms wrought by plastic bags, governments of all sizes are disincentivizing or outright banning the use of plastic bags. This Comment examines the environmental justifications and sources of legal authority for plastic bag bans to bolster the position of governmental units that have already passed or are currently contemplating the passage of plastic bag reducing measures. Part II lays out an argument in favor of plastic bag reduction. It first considers two of the practical realities that account for plastics’ environmental and economic harms—the difficulties associated with its disposal and its longevity. Next, it explains the environmental parameters of the problem, cataloguing plastic pollution’s adverse effects on the health and welfare of plants, animals, and humans. It subsequently summarizes the economic harms associated with pelagic plastic. Part III explores three possible categories of policy solutions to the pelagic plastic problem, all of which focus on the role that individual and industrial norms play in perpetuation of the problem. Part IV introduces some of the economic and social <b>forces</b> behind plastic <b>bag</b> use by describing the interests of the plastics industry and the disposable consumer culture that the industry has helped to create. It describes some of the tactics that these groups have used to oppose plastic bag reduction measures, and then touches upon the arguments and strategies {{that could be used to}} overcome this opposition...|$|R
40|$|For {{assessment}} of their performance and {{for the development of}} injury risk functions {{there is a need for}} additional biofidelity data. In this report two types of data are made available: Part A - post mortem human subject exposed to various restraints; Part B – volunteer shoulder rang-of-motions. Part A LAB- 2002 : Load-limiting belt restraints have been present in cars since 1995. An accident study showed the greater effectiveness in thorax injury prevention using a 4 kN load limiter belt with an airbag than using a 6 kN load limiter belt without airbag. Frontal sled crashes were performed using PMHS. Restraint conditions evaluated are 6 kN load-limiting belt and 4 kN load-limiting belt with an airbag. Loads between the occupant and the sled environment were recorded. Various measurements characterize the PMHS behaviour and injuries were noted. LAB- 2005 : Many studies have reported multiple rib fractures sustained by an Out-of-Position (OOP) driver subjected to a frontal airbag deployment. Two successive phases occur during the bag deployment: punch-out loading of the thorax, followed by a membrane effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the thoracic injuries generated by each phase separately. Tests of nine post-mortem human surrogates were carried out on a static test bench using a driver side airbag module. Three loading configurations were performed: membrane only, punch-out only, and both types combined. The membrane-only tests were performed with the thorax initially positioned at 13, 78 and 128 mm from the plate in order to vary the load magnitude. The punch-out and the combined tests were performed with the thorax initially 8 mm from the module. Accelerometers and angular rate sensors were fixed on the sternum and on the first, fourth, and eighth thoracic vertebrae of the PMHS. Ribs 2 to 6 were instrumented with strain gauges. The reaction <b>force</b> of the <b>bag</b> on the plate was measured using four 2 -axis load cells. Results showed that both pure punch-out and pure membrane loading can result in thoracic injuries. However, the rib fracture locations seemed to differ from one type of loading to the other. Moreover, for the same initial distance between the airbag module and the thorax, the injuries were more severe in the combined effect tests than in the pure punch-out or pure membrane. LAB- 2008 : Ribs of 8 PMHS were equipped with up to 96 strain gauges. In a first series of 3 tests, the subjects were seated upright and their chests were loaded by a 23. 4 kg impactor propelled at 4. 3 m/s in pure frontal, oblique and pure lateral directions. In a second series of 3 tests, the subjects were loaded by the deployment of an unfolded airbag in the same 3 directions. Part B The shoulder complex is rarely exposed to injuries in frontal and oblique frontal collisions, but influence the belt interaction and as such the thorax compression and head kinematics. The purpose of this study was to establish response requirements for the shoulder complex in terms of range-of-motion and stiffness. Six male volunteers were seated in a rigid seat that simulated a car driver’s posture whilst in a special designed test rig. Loads to the shoulders were applied through the arms, by means of brackets fastened to the elbows, loads rearward were applied by means of a strap around the shoulder complex. Torso movement was blocked by two pre-tensed diagonal belts that were routed close to the neck to avoid excessive clavicle interaction. Shoulders were loaded with increasing load from 0 ̶ 200 N/shoulder at 50 N increments. A test series included four load series: shoulders pulled straight forward, forward-upward, upward and rearward. Each volunteer was exposed to three tests. Shoulder positions relative to the spine were obtained from film analysis. Photo markers were mounted on the volunteer’s skin: head, posterior tip of acromion process, chest, T 1 and T 4. The right and left acromion relative to T 1 displacements were used to calculate the shoulder range-of-motion in three directions. Belt loads and seat back loads were recorded. Average resultant volunteers’ acromion relative to T 1 range-of-motion, at the maximum load, was 55 mm for forward loads, 69 mm for forward-upward loads, 73 for mm upward loads and 50 mm for rearward loads. The volunteers provided measurements with reasonable repeatability. The volunteers curved their spines only slightly when shoulder loads were applied. Hence, shoulder complex motion was successfully isolated and results reflect pure shoulder relative to chest motions. The applied loads were lower than those commonly seen in frontal crashes, however the shoulder is highly mobile and its response to loads is largely dependent on muscle characteristics. As such studies using volunteers may be complimentary to tests with post mortem human subjects...|$|R
