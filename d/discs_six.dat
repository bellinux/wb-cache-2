The US release of the entire anime series is a repackaging of all five individually released volumes into a comic book style box set, in homage to the Mach GoGoGo manga. In addition, a bonus disc containing special featurettes and an episode of Speed Racer: The Next Generation is included.

5000|$|Coleman {{was usually}} {{accompanied}} {{by one of}} the following pianists: Kathleen Brennan, Arthur P. Kenna, John Muller, Eileen O’Shea, Edward Lee, and Ed Geoghegan. However, on three 1934 78 <b>discs</b> (<b>six</b> sides) for the Decca label, Coleman was accompanied by tenor guitar player Michael [...] "Whitey" [...] Andrews. Notable Irish flute players Michael Walsh and Tom Morrison also accompanied Coleman on a few of his 1920s recordings. In total, Coleman recorded roughly ninety records. At least ten of Coleman's final recordings were either radio broadcasts, or solo acetates recorded in the years 1937-1944. Few of these historic recordings have been released to date.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{qualitative}} research {{means that the}} personal values of an individual researcher can and do (unwittingly) shape {{the way in which}} they analyse data sets, and the resultant conclusions drawn. However this phenomenon is under-studied in social research: this article seeks to help rectify this. It presents findings from a small research project focused on discourses of class, masculinity, and work among British male comedians from working-class backgrounds, interviewed on the popular BBC Radio 4 radio programme Desert Island <b>Discs.</b> <b>Six</b> different researchers, from varying disciplinary, methodological, and theoretical groundings, as well as from varying personal backgrounds, analysed three interview recordings and transcripts separately. All the researchers wrote up their individual analyses of these interviews and wrote reflexive pieces examining why they thought they approached the data as they did. The researchers then came together as a group to compare and contrast findings and approaches. The results from this study, including the discrepancies and distinctions and final group analysis, are reported alongside a thorough discussion of the project's methodology. We find that the project evidenced how a diverse research team can bring out deeper and richer analyses, and was a refreshing way to try and answer questions of individual and collective positionalit...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to extend our earlier {{observations}} on the changes that occur in the proteoglycans (PGs) of discs subjected to experimental injury to the annulus fibrosus (AF). We employed the alginate bead culture method to examine the metabolism of the dermatan sulphate (DS) containing PGs by cells derived from different regions of ovine discs that had been subjected to experimental annular injury. This was compared with the metabolism of the DS-PGs by cells isolated from equivalent regions of normal sham-operated <b>discs.</b> <b>Six</b> months after induction of the annular lesion, AF cells isolated from the lesion produced significantly higher levels of decorin and biglycan in alginate bead culture than did cells from equivalent zones of the controls. Decorin and biglycan were identified in culture media samples by immunoblotting, using specific antibodies (6 -B- 6, LF- 96), and also by positive identification of their de-glycosylated core proteins. The core protein of the DS-PGs has been shown to inhibit type I/II collagen fibrillogenesis, to negatively regulate the action of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and to diminish cellular proliferation in vitro; events which may be detrimental to tissue repair. The findings are therefore consistent with our previous observation the annular lesions in the avascular inner annulus have no capacity to heal.

40|$|THE EXPRESSION PATTERN OF METHUSELAH AND THE METHUSELAH-LIKE FAMILY IN THIRD INSTAR LARVAL CNS AND IMAGINAL DISCS by DANA HALLAL August 2011 Advisor: Dr. VanBerkum Major: Biological Sciences Degree: Master of Science Methuselah-like (Mth-l) {{proteins}} are G- protein coupled receptors of the Secretin-like receptor family. Their {{founding member}} Methuselah (Mth) was previously {{shown to be}} important in development, control of synaptic efficacy at the neuromuscular junction, and senescence, however little is understood about the Mth-l family. By using in situ hybridization, the expression of the fourteen members of the Mth-l family was characterized in Drosophila third instar larval central nervous system (CNS) and imaginal <b>discs.</b> <b>Six</b> members of the Mth-l family are expressed in larval CNS and imaginal discs. In the CNS, Mth-l 3 is expressed specifically in the abdominal neuromeres of the ventral nerve cord (VNC). While, Mth-l 8 is expressed in the other three sections of the brain; the optic lobes, the central brain, and the VNC with a higher level of expression in its thoracic neuromeres. Mth 2 ̆ 7 s expression pattern in the CNS overlaps with that of Mth-l 8, albeit at a lower intensity. Mth-l 10 C is expressed mildly in the optic lobes, central brain, and the thoracic neuromeres of the VNC. In the eye imaginal disc, Mth, Mth-l 4, 6,and 8 are expressed in cells of the morphogenetic furrow, and Mth-l 8 has additional expression in photoreceptor clusters posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. In the vertex primordium of the eye disc, Mth-l 3 and Mth-l 10 C are expressed near the ocelli, while Mth-l 8 is expressed in the frons. Mth has an intense expression in regions of the vertex primordium close to the antennal disc, and Mth-l 6 and Mth-l 10 A are expressed all over the primordium with little regional specificity. In the wing disc, Mth and Mthl 4 are expressed in cells of the wing margin but at varying intensities. Mth-l 3 is expressed in the wing surface. Mth-l 6, Mth-l 10 A and C posses an overlapping pattern of expression in the wing 2 ̆ 7 s blade and hinge. Furthermore, Mth-l 3 and Mth-l 10 C are expressed in cells of the notum. Finally, Mth, Mth-l 6, and Mth-l 10 have an overlapping pattern of expression in the leg imaginal disc. Mth-l 1, 5, 9, 10 B, 11, 13 and 14 are not expressed in larva but are seen in embryos, while Mth-l 2, 7 and 12 are neither expressed in embryos nor third in star larva of D. melanogaster. Our expression data paves the way for future functional analysis of the Mth-l family...|$|E
