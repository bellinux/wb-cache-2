In this article, we focus on a very specific aspect of after-tax investment analysis-the appropriate, after-tax discount· rate where capitalized costs are depreciated. We discuss this aspect in particular because previous forestry texts, reports, and articles have not been explicit in stating that a tax adjusted discount rate is necessary in such cases...|$|R

A three-stage resistance management program was implemented in Arizona cotton following a severe whitefly resistance crisis in 1995. This program has been highly successful for eight years. Success has been fostered by <b>intensive</b> <b>investments</b> into improved whitefly sampling and treatment decisions, coupled with conservation of natural enemies.

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} to see African countries struggling to address their foreign currency shortage. FDI is presumed {{to play a role in}} addressing this problem. With this in mind, the main objective of the study is to determine the relationship between FDI and trade balance (import and export) of African countries for the period 1980 to 2007. Due to data heterogeneity, non-continuity and because the Hausman test favours it over the Random effect technique, Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) regression method is used. The elasticities of both export and import for FDI stock is + 0. 043266 and + 0. 031987 respectively and are statistically significant. This indicates that the positive impact of FDI on balance of trade through export promotion is more than offset by its negative effect of boosting import as these countries are highly import dependent.

Given resource limitations, firms prioritize the quantum of their investments in R&D and advertising vis-à-vis other investments. We {{examine the relationship between}} firm performance and the intensity of their investments in R&D and advertising over an extended period covering 40 years and 15039 firm-years. Our findings are consistent with the resource-based literature. Specifically, we find that <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> in R&D contributes positively to the one-year stock market performances of manufacturing firms but not for nonmanufacturing firms. We also find that <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> in advertising contributes positively to the one-year stock market performances of nonmanufacturing firms. For the three-year stock market performance, in addition to the findings of the one-year period, we find inconclusive evidence that manufacturing firms benefit from investment in advertising. The interactions of R&D and advertising intensities are insignificant in explaining the stock market performance of the firms except for the three-year horizon for nonmanufacturing firms, which is significantly negative. Consistent with the resource-based literature, this implies that firm performances are diluted when they invest their resources in activities outside their core competence. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The energy industry, {{accounts}} for the largest portion of CO 2 emissions, is facing the issue of compliance with the national clean energy policy. The methodology for evaluating the energy mix policy is crucial because {{of the characteristics of}} lead time embedded with the power generation facilities investment and the uncertainty of future electricity demand. In this paper, a modified binomial model based on sequential compound options, which may account for the lead time and uncertainty as a whole is established, and a numerical example on evaluating the optional strategies and the strategic value of the cleaner energy policy is also presented. It is found that the optimal decision at some nodes in the binomial tree is path dependent, which is different from the standard sequential compound option model with lead time or time lag concept. The proposed modified binomial sequential compound real options model can be generalized and extensively applied to solve the general decision problems that deal with the long lead time of many government policies as well as capital <b>intensive</b> <b>investments.</b> Cleaner energy Lead time Compound real options...|$|R

40|$|In industry, energy {{efficiency}} reduces system cost and emissions to the environment.

However, the usual case is that low-cost measures are implemented while capital intensive measures receive less attention possibly due to, example, inadequate information available to study risks involved. Decisions support tools {{have been identified as}} a means of supporting complex production related investment decision. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate profitability and potential global CO 2 emission reduction of energy conversion investments in a small energy intensive industry by using an optimisation method as a decision support tool. The investments are evaluated using consistent future energy market scenarios with interdependent parameters. An optimisation model is developed with reMIND optimisation tool which is used to optimise the system cost of each scenario. The reduction in system cost and global CO 2 emissions of the new investments and results from sensitivity analysis are evaluated to determine the optimal investment solution. In the report, it is established that optimisation methods provide a structured means of studying the risk involved in capital <b>intensive</b> <b>investments.</b> The optimisation results show that investment in a small-scale steam turbine combined heat and power production is a profitable and robust investment. The net reduction of global CO 2 emission is substantial compared with the reference system. Furthermore, it is shown that biofuel policies alone may not make cost <b>intensive</b> biofuel <b>investments</b> attractive, further reduction in investment cost is required.
