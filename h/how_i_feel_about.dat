Nikolaj Arcel, the film's director and co-writer, said [...] "Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything. That’s <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> [...] He could do anything." [...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it {{with a sort of}} delight, even though he is obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum. He’s someone I’ve been having a lot of fun with." [...] McConaughey described Walter with [...] "I enjoyed approaching my character as if I were the Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cold Case Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Y's (Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross and James Fauntleroy II). At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly how I felt about that relationship and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> it now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{decision}} led to {{the cancellation}} of the album's original leading single [...] "Gotsta Go", a collaboration with rapper Da Brat that she premiered on the MTV Asia Awards 2006 Bangkok on May 6, 2006. Rowland eventually consulted new producers to collaborate on the album, including Mysto & Pizzi, Sean Garrett, Scott Storch, and Atlanta-based Polow da Don, who contributed the single [...] "Like This," [...] a duet with rapper Eve, to the album. In addition, the singer decided to retitle the album. She stated: [...] "I really put my heart and soul into this record and not only am I excited that everyone's going to hear the music, I'm looking forward to people getting to hear the real me. That's the reason I called the album Ms. Kelly. Because the title is all about respect, being an adult and that's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> my life, and my music." ...|$|E

2500|$|As of 2016, Beckham {{had more}} than 40 tattoos. There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in Hindi script because Beckham {{thought it would be}} [...] "tacky" [...] to have it in English. Unfortunately, this was misspelt as the {{equivalent}} of [...] "Vihctoria". In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: [...] "I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> Victoria and the boys. They're part of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barboza has a {{prolific}} and {{wide range of}} both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited {{in public and private}} galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide. [...] He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s – '80s. [...] Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. [...] In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun, he said, [...] "When I do a portrait, I’m doing a photograph of how that person feels to me; <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the person, not how they look. [...] I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. [...] When they do that, I know I have it." [...] Many of his photographs achieve his signature effect through the careful use of lighting and shadows, manipulation of the backdrop, measured adjustments to shutter speeds, composition, and many other techniques and mediums at his command.|$|E
2500|$|Toronto {{continued}} to deploy Ford and Calderón in tandem for the point guard position to good effect. Ford was injured for several games in November and December and the Spaniard stepped in with impressive performances. In three {{games against the}} Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls, Calderón provided 37 assists while committing only three turnovers. 14 games into the season, he was also leading the league in assist-to-turnover ratio with 5.67 to 1, but even so, he said: [...] "But <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the team {{right now is that}} we need T.J. Ford [...]" [...] 35 games into the season, the Spaniard increased the turnover ratio to 6.15 to 1, setting him on course to break an NBA record (he went to end the season as the league-leader with 5.38 to 1). He shot at least 50% on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws, and is sometimes listed {{as a member of the}} NBA's 50–40–90 Club, even though he was sixteen free-throws shy of attaining the [...] number of makes in this category. By mid-season, he was touted as a possibility for making the All-Star reserve team. Even after Ford returned from injury for the final third of the campaign, Calderón was able to keep his place in the starting lineup. Ford had initially agreed to playing backup, but reportedly became frustrated at not being able to start. Calderón eventually asked the coaching staff to play Ford as starter instead, leading to widespread praise from the coaching staff, teammates, and fans. Given that he was going to become a free agent by the end of the campaign, there were even calls for Ford to be traded so that the team could be built around Calderón as point guard. By the end of the regular season, Calderón was fifth in the league for assists per game, and in the 2008 NBA Playoffs, Ford split the playing time with him about equally, with the two players combining for averages of 23.4 points and 13.6 assists per game. However, the Raptors were eliminated by the Orlando Magic in the first round four games to one.|$|E

5000|$|James Poniewozik of TIME {{magazine}} {{said the}} use of voice-over [...] "undercuts one of Mad Men’s greatest strengths, which is its use of irony and understatement to show how characters' words and actions often belie their real thoughts and meaning." [...] Poniewozik also noted: [...] "As we get farther into what we usually think of in pop-culture terms as 'the ’60s,' it gets harder even for a show as brilliant as Mad Men to avoid overfamiliar takes", singling out the scene where Don watches Vietnam War news reports. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said, [...] "'The Summer Man' is an episode I expect I'm {{going to need to}} revisit a time or 20 before <b>I</b> decide <b>how</b> <b>I</b> ultimately <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> some of its stylistic departures from the Mad Men norm", referring to {{the use of}} voice-over and the camera effect of Don's pulling away from the office when he isn't drinking.

3000|$|Explanatory {{factors are}} less {{prominent}} in explaining active acceptability, and attitudinal acceptability is a stronger predictor than the combined explanatory factors. Thus, the most robust explanatory variables (effectiveness) influence active acceptability directly, whereas the remaining factors influence active acceptability indirectly as strong predictors of attitudinal acceptability. Anticipating active acceptability therefore calls for including variables not {{accounted for in}} this study. One can hypothesize that active acceptability is more closely linked to practical consequences for oneself (what will I be required to do and do I want to do this?), while attitudinal acceptability (as measured in this study) is more on a theoretical and abstract level (<b>how</b> do <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> such a measure?). Consequences to self are described as an important theoretical explanatory factor of acceptability in ch. 2, but the survey reported in {{this study did not}} include variables operationalizing this construct. Insecurity related to the specific design and functioning of the application might be of significance, but {{at the time of this}} study it was not possible to provide respondents with additional information about the user interface of the application and to what degree it would require active involvement on their part. Therein, this study has not allowed for a sufficiently sophisticated measure of consequences to self, which has proved particularly essential in estimating measure acceptability.
