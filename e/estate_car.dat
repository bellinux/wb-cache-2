25|$|The Chevette's 1.3 litre {{engine and}} {{relatively}} small bodyshell allowed for good performance. The Chevette had a light steering, clutch and gearchange, {{as well as}} good visibility and was spacious inside. The Chevette's success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars like the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, and saloon models which suited families, <b>estate</b> <b>car</b> for the service fleets and the 'Chevanne', van version for all other utility purposes.|$|E

25|$|Oversized houses {{facilitated}} {{other forms}} of conspicuous consumption, such as an oversized garage for the family's oversized motor vehicles; buying more clothing to fill larger clothes closets; et cetera; hence, conspicuous consumption becomes a self-generating cycle of spending money {{for the sake of}} social prestige. Analogous to the consumer trend for oversized houses is the trend towards buying oversized light-trucks, specifically the off-road sport-utility vehicle type (cf. station wagon and <b>estate</b> <b>car),</b> as a form of psychologically comforting conspicuous consumption, because such big motor-vehicles usually are bought by people who reside in a city, an urban nuclear family.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{version of}} the vehicle was {{intended}} {{to fit into the}} Vauxhall range below the Viva, and was initially presented only in its hatchback version, a style that became very popular during the 1970s. With its Pontiac-inspired 'shovel nose' and inset headlamps, the UK version looked radically different from the Opel Kadett and was accepted by the motoring public as a completely new car; when the saloon, <b>estate</b> <b>car</b> and van variants appeared and the hatchback was added to the Kadett lineup the common lineage became apparent. The Chevette was the first British-built hatchback of this size,; Ford did not respond with a similar product until the following year (their similar-sized offerings all having conventional rear boots).|$|E
25|$|At the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in 1970, TVR hired model Helen Jones to pose nude on the TVR stand, and the {{resulting}} commotion immediately generated more publicity for the company. This advertising technique was used again at the 1971 show, when Helen Jones {{was accompanied by a}} second model, Susan Shaw. The reaction was even greater in 1971, and amid the chaos of the public response, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders threatened to ban TVR from the show. This, of course, drew even more attention to the brand. The 1971 show also marked the appearance of the M Series prototype bodywork and the prototype SM <b>estate</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

25|$|Larger, more {{powerful}} vehicles {{are used by}} Road Policing Units, Armed Response Vehicles {{due to the fact}} that they carry out tasks such as pursuing stolen cars, responding to emergencies in a larger area, or carrying a larger amount equipment than an IRV. It is for that reason that many of the vehicles are in <b>estate</b> <b>car</b> (Station wagon) form. These vehicles tend to be Volvo V70 T5's with a 2.4 litre turbocharged petrol engine or Vauxhall Vectras with 2.8 litre V6, or the new Vauxhall Insignia. As with IRVs, diesel engines are becoming more common such as the BMW 5 Series 3.0 litre diesel which are heavily used by the Metropolitan Police Service. As well as estate cars, 4x4 (SUVs) such as Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery (LR3), BMW X5 or Mercedes M class vehicles are used especially for Motorway patrols. Police officers are required to undergo specialised training before being authorised to drive them.|$|E

The Glas <b>estate</b> <b>cars</b> met with little success in the market place. Despite the rear tailgate, luggage space and rear leg room was severely limited thanks to the car’s short wheelbase.
