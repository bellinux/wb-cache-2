30|$|Prometheus [7] uses a {{solar panel}} to charge a 22 [*]F {{supercapacitor}} {{from which the}} system draws current when there is enough power. The system uses the secondary buffer Li-Polymer battery when the charge of the supercapacitor is lower than a threshold. Also, when the supercapacitor is higher than a given threshold, it charges the battery. However, like Heliomote, the solar panel is directly hardwired to the supercapacitor and does not harvest energy efficiency. All control tasks are run on a MSP 430 MCU. Prometheus TelosB uses a TI MSP 430 with a Chipcon 2240 2.4 [*]Ghz Wireless transceiver. Prometheus power consumption is estimated ranging from 205 [*]μ W at 1 % <b>duty</b> <b>cyle</b> and 20 [*]mA at 100 %.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{method for}} {{programming}} current in dc/dc converters operating in discontinuous conduction mode {{is described in}} this paper. The control variable {{is the product of}} the square of the <b>duty</b> <b>cyle</b> and the switching period, i. e., P, which is directly proportional to input and output currents of a discontinuous-mode converter. A method of controlling P is applied to converters that utilize one switch (or one set of synchronous switches) for achieving two control functions. In particular a single-switch two-output boost converter, in which a continuous-mode converter and a discontinuous-mode converter share one active switch, is studied. In this system, current-mode control is used to regulate the output voltage of the continuous-mode converter and the proposed P control is used to regulate the other discontinuous-mode converter. The result is a generic current-mode controlled two-output converter. Index Terms—Current-mode control, dc/dc converters, discontinuous conduction mode, double converters. I...|$|E
40|$|Network {{calculus}} {{has been}} proposed and customized as framework for worst case analysis in wireless sensor networks in [1]. It has been demonstrated that this so-called sensor network calculus is an effective means to calculate maximum message transfer delays, maximum buffer requirements at the sensor nodes as well as lower bounds on <b>duty</b> <b>cyles.</b> Yet, so far only a single sink was accomodated for in the respective models. In this paper, we describe how sensor network calculus can be enhanced to also cover scenarios involving multiple sinks...|$|R
40|$|During {{experimental}} {{evaluations of}} RPL {{on a network}} with some 20 Zolertia Z 1 motes running Contiki version 2. 6, inconsistent Packet Delivery Ratios (PDR) and message latencies were frequently observed. Replacing ContikiMAC by NullRDC brought consistency, proving that the problem had {{to be found in}} the Radio <b>Duty</b> <b>Cyling</b> (RDC) protocol. Two implementation issues of ContikiMAC were found guilty. The first is the timing of the inter-packet interval related to the interval between two successive Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) probes. The second is the choice of the value of the CCA threshold. These issues will be analyzed in this poster, a satisfactory work-around has been implemented and some to be tested alternatives are proposed. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

40|$|The main {{limitation}} of operating sensor networks autonomously is the finite battery capacity of sensor nodes. Sensors are usually operated at low duty cycle; that is, they remain in active mode for short duration of time, {{in order to}} prolong the network lifetime. However, operating at low duty cycle may result in significant performance degradation in system operation. Hence, in this work, we quantitatively investigate the tradeoff between the <b>duty</b> <b>cyle</b> and network performance. Specifically, we address the design of efficient channel access protocol, by developing a scheduling algorithm based on well known Lyapunov optimization framework. Our proposed policy dynamically schedules transmissions of sensor nodes and their sleep cycles by {{taking into account the}} time-varying channel state information, traffic arrivals, and energy consumptions due to switching between operational modes. We analytically show that our policy is energy optimal {{in the sense that it}} achieves an energy consumption which is arbitrarily close to the global minimum solution. We use simulations to confirm our results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{characterize}} {{the interplay between}} collection and low-power operation by studying the joint impact of the offered load and the Low Power Listening sleep time setting on the duty-cycle distribution in a large-scale sensor network testbed. Collection services {{must be able to}} work on top of a low-power MAC. The Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) [1] has been shown to perform very well on top of Box-MAC [2], the mainstream TinyOS MAC layer that provides Low Power Listening (LPL) [3] support: CTP achieves duty-cycles of 3 % with an Inter-Packet Interval (IPI) of 5 minutes and an LPL sleep interval of 1 s. Another tree-based collection protocol for low-end sensor networks, Arbutus, has been recently shown to compare favorably with CTP in a very extensive analysis [4] that is, however, limited to an always-on CSMA MAC layer. Our ongoing work has a twofold goal: (1) to validate Arbutus in the presence of MAC-layer duty-cycling; (2) to explore the impact of the IPI and the sleep time settings on the duty cycle statistics. The motivation for (1) is clear: without duty-cycling, the radio is a toy. The motivation for (2) lies in the lack of a systematic study about the effect of different sleep time settings {{as a function of the}} offered load. It is well-accepted that nodes should sleep, but how often should they wake up given the extent of their projected load? This work presents our progress toward these two goals.
