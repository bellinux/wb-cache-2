50|$|The {{strategy}} of the Tibetan Communist Party under his leadership during the 1940s was twofold: influence and gain support for his cause amongst progressive Tibetan students, intellectuals {{and members of the}} powerful aristocracy in Central Tibet in order to establish a program of modernization and <b>democratic</b> (i.e. <b>socialist)</b> <b>reform,</b> {{while at the same time}} sustain a guerilla war against the rule of Liu Wenhui, an important warlord who affiliated with the Kuomintang.

5000|$|<b>Democratic</b> <b>socialists</b> see {{capitalism}} as inherently {{incompatible with}} the democratic values of liberty, equality and solidarity; and believe that the issues inherent to capitalism can only be solved by superseding private ownership with some form of social ownership.

50|$|Around 1879, Yung became {{involved}} with the revolutionary group Narodnaya Volya and {{was considered one of}} its founding members at the naval base of Kronstadt. The group initially stood for a mix of <b>democratic</b> and <b>socialist</b> <b>reforms,</b> including a Constituent Assembly (for designing a Constitution); universal suffrage; freedom of speech, press, and assembly; a volunteer military; land reform; and national self-determination. However, it soon mutated into a terrorist organization and was responsible for the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. Yung escaped arrest at the time as he was on the Rogue circumnavigating the globe and only returned to Russia in 1886. He was taken into custody on his return, but was soon released by a military tribunal after he disavowed connections to the organization.|$|R

40|$|The People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China has {{undergone}} extensive systemic {{reform in the}} past decade, spawning an abundance of descriptive literature on these reforms. Similarly, {{a vast amount of}} literature, which together constitutes the decentralized or market socialist model, has been developed in the post World War I period. This dissertation links these descriptive and conceptual contributions and thereby compares the reality of the Chinese reform with the theoretical literature comprising decentralized or market socialism. ^ In the first section of this dissertation, market socialist literature is integrated into a synthesized, operational model of market socialism. Toward this end, the initial chapter examines market socialism as a derivative of capitalist and socialist models. ^ The various models that compose the body of market socialism are introduced in chapter two. A selected review of market socialist literature focuses largely on the classic works of Lange, Taylor, Vanek, Ward, Horvat, Lerner, and Dobb. Through the integration of this market socialist literature, a synthesized, operational model of market socialism is specified in chapter three. Model precepts are divided into institutional and performance characteristics. ^ Chapter four describes the nature of recent <b>socialist</b> <b>reform</b> <b>movements</b> initiated outside the PRC, with emphasis on reformation within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The common attributes of these applied <b>reform</b> <b>movements</b> are examined, with particular emphasis on their common quest for improved economic efficiency. These country studies provide a basis for comparison of Chinese reformation processes. ^ Chapter five provides a brief review of the 1949 - 1978 Chinese economy, followed by an examination of the current state of China 2 ̆ 7 s modern economic reform in chapter six. ^ Chapter seven analyzes the conformity of the Chinese economic reform to the integrated theoretical model developed in chapter three. An evaluative scale is developed to facilitate comparison of the interrelationship between market socialist theory and applied Chinese reforms. In the final chapter, the degree of adherence to the model, generalizations of these findings, and the future direction of economic reform in China are discussed. ...|$|R
5000|$|In April the KSČ Presidium {{adopted the}} Action Programme {{that had been}} drafted by a {{coalition}} headed by Dubček and made up of reformers, moderates, centrists, and conservatives. The program proposed a [...] "new model of socialism," [...] profoundly [...] "democratic" [...] and [...] "national," [...] that is, adapted to Czechoslovak conditions. The National Front and the electoral system were to be democratized, and Czechoslovakia was to be federalized. Freedom of assembly and expression would be guaranteed in constitutional law. The New Economic Model was to be implemented. The Action Program also reaffirmed the Czechoslovak alliance with the Soviet Union and other <b>socialist</b> states. The <b>reform</b> <b>movement,</b> which rejected Stalinism as the road to communism, remained committed to communism as a goal.|$|R
50|$|By 1922, the Finnish society, {{economy and}} {{politics}} {{had begun to}} stabilize. The Progressive (liberal) President Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg had pardoned many Red (socialist) prisoners of the Finnish Civil War, the worst poverty caused by World War I and the Civil War was over, and the Agrarian leader, Kyösti Kallio, was preparing a law (Lex Kallio) that would distribute the excess farmlands of wealthy landowners to the former tenant farmers and other landless rural people. The Social Democrats, led by Väinö Tanner, had committed themselves to the peaceful and <b>democratic</b> pursuit of <b>socialist</b> <b>reform</b> goals. The mostly Agrarian-Progressive minority governments pursued moderate and conciliatory policies. Compulsory schooling of Finnish children was enacted in 1921. The Communists dared to organize the Socialist Workers' Party before the elections, so they preferred open political activity to underground political activity. Shortly before the election campaign officially started, the Finnish Parliament rejected a five-year defence treaty between Finland, Poland, Latvia and Estonia. Enough deputies doubted the ability of Poland and the Baltic countries to defend Finland during a real war.|$|R
