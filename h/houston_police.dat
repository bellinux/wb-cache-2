5|$|Houston Fire Department {{operates}} Station 3 at 3735 West Alabama at Cummins, near River Oaks. The {{fire station}} is in Fire District 28. Station 3 moved {{to its current}} location in 1958. The station underwent a renovation in 2003 and 2004 and re-opened in the northern hemisphere spring of 2004. The community is within the <b>Houston</b> <b>Police</b> Department's Central Patrol Division, headquartered at 61 Riesner. River Oaks {{has one of the}} lowest crime rates in Houston.|$|E
5|$|In testing done by <b>Houston</b> <b>Police</b> Department SWAT, the SS190 {{fired from}} the P90 into bare {{ballistic}} gelatin exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in). In testing in 1999 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the SS190 {{fired from the}} P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin after passing through a Level II Kevlar vest.|$|E
5|$|By 2009, the P90 was {{in service}} with {{military}} and police forces in over 40 countries. In the United States, <b>Houston</b> <b>Police</b> Department was the first local law enforcement agency to adopt the P90, acquiring it for their SWAT team in 1999. In 2003, the Houston SWAT team {{became one of the}} first agencies in the country to use the weapon in a shootout. By 2009, the P90 was in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies in the United States, including the Secret Service and Federal Protective Service. In response, the National Rifle Association added the P90 and PS90 to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law enforcement agencies to compete in the event using either weapon.|$|E

25|$|Since 1992, the Houston City Marshal's {{division}}, <b>Houston</b> Airport <b>Police,</b> and <b>Houston</b> Park <b>Police</b> were {{absorbed into}} HPD. In early 2004, during Mayor Bill White's first term in office, HPD absorbed the Neighborhood Protection division from the City of Houston Planning Department, which was renamed the Neighborhood Protection Corps in 2005. Annise Parker, Mayor White's successor, moved the Neighborhood Protection Corps into the Department of Neighborhoods {{when the new}} city division was established in August 2011 - the NPC was renamed as the Inspections and Public Service division of the Department of Neighborhoods.|$|R

5|$|The Houston riot of 1917 {{disturbed}} Du Bois {{and was a}} major setback {{to efforts}} to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after <b>Houston</b> <b>police</b> arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers {{took to the streets}} of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the <b>Houston</b> <b>Police</b> Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the removal process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.|$|E
5|$|In testing {{conducted}} by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin covered with a Level II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in) when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin, in tests {{conducted by}} <b>Houston</b> <b>Police</b> Department SWAT. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7Ã—28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E

Brown and his staff oversaw investigation of the Atlanta Child Murders case and increased efforts to provide safety in black {{areas of the city}} during the period when murders were committed. A critical element of reform during Brown's tenure was increasing diversity of the police force. By the time Brown resigned to accept the top <b>police</b> job in <b>Houston,</b> Atlanta's <b>police</b> force was 20 percent black.|$|R

Before the annexation, 13 municipal utility districts (MUD) provided those services. After annexation, water and sewer bills increased; most residents had their water bills be double and triple of the bills prior to annexation. In 2006 Mayor of Houston Bill White said that the city had to cover the debts of the MUDs, so it increased the water and sewer rates.|$|R

5000|$|While imprisoned, Hernandez studied Mexican-American history, {{the prison}} system, and revolutionary {{political}} theory, along with local laws usable {{in his and}} others' defense. Hernandez fought against institutional corruption he saw through constitutional and civil rights lawsuits, hunger strikes, work stoppages and yard takeovers, {{and was one of}} the [...] "seven other prisoners" [...] whose civil suits were merged into what later became the landmark Estelle v Ruiz victory for prison reform against the Texas Department of Corrections. While incarcerated in Huntsville, TX, he met Ricardo Adalpe Guerra, a Mexican national who had been convicted of killing a <b>Houston</b> area <b>police</b> officer, at the time on death row in the cell next to Alvaro. He spent much of his sentence in solitary confinement (allegedly due to retaliation from the prison), before being cleared and freed in 1991, due in part to investigative reporting by former Houston Post staffer Paul Harasim.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office in <b>Houston,</b> Hurtt {{required}} <b>police</b> to cover up tattoos with long sleeves, if needed. Additionally, he required all facial hair to be removed, citing that it would prevent gas masks to be used effectively. This resulted {{in a group of}} African American officers filing a lawsuit claiming that they have skin conditions called Pseudofolliculitis barbae or Acne keloidalis nuchae that makes it painful to shave. The city supported Chief Hurtt's new policy and approved $150,000 for legal defense against the suit. [...] The suit was eventually tossed out.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cities in}} the United States have mounted units, with New York {{having one of the}} largest with 79 {{officers}} and 60 horses, but numerous mounted units in cities around the United States were disbanded or downsized in the 2010s. For example, units in Boston and San Diego were disbanded by 2011, while New York Cityâ€™s mounted unit was reduced considerably over the last decade with 79 police officers and 60 horses in 2011 - down from the 130 officers and 125 horses it had before the downsizing. Philadelphia's mounted police unit was disbanded in 2004, but reinstated in 2011 with four horses from the disbanding unit of Newark, New Jersey. The <b>Houston,</b> Texas <b>Police</b> Department's Mounted Patrol Unit, started in 1983 and now consisting of 1 lieutenant, 4 sergeants and 24 officers, has become increasingly well known due to the decision to, by the middle of 2008, remove the shoes of all its 38 mounted horses and embrace the concept of naturalizing their horses' diet and care in addition to riding them barefoot.|$|R
