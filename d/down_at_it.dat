500|$|Lefebvre died on 25 March 1991 {{at the age}} of 85 {{from cancer}} in Martigny, Switzerland, less than three years after being excommunicated for {{carrying}} out the episcopal consecrations. Eight days later he was buried in the crypt at the society's international seminary in Écône, Switzerland. Archbishop Edoardo Rovida, Apostolic Nuncio to Switzerland, and Bishop Henri Schwery of Sion, the local diocese, came and prayed at the body of the dead prelate. Later that year, on 18 September 1991, Cardinal Silvio Oddi, who had been Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy from 1979 to 1986, visited Lefebvre's tomb, knelt <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and prayed, afterwards saying aloud: [...] "Merci, Monseigneur". Thereafter Cardinal Oddi said he held Lefebvre to have been [...] "a holy man" [...] and suggested that the Society of St Pius X could be granted a personal prelature by the Holy See like that of Opus Dei. In January 1992, the then-superior general of the society, Fr. Franz Schmidberger, rejected this hypothetical offer by an unpublished private letter to the Holy See. The letter's content was described by Bishop Richard Williamson (subsequently expelled from the SSPX) as basically saying that, [...] "as long as Rome remains Conciliar, a fruitful and open collaboration between the two [...] does not seem possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|He said nothing, {{but took}} up his hat, and looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with angry determination. Marian, too uneasy to endure silence, added: ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{changing}} his action even then, he opened {{and shut the}} palms of his hands as he warmed them, and looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|He gazed rather arrogantly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me. <b>It</b> always irritated me to {{be looked}} <b>down</b> <b>at</b> that way.|$|R
60|$|Stewart gave {{a slight}} start. His manner had {{a semblance of}} the old, cool audacity. As he looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her <b>it</b> subtly changed.|$|R
50|$|If the beak is not eroded or worn <b>down</b> <b>at</b> all, <b>it</b> {{may still}} be capped with the prodissoconch, which is the larval shell of the animal.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a mermaid," [...] {{said the}} mate, who was {{inclined}} to be superstitious, as he peered doubtfully <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Let it go, Joe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean the}} damp sand," [...] said Grace, {{beginning}} {{to pull over}} some sewing which she had in her lap, and looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|The man was {{motionless}} for a moment, {{staring at}} the blood on his master's pyjamas. Dominey glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and turned the dressing-gown up to his throat.|$|E
60|$|She wrote <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> He looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with uplifted eyebrows, {{but made}} no remark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yield you!" [...] cried a voice. By way of {{answer the}} bowstring twanged, and an arrow sped home to its {{feathers}} through {{the throat of}} the speaker, so that he went <b>down,</b> grabbing <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and spoke no more for ever.|$|R
50|$|The main temple {{opens to}} devotees early at 5 a.m. and closes <b>down</b> <b>at</b> 10 pm. <b>It,</b> however, remains closed between 12 noon to 3 pm.|$|R
60|$|The {{red edge}} of his Baedeker still {{projected}} from the lawyer's pocket, for {{it had not been}} worth their captor's while to take it. He glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] Bessie looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> first {{on one side}} and then on the other, as a woman always does when her dress is spoken of.|$|E
60|$|Tessa {{was only}} more frightened, {{understanding}} nothing. Her first conjecture settled on her basket of sweets. They wanted that, these alarming angels. Oh dear, dear! She looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|As was but natural, {{the youth}} below turned quickly, {{thinking}} some {{friend of the}} broker's had appeared. The moment Tom turned, Pelter hurled something <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>It</b> was an old wooden footstool, and it struck the youth squarely on the head. Down went poor Tom in the grass, senseless.|$|R
50|$|There is no summit {{cross on}} the Pirchkogel, only a signal post. The cross {{is a little}} lower <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Marlstein, where <b>it</b> may {{be seen from the}} west and north.|$|R
6000|$|ST. HERBERT [He {{comes to}} him, stands looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him.] Did <b>it</b> never occur to you, {{when you were}} advocating equal {{political}} rights for women, that awkward situations might arise? ...|$|R
60|$|Bartley {{released}} himself, {{and went}} to the new crib, in which the baby lay, and with {{his hands in his pockets}} stood looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with a curious smile.|$|E
60|$|Without {{taking his}} eyes from her face, he pulled the knife out of its sheath--a short, broad, cruel {{double-edged}} blade with a bone handle--and only then looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Engleton {{came to the}} table, {{and drew}} a card at random from the pack. Forrest's eyes seemed to narrow a little as he looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Engleton had drawn another ace.|$|E
60|$|Whitefoot {{climbed up}} to the old nest of Melody the Wood Thrush {{over the edge of}} which little Mrs. Whitefoot was looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>It</b> took Whitefoot hardly a moment to get up there, for the nest was only a few feet above the ground in a young tree, and you know Whitefoot is a very good climber.|$|R
6000|$|... "To Elsie!" [...] she repeated, {{and drank}} very nearly {{the whole of}} its contents. Then she set the glass <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was finally}} aware of some one {{standing}} near and looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>It</b> {{was the second}} mate, who supported himself in a conversational posture by the hand which he stretched to the shrouds above their heads. [...] "Are you a good sailor, Mr. Staniford?" [...] he inquired. He and Staniford were friends in their way, and had talked together before this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{play some}} of those little melodies of Mozart's which you used to like so much?" [...] she asked, opening the music nervously, and looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> while she spoke.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} room and, opening a desk, sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{for a minute or}} two. Then he came back and laid a strip of paper {{on the table in front}} of Florence.|$|E
60|$|He {{dragged the}} body {{to the edge of}} the hole and toppled it in. It struck the bottom with a dull crash, on its side, the face twisted up to the light. The miner peered <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Alarmed, Reinhart {{hurried out}} of his office and down the corridor. He found Kaplan {{standing}} in front of the SRB machines. [...] "What's the story?" [...] Reinhart demanded. He glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the reading. <b>It</b> was unchanged.|$|R
60|$|The bear came thundering on, {{and reached}} the tree a few seconds later. It made several {{abortive}} efforts to ascend, and then, sitting <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the foot, <b>it</b> looked up, grinning and growling horribly in disappointed rage.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{will not}} be a chance for us now for the next hour and a half," [...] said Mr. Supplehouse, groaning. Harold Smith cast one eye <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, but <b>it</b> {{immediately}} flew back to the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|He had {{had another}} pinch of snuff in his hand, but had {{gradually}} {{let it drop}} from between his fingers to the floor; where he now smoothed it out with his foot, looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> the while.|$|E
60|$|I {{bought a}} special edition, which a newsboy was brandishing in our faces, and, turning down the leading article, {{passed it on}} to my father. He glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and then looked up at me in blank amazement.|$|E
60|$|Each took {{a side of}} {{the fixed}} table; {{it was the first}} time they had sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> together; but now all sense of incongruity, all memory of differences, was quite swept away by the {{presence}} of the common ruin.|$|E
6000|$|... “Not in the least!” said Appleby. “Don’t make excuses, Tony. It isn’t {{everybody}} {{who would have}} walked home with me, {{and it was very}} good of you to persuade Godfrey Palliser to have me <b>down</b> <b>at</b> all. <b>It</b> is the only taste I get of this kind of thing—one fortnight in the year, you see—and I’m considerably fonder of it than is good for me.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Fly ball, deep center field, Herrera back, on the track, and he, did he {{make the}} catch? He fell <b>down</b> <b>at</b> he's got <b>it!</b> He's got it! Odubel Herrera has got it and Cole Hamels has a no-hitter! Cole Hamels' no-hitter.|$|R
60|$|This {{information}} {{was so far}} recognised by Mr. Howard as correct, that he paid Mr. Cann five sovereigns <b>down</b> for <b>it</b> <b>at</b> once.|$|R
