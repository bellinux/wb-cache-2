40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which feminist knowledge/s of sexual violence have been produced and reproduced in the local field of sexual assault, in New South Wales, Australia. Internationally, specialist sexual assault services are a relatively recent phenomenon, appearing on the landscape only thirty years ago. In the Australian literature, their appearance is consistently linked to feminist activism and theorising. However, the precise contour of the relationship between feminist knowledge/s and sexual assault services and practices has yet to be established. Via a Foucauldian derived methodological approach, the study excavates the knowledge used in, and produced through and about, sexual assault services in NSW. The library of documents assembled includes texts produced from interviews conducted with practitioners from selected sexual assault services across NSW and documents produced by services and from within the sector, such as brochures, website material, manuals, annual reports, publications and governance documents, such as the policy and procedure manuals. Representations within the assembled documents and texts of the routine practices of sexual assault workers and routine conventions in the regulatory <b>apparatus</b> <b>illuminate</b> the shape and parameters of the contemporary sexual assault service. The picture that emerges is one in which the tight, almost naturalised link between sexual assault and feminist knowledge/practices is being refracted through the lens of ‘trauma’. Sexual assault is represented as about gendered power and violence: as an act that, although experienced by individuals, is located within a structural system of gender inequality. Simultaneously sexual assault is represented as an ontological assault, as an assault on ‘the self’, on the victim’s identity. The significance of this construction is made visible in the interview texts through the concept of psychological trauma, a term that appears frequently in the library of documents. I examine how this concept is deployed, the types of subjects it produces and {{the ways in which}} it operates in the field. This thesis contributes to international feminist scholarship on the uptake of trauma discourses in the field of sexual violence, by demonstrating how sexual assault practitioners have produced new knowledge/practices and how these are shaped by being situated in specific institutional sites. In addition, it appears that trauma and feminist discourses are being made compatible in this local field. The thesis also underlines the importance of interrogating knowledge practices and the significance of Foucauldian derived analytic strategies for de-familiarising fields of feminist concern.

50|$|Cape San Juan Light (Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan) is a {{historic}} lighthouse located on the northeastern part of the highest point of Cape San Juan in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. The lighthouse was constructed in 1880 and was officially lit on May 2, 1882. The original <b>illuminating</b> <b>apparatus,</b> not changed until after 1898, had an 18 mi range and displayed a fixed white light which every three minutes flashed red.The lighthouse owned by the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust {{is part of the}} Las Cabezas de San Juan natural reserve.

Despite its small size, the reserve shelters seven different ecological systems, including beaches, lagoons, dry forest, coral reefs and mangroves.|$|E
5000|$|On March 3, 1873, Congress {{made the}} first of three {{appropriations}} for a new lighthouse on Morris Island. $60,000 was granted on that date for [...] "commencing the rebuilding of a first-order seacoast light on Morris Island destroyed during the war." [...] Two other appropriations totaling $90,000 in 1874 and 1875 were for completing the work. The new structure was to be at or near the same spot as the old tower, 150 ft high and built of brick, with a first-order flashing light. Foundation piles were driven and the space between them filled with concrete 8 ft thick. The new tower, when completed in 1876, was 161 ft in height and the cost was $149,993.50. A first-order Fresnel lens was installed. In 1884 the <b>illuminating</b> <b>apparatus</b> was changed for the use of mineral oil instead of lard oil.|$|E

5000|$|The light station {{sustained}} {{serious damage}} {{at the hands}} of Union troops aboard the USS Kingfisher that landed in 1862 during the Civil War. The keeper’s dwelling was completely destroyed and the door frames and sashes of the tower were torn or burnt out. Repairs were made, a new <b>illuminating</b> <b>apparatus</b> was provided, and the light was re-exhibited on July 23, 1865. In 1869 the beach in front of the lighthouse was reported to be washing away and would need protection against encroachments of the sea during heavy storms. In 1877 Congress appropriated $2,000 for protecting the site after the Lighthouse Board had reported 2 years earlier [...] "The base of the tower is very nearly at the same level as the sea, which is but little more than 150 feet distant, the shore being of shifting sand. In a violent hurricane, it is feared, the tower may be undermined." [...] The Board had asked for $5,000 to protect the site and reported in 1879 that, as it was found [...] "impracticable to build a jetty for $2,000 that can protect the site from the encroachment of the sea, no further action has been taken in the matter." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lighthouse's {{foundations}} and the seawall {{in front of}} it was damaged by a severe storm in September 1889. The storm threatened the light enough that the illumination apparatus was removed, and the lighthouse was temporary abandoned. In 1899, a kitchen addition was added to the structure, and the next year, a concrete seawall was constructed. The last major improvement was the replacement of the oil wick lamp in the <b>illuminating</b> <b>apparatus</b> by an incandescent oil vapor lamp. On November 21, 1923, a fire was started when the keeper's dog knocked over a kerosene lantern, destroying part of the roof and the kitchen. A temporary roof patch was torn of in a storm in March 1924, and the structure was decommissioned. The structure was moved to 31st Street and Landis Avenue later that year, refurbished, and sold as a private residence. It was later moved to 3414 Landis. The original lighthouse was replaced by a 45 ft steel skeleton tower on the beach, which flashed red every six seconds, and was visible approximately 12 mi. The automated tower was damaged in the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, and later dismantled. The original site of the light station is on the present 31st Street beach. Though usually buried under sand, parts of the lighthouse's foundations are occasionally uncovered after a large storm.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1799, Congress chose not to appoint Owen Hillman as Keeper. Instead, Congress chose Ebenezer Skiff as the island's first Principal Keeper. Skiff became the first white man of European descent {{to live in the}} town of Gay Head. On 18 November 1799, Ebenezer Skiff ignited the spider lamp inside the tower's {{lighting}} room, officially illuminating the Gay Head Light {{for the first time as}} an aide to navigation. The light was projected from lamp wicks fueled by sperm whale oil. Spider lamps were the principal source of light in U.S. lighthouses in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They consisted of a pan of oil with a wick system that was first used in Boston Light in 1790. Spider lamps were known to produce fumes that burned the Keeper's eyes and obscured the light's glass with an oily smudge. The first Gay Head Light [...] "...was a white flash, was produced by fourteen lamps burning sperm oil, and it is part of tradition of the place that there was quite as much smoke as flame resulting from the combustion of this illuminant. The Keeper was often obliged to wear a veil while in the tower, and the cleansing of the smudge on the glass lantern was no small part of his job." [...] Gay Head Light was one of several early U. S. lighthouses to use a so-called [...] "Revolving Illuminating Apparatus" [...] to generate a Flashing White Light signal. The Revolving <b>Illuminating</b> <b>Apparatus</b> consisted of sperm whale oil lamps placed on circular service tables attached to a Pedestal rotated by wooden clockwork. According to complaint by the light's first Keeper, Ebenezer Skiff, during cold or damp weather, the wooden clockwork became swollen, which required that the Keeper turn the rotating lighting mechanism by hand. At times, Keeper Skiff hired local Aquinnah Indians at $1.00 per day to help maintain and rotate the Light. Ebenezer Skiff also became involved with teaching Gay Head Wampanoag children.|$|E
