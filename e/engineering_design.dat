5|$|The Murrah Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} a neural information retrieval system (NIRS), now in production within the Boeing Company, {{which has been}} developed for the identification and retrieval of <b>engineering</b> <b>designs.</b> Two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of <b>engineering</b> <b>designs</b> are input to adaptive resonance theory (ART- 1) neural networks to produce clusters of similar parts. The trained networks are then used to recall an appropriate cluster when queried with a new part design. This application is of great practical value to industry because it aids in the identification, retrieval, and reuse of <b>engineering</b> <b>designs,</b> potentially saving large amounts of nonrecurring costs. In this paper, we review the application, the neural architectures and algorithms, and then give the current status and the lessons learned in developing a neural-network system for production use in industry...|$|R
