40|$|The Swedish {{environmental}} objective to have sustainable forests by 2020 {{will not be}} achieved with current measures taken by the forestry sector. One {{problem is that the}} mandatory environmental considerations are not taken to a satisfactory degree in regeneration felling sites. The ones performing regeneration felling and the taking or not taking of environmental considerations are the <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop understanding about <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators’ practice, how it hinders and facilitates the taking of environmental considerations in regeneration felling from the operators’ own descriptions of their work situation, in answering the questions: What characterizes <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators practice and their task of taking environmental considerations? What type of knowledge and skills are needed in order to take considerations to the environment? How can the development of <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators’ skills and possibilities of taking environmental considerations be understood? Through a theoretical reading of transcripts from seven semi-structured interviews with <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators, answers to these questions are given on the assumption, based on a socio-cultural perspective on practice and practical knowledge, that knowledge, intentions, aims, norms, routines and the meaning given to objects and situations are situated and developed in social interactions. The conditions for the taking of environmental considerations during timber harvesting are also assumed to be limited to the workings and properties inherent to the capitalistic system. This study shows that the lack of considerations to environmental values in regeneration sites are not due to <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators' lack of competence or that the <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators have unfavorable attitudes towards environmental preservation. But during regeneration felling operators need to balance the task of taking environmental considerations with other tasks. It is operators’ practical knowledge of recognizing environmental values and their skills of operating harvesting <b>machines</b> in varying <b>forest</b> landscapes that enables and guides the taking of environmental considerations. But considerations to environmental values are limited by the frames of harvesting practices and by the reality of timber production in a global capitalistic system. This study shows that the development of <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> operators’ knowledge and skills on how to consider environmental values, are better facilitated when operators’ actions are acknowledged, questioned and analyzed in dialogue between operators, and managers of timber harvesting and environmental consideration with respect and sensibility for the others expertise and identity...|$|R

40|$|Achieving a {{low noise}} level is of great {{interest}} to the <b>forest</b> <b>machine</b> industry. Traditionally this is obtained by using passive noise reduction, i. e. by using materials for sound isolation and sound absorption. Especially designs to attenuate low frequency noise tend to be bulky and impractical from an installation point of view. An alternative solution to the problem is to use active noise control (ANC). The basic principle of ANC is to generate an anti-noise signal designed to destructively interfere with the unwanted noise. In this thesis two algorithms (Feedback FxLMS and Feedforward FxLMS) are implemented and evaluated for use in the ANC-system. The ANC-system is tuned to the speciﬁc environment in the driver’s cabin of a Komatsu <b>forest</b> <b>machine.</b> The algorithms are ﬁrst tested in a simulated environment and then in real-time inside a <b>forest</b> <b>machine.</b> Simulations are made both in Matlab and in C using both generated signals and recorded signals. The C code is implemented on the Analog Devices Blackﬁn DSP card BF 526. The result showed a signiﬁcantly reduction of the sound pressure level (SPL) in the driver’s cabin.

5000|$|Sakari Pinomäki's first company, PIKA <b>Forest</b> <b>Machines,</b> is {{credited}} with designing the first self-propelled tree length timber processor, the PIKA Model 60, in 1968, and the first fully mobile timber [...] "harvester", the PIKA Model 75, in 1974. These machines differed significantly from other [...] "retro-fitted" [...] forestry machines in that they were designed from inception to be timber harvesting and processing equipment, and were not conventional farming or earth moving equipment with additional apparatus welded onto them to allow timber processing work to be possible. Pinomäki coined the term [...] "harvester" [...] to describe his Model 75 machine, which differs from a tree length processor in that a harvester grips, fells, de-limbs and sections the tree on site, while a processor simply de-limbs a tree that has been felled by chain saws and dragged to the delimbing equipment. His designs and innovations have been subsequently copied by at least five other major manufacturers of heavy timber equipment, including Timberjack, Valmet and Ponsse, and were instrumental in developing the [...] "Scandinavian" [...] system of timber harvesting, which is far more sustainable and nature conserving than the methods employed up till the mid-20th century. The two machine harvester-forwarder system consequently became the worldwide standard for sustainable forestry.|$|E

A class of such vehicles that are believed to have considerable commercial potential is autonomous wood shuttles (forwarders). The degree of automation is influenced by increased productivity, the machine operator as a bottle-neck, cost reduction, and environmental aspects. Technical principles that can be applied to autonomous forest vehicles are satellite navigation, laser odometry, wheel odometry, laser scanner and radar.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{developments in}} large-scale logging technology in Sweden from 1985 to 2010. Data {{were collected from}} manufacturers' sales material and from large forest enterprises. On average, forwarders manufactured in 2010 had 27 – 33 % higher boom lifting torque than those manufactured in 1985 – 1989. The inflation-adjusted prices of medium-sized single-grip harvesters remained the same, but prices of forwarders increased by 30 – 50 % in this period. The mechanical availability of various classes of machinery used increased from 70 – 80 % to 85 – 88 % between 1985 and 2008. The harvesting costs of thinning decreased between 1990 and 1998, while those of final fellings decreased from 1985 to 2006. However, in 2008 costs of both thinning and final felling tended to increase. The productivity of logging by the Swedish forest enterprise SCA increased almost three-fold in the period 1985 – 2010. However, since 2003 there have been signs of declining productivity. Currently, there is considerable interest in harvesting forest biomass for energy production.

40|$|Accurate {{monitoring}} of sedentary behaviour {{and physical activity}} is key to investigate their exact role in healthy ageing. To date, accelerometers using cut-off point models are most preferred for this, however, machine learning seems a highly promising future alternative. Hence, the current study compared between cut-off point and machine learning algorithms, for optimal quantification of sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in the elderly. Thus, in a heterogeneous sample of forty participants (aged ≥ 60 years, 50 % female) energy expenditure during laboratory-based activities (ranging from sedentary behaviour through to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) was estimated by indirect calorimetry, whilst wearing triaxial thigh-mounted accelerometers. Three cut-off point algorithms and a Random <b>Forest</b> <b>machine</b> learning model were developed and cross-validated using the collected data. Detailed analyses were performed to check algorithm robustness, and examine and benchmark both overall and participant-specific balanced accuracies. This revealed that the four models can at least be used to confidently monitor sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Nevertheless, the machine learning algorithm outperformed the cut-off point models by being robust for all individual's physiological and non-physiological characteristics and showing more performance of an acceptable level over {{the whole range of}} physical activity intensities. Therefore, we propose that Random <b>Forest</b> <b>machine</b> learning may be optimal for objective assessment of sedentary behaviour and physical activity in older adults using thigh-mounted triaxial accelerometry...|$|R
