25|$|The {{origins of}} the name Frensham come from 'Frena's ham'. Frena {{was the name of}} either a Danish Earl who was killed in the battle of Ashdown in the year 871, or of a Saxon who was driven south from Northumberland by the Danes in 993. The second part 'ham' means 'settlement', and is also from where we <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'home', so Frensham is 'Frena's settlement'.|$|E
500|$|General William Westmoreland, {{who was the}} U.S. Army {{commander}} in South Vietnam, Taylor, and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington, D.C. urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam. Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day, saying, [...] "Hanoi will <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> that, despite our present tribulations, there is still bite in the tiger they call paper, and the U.S. stock {{in this part of}} the world will take sharp rise. Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate." [...] Taylor recommended that the US take unilateral action, citing the animosity between himself and Khanh's junta.|$|E

500|$|Novak was {{inspired}} to write the episode after attending an NBC sexual harassment seminar that {{the cast and crew}} had to attend before the series began. Many jokes and personal experiences involving sexual harassment were added into the script. This episode aired with a warning that it contained adult content and subject matter, which is rare for a network comedy. Novak explained that he had to fight NBC to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "boner" [...] on the air. One station refused to air the episode due to the language. [...] "Sexual Harassment" [...] received moderately positive reviews from television critics. The episode was viewed by 7.13 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E
500|$|His father's last {{move was}} in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong {{attended}} Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed later in August; all {{before he had}} a driver's license. Armstrong {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: [...] "I'd like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo11 would like to send them best wishes". [...] Houston replied: [...] "Thank you, Apollo11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> through the news. Certainly appreciate that." [...] Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.|$|E

500|$|When {{deciding}} what car Packer would own, writer B. J. Novak {{wanted to use}} a Mustang, but none were available. Producer Kent Zbornak decided to get Packer a red Chevrolet Corvette, which Novak now admits is [...] "even better". This episode aired with a warning that it contained adult content and subject matter, which is rare for a network comedy. Novak explained {{that he had to}} fight NBC to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "boner" [...] on the air because the replacement—"schwing"—didn't have, according to Novak, [...] "the same redemption for Michael at the end." [...] The disclaimer was a compromise. A station in Kentucky nevertheless refused to air this episode. Pam's mother was played by Shannon Cochran in this episode of the series, in the first appearance of the character {{at this point in the}} show. Cochran was unable to return to play the character for the season six episode [...] "Niagara", due to scheduling conflicts with a year-long theater contract, and was thus replaced by Linda Purl.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E
2500|$|In the 9th century, Islamic mathematicians were {{familiar}} with negative numbers from the works of Indian mathematicians, but the recognition and use of negative numbers during this period remained timid. Al-Khwarizmi in his Al-jabr wa'l-muqabala (from which we <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "algebra") did not use negative numbers or negative coefficients. But within fifty years, Abu Kamil illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication , and al-Karaji wrote in his al-Fakhrī that [...] "negative quantities must be counted as terms". In the 10th century, Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī considered debts as negative numbers in A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen.|$|E

Later, he reported back {{that he had been}} [...] "toying with the idea", and was [...] "willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience." [...] She also said that the imprint is planned to launch with two as-yet undetermined books.

[...] The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango came downstairs and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, [...] "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black." ...|$|E

In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes [...] "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes [...] "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." [...] Foye asked his spokesman to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> out. Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark.
