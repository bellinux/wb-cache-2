500|$|CPC general {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng as [...] "paramount leader" [...] in the 1990s, and continued {{most of his}} policies. As part of Jiang Zemin's nominal legacy, the CPC ratified the Three Represents for the 2003 revision of the party's constitution, as a [...] "guiding ideology" [...] to encourage the party to represent [...] "advanced productive forces, the progressive course of China's culture, and the <b>fundamental</b> <b>interests</b> of the people." [...] The theory legitimized the entry of private business owners and bourgeois elements into the party. Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin's successor as paramount leader, took office in 2002. Unlike Mao, Deng and Jiang Zemin, Hu laid emphasis on collective leadership and opposed one-man dominance of the political system. The insistence on focusing on economic growth led {{to a wide range}} of serious social problems. To address these, Hu introduced two main ideological concepts: the Scientific Outlook on Development and Harmonious Socialist Society. Hu resigned from his post as CPC {{general secretary}} and Chairman of the CMC at the 18th National Congress held in 2012, and was succeeded in both posts by Xi Jinping.|$|E

2500|$|The term ″Three Represents″ {{was first}} used in 2000 by Jiang Zemin in a trip to Guangdong province. From then until its {{inclusion}} in the party's constitution at the 16th National Congress, the Three Represents became a constant theme for Jiang Zemin. In his speech at {{the anniversary of the}} founding of the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin said that [...] "we [...] must always represent the development trend of China's advanced productive forces, the orientation of China's advanced culture, and the <b>fundamental</b> <b>interests</b> of {{the overwhelming majority of the}} people in China." [...] By this time, Jiang and the CPC had reached the conclusion that attaining the communist mode of production, as formulated by earlier communists, was more complex than had been realized, and that it was useless to try to force a change in the mode of production, as it had to develop naturally, by following the economic laws of history. While segments within the CPC criticized the Three Represents as being un-Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values, supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The theory is most notable for allowing capitalists, officially referred to as the [...] "new social strata", to join the party on the grounds that they engaged in [...] "honest labor and work" [...] and through their labour contributed [...] "to build socialism with Chinese characteristics."

2500|$|On 15 July 1971, 17 UN members, led by Albania, {{requested}} that {{a question of}} the [...] "Restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations" [...] be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly. In an explanatory memorandum accompanying their request, the 17 UN members observed that for years they had protested against the hostile and discriminatory policy followed by several governments with regard to the lawful government of China, the sole genuine representative of the Chinese people. The existence of the People's Republic of China, they declared, was a reality which could not be changed to suit the myth of a so-called [...] "Republic of China" [...] fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory. In the view of the 17 UN members the unlawful authorities installed in the island of Taiwan claiming to represent China, remained there only because of the permanent presence of United States armed forces. No important international problems, they added, could be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. It was in the <b>fundamental</b> <b>interests,</b> they concluded, of the United Nations to restore promptly to the People's Republic of China its seat in the organization thus putting an end to a grave injustice and dangerous situation which had been perpetuated in order to fulfill a policy that had been increasingly repudiated. This meant the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime from the seat which it unlawfully holds in the United Nations.|$|E
