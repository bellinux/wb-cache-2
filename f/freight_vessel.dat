25|$|The Tory was {{the first}} of three New Zealand Company {{surveyor}} ships sent off in haste to prepare for settlers in New Zealand. In August the Cuba, with a surveyors' team headed by Captain William Mein Smith, R.A., set sail, and a month later—still with no word on the success of the Tory and Cuba—on 15 September 1839 it was followed from Gravesend, London, by the Oriental, the first of five 500-ton immigrant ships hired by the company. Following the Oriental were the Aurora, Adelaide, Duke of Roxburgh and Bengal Merchant, plus a <b>freight</b> <b>vessel,</b> the Glenbervie, which all sailed with instructions to rendezvous on 10 January 1840 at Port Hardy on D'Urville Island where they would be told of their final destination. It was expected that by that time William Wakefield would have bought land for the first settlement and had it surveyed, and also inspected the company's land claims at Kaipara and Hokianga.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{significant}} reductions of the NOx (Nitrogen Oxides) and PM (Particulate Matter) emissions from road transport have been observed, whereas current in-service <b>freight</b> <b>vessels</b> are still often equipped with diesel engines free of emission control. Despite {{the need for}} real-world emission data, very few measurements on board <b>freight</b> waterways <b>vessels</b> {{have been carried out}} so far, due to both test difficulties and the poor accessibility and availability of commercial vessels. Indeed, only a few hours of emission monitoring could be performed from measurements conducted on-board two <b>freight</b> <b>vessels</b> and a passenger boat, in the frame of a recent project. However, steady-state operating conditions were observed most of the time and reliable functions could be set up to simply derive pollutant emissions from engine speed, respectively for each pollutant (CO 2, NOx, PM and CO) and for each boat. Results in g/kWh are analysed and confronted with standards. Significant differences are observed between tested vessels, in terms of emissions factors rated per transport unit (g/tonne. km). These factors from current waterways freighters are set against those from heavy-duty trucks...|$|R

50|$|Two {{waterways}} via {{the rivers}} and canals Havel and Mittellandkanal were open for inland navigation, but only <b>freight</b> <b>vessels</b> were allowed to cross from West Berlin into East German waters. The Havel crossed at the East German border in Nedlitz (a part of Potsdam-Bornstedt), continuing through the Elbe-Havel Canal and then either taking the Elbe northwestwards crossing the border again at Cumlosen (E)/Schnackenburg (W) or westwards following the Mittellandkanal to Buchhorst (Oebisfelde) (E)/Rühen (W). Western <b>freight</b> <b>vessels</b> could stop only at dedicated service areas, because the East German government wanted to prevent any East Germans from boarding them. Through these waterways, West Berlin {{was linked to the}} western European inland navigation network, connecting to seaports like Hamburg and Rotterdam, as well as to industrial areas such as the Ruhr Area, Mannheim, Basel, Belgium, and eastern France.|$|R
2500|$|The jekt {{was used}} as a <b>freight</b> <b>vessel</b> along the Norwegian coast from around the 17th century and until the early 20th century, when the use {{steadily}} declined. The vessel type was built from Hardanger in the south to Beiarn in the north. At most around 200 jekts sailed from Northern Norway to Bergen with stockfish. The jekt had a distinct appearance and was a sturdy freighter with a large capacity for cargo. Under good conditions the voyage could go fast, there are stories about voyages from Lofoten to Bergen in around three days, which makes a speed around 8 knots. It is possible that the vessel type is based on earlier Norwegian vessels, but that foreign vessels also have been an inspiration.
