40|$|Insects {{are highly}} valued as food in many {{cultures}} but {{have only recently}} gained interest in the West as a sustainable alternative to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} meat production. Despite the growing consumer interest in insect consumption, there is still a great disparity between curious trying and actual acceptance. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how the product preparation, familiarity and individual traits (e. g. food neophobia) influence the consumer acceptance of insects as food. Dutch consumers (n = 976) evaluated 8 mealworm product images on 4 acceptability measures (product appropriateness, expected sensory-liking, willingness to buy, willingness to try). Product images varied according to mealworm visibility (visible/invisible), carrier flavour (savoury/sweet) and carrier origin (Western/Asian). High product acceptability was not simply achieved by adding mealworms to familiar <b>foods.</b> <b>Acceptability</b> depended very much on the perceived appropriateness of mealworms as food and the perceived appropriateness of the product combination. However, mealworm products were always expected to be inferior to the carrier products, even when visually identical. Familiarity with mealworms and individual traits played a relatively minor role, and influenced the willingness to try more than the other acceptability measures. We conclude that appropriate product design is important but insufficient to achieve consumer acceptance of insects as food in the West. Additional incentives are required to encourage acceptance beyond the mere willingness to try. We discuss the complexities underlying the consumer acceptance of insects as food and reflect on how acceptance might be increased in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|Stunting, and to {{a lesser}} extent wasting and undernutrition, of {{children}} under five years constitutes a serious health problem in Zambia. Although non-nutritional causes such as infection and poverty importantly exacerbate these conditions, improvements in the diets of children is vital for better health. The age interval beginning at about six months is an especially vulnerable time for children, when they are being weaned from breast milk to conventionally used cultural foods. The current study reports assessments by mothers of nine experimental weaning mixtures, formulated by computer to be low cost and nutritionally superior to maize meal alone. An incomplete block design with randomization was used to compare the nine weaning food blends, differentially constituted to address specific conditions. One group of 127 mothers (or guardians) of children 6 to 27 months judged cooked porridges prepared from the blends. The alternate group of 140 mothers of children from 5 to 30 months evaluated characteristics of uncooked porridge ingredients. Statistical analyses of hedonic scale ratings and tabulation of mothers’ voluntary comments were performed. With few exceptions, blend macronutrient/energy characteristics generally conformed to proposed standards in Codex Alimentarius and other literature guidelines. Mixture levels of 20 vitamins and minerals were estimated. A rice-containing formula was most expensive and a high maize/moderate soy formulation the least costly in price assessment. Acceptability results showed that in addition to maize meal and nonfat dry milk, the most acceptable mixtures contained bambara nuts or soybeans as chief ingredients. Blends with substantial percentages of millet, sorghum, or kapenta were not ordinarily acceptable. It was observed that all four cooked porridge quality factors were significantly (p ≤ 0. 01) related with each other, and that both ingredient set rating categories were likewise significantly (p ≤ 0, 01) related. It is emphasized that nutrient contributions of the weaning mixtures are meant for further complementation by concurrent feeding of breast milk, by appropriate use of micronutrient powders or lipidbased micronutrient spreads, and by market or home produced <b>foods.</b> <b>Acceptability</b> results of this study may be influenced by factors such as commodity cost variations, food donations, mother education, and processing cooperatives.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the number}} of new food {{products}} has increased considerably. Nevertheless, not all new food products are accepted and understood by consumers, the innovations in the food sector are often not well received by the market, partly due to a phenomenon known as food neophobia. Food neophobia, a general aversion to try new or unfamiliar foods, has a major impact on preferences, selection and <b>food</b> product <b>acceptability.</b> The neophobic consumers tend to display negative attitudes and less pleasure in relation to new food products. Food neophobia is based on three main reasons for rejection of a food, such as: dislike of its sensory characteristics, fear of negative consequences of eating it, and disgust arising from the idea of the food’s nature or origin. Phobia towards the introduction of unfamiliar foods in the diet can occur for several different factors, such as: socio-demographic characteristics, education level and lifestyle, degree of urbanization, income level, arousal, personal experiences, advertising, fashion, advices of other persons, and habits. This review paper was designed to provide up-to-date relevant information on factors influencing food neophobia, like social factors, type of new food, education, and arousal.

40|$|In the {{worldwide}} context of healthy diet, taste enhancement {{is essential to}} maintain low salt <b>food</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Aroma-taste interactions and heterogeneous distribution of tastants were used as strategies for taste enhancement. However, {{the combination of these}} two strategies has never been studied. This study investigated the effect of heterogeneous aroma-salt distribution on salty taste enhancement and consumer acceptability of hot snacks. A four-layers cream-based model food was designed with the same total amount of sodium and ham aroma, but their distribution varied in each layer. Low, medium or large contrasts between layers of salt and aroma concentration were used, according to an optimized experimental design. Control products with no added ham aroma were included, which resulted in 10 products. A consumer panel (n= 82) rated for each product: salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami taste intensity, as well as ham and cheese aroma intensity. Additionally, they evaluated their acceptability for the products during another sensory session. Results showed first that ham aroma enhanced saltiness (p< 0. 07) in homogeneous product compared to the control containing salt only. Secondly, products with the largest contrast in salt concentration were perceived more salty (p< 0. 01), regardless of the distribution of the ham aroma. Thirdly, the product with the largest contrasts in salt and aroma concentration, i. e. distributed on extreme layers, was even perceived as saltier than the product containing 20 % more salt homogeneously distributed. Interestingly, consumer acceptability did not differ significantly between all products. This set of results led us to conclude that a well-designed heterogeneous distribution of salt and aroma in hot snacks could compensate for at least 20 % of salt reduction, while maintaining salt perception and <b>food</b> <b>acceptability...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{model was}} developed for the systematic selection of raw materials for nutritious and acceptable Thai foods. The basis for the quantitative model was linear programming. Unlike most other applications of this technique which considered only nutritional needs, this model also took into account the consumer's requirements for an acceptable food. The development of the model formed part of a research programme in the Food Technology Department of Massey University which is investigating quantitative product development techniques. The linear programming model was used firstly to select raw material mixes which would satisfy the daily nutritional requirements of the Thai people. Selection was made {{from a list of}} 151 available raw materials - 144 indigenous Thai raw materials and 7 New Zealand dairy products. The requirements for 26 nutrients were satisfied. These included protein, fat, calories, fibre, 3 minerals, 9 vitamins and 10 essential amino acids. The lack of specific upper limits on most of the nutrients resulted in solutions with a gross nutritional imbalance. Recent investigations indicate that such imbalances may be detrimental to human health and it is suggested that a more satisfactory diet is one where all nutrients are balanced, at or near their lower requirement levels. Considerable problems exist in achieving a balanced diet using range constraints in the linear programme due to the probability of solution infeasibilities. Goal programming, an extension of linear programming, has been used in other fields of research to minimize the deviation of solution variables from specific goals. This technique showed potential in attaining a balanced nutritional diet where the goals represented the requirements for specific nutrients. A goal programming model was devised which firstly achieved a balance of essential amino acids as close to that of egg protein as possible. Secondly, a solution was obtained where all 26 nutrients were at the 'optimum' balance. The achievement of a balanced nutritional diet resulted in a large increase in cost and indicated the importance of careful definition of the requirements for nutritional balance in future research where cost minimization is a priority. The raw materials selected by both goal and linear programming were totally unacceptable as ingredients in a Thai food dish without extensive processing to change both flavour and texture of the mixture. It was more logical to provide a procedure for raw material selection {{on the basis of their}} combined acceptability in a Thai food dish. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to derive a 3 dimensional configuration of 40 raw materials from consumer information on the use of these raw materials in Thai food dishes. The axes of this space represented the dominant properties of raw materials in determining <b>food</b> dish <b>acceptability.</b> An ideal point was located in this space. This point was defined as the 'optimum' combination of raw material properties required in a Thai food dish. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling provided the basis for derivation of metric scale values for the 40 raw materials and the ideal point. These values were used to derive a linear function relating raw materials to <b>food</b> dish <b>acceptability.</b> This function was used in the linear programming model together with nutritional constraints to provide a systematic method of raw material selection for nutritious and acceptable Thai food dishes. The raw material mixes selected by this model showed a marked improvement over those chosen by the linear programme subject to only nutritional constraints...|$|R

An 84 -consumer panel was asked to give three types of evaluation for both products: tasting without information (perceived liking); information without tasting (expected liking); tasting with information (actual liking). For both products, the expected liking was significantly different from the perceived liking (P 0. 05), whereas, for the meat produced by AR lambs actual liking was lower than perceived liking (P < 0. 001). However, consumers did not completely assimilate their liking in the direction of expectations, as indicated by the fact that expectancy for AR lamb was significantly lower than actual acceptability (P < 0. 001). Mean scores of perceived liking were higher for the meat produced by AR animals as compared to ER lambs (P < 0. 05).

Focusing on dairy products, this review article investigates the factors due to: (i) food products, and mainly the influence of food composition and structure on aroma retention and release; (ii) the inter-individual variability of subjects, mainly chewing behaviour, saliva rate and composition and their influence on aroma release; and (iii) the interactions between food products and subjects and their impact on aroma release and perception. We also discuss the various instrumental and sensory methodologies that are often used to study aroma-texture interactions in dairy products, with particular focus on articles that compare in vivo aroma release and perception in dairy products. This review emphasizes that the relationship existing between in vivo aroma release and perception in dairy products is strongly dependent on the type of texture relative to two mechanisms; physicochemical mechanisms based on the modification of aroma release and a cognitive mechanism based on aroma-taste-texture interactions. These two mechanisms exist simultaneously but have more or less impact on aroma perception, {{depending on the type of}} texture...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{indicated that}} measurable declines in masticatory function due to missing teeth, {{with and without}} prosthetic replacements, alter perceptual estimates of <b>food</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Using 1, 133 male participants from the Veterans Administration Dental Longitudinal Study, individuals were classified into nine dentition categories to evaluate the effect of impaired masticatory ability. The data demonstrated that when limited declines in perceived masticatory function occur, perceptual estimates of Taste Acceptability, Texture Acceptability, and Ingestion Frequency for the 13 test foods utilized are not significantly modified. In contrast, when more severe dentition losses occur, the rheological properties of each food determine {{the degree to which}} these perceptual measures, especially Perceived Ease of Chewing, will be altered. Although restorative therapy can lead to concomitant improvements in masticatory function, low perceptual re-sponses may still be observed. These appear to be largely a function of the physical attributes of the foods ingested. Key Words: Mastication, Tooth loss, Artificial dentition, Age, Food selection HUMAN food selection is thought to be theresult of a complex interaction of biological, environmental, cultural, and behavioral influences (Pilgrim, 1957; Zifferblatt et al., 1980), but the degree to which each of these variables affects ingestion patterns still remains unclear. Various studies have provided evidence that food choice is guided neither by nutritional need nor item avail-ability (Pilgrim, 1976; Reaburn et al., 1979). The widespread prevalence of tooth loss seen in elderly adults and the impact of the resultant impaired mas-ticatory ability on food selection patterns (Manly & Shiere, 1950; Soremark & Nilsson, 1972) is often overlooked. It has been suggested that tooth-loss-related de-clines in masticatory function are responsible for elderly persons consuming predominantly soft...|$|E
40|$|One {{major issue}} of the food {{industry}} is reducing sodium content while maintaining <b>food</b> <b>acceptability</b> and liking. Despite extensive research in this field, little has been published on real complex food products. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether the size of particles, a parameter easily adjusted in food processing, could influence the salty taste of low-salt food product. We thus evaluated the effect of ham particle sizes (4 levels, including a zero level) on salt perception and the consumer liking of flans varying in their overall salt concentrations (low- and high-salt content). Two consumer panels, composed of 107 and 77 subjects, rated, respectively, the saltiness of and liking for the developed flans (8 samples). The outcomes of this study indicated first, that the addition of ham to flans increased the salty taste perception and second, that a decrease in ham particle size (ground ham) increased the perceived saltiness. Moreover, low- and high-salt flans were equally liked, demonstrating that food manufacturers could reduce the salt contents (here, by over 15 %) while maintaining consumer acceptability through the manipulation of the size of the salt-providing particles. Practical Application The results from this study can contribute to low-salt food design with a good acceptability by the consumers. Because salted ham particles are heterogeneously distributed in flans, the salty perception is increased compared to a homogeneous distribution of salt in flans. Moreover, a decrease in ham particle size increases the overall surface of particles, which efficiently increases the perceived saltiness. Salt content and particle size of some ingredients can be optimized to enhance saltiness of low-salt composite foods, without addition of any additive and without significant loss of sensory acceptability...|$|E
40|$|Humans perform {{fascinating}} science experiments {{at home on}} a {{daily basis}} when they undertake the modification of natural and naturally-derived materials by a cooking process prior to consumption. The material properties of such foods are of interest to food scientists (texture is often fundamental to <b>food</b> <b>acceptability),</b> oral biologists (foods modulate feeding behavior), anthropologists (cooking is probably as old as the genus Homo and distinguishes us from all other creatures) and dentists (foods interact with tooth and tooth replacement materials). Materials scientists may be interested in the drastic changes in food properties observed over relatively short cooking times. In the current study, the mechanical properties {{of one of the most}} common (and oldest at 4, 000 + years) foods on earth, the noodle, were examined as a function of cooking time. Two types of noodles were studied, each made from natural materials (wheat flour, salt, alkali and water) by kneading dough and passing them through a pasta-making machine. These were boiled for between 2 - 14 min and tested at regular intervals from raw to an overcooked state. Cyclic tensile tests at small strain levels were used to examine energy dissipation characteristics. Energy dissipation was > 50 % per cycle in uncooked noodles, but decreased by an order of magnitude with cooking. Fractional dissipation values remained approximately constant at cooking times greater than 7 min. Overall, a greater effect of cooking was on viscoplastic dissipation characteristics rather than on fracture resistance. The results of the current study plot the evolution of a viscoplastic mixture into an essentially elastic material in the space of 7 minutes and have broad implications for understanding what cooking does to food materials. In particular, they suggest that textural assessment by consumers of the optimally cooked state of food has a definite physical definition. © 2007 Materials Research Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{number of}} factors are known to {{influence}} <b>food</b> preferences and <b>acceptability</b> of new products. These include their sensory characteristics and strong, innate neural influences. In designing foods for any target group, {{it is important to}} consider intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics which may contribute to palatability, and <b>acceptability</b> of <b>foods.</b> Objective: To assess age and gender influences on sensory perceptions of novel low cost nutrient-rich food products developed using traditional Ghanaian food ingredients. Materials and Methods: In this study, a range of food products were developed from Ghanaian traditional food sources using the Food Multimix (FMM) concept. These products were subjected to sensory evaluation to assess the role of sensory perception on their acceptability among different target age groups across the life cycle (aged 11 - 68 years olds) and to ascertain any possible influences of gender on preference and choice. Variables including taste, odour, texture, flavour and appearance were tested and the results captured on a Likert scale and scores of likeness and acceptability analysed. Multivariate analyses were used to develop prediction models for targeted recipe development for different target groups. Multiple factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic linear regression were employed to test the strength of acceptability and to ascertain age and gender influences on product preference. Results: The results showed a positive trend in acceptability (r = 0. 602) which tended towards statistical significance (p = 0. 065) with very high product favourability rating (91...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} consumers' habits and belief structures concerning local food products {{and to develop}} a new snack as a way to fight against children malnutrition in Madagascar. A large variety of natural food resources grow in Madagascar, like Moringa oleifera (MO) which leaves are rich in nutrients but not consumed. First, a survey conducted in four areas of Madagascar revealed that MO leaves are known for their health benefits but infrequently consumed, probably because of their low satiating power and strong odor. In the studied areas, different levels of consumption were observed, which may be linked to varying levels of familiarity with MO by the local populations, this in turn resulting from different situations regarding geographical and historical availability. In contrary, resources such as cassava are perceived as having negative effects on health but are widely consumed because they are cheap, liked by children and satiating. The second step in the study aimed to propose products that could increase MO consumption without completely changing <b>food</b> practices. The <b>acceptability</b> of snacks associating cassava roots and MO was evaluated by means of hedonic tests performed by children. Between the snacks tested, the preferred snack contained the highest quantity of MO and was sweetened. There was no effect of area on the acceptance of the formulated snacks. This work is an evaluation of the potential of MO in the diet of malnourished population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Kiribati, {{a remote}} atoll island {{country of the}} Pacific, has serious {{problems}} of vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Thus, {{it is important to}} identify locally grown acceptable foods that might be promoted to alleviate this problem. Pandanus fruit (Pandanus tectorius) is a well-liked indigenous Kiribati food with many cultivars that have orange/yellow flesh, indicative of carotenoid content. Few have been previously analysed. Aim This study was conducted to identify cultivars of pandanus and other foods that could be promoted to alleviate VAD in Kiribati. Method Ethnography was used to select <b>foods</b> and assess <b>acceptability</b> factors. Pandanus and other foods were analysed for β- and α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene and total carotenoids using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results Of the nine pandanus cultivars investigated there was a great range of provitamin A carotenoid levels (from 62 to 19 086 μg β-carotene/ 100 g), generally with higher levels in those more deeply coloured. Seven pandanus cultivars, one giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma chamissonis) cultivar and native fig (Ficus tinctoria) had significant provitamin A carotenoid content, meeting all or half of estimated daily vitamin A requirements within normal consumption patterns. Analyses in different laboratories confirmed high carotenoid levels in pandanus but showed that there are still questions as to how high the levels might be, owing to variation arising from different handling/preparation/analytical techniques. Conclusions These carotenoid-rich acceptable foods should be promoted for alleviating VAD in Kiribati and possibly other Pacific contexts where these foods are important. Further research in the Pacific is needed to identify additional indigenous foods with potential health benefit...|$|R
