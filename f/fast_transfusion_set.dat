40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: An {{assessment}} of practices and available medical devices during {{the treatment of}} a massive haemorrhage has been realised in the shock unit of our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Parameters influencing transfusion flow rate have been identified. Medical devices and equipment to accelerate the flow rate were analyzed {{on the basis of}} manufacturers' data and users opinion in relation with their practices. RESULTS: The system, from blood bags to venous access, influences flow rate: red blood cell viscosity, catheter and pressure gradient. Three types of acceleration systems are available: accelerated <b>transfusion</b> <b>set,</b> pressure cuff with a gravity blood IV set and fast-flow fluid warmers. Their benefits and disadvantages are presented and discussed. DISCUSSION: Maximum flow rates noted by manufacturers are not the real values because some parameters such as venous catheter diameter (limitative factor) and the red blood cell viscosity (diluted or not) are not considered. The choice of an infusion system is mainly based on the technical capacities (flow rate fluctuations, pressure gradient on blood bags, warming, air purging), practical modalities of use (medical devices and assembly) and cost. The pressure cuff with <b>transfusion</b> gravity <b>set</b> should be limited to non-critical situations or during the assembly of the fast flow fluid warmers (but no warming fluids, no air embolism prevention). The accelerated <b>transfusion</b> <b>set</b> is not the best option for a shock unit because it needs an operator permanently. The fast-flow fluid warmers are recommended for all types of massive haemorrhages, they are more secure but they require a long time to be assembled...|$|R
40|$|Bleeding, either {{medical or}} {{surgical}} bleeding, remains {{an important issue}} in surgery. Therefore, complete blood count and bleeding time are routinely checked in patients undergoing surgical procedures. To {{reduce the risk of}} medical bleeding, pre-operative management for patients with low platelet count is crucial. The first step in this management is to confirm the platelet count manually. Transfusion of the platelet concentrate can be taken into consideration if the platelet is very low (less than 50. 000 /mm 3 assumed normal platelet function) or the surgical procedures have a greater risk of bleeding. Platelet concentrate can be produced from the apheresis of a single donor or the  extraction of the whole blood from multiple donors. The blood should be transfused by  using a special platelet <b>transfusion</b> <b>set</b> within 30 minutes. However, the transfusion of platelet concentrate is not recommended for patients with Immune Trombocytopenia Purpura. In this case, the autoimmune process will immediately destroy the platelet, so immunosuppressant therapy is warranted...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was the {{analysis}} of the HBV genome of virus isolates from individuals with chronic HBV infection but without detectable HBsAg.

One in four of the patients reported that no amount was deemed sufficient to compensate for the renunciation of their home BT management. The main determinants of WTP were significantly different from WTA predictors. Our results suggest that individuals' strategies towards constructing WTP and WTA differ in terms of determinants, reasoning, use of information and economic rationality. They give empirical evidence on the usefulness to elicit both WTP and WTA responses in healthsurveys to help understand the economic evaluation of health technology assessment and care organization...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the ongoing}} review of donor {{recruitment}} criteria by local blood transfusion {{services and the}} development of highly sensitive and specific testing for the presence of antibodies to HIV in blood and blood products, there remains a residue of HIV in donated blood. This is because of donors who are in the 'window period' between acquisition of HIV and seroconversion, human errors and limits to the sensitivity and specificity of current tests. Data available from a national survey of HIV seroprevalence in South African blood donors allowed for the estimation of the number of units screened negative but likely to be infected with HIV. Assuming window periods of 4. 8 and 14 weeks, a test sensitivity of 99. 9 %, a specificity of 98. 5 % and a human error rate of 0. 1 %, the likely rate of HIV-infected blood in the South African blood transfusion supply ranges from 1. 1 to 3. 9 / 100, 000 units, with a likely estimate of 2. 2 / 100, 000 units. In the current South African blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>setting,</b> between 8. 1 and 28. 2 units of blood per annum will be HIV-positive with a likely estimate of 15. 9 units.

The expected increase in the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection in all adult South African populations necessitates additional measures to ensure a blood supply which is as safe as possible.

Numerous observational studies have shown that older RBC units are an independent factor for patient mortality. However, recently published randomized clinical trials have shown no difference of clinical outcome for patients receiving old or fresh RBCs. An overlooked but essential issue in assessing RBC unit quality and ultimately designing the necessary clinical trials is a metric for what constitutes an old or fresh RBC unit. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSTwenty RBC units were profiled using quantitative metabolomics over 42 days of storage in SAGM with 3 - to 4 -day time intervals. Metabolic pathway usage during storage was assessed using systems biology methods. The detected time intervals of the metabolic states were compared to clinical outcomes. RESULTSUsing multivariate statistics, we identified a nonlinear decay process exhibiting three distinct metabolic states (Days 0 - 10, 10 - 17, and 17 - 42). Hematologic variables traditionally measured in the <b>transfusion</b> <b>setting</b> (e. g., pH, hemolysis, RBC indices) did not distinguish these three states. Systemic changes in pathway usage occurred between the three states, with key pathways changing in both magnitude and direction. Finally, an association was found between the time periods of the metabolic states with the clinical outcomes of more than 280, 000 patients in the country of Denmark transfused over the past 15 years and endothelial damage markers in healthy volunteers undergoing autologous transfusions.

Objective: To describe the manifestations and quality of care children with severe malaria receive in Mulago Hospital Paediatric emergency unit and evaluate its impact on outcome. Methods: A cohort of 784 children with severe malaria was recruited at admission and followed up. Selected measures of quality were the exposure factor and death, the outcome measure.

30|$|According to the FDA DEHP safety {{assessment}} document, the tolerable intake (TI) values for DEHP are 0.6 mg/kg(body mass)/day for the parenteral route, {{and in the}} absence of specific information, body masses of 70 kg for adults, 10 kg for children, and 3.5 kg for neonates should be used (ISO 10993 - 172002). Using the TI value of 0.6 mg/kg(body mass)/day, the calculated DEHP tolerable exposures (TEs) for human beings are 42 mg/day for adults, 6 mg for children and 2.1 mg for neonates, respectively. Apparently, all of the determination results are less than the TE value for adults, which means that the DEHP released from these medical devices is safe for adults. For the <b>transfusion</b> <b>set,</b> the result from the alternative media is more than the TE value for neonates, but when blood was used, which will be the practical contact media during clinical use, the released DEHP was much less than the TE value for neonates. This result indicates that the amount of DEHP released from this product is also safe, even for neonates. When reviewing the tube system for haemodialisis use, the result is much higher than the TE values for children and neonates; therefore, a further extraction with blood may be needed if the product is intended for these types of populations. If those results can still not conform to the TE values of these two groups, then a risk analysis should be conducted or the selection of an alternative product is recommended. However, it should be noted that with more and more concern with the toxicity of DEHP during the past ten years, especially the increased risk in children (U.S.FDA 2001), many products have been developed using an alternative plasticizer or an alternative material for children and neonates.|$|R

This complexity is at the origin of difficulties for transfusion of African patients especially sickle cell disease patients requiring chronic transfusion therapy with high risk of immunization. As a complete survey of RH variants is lacking in African populations, we performed red blood cell genotyping to determine the type and frequency of RHD and RHCE alleles in sub-Saharan African populations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 347 blood samples were collected from individuals of six nonpygmoid and three pygmoid populations. RH typing was performed using two single-tube multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplifications (BioArray Solutions, Immucor). RESULTS: All six sub-Saharan nonpygmoid populations exhibited constant variety in both type and frequency of aberrant RHD and RHCE alleles. Predicted partial RH 1 (1. 8 %) and RH 5 (0. 9 %) phenotypes were less than expected. Conversely, predicted partial phenotype RH 2 (5. 5 %) was frequent. Data confirmed the high frequency of samples positive for the non-clinically significant RH 10 /RH 20 antigens (39. 5 %) and revealed a high frequency of RH 54 (DAK, 8. 1 %). The pygmoid groups showed higher percentages of predicted partial RH antigens and greater heterogeneity reflecting wide genetic differentiation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that frequencies of aberrant RHD and RHCE alleles were similar, irrespective of location and ethnicity. In view of the predicted frequencies and relative clinical significance of both private antigens and high-prevalence antigens absent, the most relevant assays for individuals of African descent in a <b>transfusion</b> <b>setting</b> are for 1) partial RH 2 in the patient and 2) RH 54 (DAK) in the donor...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Pathogen {{inactivation}} {{in blood}} and blood products {{is one of the}} major means to achieve a zero risk blood supply and improve transfusion safety. Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) activated by ultraviolet (UV) light, produces active oxygen which damages cell membrane and prevents replication of the carrier of diseases (viruses, bacteria, protozoa) in all blood products. The aim of this study was to establish the influence of the process of pathogens photoinactivation using riboflavin and UV rays on the biochemical and functional characteristics of platelet concentrates prepared from “buffy coat”. Methods. The examination included 80 platelet concentrates prepared from “buffy coat”, which was separated from whole blood donated by voluntary blood donors around 6 hours from the moment of collection. Concentrates were pooled, filtered and separated unton two groups: one consisted of 10 control units and the other of 10 examined units (pooled platelet concentrates). Examined units of the platelets were treated by riboflavin (35 mL) and UV rays (6. 24 J/mL, 265 - 370 nm) on Mirasol aparature (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies, USA) in approximate duration of 6 min. A total of 35 mL of saline solution was added to the control units. The samples for examining were taken from the control and examined units initially (K 0, I 0), after the addition of saline (K 1) and riboflavin (I 1), after illumination (I 2), first day of storage (K 3, I 3) and the fifth day of storage (K 4, I 4). The following parameters were measured: platelet count and platelet yield, residual erythrocyte and leukocyte count, pH, pO 2, pCO 2 and bacterial contamination. Results. All the measured parameters showed a statistically significant decrease comparing to K 0 and I 0; all the results of the first day of platelet storage showed statistically significant decrease comparing to K 1 and I 1, and all the results of the fifth day of platelet storage (K 4, I 4) showed a statistically significant decrease comparing to K 1 and K 3 and to I 1 and I 3. There was no the mentioned difference in the measured parameters between K 4 and I 4 (the end of storage - the fifth day). All the platelet units were sterile till the seventh day, when the investigation ended. Conclusion. Platelet concentrates inactivated by riboflavin and UV rays (Mirasol PRT sistem, Caridian BCT, USA) keep all the characteristics assessed by the Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components (Council of Europe), during the whole storage period (five days).

40|$|Blood transfusions are {{a common}} event in the ICU with {{about a third of}} all {{patients}} receiving a transfusion at some point during their ICU stay. The theoretical rationale behind blood transfusion is fairly clear-cut: by increasing the hemoglobin concentration, oxygen delivery to the tissues will be improved and organ function optimized. However, in reality the situation is more complex. While increasing red cell mass may indeed increase oxygen delivery, there may not be a corresponding increase in oxygen uptake and tissue oxygen availability. In fact, despite traditional <b>transfusion</b> triggers <b>set</b> in the region of a hemoglobin value of 10 g/dl or a hematocrit of 30 %, there is evidence that the system can tolerate much lower levels of anemia with few or no adverse effects. Several studies have suggested an increase in mortality in transfused patients, however, while many patients may indeed tolerate a lower hemoglobin value than traditionally thought, anemia is not a benign feature and acutely anemic patients also have higher mortality rates. The 'optimal' hemoglobin is, thus, a balance between the benefits of maximum hemoglobin levels and the potential adverse effects of blood transfusion and high hematocrit.

40|$|Advances in {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI) {{during the}} past decade have led to more widespread use of these procedures in older and sicker patients. Refinement of periprocedural antithrombotic therapy has played a particularly important role in reducing ischemic complications to very low levels in routine practice. Although the use of more powerful antiplatelet agents has been associated with increased risk of bleeding (especially among the elderly and patients with serious comorbidities), such complications have traditionally been viewed as benign in nature. Recent studies, however, have identified major bleeding after PCI as an important predictor of increased mortality. Whether this relationship between bleeding and risk of death is cause-and-effect, or merely an association based on shared risk factors, remains unclear. In this review, we examine the basis for a possible causal link between post-PCI bleeding and subsequent mortality. Possible mechanisms underpinning such a link are discussed, including a potential adverse role for blood <b>transfusion</b> in this <b>setting.</b> A framework for further clinical evaluation of this issue is presented...|$|R

Early and aggressive resuscitation through restoration of both hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation is a major therapeutic goal in this setting. The optimal threshold for RBC transfusion and the eventual benefit in septic acute circulatory failure are debated. This issue appears particularly relevant to {{patients with}} hematological malignancies since the high prevalence of anemia imposed by malignant bone marrow infiltration or by cytotoxic treatments makes them particularly liable to urgent RBC <b>transfusion</b> in this <b>setting</b> in contrast to patients with delayed ICU-acquired anemia. This question was not specifically addressed by the leading trials about transfusion strategies in critically ill patients, since patients with chronic anemia were excluded from the pivotal TRICC trial and cancer patients were underrepresented in the TRISS trial [12 – 14]. We herein addressed the practices and the prognostic value of RBC transfusion as part of early sepsis resuscitation in a large cohort of patients with hematological malignancies who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for the main diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{identification}} of transmissions of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) by blood transfusion {{raised the question}} which of these EIDs poses the highest risk to blood safety. For {{a number of the}} EIDs that are perceived to be a threat to blood safety, evidence on actual disease or transmission characteristics is lacking, which might render measures against such EIDs disputable. On the other hand, the fact that we call them "emerging" implies almost by definition that we are uncertain about at least some of their characteristics. So what is the relative importance of various disease and transmission characteristics, and how are these influenced by the degree of uncertainty associated with their actual values? We identified the likelihood of transmission by blood transfusion, the presence of an asymptomatic phase of infection, prevalence of infection, and the disease impact as the main characteristics of the perceived risk of disease transmission by blood transfusion. A group of experts in the field of infectious diseases and blood <b>transfusion</b> ranked <b>sets</b> of (hypothetical) diseases with varying degrees of uncertainty associated with their disease characteristics, and used probabilistic inversion to obtain probability distributions for the weight of each of these risk characteristics. These distribution weights can be used to rank both existing and newly emerging infectious diseases with (partially) known characteristics. Analyses show that in case {{there is a lack of}} data concerning disease characteristics, it is the uncertainty concerning the asymptomatic phase and the disease impact that are the most important drivers of the perceived risk. On the other hand, if disease characteristics are well established, it is the prevalence of infection and the transmissibility of the disease by blood transfusion that will drive the perceived risk. The risk prioritization model derived provides an easy to obtain and rational expert assessment of the relative importance of an (emerging) infectious disease, requiring only a limited amount of information. Such a model might be used to justify a rational and proportional response to an emerging infectious disease, especially in situations where little or no specific information is available...|$|R
30|$|One {{strength}} {{of this study is}} the prospective collection of data, although it was a secondary analysis of a database that was not designed to this specific aim. In general, data from the first three days were complete and accurate, but data collected later on were less detailed. Thus, the estimation of packed red cells transfused within the first three days was accurate, whereas daily transfusions thereafter were not collected. Nonetheless, neither the volume of fluid loading nor the fluid balance was accurately recorded in the database. In the same way, the incidence of delayed ICU-acquired infectious and non-infectious complications and the definite causes of death could not be reliably estimated. In the absence of guidelines, indications of RBC <b>transfusion</b> in this <b>setting</b> were probably quite inconsistent across centers. Hemoglobin levels in the RBC transfusion group were often higher than the recommended 7  g/dl threshold. However, this was an observational study reflecting routine practice. With respect to the lower hemoglobin levels and the severity of circulatory dysfunctions in transfused patients, it is likely that physicians followed a common pragmatic decision-making process at the bedside, based not only on a sole hemoglobin level but also on markers of tissue dysoxia. However, such an observational study can only provide exploratory data and statistical link, but is no substitute to prospective interventional studies.|$|R
30|$|Symptomatic {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) of {{the knee}} develops often in association with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. Two distinct pathologies should be recognised while considering treatment options in patients with end-stage medial compartment OA and ACL deficiency. Patients with primary ACL deficiency (usually traumatic ACL rupture) can develop secondary OA (typically presenting with symptoms of instability and pain) and these patients are typically young and active. Patients with primary end stage medial compartment OA can develop secondary ACL deficiency (usually degenerate ACL rupture) and these patients tend to be older. Treatment options in either of these patient groups include arthroscopic debridement, reconstruction of the ACL, high tibial osteotomy (HTO) with or without ACL reconstruction, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). General opinion is that a functionally intact ACL is a fundamental prerequisite to perform a UKA. This is because previous reports showed higher failure rates when ACL was deficient, probably secondary to wear and tibial loosening. Nevertheless in some cases of ACL deficiency with end-stage medial compartment OA, UKA has been performed in isolation and recent papers confirm good short- to mid-term outcome without increased risk of implant failure. Shorter hospital stay, fewer blood <b>transfusions,</b> <b>faster</b> recovery and significantly lower risk of developing major complications like death, myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (as compared to TKA) make the UKA an attractive option, especially in the older patients. On the other hand, younger patients with higher functional demands are likely to benefit from a simultaneous or staged ACL reconstruction in addition to UKA to regain knee stability. These procedures tend to be technically demanding. The main aim of this review {{was to provide a}} synopsis of the existing literature and outline an evidence-based treatment algorithm.|$|R

Objectives To prospectively define the incidence of anemia and use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in critically ill patients and to explore the potential benefits and risks associated with transfusion in the ICU. Design Prospective observational study conducted November 1999, with 2. components: a blood sampling study and an, anemia and blood <b>transfusion</b> study. <b>Setting</b> and Patients The blood sampling study included 1136 patients from 145 western European ICUs, and the anemia and blood transfusion study included 3534 patients from 146 western European ICUs. Patients were followed up for 28 days or until hospital discharge, interinstitutional transfer, or death. Main Outcome Measures Frequency of blood drawing and associated volume of blood drawn, collected over a 24 -hour period; hemoglobin levels, transfusion rate, organ dysfunction (assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score), and mortality, collected throughout a 2 -week period. Results The mean (SD) volume per blood draw was 10. 3 (6. 6) mL, with an average total volume of 41. 1 (39. 7) mL during the 24 -hour period. There was {{a positive correlation between}} organ dysfunction and the number of blood draws (r= 0. 34; P<. 001) and total volume drawn (r= 0. 28; P<. 001). The mean hemoglobin concentration at ICU admission was 11. 3 (2. 3) g/dL, with 29 % (963 / 3295) having a concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The transfusion rate during the ICU period was 37. 0 % (1307 / 3534). Older patients and those with a longer ICU length of stay were more commonly transfused. Both ICU and overall mortality rates were significantly higher in patients who had vs had not received a transfusion (ICU rates: 18. 5 % vs 10. 1 %, respectively; chi(2) = 50. 1; P<. 001; overall rates: 29. 0 % vs 14. 9 %, respectively; chi(2) = 88. 1; P<. 001). For similar degrees of organ dysfunction, patients who had a transfusion had a higher mortality rate. For matched patients in the propensity analysis, the 28 -day mortality was 22. 7 % among patients with transfusions and 17. 1 % among those without (P=. 02); the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test confirmed this difference. Conclusions This multicenter observational study reveals the common occurrence of anemia and the large use of blood transfusion in critically ill patients. Additionally, this epidemiologic study provides evidence of an association between transfusions and diminished organ function as well as between transfusions and mortality...|$|R

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The most common cause of nonsurgical postcardiopulmonary bypass bleeding is platelet dysfunction. For this reason, pharmacologic agents are under investigation in an effort to reduce the need for <b>transfusion</b> in this <b>setting.</b> METHODS: A posthoc analysis of blood product usage was performed in data obtained from a Phase I, single center, open label, randomized study performed in 63 patients. The trial was designed to test the safety and tolerance of adenosine when added to blood cardioplegia in increasing doses to enhance myocardial protection. The database provided information regarding the effect of adenosine cardioplegia on venous plasma adenosine concentrations, the amount of platelets, fresh frozen plasma and packed erythrocytes used, and the association between the adenosine dose and postoperative thoracic drainage. RESULTS: The postoperative thoracic drainage at 6 hours, 24 hours, and at the time of chest tube removal in the high-dose adenosine cardioplegia group was 68 %, 76 %, and 75 % of the placebo and low-dose adenosine cardioplegia group (p < 0. 05). The highest dose of adenosine studied increased baseline adenosine venous plasma levels 360 -fold, from 0. 17 +/- 0. 09 mumol/L to 42. 30 +/- 11. 20 mumol/L (p < 0. 05). This marked increase was associated with a 68 %, 56 %, and 58 % reduction in platelet, fresh frozen plasma, and packed erythrocyte usage, respectively (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to enhancing the heart's tolerance to ischemia, adenosine-supplemented cardioplegic solution also may reduce bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) {{is a disease}} with marked heterogeneity. Despite major {{improvement}} in outcome, it remains a life-threatening malignancy. Demographic and clinical data on pediatric AML is lacking among the Lebanese population. Purpose: We aimed to identify clinical, molecular and outcome data in children with AML in Lebanon. Methods: A retrospective chart review of children with AML diagnosed in three Lebanese hospitals during the past 8 years was conducted. Results: From May 2002 through March 2010, we identified 24 children with AML in Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, University Medical Center Rizk Hospital and Abou-Jaoude Hospital. Males and females were equally represented; median age at diagnosis was 9 years (range 1 - 24) and median WBC at diagnosis was 31 x 109 /L (range: 2. 1 - 376 x 109 /L). Twenty five percent of patients (6 out of 24) had acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Karyotype was normal in 33 % of patients; t(8; 21), inv (16), t(8; 9), t(7; 11), t(9; 11), complex chromosomal abnormality, monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 were the most common cytogenetic abnormalities encountered. Patients were treated on different European and North American protocols. Twelve patients (50 %) achieved morphologic CR after cycle 1, 6 of them (50 %) had bone marrow relapse within 11 months from diagnosis. Nine patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant and 3 of them are alive at 5 years post-transplant. Early death rate was 16. 6 % of patients, mainly those with APL and a presenting WBC > 10 x 109 /L. Fifty per cent of APL patients had an early death due to DIC despite starting ATRA therapy. Overall, median survival for AML patients who died from disease progression was 25. 8 months (range: 1 - 60 months). Overall disease-free survival was 30. 4 %. Patients 10 years. Conclusions:  Our report highlights the needs in Lebanon for better supportive care of children with APL including faster ATRA administration and aggressive <b>transfusions,</b> <b>faster</b> access to stem cell transplant for high-risk AML patients {{and the need for}} a national homogenous treatment strategy for children with AML.   Key-words: AML, pediatric AML, leukemia, AML Lebanon, APML, Early deat...|$|R
40|$|Background. Due to the {{administrative}} {{errors in the}} transfusion chain between the blood donor and the patient, transfusion errors still occur. Usually, they are caused by the misidentifications of the patient, his blood samples and respective blood components. A reliable identification can only be reached by an appropriate informatization of the whole process by implementation of information networks and communication technologies. Methods. An information system covering all modern standards of safety and enabling integrity of patient records as well as <b>faster</b> and efficient <b>transfusion</b> was prepared. The system is enabling the rational use of the blood as well as assuring the obligatory haemoviligilance, as foreseen by the current law. The whole system is modular, consisting of terminals, supportive equipment, networking systems and servers. Additional hardware are the electronic code bar readers. Mobile terminals (Palm Pocket PCs) are wirelessly connected to the data network using the IEEE 802. 11 b WLAN technology in a wireless connection. All elements are included into the communication network with the servers contain data bases of blood donors, blood components and the patients; they execute the algorithms of the blood transfusion process support and enable the authentication. At {{the same time they}} enable the corresponding interfaces adapted to the users and terminals. For the connection of elements, corresponding interfaces are used. Results. The application is supporting the whole system of ordering, issuing and transfusion of a blood component. Its main characteristics are the bar-coded wristband for patient identification, coding of the blood samples with the same bar code that is unmistakably connected with the patient, and electronic ordering of blood component via a handheld device at the patient’s side. By means of which identity of the patient and the blood component can be matched right before the intended transfusion. Similarly, the handheld device can also be used for the posttransfusion procedures including the transfusion report as well as adverse effects reports. Conclusions. We expect that a similar system of transfusion safety assurance and haemovigilance is essential for the quality work at the hospital wards and will be set up soon, thereby enabling a safer and better transfusion therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{detect the}} effect of the stem cell source, {{allogeneic}} peripheral blood stem cell transplantations (alloPBSCTs) performed between 1995 and 1997 from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -identical siblings in 40 patients with acute and chronic hematological disorders were compared with a historical group of 40 patients with similar variables who had received allogeneic bone marrow transplants (alloBMTs) between 1993 and 1995. Patients in both groups were identical except that both the recipient and the donor ages were, on average, higher in the alloPBSCT group (26 vs. 36 [p = 0. 005] and 27 vs. 32 [p = 0. 024], respectively). Patients received similar therapy excluding posttransplant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration (97 % in alloBMT vs. 12. 5 % in alloPBSCT). The median time to reach neutrophil counts > 0. 5 × 109 /L and platelet counts > 20 × 109 /L was 13 and 14 days, respectively, in patients receiving alloPBSCTs compared with 19 and 27 days in patients receiving alloBMTs (p = 0. 0014 and p = 0. 0002). The alloPBSCT group required similar transfusions of red blood cells or platelets. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-vs. -host disease (aGVHD) was similar in both groups. However, chronic GVHD (cGVHD) of all grades developed in 78. 1 % of patients in the alloPBSCT group after a median follow-up period of 12. 5 (range 0. 5 - 34) months. In alloBMT recipients, cGVHD of all grades developed in 21. 4 % after a median follow-up period of 38 (range 0. 5 - 62) months (p = 0. 00001). Day 100 transplant-related mortality was also similar: 20 % (8 of 40) in the alloBMT patients and 17. 5 % (7 of 40) in the alloPBSCT group. Although not statistically significant, a relatively higher relapse rate occurred in the alloBMT group (21. 4 vs. 10. 7 %). The estimated disease-free survival in month 24 was 51. 3 % for alloBMT and 54. 6 % for alloPBSCT, and the estimated overall survival in month 24 was 56. 1 % for alloBMT and 64. 6 % for alloPBSCT. In conclusion, this retrospective comparison suggests that alloPBSCT from HLA-identical donors is associated with <b>faster</b> engraftment, fewer <b>transfusions,</b> and no greater incidence of aGVHD, but a high incidence of cGVHD...|$|R
40|$|Thrombocytopenia {{is one of}} the commonest {{haematological}} {{problems in}} neonates, affecting at least 25 % of all admissions to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) [Murray NA, Howarth LJ, McCloy MP et al. Platelet transfusion in the management of severe thrombocytopenia in neonatal intensive care unit patients. Transfus Med 2002; 12 : 35 - 41; Garcia MG, Duenas E, Sola MC et al.

Platelet transfusions in the neonatal intensive care unit: factors predicting which patients will require multiple transfusions. Transfusion 2001; 41 : 803 - 8]. Although a long list of disorders associated with neonatal thrombocytopenia can be found in many textbooks, newer classifications based on the timing of onset of thrombocytopenia (early vs. late) are more useful for planning diagnostic investigations and day-to-day management. The mainstay of treatment of neonatal thrombocytopenia remains platelet transfusion although {{it is important to note}} that no studies have yet shown clinical benefit of platelet <b>transfusion</b> in this <b>setting.</b> Indeed some reports even suggest that there may be significant adverse effects of platelet transfusion in neonates, including increased mortality, and that the effects of transfusion may differ in different groups of neonates with similar degrees of thrombocytopenia [Bonifacio L, Petrova A, Nanjundaswamy S, Mehta R. Thrombocytopenia related neonatal outcome in preterms. Indian J Pediatr 2007; 74 : 269 - 74; Kenton AB, Hegemier S, Smith EO et al. Platelet transfusions in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis do not lower mortality but may increase morbidity. J Perinatol 2005; 25 : 173 - 7]. There is also considerable variation in transfusion practice between different countries and between different neonatal units.
