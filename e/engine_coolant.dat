5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type exhausts. Later {{marks of the}} Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} annular {{radiators}} for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) {{to be as}} short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.|$|E
50|$|Ethylene {{production}} is an estimated $160 billion/year. Ethylene derivatives {{are found in}} food packaging, eyeglasses, cars, medical devices, lubricants, <b>engine</b> <b>coolants</b> and liquid crystal displays. Ethylene production by steam cracking consumes large amounts of energy, uses valuable oil fractions, such as naphtha and is the largest contributor to Greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industry.|$|R
50|$|Revolutions {{per minute}} should be around 1500 rpm. Run {{for about half}} an hour while {{checking}} the oil pressure and begin again should there be any over-boiling of the <b>engine's</b> <b>coolant,</b> which is a combination of air, oil, and water. Once this initial step is completed, drive at varying speeds on the road (or stand) by accelerating between speeds of 30 and 50 miles per hour.|$|R

25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to facilitate the}} use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second fuel tank for biodiesel {{in addition to the}} standard diesel fuel tank. The second fuel tank can be insulated and a heating coil using <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> is run through the tank. The fuel tanks can be switched over when the fuel is sufficiently warm. A similar method can be used to operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of leaks, {{antifreeze}} chemicals such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol may retain their basic properties indefinitely. By contrast, corrosion inhibitors are gradually used up, and must be replenished from time to time. Larger systems (such as HVAC systems) are often monitored by specialist firms which take responsibility for adding corrosion inhibitors and regulating coolant composition. For simplicity, most automotive manufacturers recommend periodic complete replacement of <b>engine</b> <b>coolant,</b> to simultaneously renew corrosion inhibitors and remove accumulated contaminants.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the cylinder block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} Duke has rescued the Jennys one by one, his General friend informs {{him that he}} can destroy the ship by {{shutting}} down its <b>engine's</b> <b>coolant</b> system. He does just that, then teleports [...] "Jenny 5" [...] back to Earth. The General's teleportation system is unable to beam out Duke Nukem too, however, requiring him to wade through more alien assailants in order to transport out using their teleporters. The ship subsequently blows up, and Duke Nukem arrives safely back on Earth.|$|R
25|$|A heat {{exchanger}} is a device used to transfer heat between a solid object and a fluid, or between {{two or more}} fluids. The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing {{or they may be}} in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries, natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a {{heat exchanger}} is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol {{was widely}} used in windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
500|$|The I-3 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. It was provided with differential Frise-type ailerons. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers and the tailskid was made from duralumin. The main gear could be replaced by skis like those fitted to the Polikarpov R-1. The engine's semi-retractable radiator extended below the fuselage behind the rear main gear struts. Two fuel tanks were fitted, the main one in the fuselage, but a small [...] tank, mainly used to start the engine, was in the center section of the upper wing, along with the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> tank. A total of [...] of fuel was carried. Initially the I-3 was fitted with two fixed [...] synchronized Vickers machine guns, but these were later replaced by PV-1 machine guns. A central OP-1 optical gunsight was provided with a KP-5 ring sight offset to starboard. Some aircraft had bomb racks to carry two [...] bombs.|$|E
40|$|Over 120 organic {{compounds}} {{have been investigated}} as potential corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in simulated <b>engine</b> <b>coolants.</b> A relationship has been found between the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and inhibitor performance (Rp). With straight chain alkyl carboxylates, maximum inhibition was found for C 6 - C 10 monocarboxylates and C 7 - C 12 dicarboxylates. Polarization curves for selected inhibitors and the Ecorr- Rp relationship suggest these compounds affect only the anodic dissolution. The inhibitor effectiveness of sebacate {{was found to be}} unaffected by stirring or the presence of corrosion products...|$|R
5000|$|The BV 238 V1, {{bearing the}} four-letter Stammkennzeichen factory radio code of RO + EZ, first flew in April 1944.

5000|$|An {{automotive}} {{thermoelectric generator}} (ATEG) is {{a device that}} converts some of the waste heat of an internal combustion engine (IC) into electricity using the Seebeck Effect. A typical ATEG consists of four main elements: A hot-side heat exchanger, a cold-side heat exchanger, thermoelectric materials, and a compression assembly system. ATEGs can convert waste heat from an <b>engine's</b> <b>coolant</b> or exhaust into electricity. By reclaiming this otherwise lost energy, ATEGs decrease fuel consumed by the electric generator load on the engine. However, {{the cost of the}} unit and the extra fuel consumed due to its weight must be also considered.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> gets too hot, it might boil while inside the engine, causing voids (pockets of steam), leading to {{localized}} hot spots and the catastrophic {{failure of the}} engine. If plain water were {{to be used as}} an <b>engine</b> <b>coolant,</b> it would promote galvanic corrosion. Proper <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> and a pressurized coolant system can help obviate the problems which make plain water incompatible with automotive engines. With proper antifreeze, a wide temperature range can be tolerated by the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant,</b> such as [...] to [...] for 50% (by volume) propylene glycol diluted with water and a 15 psi pressurized coolant system.|$|E
2500|$|The center hub {{rotating}} assembly (CHRA) houses the shaft {{that connects the}} compressor impeller and turbine. It also must contain a bearing system to suspend the shaft, allowing it to rotate at very high speed with minimal friction. For instance, in automotive applications the CHRA typically uses a thrust bearing or ball bearing lubricated by a constant supply of pressurized engine oil. The CHRA may also be considered [...] "water-cooled" [...] by having an entry and exit point for <b>engine</b> <b>coolant.</b> Water-cooled models use <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> to keep lubricating oil cooler, avoiding possible oil coking (destructive distillation of engine oil) from the extreme heat in the turbine. The development of air-foil bearings removed this risk.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{antifreeze}} {{has been}} mixed {{with water and}} put into use, it periodically needs to be maintained. If <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> leaks, boils, or if the cooling system needs to be drained and refilled, the antifreeze's freeze protection {{will need to be}} considered. In other cases a vehicle may need to be operated in a colder environment, requiring more antifreeze and less water. Three methods are commonly employed to determine the freeze point of the solution: ...|$|E
3000|$|... 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PDO) and {{terephthalic acid}} (TPA) {{are used to}} produce polytrimethylene {{terephthalate}} (PTT), a high performance polymer that is used in apparel, upholstery, carpet, specialty resins and other applications, where properties such as softness, comfort-stretch and recovery, dye ability, and easy-care are desired. Purified 1, 3 -PDO may also be used in adhesives, resins, laminates, powder coatings, films, solvents (ink-jet dyes), medicines, cosmetics, <b>engine</b> <b>coolants,</b> detergents, insect repellents and fragrances (DuPont [2014]). Demand for PTT {{was estimated to be}} approximately 400, 000 to 800, 000 tones in 2013. Therefore, low-cost production of 1, 3 -PDO is important for the competitiveness in this market (Nakamura and Whited [2003]).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years, {{automobiles}} had their radiator caps {{outside of the}} hood {{and on top of}} the grille which also served as an indicator of the temperature of the <b>engine's</b> <b>coolant</b> fluid. The Boyce MotoMeter Company was issued a patent in 1912 for a radiator cap that incorporated a thermometer that was visible to the driver with a sensor that measured the heat of the water vapor, rather than the water itself. This became a useful gauge for the driver because many early engines did not have water pumps, but a circulation system based on the [...] "thermo-syphon" [...] principle as in the Ford Model T.|$|R

2500|$|With {{a normal}} {{operating}} temperature of [...] prior to the recall switching to a [...] thermostat, the midmounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator.

50|$|A charge-air cooler {{is simply}} an all-encompassing term, meaning that it cools the turbo's air charge before it is routed into the engine.

2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars.
