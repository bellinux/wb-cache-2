30|$|An {{increase}} in the fluid content increases electrical conductivity (e.g., Nesbitt 1993), increases seismic wave attenuation (e.g., Jackson et al. 2004), and decreases seismic velocities (e.g., Mainprice 1997). Laboratory studies showed that electrical conductivity is very sensitive to fluid fraction (e.g., Caricchi et al. 2011; Yoshino et al. 2012), suggesting that a small change in fluid fraction can explain the differences in electrical conductivity between the different anomalies plotted in Figure  3 (assuming a similar temperature).The relationship between <b>electrical</b> conductivity and <b>seismic</b> wave attenuation presented in Figure  3 suggests that the fluid conditions affect <b>electrical</b> conductivity and <b>seismic</b> wave attenuation in a similar manner, assuming that fluids {{are responsible for the}} electric and <b>seismic</b> <b>signals.</b> Further <b>electrical</b> and <b>seismic</b> investigations are needed to demonstrate if the slope (or intercept) of this empirical relationship depends on the amount of fluids and their storage conditions and therefore place quantitative constraints on the nature of zones of fluid accumulation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Seismic</b> <b>signals</b> {{generated}} by artificially released avalanches were studied f’rom the seismological viewpoint {{in the time}} and frequency domains {{in an attempt to}} characterise them for monitoring purposes. The avalanches were artificially released and the corresponding <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> were recorded at different sites within a radius of up to 3 km together with the video images with a common time reference. The results obtained indicate that avalanches following the same path and recorded at the same site present similar <b>seismic</b> <b>signals.</b> A relationship between the avalanche <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> (amplitude, frequency content and wave trains) and the avalanche path was observed. The sources of the recorded <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> corresponds to avalanche path slope changes, interaction with obstacles and phenomena associated with the stopping stage of the avalanche. Local site effects were also present. These results lend support to the use of <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> as an efficient method of monitoring areas where avalanches are frequent and human observation is difficult...|$|R

These two signals {{have been shown}} to interact in such a manner that the <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> alters a female’s response to the visual signal, leading to a putative increased importance of visual signaling {{in the presence of a}} <b>seismic</b> <b>signal.</b> Experiments leading to this attention-focusing hypothesis relied in part on the video playback technique, eliciting the question of its significance under more biologically relevant conditions. Here, we directly examine female mate choice of males with differing visual signals (foreleg pigmentation) both in the presence and absence of a <b>seismic</b> courtship <b>signal.</b> We first quantified the natural variation of male foreleg pigmentation within a population of S. uetzi. The proportion of the tibia covered in pigmentation was found to be positively correlated with male weight, suggesting that this signal may convey reliable information about male size. Visual signals of live males were then manipulated into two treatments: black and brown male foreleg tibias, representing the extreme ends of the natural variation found. The <b>seismic</b> <b>signaling</b> environment was also manipulated into two treatments: <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> present and absent. Mating frequency was higher in the presence of a <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> than in its absence, but there was no interaction between the <b>seismic</b> and visual <b>signaling</b> treatments. Females mated with black and brown males equally whether a <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> was present or absent. This study suggests that inexperienced females do not distinguish between males of different manipulated foreleg pigmentations in mate-choice decisions, even when in the presence of a <b>seismic</b> courtship <b>signal...</b>|$|R

40|$|Unraveling the {{function}} and evolutionary history of multimodal signaling is a difficult, yet common task of much research in animal communication. Here, I investigated multimodal signal {{function in the}} visual and seismic courtship display of the wolf spider Schizocosa stridulans and found that only the <b>seismic</b> courtship <b>signal</b> was important for mating success. First, copulation frequency was assessed in the presence/ absence of both visual and <b>seismic</b> courtship <b>signals.</b> The <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> was sufficient for successful copulation, whereas the visual signal was neither necessary nor sufficient, suggesting that the signals are not redundant and do not function as backups. Next, female receptivity to video courtship sequences with altered male ornamentation was assessed {{in the presence of}} a live male’s <b>seismic</b> <b>signal.</b> Female receptivity did not depend on male foreleg ornamentation. Instead, females performed receptivity displays equally to all video stimuli, demonstrating that in the presence of <b>seismic</b> <b>signaling,</b> receptivity is independent of visual signaling—indicating <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> dominance. Finally, female responses to isolated seismic cues from crickets and courting males suggest that <b>seismic</b> courtship <b>signals</b> carry both location and identification information.

A total of 28  blocks, with masses ranging from 76 to 472  kg, {{were used for the}} experiment. An instrumentation combining video cameras and seismometers was deployed along the travelled path. The video cameras allow reconstructing the trajectories of the blocks and estimating their velocities {{at the time of the}} different impacts with the slope. These data are compared to the recorded <b>seismic</b> <b>signals.</b> As the distance between the falling block and the seismic sensors at the time of each impact is known, we were able to determine the associated <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude corrected for propagation and attenuation effects.

It is therefore desirable to consider the use of automated systems capable of detection and identification of potential threats. This thesis describes an investigation into acoustic and seismic methods for achieving such a system specifically for commercial road vehicles. Accurate algorithms {{have been developed for}} recognition of moving vehicles using fusion of acoustic and <b>seismic</b> <b>signals.</b> It has been found that <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> are less susceptible to interfering signals, making them optimal for detection of vehicles. Their much narrower bandwidth also increases processing efficiency and speed. Thus, the algorithm developed utilises firstly only <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> to detect vehicle presence, and then employs both acoustic and <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> for classifying type of the vehicle. The detection algorithm is purely time domain and uses seismic Log Energy together with a modification of Time Domain Signal Coding. The best detection accuracy obtained was 97. 71 % with Support Vector Machine and 99. 02 % with Learning Vector Quantisation Neural Networks. The classification algorithm to distinguish between trucks and cars utilises three relatively simple time domain methods: Zero-Crossing Rate, Log Energy and Autocorrelation of seismic signals; combined with LPC coefficients collected from acoustic signals. Classification with either SVM or LVQ reached 93. 30 % or 80. 80 % respectively.
