Riga-based Parex Bank, the largest Latvian-owned bank, was vulnerable as it held large sums from foreign depositors (which began withdrawing assets {{around the time of}} Lehman Brothers September 2008 collapse) and was heavily exposed to real estate loans. Latvia's government took a controlling interest in Parex in November 2008, spinning off Citadele banka as a good bank in August 2010. The bad assets were left behind, effectively creating a bad bank with the original Parex Banka name and no retail depositors.

5000|$|According to ABCT, {{a period}} of [...] "malinvestment" [...] is caused by {{a period of}} {{excessive}} business lending by banks, and this credit expansion is later followed by a sharp contraction and period of <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> sales (liquidation) which were purchased with overleveraged debt. The initial expansion is believed to be caused by fractional reserve banking encouraging excessive lending and borrowing at interest rates below what full reserve banks would demand. Due to the availability of relatively inexpensive funds, entrepreneurs invest in capital goods for more roundabout, [...] "longer process of production" [...] technologies. Borrowers take their newly acquired funds and purchase new capital goods, thereby causing an increase in the proportion of aggregate spending allocated to capital goods rather than consumer goods. However, such a shift is inevitably unsustainable over time due to mispricing caused by excessive credit creation by the banks and must reverse itself eventually as it is always unsustainable. The longer this distorting dislocation continues, the more violent and disruptive will be the necessary re-adjustment process.|$|E
40|$|Market {{distress}} can be {{the catalyst}} of a deleveraging wave, as in the 2007 / 08 financial crisis. This paper demonstrates how market distress and deleveraging can fuel {{each other in the}} presence of adverse selection problems in asset markets. At the core of the detrimental feedback loop is agents' desire to reduce their reliance on <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> markets by decreasing their leverage which in turn amplifies the adverse selection problem in asset markets. In the extreme case, this leads to a market breakdown. I find that adverse selection creates both an "ex-ante" inefficiency because it distorts agents' long-term leverage choices and an "interim" inefficiency because it distorts agents' short-term liquidity management.

40|$|We {{present a}} model to study the {{dynamics}} of risk premia during crises in asset markets where the marginal investor is a financial intermediary. Intermediaries face a constraint on raising equity capital. When the constraint binds, so that intermediaries ’ equity capital is scarce, risk premia rise to reflect the capital scarcity. We calibrate the model and show that it does well in matching two aspects of crises: the nonlinearity of risk premia during crisis episodes; and, the speed of adjustment in risk premia from a crisis back to pre-crisis levels. We use the model to quantitatively {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} a variety of central bank policies, including reducing intermediaries ’ borrowing costs, infusing equity capital, and directly intervening in <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> markets. All of these policies are effective in aiding the recovery from a crisis. Infusing equity capital into intermediaries is particularly effective because it attacks the equity capital constraint that {{is at the root of}} the crisis in our model...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{share of}} {{financial}} assets that are held and managed by large institutional investors whose desired trades move asset prices {{is at odds}} with the traditional competitive assumption that investors are small and take prices as given. This paper relaxes the traditional price-taking assumption and instead presents a dynamic multiple asset model of imperfect competition in asset markets among large investors who differ in their risk aversion. The model is used to study asset price dynamics during an LTCM-like scenario in which market rumors of <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> sales are followed at a later date by the sales themselves. Using the model, it is shown that large investors front-run distressed sales; asset prices overshoot their long-run fundamentals; and asset pricing models experience temporary breakdown. During the period of model breakdown assets equilibrium returns are explained by the market portfolio and by transient liquidity factors.

40|$|Financial {{intermediation}} transforms short-term {{liquid assets}} into long-term capital assets. As a result, risk taking, {{in the form}} of long-term commitments despite unresolved short-term funding risk, is an essential element of intermediation. If such funding risk must be addressed by costly recapitalization and/or <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> sales due to capital market frictions, an increase in uncertainty can cause a disruption in the intermediation process by forcing risk-neutral intermediaries to behave in a risk-averse manner. Our analysis examines this behavior theoretically and empirically. We first develop a dynamic macroeconomic model in which the balance sheet/liquidity condition of financial intermediaries {{plays an important role in}} the determination of asset prices and economic activity under time-varying uncertainty. Second, we present new evidence on the importance of uncertainty facing financial intermediaries for credit terms and volume and for aggregate economic activity, thereby partially quantifying the significance of capital market frictions. We adopt a structural identification strategy in which the predictions of our theory, {{in the form of}} sign restrictions, play an important role.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{estimate}} the market’s opinion of ex-ante costs of financial distress (CFD) from a structurally motivated {{model of the}} industry, using a panel dataset of monthly market values of debt and equity for 244 firms in 22 industries between 1994 and 2004. Costs of financial distress are identified from the market values and systematic risk of a company’s debt and equity. The market expects costs of financial distress to be 0 - 11 % of firm value for observed levels of leverage. In bankruptcy, the costs of distress can rise as high as 31 %. Across industries, CFD are driven primarily by the potential for under-investment problems and <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> fire-sales, as measured by spending {{on research and development}} and the proportion of intangible assets in the firm.

40|$|We {{study the}} trading {{dynamics}} in a <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> market with search frictions. When trading {{of a financial}} asset ceases due to an adverse selection problem, a large player can resurrect the market by buying up bad assets which involves assuming financial losses. The player can, however, delay the intervention: a mere announcement today of intervening at a later point in time can cause markets to function again. This announcement effect {{gives rise to a}} trade-off between the size and the timing of the intervention. The optimal intervention involves balancing the financial losses from the intervention and the social cost of illiquid markets. If the losses are small and a market is deemed important, it is optimal to ensure that the market functions continuously. In this case, there is a fixed cost associated with intervention delay, making it optimal to intervene as early as possible at the minimum size. As losses increase and the importance of the market declines, the intervention is optimally delayed and it can be optimal to rely on the announcement effect by increasing the size of the intervention. Furthermore, our finding highlights the importance of search friction in the formation of market distress, the determination of policy announcement effect, and the optimal design of intervention.

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the recent}} {{subprime}} credit crisis, we examine the asset-pricing implications of a market in which assets can become severely distressed as investors learn that an adverse event has occurred, but don’t initially know {{the full extent of}} the damage. We show that the “train wreck ” occurs in two stages. First, there is a major credit contraction as leveraged investors attempt to reduce their funding risk. As the debt sector shrinks, safe assets such as riskless bonds soar in value while the risk premium for risky assets increases. The price of the <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> falls, but is cushioned by the decline in the riskless interest rate. Risk sharing is affected as the most-risk-averse agents put more of their portfolio into risky assets. In the second stage, uncertainty is resolved, and market leverage, interest rates, and nondistressed asset values return to their previous levels. The resulting time variation in risk premium induces significant predictability into asset returns throughout the distress period. To examine the empirical implications of the model, we conduct the first large-scale empirical investigation into the pricing of subprime asset-backed CDOs using data for the ABX indexes. We find that negative shocks to the ABX index result in contractions in the size of the short-term credit market, increases in the value of both short-term and long-term Treasury bonds, and increases in the trading activity of financial stocks. We also find that ABX returns have significant forecast ability for Treasury bonds and the stock market as far as three weeks ahead, suggestive of a “deer-in-headlights ” effect in the financial markets. Using fixed-income derivatives data, we show that similar effects were present in the market during the 1998 LTCM/hedge-fund crisis...|$|E
40|$|Chronic food {{insecurity}} {{is a reality}} for the poor in rural Ethiopia. The majority of these poor households depend on rainfed agriculture which is characterized by uncertainty. This increases vulnerability among the poor to weather shocks. For 20 years after the 1984 - 85 famine, the response to {{food insecurity}} in Ethiopia {{was based on a}} system of emergency relief. This was effective at averting severe food crises, but the delivery of relief was unpredictable and often failed to stop <b>distressed</b> <b>asset</b> sales. In 2005, the Government of Ethiopia and a consortium of donors implemented the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP) as a social protection program whose transfers would provide more reliable consumption insurance against food insecurity and economic shocks. The PSNP was implemented in the food insecure regions of the country and operates as a safety net by providing transfers to the poor through public works or direct support. The PSNP is complemented by the Other Food Security Program (OFSP) which provides skill and monetary assistance for improving agricultural practices. Hence, the PSNP helps maintain assets and the OFSP facilitates building of new ones. Given that asset depletion is an important form of coping for the poor despite their small asset base and that the lack of assets themselves may lead to food insecurity, asset formation {{is an important factor in}} overcoming this vicious cycle. This paper examines the impact of the PSNP on food security and coping mechanisms among the rural poor in Ethiopia. Using newly collected panel data covering 3700 households from 2006 - 2008 across four principal regions served by the PSNP, we employ various matching estimators to compare the impacts of the programs between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries residing in the same villages. First, we examine the impact of the program on food security, measured by food expenditures and calorie intake. Second, we compare asset levels between the beneficiary and non-beneficiary households t...|$|E
