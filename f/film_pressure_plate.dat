50|$|The top, {{bottom and}} the lens base cover {{were made from}} pressed steel of about ½mm thickness. The rest of the chassis {{and most of the}} {{internal}} parts were made from mould-injected plastic. Metal was only used for parts where wear and tear make it unavoidable, such as the <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the film transport cogwheels.|$|E
50|$|Leica IIIf and its {{predecessors}} {{had used a}} knob to advance the film. For fear of tearing the film, early M3s had a double stroke advance lever, like the Neoca 2s would. Later models (from model no 915 251) had single-stroke levers, which quickened up operation of the camera. Another type of variation is in the <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> used. Early models used a glass plate to keep the film flat; later models used a metal plate.|$|E
50|$|The first Kodak 35 has no rangefinder. It resembles {{slightly}} to cameras like the German Wirgin Edinex and Adox Adrette. It takes thirty-six 24×36 mm frames on 135 film. The precision molded black Bakelite body has satin-chromed {{top and base}} plates, and a collapsible finder is mounted on top center. The removable Bakelite back with the attached base plate slides easily off for film handling. It is secured by a centrally located wing key in the base plate. Turning the key also slackens the spring tension of the chromed steel <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> a very unusual feature presumably incorporated to facilitate reassembling the camera rather than preventing scratching the film during rewind, {{which would have been}} a novel feature.|$|E
40|$|Film {{unflatness}} {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that reduce the accuracy of photogrammetric method in coordinate determination. The problem {{is that it is not}} possible to model by internal orientation. The CONTAX RTSll 1 is a 35 mm camera with an in-built vacuum attached to the camera's back plane. The camera incorporates a ceramic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and real time vacuum system which attracts the <b>film</b> onto the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> when the firing is depressed. It was tested to see if it did provide a reliable result. A calibration range consisting of 94 retroreflective targets at CURTIN University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia was used in the test...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an offset <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> comprising an emulsion carrier {{and a top}} coating for printing using fountain solution. The top coating can be changed by development and {{has at least one}} hydrophile and at least one hydrophobe and oliophile component. They are distributed ahead of the latent picture production and the development of the surface so that the surface of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is hydrophile for positive <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> and hydrophobe or oliophile for negative <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> A latent, electrostatic picture can be produced in the top coating.

5000|$|A few minor {{modifications}} {{were also}} made to internal parts, notably to the <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> spring that changes {{through a variety}} of shapes from rod to flat shape. Most, if not all shutters alternatives have a No. 5 Cable Release socket with a tiny removable coin-slotted screw plug, while the later ones also have a Kodak type flash synchroniser contact post. A metal band inscribed [...] "Made in U.S.A." [...] was attached {{to the top of the}} shutter housing cover plate, save for the last year or two of production. The milling pattern on the focusing wheel front goes {{through a variety of}} styles from flat to a pattern of several concentric circles.|$|E
50|$|The Pentax 6×7, {{designated}} product model number of 23400 by Asahi Pentax, {{is similar to}} any traditional 35mm SLR camera except in size. The hefty camera with a general dimension body of 7.25 inches × 4.5 inches × 3.75 inches / 18 cm × 11 cm × 9.5 cm and with the standard prism and 105 mm lens would bring it to 7.5 inches × 5.75 inches × 6.5inches / 18 cm × 14.5 cm × 17 cm. Users familiar with the diminutive cousins would find the Pentax 6×7 an easy transition due to {{the layout of the}} camera. Differing only in the location of the shutter speed knob as it is located on the left hand top. Location of the lens release is {{on the left side of}} the mirror housing, the shutter release and film advance lever are located on the right-hand side of the top. As naming conventions implies, the 6×7 indicates that this is a medium format camera and the negative produced is 6 cm by 7 cm (actual format 56mm X 70mm) and additionally the successors 67 and 67II remain the same format. The Pentax 6×7 has the ability to use either the 120 or 220 roll film, which produces ten or twenty respectively (twenty-one for the 1969 version). A small slotted selector on the right-hand side next under the film advance lever of the camera selects the film type (properly operated when film door is opened prior to selecting), and also the <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> inside has positions for either type, the thickness of the films being different as it passes the 'main roller' towards the 'take-up' spool. The pressure plate also maintains film flatness in this horizontal design during exposure, aiding the extreme sharpness across the entire image for which the camera is renowned. Other systems use film tension alone, or against rails at the film's edge, in more compact vertical-feed magazines found in 6×6 or 6×4.5 formats. The synonymous or standard equipment includes the Super Takumar and later the Super-Multi-Coated TAKUMAR/6×7 1:2.4 f=105 lens and the pentaprism finder that allows for the 'through-the-lens actual image (90% of actual area) of what is being composed.|$|E
50|$|The TMA-1 and TMA-1A are circular, plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The mine {{consists of}} an upper plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> and the lower body containing the main charge. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has eight triangular raised sectors, and a central fuze cap. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is {{held in place by}} four plastic pins, which when suffient pressure is applied, shear allowing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to collapse onto the mine body, triggering the UANU-1 fuze. A secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine, allowing the use of anti-handling devices. The mine is found in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.|$|R
50|$|The T-AB-1 is a {{rectangular}} plastic cased Brazilian anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a T-AB-1 anti-personnel mine as a fuze. The AP mine is {{inserted into the}} body of the AT mine under a large stiff ABS plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is fastened in place by a number of shear pins, which are designed to give way under a pressure of 200 kg.

40|$|In this article, an aerostatic {{thrust bearing}} with annular elastic uniform <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> {{structure}} was designed. In {{order to obtain}} a relationship between bearing capacity and stiffness of aerostatic thrust bearing designed in this article, first, the stress field mechanics model of the gas thrust bearing {{was established in the}} static. Second, deformation control equations of the elastic uniform <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and gas lubrication Reynolds equation were established according to the flow continuity principle. Here, finite element mesh of gas flow field was woven using the technology of grid overlapping and grid stitching. Then, gas–solid coupling control equations were solved using the numerical method. Gas <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution and gas static bearing capacity of thrust bearing were analyzed. Function relationship between bearing capacity and the stiffness and the thickness of gas film was obtained. Finally, the results of theory analysis and experiment were compared. The results of the comparison can be listed as, under the effect of gas pressure, orifice area and the equilibrium pressure groove depth are changed due to elastic deformation of the elastic uniform <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The static stiffness of aerostatic thrust bearing with elastic equilibrium pressure groove increased by 30 % than the static stiffness of aerostatic thrust bearing with rigid equilibrium pressure groove. The maximum carrying capacity occurred in the gas film thickness of 3. 5 [*]µm. The maximum static stiffness appeared in the gas film thickness of 5. 5 [*]µm. It {{can be seen from the}} comparison results of experiments and theoretical analysis that data results of gas film thickness and the bearing capacity are the same. The feasibility of the theoretical analysis method is validated...|$|R
5000|$|The Type I mine had a {{cylindrical}} {{case with}} a domed upper <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> that is held above the main case of the mine by the spring-loaded central fuze well. A strip of canvas around the circumference seals {{the gap between the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the main body of the}} mine. The Type II uses a smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> that does not cover the entire top surface of the mine, giving the center of the mine a raised appearance. In every other detail, the mines are identical.|$|R
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> squeezing the friction disk between the inner <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the outer cover plate.

A simulation analysis of thermal stress coupling of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been made in order to calculate temperature distribution and the stress level of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> A new improved solution has been proposed. The result shows that although the plate quality is almost same after the improvement, the temperature peak is reducing about 1 o C, the maximum stress decreased 38. 6 %, and the axial stiffness improved significantly...|$|R
50|$|An Elsie mine {{has a small}} raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{top surface}} of the mine which {{is covered with a}} small pad of flock material. The {{flocking}} material is designed to act as camouflage. Sustained downward pressure on the small <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (by the victim's foot) cocks a spring-loaded striker. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been pressed down approximately 2.5 cm, a single retaining ball bearing flips side-ways into a recess. When the ball bearing flips side-ways, it frees the striker (held under tension by a coiled spring beneath it) which snaps upwards into the stab detonator, thereby detonating the explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|The NV-41 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consists of a square wooden box with a filling plug on the bottom. The top of the box is covered by a thin pressure lid, which covers a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> held up by a spring. Sufficient pressure on the lid collapses it down onto the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Downward movement of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> moves down a pressure plunger, which in turn levers up the striker retaining lever, releasing the spring-loaded striker and allowing it to impact the stab sensitive detonator, triggering the main charge.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that soil–water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{plays an important role in}} unsaturated soil mechanics, but the measurement of SWCC is inconvenient.

In this study, the effects of sample dimensions and shapes on the balance time of measuring SWCCs using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and the shape of SWCCs are investigated. It can be found that the sample dimensions and shapes have apparent influence on the balance time. The testing durations for circular samples with smaller diameters and annular samples with larger contact area are significantly shortened. However, there is little effect of sample dimensions and shapes on the shape of SWCCs. Its mechanism is explored and discussed in details through analysing the principle of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and microstructure of the sample.

50|$|The TM-35 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine has a metal case, which is rectangular with a carrying handle {{on one side and}} a large raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> in the centre. Sufficient pressure on the central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> presses down on one end of an internal see-saw like lever, which removes the retaining pin from an MUV fuze, releasing the striker, triggering the mine.|$|R
5000|$|The casing of the Tellermine is circular, rising {{towards the}} {{center with a}} large flat <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> A {{rectangular}} metal carrying handle is fitted {{to the side of}} the mine. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> sits over the fuze well which can hold either a T.Mi.Z.42 shear pin fuze or T.Mi.Z.43 ball release fuze. The mine is armed by removing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> screwing a fuze into the fuze well, then screwing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> back on again. At the bottom of the fuze well is a PETN booster charge, surrounded by the doughnut-shaped main charge of TNT explosive. The mine has secondary fuze wells located on the side and base to enable anti-handling devices to be fitted if required. Additionally, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze features an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the fuze is inserted and the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin in the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, any attempt to disarm the mine by unscrewing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (to remove the fuze) will automatically trigger detonation. Since it is impossible to determine which fuze type has been installed, no <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> should be removed from a Tellermine. The Tellermine 43 can also be fitted with an optional tilt-rod fuze, which is screwed into the side fuze well. Anti-tank mines with this type of fuze were capable of inflicting much more damage to armored vehicles. This was demonstrated numerous times in the Normandy Campaign. On June 8th, 1944, a Sherman tank was accompanying the 1st Ranger Battalion in an attack on the Maisy battery. It ran over a Tellermine and was blown to pieces, with a total crew loss. Sergeant John Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Slaughter describes the scene: [...] "The explosive energy from that hidden teller mine sent the 32-ton Sherman tank into the ditch on its side. This scene echoed the bloody, grotesque carnage of D-Day. One minute they were healthy young men, and the next minute they were bloody arms and legs wrapped around bloody torsos. We found body parts and shoes with the feet still stuck in them twenty-five yards away." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{significant}} difference between the PMN-1 and PMN-2 is that the PMN-2 (a mid-1970s design) contains a more modern fuze with an integral baffle beneath the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> This and the X-shaped design of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> makes the PMN-2 much more resistant to traditional explosive mine countermeasures, which use sudden overpressure to detonate mines. It can therefore be regarded as a blast resistant mine. In contrast, the PMN-1 (a 1950s design) can successfully be cleared by such methods.|$|R
