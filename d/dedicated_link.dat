2500|$|Being a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> to the Railway Station, {{the number}} 6 buses had been timed to meet {{arriving}} trains from various locations around Christchurch. [...] As more routes {{were converted to}} bus operation, some were routed past the Railway Station {{and were able to}} alleviate some of this load. [...] The Worcester Street route remained linked to the Railway Station after the Dallington and Wainoni routes were assigned to new cross-town services with the Bryndwr and Wharenui routes respectively in October 1955.|$|E
5000|$|Initially GPRS roaming {{was based}} on {{complicated}} relationships between individual operators with each operator requiring a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> to each different partner so that , whereby [...] {{is the number of}} global operators that would require a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link.</b> This meant that mobile subscribers who wanted to use GPRS whilst roaming could only do so if their operator had a direct agreement with the operator in the country or area in which they were roaming.|$|E

50|$|Mediterranean Aviation Company Limited saw its {{beginnings}} in 1978 as a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> between Europe and the remote airfields {{of the oil}} and gas industries. Today better known as Medavia, it has evolved into an aviation powerhouse.|$|E
50|$|A {{point-to-point}} link is a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> that connects exactly two communication facilities (e.g., two nodes of a network, an intercom station at an entryway {{with a single}} internal intercom station, a radio path between two points, etc.).|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 1, the {{proposed}} system consists of five functional units. These are parsing and classification unit, framing unit, network control unit, application management unit, and radio control unit. These functional units {{are connected to}} each other through <b>dedicated</b> <b>links.</b> The functions of these units are described as follows.|$|R
40|$|A highly {{parallel}} {{multiprocessor architecture}} for low-level processing of digital images {{is described in}} this paper. It {{is based on the}} ideas of distributed memory, data replication to reduce the need for interprocessor communications, and <b>dedicated</b> <b>links</b> between processors to eliminate the need for a common bus for interprocessor communications...|$|R

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{benefit of}} mobile deep linking {{is the ability}} for marketers and app developers to bring users directly into the specific location within their app with a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link.</b> Just as deep links made the web more usable, mobile deep links {{do the same for}} mobile apps.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} topology with a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> {{between two}} endpoints. Easiest to understand, of the variations of point-to-point topology, is a point-to-point communications channel that appears, to the user, to be permanently {{associated with the}} two endpoints. A child's tin can telephone {{is one example of}} a physical dedicated channel.|$|E
50|$|A GPRS roaming {{exchange}} (GRX) {{acts as a}} hub for GPRS connections from roaming users, {{removing the}} need for a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> between each GPRS service provider. It was developed to facilitate a more efficient way for operators to interconnect networks, and played a large part in the transition to third-generation systems.|$|E
50|$|The GRX {{operator}} {{can therefore}} {{act as a}} hub, allowing a GPRS subscriber to interconnect with many roaming partners {{without the need for}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>links.</b> For operators this is advantageous in that it allows quicker implementation of roaming partners, faster time to market for new operators and lower capital expenditure seeing as it is a scalable solution depending on bandwidth and quality of service requirements. Because the interconnection between the visited PLMN and home PLMN uses private GRX networks there is also no need to maintain Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels over the public internet.|$|R
5000|$|Controversially, the {{redevelopment}} {{was the first}} major sporting facility in Australia with no car parking, primarily due to concerns with traffic congestion in the surrounding residential neighborhood. The stadium's proximity to pubs, restaurants, cafes, bars and the XXXX brewery, together with <b>dedicated</b> pedestrian <b>links</b> to Milton railway station and Brisbane CBD adds to the match day experience and is seen as a model for new stadiums and large entertainment venues. The stadium redevelopment has been the catalyst for the Barracks urban renewal development at Petrie Terrace midway along the <b>dedicated</b> pedestrian <b>link</b> to the CBD.|$|R
5000|$|There was a <b>dedicated</b> rail <b>link</b> {{bus that}} linked [...] with the community. It was only {{available}} to rail passengers, and operated to Penywaun, Hirwaun, Cefn Rhigos and Rhigos.|$|R
5000|$|The SAS [...] "bus" [...] {{operates}} point-to-point {{while the}} SCSI bus is multidrop. Each SAS device is {{connected by a}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> to the initiator, unless an expander is used. If one initiator is connected to one target, there is no opportunity for contention; with parallel SCSI, even this situation could cause contention.|$|E
50|$|DOCSIS 2.0 is {{also used}} over {{microwave}} frequencies (10 GHz) in Ireland by Digiweb, using dedicated wireless links rather than HFC network. At each subscriber premises the ordinary CM is connected to an antenna box which converts to/from microwave frequencies and transmits/receives on 10 GHz. Each customer has a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> but the transmitter mast must be {{in line of sight}} (most sites are hilltop).|$|E
5000|$|Access {{networks}} usually {{also must}} support point-to-point {{technologies such as}} Ethernet, which bypasses any outside plant splitter to achieve a <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> to the Central Office. Some PON networks use a [...] "home run" [...] topology where roadside cabinets only contain patch panels so that all splitters are located centrally. While a 20% higher capital cost could be expected, home run networks may encourage a more competitive wholesale market since providers' equipment can achieve higher utilisation.|$|E
50|$|A {{switched}} mesh is {{a wireless}} mesh network that uses multiple radios to communicate via <b>dedicated</b> mesh backhaul <b>links</b> to each neighboring node in the mesh. Here {{all of the}} available bandwidth of each separate radio channel is <b>dedicated</b> to the <b>link</b> to the neighboring node. The total available bandwidth {{is the sum of}} the bandwidth of each of the <b>links.</b> Each <b>dedicated</b> mesh <b>link</b> is on a separate channel, ensuring that forwarded traffic does not use any bandwidth from any other link in the mesh. As a result, a switched mesh is capable of much higher capacities and transmission rates than a shared mesh and grows in capacity as nodes are added to the mesh.|$|R
50|$|E-DDC Version 1.2, {{approved}} December 2007, introduced {{support for}} DisplayPort (which has no <b>dedicated</b> DDC2B <b>links</b> and uses its bidirectional auxiliary channel for EDID and MCCS communication) and DisplayID standards.|$|R

Traditional TCP implementations have severe problems in reaching the necessary performance. In the recent past, researchers have shown that TCP implementations can be scaled to achieve multi-gigabit per second speeds over high-bandwidth high-delay networks. The ability of TCP to scale to high speeds opens possibilities for very large data transfers over vast distances. We analyze here whether TCP can fulfill this task and what problems we are faced with. We also examine TCP {{in the context of}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>links</b> (Lambdas) ...|$|R

This was provided on-site via a proprietary and often redundant hardware installation, such as Reuters Market Data System (RMDS) or Triarch. One of the early attractions for dealers was the integration with Microsoft Excel and the instant messaging facility for sending messages to other dealing desks. The flexible Kobra {{client software}} allowed {{for a variety of}} real-time and historic market data visualizations and custom analytics.

5000|$|The CF {{talks to}} other EKMS {{elements}} {{through a variety}} of media, communication devices, and networks, either through direct distance dialing using STU-III (data mode) or <b>dedicated</b> <b>link</b> access using KG-84s. During the transition to full electronic key, the 3.5-inch floppy disk and 9-track magnetic tape are also supported. A common user interface, the TCP/IP-based message service, is the primary method of communication with the CF. The message service permits EKMS elements to store EKMS messages that include electronic key for later retrieval by another EKMS element.|$|E
