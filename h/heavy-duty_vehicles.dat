25|$|In October 2010, the EPA {{granted a}} waiver to allow up to 15% of ethanol blended with {{gasoline}} {{to be sold}} only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2007 or later, representing about 15% of vehicles on U.S. roads. In January 2011, the waiver was expanded to authorize use of E15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles. The EPA also decided not to grant any waiver for E15 use in any motorcycles, <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles,</b> or nonroad engines because current testing data do not support such a waiver. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the E15 waivers now cover 62% of vehicles {{on the road in}} the US, and the ethanol group estimates if all 2001 and newer cars and pickups were to use E15, the theoretical blend wall for ethanol use would be approximately 17.5 billion gallons (66.2 billion liters) per year. The EPA was still studying if older cars can withstand a 15% ethanol blend.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 the Chatham Dockyard {{began to}} close, {{threatening}} the economic {{stability of the}} Chatham area. In 1983 Gillingham Borough Council authorised the regeneration of the area as a commercial dock, granting planning permission and intending that it operate 24 hours a day. The fact that the 24-hour operating period would cause a disturbance in what was essentially a residential area was considered, but {{it was felt that}} the economic benefit the dock would produce outweighed this problem. The port went into full operation in 1984, and within 4 years almost 750 lorries were using the roads every day. In 1988, acting under Section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, Gillingham Borough Council brought an action against the dock company on behalf of its residents, arguing that the company was creating a public nuisance against the residents of the area, thanks to the noise of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> going through the neighbourhood at night. The council sought an injunction limiting the hours in which vehicles could pass, saying it should only be permitted from 7:00am to 7:00pm.|$|E

25|$|In March 2009 Growth Energy, a {{lobbying}} {{group for the}} ethanol industry, formally requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15%, from 10%. In October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver to allow up to 15% blends to be sold for cars and trucks with a model year of 2007 or later, representing about 15% of vehicles on the roads. In January 2011 the waiver was expanded to authorize use of E15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles.

According to the Renewable Fuels Association the E15 waivers now cover 62% of vehicles {{on the road in}} the country. In December 2010 several groups, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, filed suit against the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In August 2012 the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA ruling that the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of automotive technology and high-speed highway construction, {{the speed of the}} vehicles increase which cause the significant increase in the aerodynamic drag when road vehicles are moving. Thereby the power of the vehicles, fuel economy, operational stability and other properties are affected very seriously. <b>Heavy-duty</b> commercial <b>vehicles</b> as {{the most efficient way to}} transport goods on the highway are widely used, and the speed of the vehicles increases faster. Especially the demands for <b>heavy-duty</b> commercial <b>vehicles</b> are increasing in recent years. Reducing the aerodynamic drag by the analysis of external aerodynamic characteristics, improving the fuel economy and reducing energy consumption have become new research topics of <b>heavy-duty</b> commercial <b>vehicles.</b> To make the <b>heavy-duty</b> commercial <b>vehicles</b> meet the national standards of energy saving, a simplified heavy-duty commercial truck model was built in this paper. The numerical simulation of the vehicle was completed based on the theory of the aerodynamics. The aerodynamic characteristics were analyzed, according to the graphs of the pressure distribution, velocity distribution and flow visualization. To improve the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>heavy-duty</b> commercial <b>vehicles,</b> the main drag reduction measures are reducing the vortex of the cab and the container, the end of the container and the bottom of the container...|$|R

40|$|Particulate matter {{emissions}} from the California in-use vehicle fleet were measured as 37 [*] 500 vehicles traveled through two bores of the Caldecott Tunnel {{located in the}} San Francisco Bay area. Microorifice cascade impactors and filter-based samplers {{were used to determine}} the particle chemical composition as a function of particle size. Ammonia {{emissions from}} the vehicle fleet were measured as well. Concentrations of aerosol mass, organic carbon, elemental carbon, sulfate ion, nitrate ion, and ammonium ion, as well as 13 elements are reported. The particle mass distribution peaks in the particle size range 0. 1 − 0. 18 μm aerodynamic diameter (D_a). Elemental carbon and organic matter were the largest components of particle mass in all the size ranges studied. The Caldecott Tunnel bores studied include one which carries light-duty vehicle traffic and one which carries a mixture of light- and <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> traffic. From experiments conducted in both bores, estimates are made of the size distribution and chemical composition of particulate matter emissions extrapolated to the 100 % light-duty and 100 % <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleets. The <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleet emitted 1285 ± 237 mg of fine particulate matter (D_a < 1. 9 μm) /kg of C contained in the fuel burned (corresponding to approximately 430 ± 79 mg/km driven). Light-duty vehicles emitted less than 85 ± 6 mg/kg of C in the fuel burned (corresponding to less than approximately 5. 5 ± 0. 4 mg/km driven). Emissions of gas-phase ammonia in the Caldecott Tunnel were measured to be 194 and 267 mg/L of gasoline-equivalent fuel burned in the tunnel. The ammonia emissions are attributed to automobiles that were equipped with 3 -way catalysts and operating fuel rich...|$|R

40|$|<b>Heavy-duty</b> diesel <b>vehicle</b> (HDDV) {{operations}} {{are a major}} source of pollutant emissions in major metropolitan areas. Accurate estimation of <b>heavy-duty</b> diesel <b>vehicle</b> emissions is essential in air quality planning efforts because highway and non-road heavy-duty diesel emissions account for a significant fraction of the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions inventories. Yet, major modeling deficiencies in the current MOBILE 6 modeling approach for <b>heavy-duty</b> diesel <b>vehicles</b> have been widely recognized for more than ten years. While the most recent MOBILE 6. 2 model integrates marginal improvements to various internal conversion and correction factors, fundamental flaws inherent in the modeling approach still remain. The major effort of this research is to develop a new <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> load-based modal emission rate model that overcomes some of the limitations of existing models and emission rates prediction methods. This model is part of the proposed <b>Heavy-Duty</b> Diesel <b>Vehicle</b> Modal Emission Modeling (HDDV-MEM) which was developed by Georgia Institute of Technology. HDDV-MEM first predicts second-by-second engine power demand as a function of vehicle operating conditions and then applies brake-specific emission rates to these activity predictions. To provide better estimates of microscopic level, this modeling approach is designed to predict second-by-second emissions from onroad vehicle operations. This research statistically analyzes the database provided by EPA and yields a model for prediction emissions at microscopic level based on engine power demand and driving mode. Research results will enhance the explaining ability of engine power demand on emissions and the importance of simulating engine power in real world applications. The modeling approach provides a significant improvement in HDDV emissions modeling compared to the current average speed cycle-based emissions models. Ph. D.
