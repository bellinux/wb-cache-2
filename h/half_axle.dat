50|$|The G.I had a {{conventional}} undercarriage with two mainwheels and a tailskid. Originally each wheel was {{mounted on a}} V-shaped pair of struts and a <b>half</b> <b>axle</b> attached to a central frame. This proved weak and the half axles were therefore replaced by {{a conventional}} solid axle. Both wheels and skid had rubber shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{practical}} difficulties in servicing the brake mechanism. Instead of simply removing a wheel to renew pads and discs, the vehicle {{may need to}} be jacked up, so a mechanic can work underneath the vehicle. Additionally renewing brake discs can require dismantling the <b>half</b> <b>axle.</b> This greatly discourages their use in motorsport, and the additional time makes for greater labour cost when servicing these parts.|$|E
50|$|The colonial {{aircraft}} {{were expected}} to have to use basic or unprepared strips, so needed a robust undercarriage. The R.16 had large 1150 mm diameter wheels, independently mounted and fitted with brakes that could be use for steering, enclosed under large fairings. Each wheel was on a cranked steel <b>half</b> <b>axle</b> from the lower fuselage with a trailing recoil strut and a vertical oleo leg to the engine mounting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were made}} from a special alloy, which allowed it to work even under extreme heat. The modified engine had about [...] at 5000 rpm (the standard version had about half). The car had also the tachometer, unlike the production version. The front axle {{was similar to the}} one of Tatra 17 with swinging <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> (standard version had <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> only at the rear, while front was solid).|$|R

50|$|Modern {{front-wheel drive}} cars {{typically}} combine the transmission (gearbox and differential) and front axle {{into a single}} unit called a transaxle. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles. Each <b>half</b> <b>axle</b> connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity (CV) joint which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically {{as well as to}} pivot when making turns.|$|E
50|$|The Alca's flat sided {{fuselage}} {{was deep}} from the nose to behind the wing trailing edge where the underside swept upwards, producing an almost boom like rear fuselage. The pilot's open cockpit, {{fitted with a}} small windscreen, was placed just ahead of mid chord between the spars. The upper fuselage line was almost flat and the little twin cylinder engine was high in the nose with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. At the rear the empennage was conventional, though in glider fashion the straight edged fixed surfaces were small in area compared with the control surfaces. A tailplane braced from both above and below was mounted on the fin just above the fuselage; together with its balanced elevator it had a tapered, round tipped plan, with a cut-out for movement of the straight edged, though rounded, balanced rudder which extended to the keel. The Alca had a conventional glider type, rubber sprung landing skid plus tail bumper but it also had an unusual wheeled undercarriage for take-off. This featured a wheel on each side mounted on a <b>half</b> <b>axle</b> attached to the lower fuselage longeron and a vertical shock absorbing leg to the wing. After take-off, this was retracted and not used again until the next departure.|$|E

50|$|The fuselage, also wooden and plywood-covered, was flat-sided, with car-type doors {{giving access}} to the {{side-by-side}} seats in the cabin which was placed under {{the leading edge of}} the wing. In front, a compactly cowled, 40 kW (60 hp) CNA D.4 flat four engine drove a 2-blade propeller. The PM.1 had a conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on centrally mounted, faired V-form <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> and with vertical legs to the bottom longerons, assisted by a tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The San Francesco has a {{conventional}} fixed tailwheel undercarriage with sprung <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> mounted on central struts below the fuselage. Its cabin begins {{ahead of the}} wing and extends rearwards under it. Versions of the aircraft have flown with at least three variants of the Limbach adaptations of the flat four-cylinder Volkswagen motor: the early San Francescos had the 51 kW (68 hp) 1700E and some later ones 60 kW (80 hp) or 75 kW (100 hp) Limbachs.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the SL-122 is flat sided and deep. There are two tandem {{seats in}} the underwing cabin, which is fully glazed all around. Its rectangular tailplane is mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, below a straight tapered fin and rudder. The Pchelka has a fixed, conventional undercarriage; V-struts hinged to the lower fuselage support the mainwheels at the outer ends of bungee cord sprung <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> from the fuselage underside. There is a cantilever, steerable tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|Inboard brakes can {{significantly}} reduce unsprung mass, but put more load on <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> and (constant velocity) universal joints, and require space {{that may not}} be easily accommodated. If located next to a differential or transaxle, waste heat from the brakes may overheat the differential or vice versa, particularly in hard use, such as motor racing. They also make anti-dive suspension characteristics harder to achieve as the moment created by the act of braking is not reacted on the suspension arms.|$|R
50|$|The Maya had a {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{with wooden}} stringers and Wobex mat covering. The cabin stood above the rear fuselage line, enclosing side-by-side seats with a third, occasional seat, or luggage space, behind. In front a 75 kW (100 hp) Lycoming flat four engine, with cylinder-heads exposed, drove a two blade propeller. It had a conventional undercarriage, with each mainwheel mounted on V-struts and <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> hinged to the fuselage central underside via rubber shock absorbers.

Aft of the pilot's side windows, two further rectangular windows on each side lit the passenger cabin, the forward one on the port side incorporated into a cabin access door. The Z.1010 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with enclosed, faired mainwheels on faired <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> mounted on the lower fuselage. Tall, faired shock absorbing legs ran from wheels to wing roots.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} based on the proven Tatra concept of a {{backbone}} tube chassis construction with swing <b>half</b> <b>axles,</b> a modular gearbox and differential assemblies. The main advantages of the central load carrying backbone tube are its high torsion and bend strength, which protects the truck body against load stresses. The secondary advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drivetrain. Due to its torsional stiffness and use of differentials locks the vehicle had exceptional offroad capabilities. Of note was the ability to use a cranking handle to start the engine.|$|R
50|$|The seating {{is under}} {{the leading edge of}} the wing with a cabin roof window in the wing center section. Access is through side transparencies. Engine options include several Rotax or Jabiru units in the 37-89 kW (50-120 hp) range, driving two- or three-blade {{propellers}} and enclosed in a composite cowling. Both undercarriage versions have the main wheels on faired-in V-form struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons, with rubber-sprung <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> fixed to a compression frame. The conventional tailwheel is steerable but the alternative nose wheel castors freely, though a steerable version is planned.|$|R
50|$|The chassis is a {{full-length}} backbone tube with independent swing <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> in 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8. 4x4 models had front axle suspension via adjustable torsion bars, 6x6 and 8x8 models {{front and rear}} axles used longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs. For 4x4 configuration the rear axle was suspended via air suspension. Full-time all-wheel-drive front twin steer (6x6, 8x8) drive via homo-kinetic drive shafts, drive with the differential locks, inter-axle differentials with locks and planetary hub reductions on all models. Unlike many six-wheeled vehicles, which have a single front axle and tandem rear axles, 6x6 versions used twin steering front axles- as with the 8x8- and a single rear axle.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s Network SouthEast {{developed}} Networker trains with micro-processor controlled three-phase AC {{traction motors}} on <b>half</b> the <b>axles.</b> The build {{of the first}} Class 465 units was split between the newly privatised British Rail Engineering Limited and GEC-Alstholm.|$|R
50|$|Its {{straight}} {{tapered wing}} {{is a composite}} structure, with an aluminium frame, Styrofoam filling and fabric covering. The ailerons and three-position flaps are made of aluminium. The wings are braced on each side with a single lift strut to a lower fuselage longeron. The tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage height, is also strut braced. The fuselage of the Tétras is a steel structure covered with Dacron. Variants with both tricycle and conventional undercarriages, all fixed, have been built. The former arrangement has spring cantilever main legs, the latter has the mainwheels mounted on faired V-strut legs and bungee sprung <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> fixed to a compression frame. Both undercarriage variants have hydraulic brakes. Skis may also be fitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is flat {{sided with}} a narrow dorsal ridge sloping upwards from the tail to the wing trailing edge. The single seat cabin is below the wing, its windows full-chord and the screen just forward of the leading edge. Access is via a hinged transparency and shallow hinged fuselage panel. The Kid usually has an 18 kW (24 hp) Hirth F33 single cylinder two-stroke engine, though the 30 kW (40 hp) Aero 40 Wankel engine is an alternative. The Kid has its tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, braced with V-struts from below and wire-braced to the fin above. The fin and rudder are broad chord and rounded. The starboard elevator has a trim tab. The undercarriage is fixed and conventional, with brakeable mainwheels on faired-in V-struts hinged to the lower fuselage longerons, with bungee-sprung <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> mounted on a central compression frame. There is a solid tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The GY-120 had an {{aluminium}} alloy tube structure, stressed to FAR 23 standard. Its parasol wing was unswept and of constant chord, carrying half span ailerons. The wing was supported from below by a {{fore and aft}} pair of inverted V-form struts from the upper fuselage longerons to the its centreline. These struts also supported a longitudinal inverted V kingpost to which landing wires were attached. Flying wires braced the wing from below to the lower fuselage. The fuselage was flat sided, the fin and rudder straight edged. The {{leading edge of the}} fin was swept and the deep, almost rectangular rudder reached down between the elevators, mounted on the tailplane {{at the top of the}} fuselage, to the keel. Two seats in tandem were placed below the wing in a continuous open cockpit. The GY-120 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with the mainwheels on <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> and radius arms mounted on the fuselage centreline and near vertical rubber compression legs fixed to the fuselage sides. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was coil sprung.|$|R
50|$|The LT.12 was a braced high-wing monoplane, with a wing {{that was}} {{rectangular}} in plan out to {{very near the}} blunt tips where the chord reduced slightly. The wing was held high over the fuselage on two plywood covered pillars like a cut-away pedestal, forward and aft of the rear, underwing, open cockpit. The forward cockpit was ahead of the leading edge. Two parallel faired struts braced the wing on each side from about mid-span to the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was a deep sided, almost rectangular hexagonal, plywood skinned wooden structure which tapered to the tail. The LT.12's tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, with a straight, swept leading edge and carrying balanced elevators, the balances reducing the leading edge sweep outboard. The small fin was triangular, carrying a broad balanced rudder which moved in an elevator cut-out. The LT.12 had both a standard landing skid from nose to below the wing trailing edge combined with a rudder protecting tail bumper and a narrow track wheeled undercarriage, attached to the skid on <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> and with trailing struts.|$|R

5000|$|The Inter Autoscooter is a French {{three-wheeled}} microcar {{that first}} {{appeared at the}} 1953 Paris Salon. Some say it was produced {{to compete with the}} Messerschmitt KR175 which also appeared that year. This is not surprising as both cars were built by aircraft companies and shared a similar cockpit and tandem seating layout. The Inter was produced by SNCAN in their aircraft factory at Villeurbanne in the region of Lyon; Just over 300 units were built between 1954 and 1956. Early advertising literature reveals that two models were offered, one with a cockpit cover that hinged open from the side and named the Berline, the other an open bodied version called the Torpedo. Both cars were powered by a small Ydral 175cc two-stroke engine driving the single rear wheel. The Inter had some unusual features not least being its ability to fold together its two front <b>half</b> <b>axles</b> so as to facilitate easy storage, however this feature only appears on the first few cars made as it proved to be impractical and was soon discontinued. The Inter also featured a device called a gyrostarter, this was in effect a kind of electric kick start made by the American electromechanical giant WestinghouseThe device consists of a built in electric 6 volt motor with a clutched flywheel, the momentum of the rotating flywheel is transferred to the engine by means of its clutch once it has built up sufficient speed, it sounds much like a helicopter preparing for take off! The device switches to being a generator once the engine is running. Considering the very small production run, approximately 38 vehicles survive in the hands of museums and collectors, of which only a few are still in running condition.|$|R
