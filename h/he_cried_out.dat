5|$|Visits to Spandau of {{half an hour}} {{per month}} were allowed, but Hess forbade his family to visit until December 1969, {{when he was a}} patient at the British Military Hospital in West Berlin for a {{perforated}} ulcer. By this time Wolf Rüdiger Hess was 32 years old and Ilse 69; they had not seen Hess since his departure from Germany in 1941. After this illness, he allowed his family to visit regularly. His daughter-in-law Andrea, who often brought photos and films of his grandchildren, became a particularly welcome visitor. Hess's health problems, both mental and physical, were ongoing during his captivity. <b>He</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> in the night, claiming he had stomach pains. He continued to suspect that his food was being poisoned and complained of amnesia. A psychiatrist who examined him in 1957 deemed he was not ill enough to be transferred to a mental hospital. Another unsuccessful suicide attempt took place in 1977.|$|E

500|$|Breckinridge's men {{initially}} {{broke the}} Union line and forced {{them across the}} river. Artillery {{on the opposite side}} of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge's men, and reinforcements for the fleeing Union troops arrived. In just over an hour, [...] nearly one-third of Breckinridge's troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, as he rode among the survivors, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> repeatedly, [...] "My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans," [...] bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg's official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge's division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg's report [...] "fails... to do justice to the behavior of my Division"; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge's command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.|$|E

500|$|The {{transfer}} of Audaciouss broadside to Spartiate meant that Captain Maurice-Julien Emeriau now faced three opponents. Within minutes {{all three of}} his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around Spartiate continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although Spartiate was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, Aquilon, which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, Minotaur. Captain Antoine René Thévenard used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a langrage shot from Spartiate struck Nelson over his blinded right eye. The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind. Nelson collapsed {{into the arms of}} Captain Edward Berry and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> [...] "I am killed, remember me to my wife", and called for his chaplain, Stephen Comyn. The wound was immediately inspected by Vanguards surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together. Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on Orient to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Thévenard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under Minotaurs guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender. With his opponent defeated, Captain Thomas Louis then took Minotaur south to join the attack on Franklin.|$|E
2500|$|Messianics {{understand}} that Paul the Apostle (who {{is often referred}} to as Sha’ul, his Hebrew name) remained a Jewish Pharisee even as a believer until his death. This is based on , detailing events after Paul's acceptance of Jesus as Messiah. [...] "But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> in the council, Men [...] brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Carthage Greys {{reportedly}} feigned {{defense of}} the jail by firing shots or blanks over the attackers' heads, {{and some of the}} Greys reportedly joined the mob, who rushed up the stairs. The mob first attempted to push the door open to fire into the room, though Joseph Smith and the other prisoners pushed back and prevented this. A member of the mob fired a shot through the door. Hyrum Smith was shot in the face, just to the left of his nose, which threw him to the floor. <b>He</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "I am a dead man!" [...] and collapsed.

2500|$|As Blücher and his {{followers}} retired to rally, they were rapidly pursued by the French Cuirassiers, At this moment, the Blücher's fine grey charger — a present from the George, Prince Regent of England — was mortally woimded by a shot, in its left side, near the saddle girth. On experiencing a check to his speed, Blücher spurred, when the animal, still obedient to the impulse of its master, made a few convulsive plunges forward; but on feeling that his steed was rapidly losing strength, and perceiving {{at the same time}} the near approach of the French Cuirassiers, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> to his aide de camp: [...] "Nostitz, now I am lost!". At that moment the horse fell from exhaustion, rolling upon its right side, and half burying its rider under its weight.|$|E
2500|$|The Scholls and Probst were {{scheduled}} to stand trial before the Volksgerichtshof— the Nazi [...] "People's Court" [...] infamous for its unfair political trials, which {{more often than not}} ended with a death sentence — on 22 February 1943. They were found guilty of treason. Roland Freisler, head judge of the court, sentenced them to death. The three were executed the same day by guillotine at Stadelheim Prison. All three were noted for the courage with which they faced their deaths, particularly Sophie, who remained firm despite intense interrogation, and intimidation by Freisler during the trial. She replied: [...] "You know as well as we do that the war is lost. Why are you so cowardly that you won't admit it?" [...] Immediately before Hans was executed, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> [...] "Es lebe die Freiheit! - Long live freedom!", as the blade fell.|$|E
2500|$|He later {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home. During a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck near him. Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "Help! Saint Anna, I will become a monk!" [...] He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked {{him to the door}} of the Black Cloister. [...] "This day you see me, and then, not ever again," [...] he said. His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther's education.|$|E

Once there, he was accused of receiving bribes, and he fled and secretly returned to the eastern capital Luoyang. Once at Luoyang, he secretly met Emperor Zhongzong's cousin (Wu Zetian's nephew) Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang, who was then a trusted advisor of Emperor Zhongzong and a lover to Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei and was locked in a power struggle with the leaders of the coup that had returned Emperor Zhongzong to the throne -- Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Huan Yanfan, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji.

2500|$|At 4 p.m. on January 2, Bragg {{directed}} Breckinridge's {{troops to}} attack Beatty's division, which was occupying the hill {{on the east}} side of the river. Breckinridge initially protested that the assault would be suicidal but eventually agreed and attacked with determination. The Union troops were pushed back across McFadden Ford, but the Confederate charge ran into heavy fire from massed Union artillery across the river, commanded by Crittenden's artillery chief, Capt. John Mendenhall. Mendenhall deployed his guns perfectly—45 arrayed hub-to-hub on the ridge overlooking McFadden's Ford [...] and 12 more guns about a mile to the southwest, which could provide enfilading fire, completely commanding the opposite bank and heights beyond—and saved the day for Rosecrans. The Confederate attack stalled, having suffered over 1,800 casualties in less than an hour. A Union division under the command of James S. Negley (Thomas's wing) led a counterattack at 4:45p.m., and the Confederate troops retreated. Breckinridge was devastated by the disaster. He lost nearly one third of his Kentucky troops (Hanson's Brigade, also known as the Orphan Brigade because it could not return to Union-occupied Kentucky). As he rode among the survivors, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> repeatedly, [...] "My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1934, Wilson {{was visited}} by old {{drinking}} companion Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded {{to find that}} Thacher had been sober for several weeks {{under the guidance of}} the evangelical Christian Oxford Group. Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns hospital under Doctor Silkworth's care and he showed signs of delirium tremens. It was while undergoing treatment with The Belladonna Cure that Wilson experienced his [...] "Hot Flash" [...] spiritual conversion and quit drinking. Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol. According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, <b>he</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!" [...] He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Dr. Silkworth, who told him, [...] "Something has happened to you I don't understand. [...] But you had better hang on to it".|$|E
