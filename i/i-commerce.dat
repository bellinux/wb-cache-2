40|$|The {{increasing}} use of the Internet {{in business}} and commerce has created {{a number of new}} business op-portunities and the need for supporting models and platforms. One of these opportunities is information commerce (<b>i-commerce),</b> a special case of e-commerce focused on the purchase and sale of information as a commodity. In this paper we present an architecture for <b>i-commerce</b> systems using OPELIX (Open Personalized Electronic Information Commerce System) [11] as an example. OPELIX provides an open information commerce platform that enables enterprises to produce, sell, deliver, and manage information products and related services over the Internet. We focus on the notion of information marketplace, a virtual location that enables <b>i-commerce,</b> describe the business and do-main model for an information marketplace, and dis-cuss the role of intermediaries in this environment. The domain model is used {{as the basis for the}} software architecture of the OPELIX system. We dis-cuss the characteristics of the OPELIX architecture and compare our approach to related work in the field. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of the Internet and its use in business and commerce has created {{a number of new}} business opportunities and a need for their supporting models. One of these opportunities may be classified as information commerce (<b>i-commerce),</b> a special case of e-commerce focused on the purchase and sale of information as a commodity. <b>I-commerce</b> may also be viewed as a special case of trading of intangible goods[1]. In this paper, we present a business and domain model for the emerging field of <b>i-commerce.</b> The model, called CIP (Customer-Intermediary-Provider), describes an information marketplace, a virtual environment in which buyers and sellers of information may trade information products. The purpose of the model is to clarify the issues involved in icommerce, identify architectural requirements of icommerce systems, and identify new services needed to support such architectures on the Internet. Such models are necessary for understanding and classifying the rapidly increasing information and service providers on the Internet. Indeed, the CIP model may be used to describe the functions and services of many existing and emerging Web-based services...|$|E
40|$|Information {{commerce}} (<b>i-commerce)</b> is {{a special}} variant of e-commerce in which the goods being offered for sale are digital and thus amenable to processing by computers. Trading of digital goods opens up new business opportunities and also poses interesting software engineering challenges. We present a general model of information commerce that extends the traditional customer-vendor model with an arbitrary number of layers of intermediaries that process other vendor products and services and offer new products and services of their own. Examining the interactions among {{the participants in this}} model leads to the requirements for an infrastructure to support information commerce applications and systems. We present a general, flexible, component-oriented architecture for information commerce systems. The architecture supports all business phases of <b>i-commerce</b> and may be deployed and distributed in a heterogeneous environment according to a user-defined configuration. We present the design rationale for the OPELIX system and our implementation experience...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Traditionally, {{analytical}} CRM (A-CRM) mainly {{relies on}} the use of structured data from a data warehouse where data are extracted, transformed, loaded from operation systems such as ERP, SCM or operational CRM. In recent years of rising big data trend, recognized shifts in E-commerce have taken place from internet-enable commerce (<b>I-commerce),</b> to mobile commerce (M-commerce), and now to ubiquitous commerce (U-commerce). As theses paradigm shifts imply that ubiquitous computing improves considerably companies ’ access to information by allowing them to acquire information at anytime, anywhere. Give this changes on data collection shifts due to ubiquitous computing, however, current A-CRM framework in literature seems not too matched to this change. There is only a handful studies published on CRM in ubiquitous computing environment fitting what big data age requires. Consequently, the objective of this study attempts to propose a conceptual framework of A-CRM. Built by conceptual framework approach, this framework provides valuable directions, definitions and guidelines to practitioners preparing the successful big data marketing in big data age...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the Internet {{revolutionized}} {{many activities}} from entertainment to marketing and business. Two key underlying Internet technologies, efficient data delivery and hypertext, demonstrated exceptional potential as new application enablers. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel Hypermedia-Aided Design (HAD) collaboration framework that facilitates new communication and data presentation paradigms to improve the effectiveness of typical EDA applications. The framework leverages on the advantages of using semantic multicast as a communication backbone and quantized hypermedia presentations as an efficient data organization, retrieval, and presentation model. Semantic multicast is a global communication tool that relies on an internetwork of proxies to provide content discovery and semanticsbased profile-driven data dissemination services. We introduce {{the notion of a}} quant, an atomic interactive multimedia information primitive with embedded hyperlinks. We demonstrate how interest-specific quant retrieval and concatenation can enable more focused collaboration. The HAD framework consists of a set of applications for student(designer) -centered CAD education(consulting), collaborative design and debugging, <b>I-commerce,</b> and technical support. In all applications, quant-based presentations enable that theoretical and practical components are tailored according to user's interest and performances. The conceptualized and implemented applications act in synergy with existing software, hardware, and system design tools. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} the Internet has {{transformed}} the business environment {{in no small measure}} and has influenced the ways and manner businesses are transacted. This platform has brought about enhanced electronic and mobile business transactions. However, the advent of e-Commerce, m-Commerce or <b>i-Commerce</b> has placed a premium on the participating organisations or nations in terms of provision of the basic infrastructure for a secure, seamless and trusted business environment through the electronic media. This paper presents an exploratory study of the prospects of e-Commerce implementation and the factors inhibiting its growth. A set of questionnaire was designed, administered and analysed based on political, economic, social and technological (PEST) analysis. The PEST analysis is to help review the current practices with a view to developing a framework for Nigeria and other developing nations in Africa. Findings revealed that the Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) is the most widely used medium of e-Payment in Nigeria, which is not very suitable for e-Commerce implementation. Similarly, the Internet penetration is still abysmally low {{and is one of the}} major threats to e-Commerce implementation. However, the nascent democracy enjoyed in Nigeria is faced with some teething problems, but it promised with time, relative political stability, direct foreign investment, improved economical atmosphere, improved social services and technological development more than ever witnessed in the country. Therefore, a viable framework for Nigeria and Africa would be such that involves the private and public partnership (PPP). This consortium is expected to provide the platform for access to the Internet and popularize the use of e-Payment among other things...|$|E
