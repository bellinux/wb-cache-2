5|$|Different {{in-flight}} {{entertainment is}} available {{depending upon the}} aircraft and the class travelled. The airline's in-flight magazine is called Msafiri, and is distributed among the passengers in all aircraft, <b>irrespective</b> of the class.|$|E
5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, <b>irrespective</b> of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , is rarely used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.|$|E
5|$|A viral genome, <b>irrespective</b> of {{nucleic acid}} type, {{is almost always}} either {{single-stranded}} or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's complex sound-images and {{philosophical}} approach have caused frequent comparisons with mystical filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson. <b>Irrespective</b> of substantial cultural differences, much of western writing about Kiarostami positions {{him as the}} Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of universal austere, spiritual poetics and moral commitment. Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of Sufi concepts.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. <b>Irrespective</b> of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|The Commission, {{as part of}} its mandate, is {{responsible}} for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally. To this end, the war dead are commemorated by name on a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. War dead are commemorated uniformly and equally, <b>irrespective</b> of military or civil rank, race or creed.|$|E
5|$|The Palanquin {{procession}} of Sai Baba takes place every Thursday from the Samadhi Mandir to Dwarkamayi, onward to Chavdi {{and back to}} the Sai Baba Mandir. Devotees belonging to all faiths are welcome to take Darshan in the Samadhi Mandir and have free meals in the Prasadalaya, <b>irrespective</b> of caste, creed, and religion as these were one of the ideal principles of Sai Baba.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, <b>irrespective</b> of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|Walker took 60 wickets in the 1875–76 {{domestic}} {{season at}} an average of 8.47 runs per wicket, the best for all bowlers of the season. Walker was also a highly skilled wicket-keeper. Despite his all-round capabilities, Walker was best recognised and remembered for his impressive contributions as an inspirational captain, coming out as the best player in many matches <b>irrespective</b> of his team's performance.|$|E
5|$|While {{some critics}} have feared the {{revision}} of the Champagne region is about expanding production <b>irrespective</b> of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson {{has pointed out that}} the proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion. The villages under discussion are situated in gaps inside the perimeter of the existing Champagne regions rather than outside it.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, <b>irrespective</b> of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became <b>irrespective</b> of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award, the prize is {{presented}} to outfielders <b>irrespective</b> of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one right fielder. It is also possible for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E
5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, <b>irrespective</b> of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} four seasons, {{prospect}} UFC fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams, <b>irrespective</b> of weight class, with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from the opposing team by selecting favourable matchups.|$|E
5|$|Gambling {{and related}} paraphernalia, broadly defined by ABC to include claw and crane machines, casino-themed video games, {{football}} pools, and door prizes, <b>irrespective</b> of whether any profit {{is being made}} by the business, are prohibited at licensed establishments. The only exceptions are for those bars licensed {{by the state to}} sell lottery tickets or have off-track betting on horse racing. Charity bingo games or raffles are also allowed. Card games, darts, billiards and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged, and no prizes are given.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. <b>Irrespective</b> of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Narayan {{published}} his first mythological work, Gods, Demons and Others, {{a collection of}} rewritten and translated short stories from Hindu epics. Like many of his other works, this book was illustrated by his younger brother R. K. Laxman. The stories included were a selective list, chosen {{on the basis of}} powerful protagonists, so that the impact would be lasting, <b>irrespective</b> of the reader's contextual knowledge. Once again, after the book launch, Narayan took to travelling abroad. In an earlier essay, he had written about the Americans wanting to understand spirituality from him, and during this visit, Swedish-American actress Greta Garbo accosted him on the topic, despite his denial of any knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, {{there were}} large {{communities}} of Coptic Christians, Melkites, Turks, Armenians, and Black Africans—the latter two groups {{had a large}} presence in Upper Egypt. Under the Fatimids, non-Muslims in Egypt generally prospered, {{with the exception of}} Caliph al-Hakim's reign. However, with Shirkuh's ascendancy to the vizier position, a number edicts were enacted against the non-Muslim population. With the advent of the Syrian expeditionary force (consisting of Oghuz Turks and Kurds) into Egypt, waves of maltreatment of minorities occurred, <b>irrespective</b> of religion. These incidents occurred while Shirkuh and Saladin were viziers to the Fatimid caliph.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality {{published}} the general scheme of a Marriage Bill 2015. The bill {{set out the}} changes {{to be made to}} legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the existing legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though the wording of the amendment is self-executing and designed to invalidate it <b>irrespective</b> of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnership, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.|$|E
5|$|In one experiment, when offered live {{fruit flies}} (Drosophila virilis), {{salamanders}} choose {{the larger of}} 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3. Frogs can distinguish between low numbers (1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, but not 3 vs 4) and large numbers (3 vs 6, 4 vs 8, but not 4 vs 6) of prey. This is <b>irrespective</b> of other characteristics, i.e. surface area, volume, weight and movement, although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, <b>irrespective</b> of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|Official {{regulation}} {{states that}} the flag must never touch the ground or water, or {{be used as a}} drapery in any form. The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, <b>irrespective</b> of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015. A referendum on 22 May 2015 amended the Constitution of Ireland {{to provide that}} marriage is recognised <b>irrespective</b> of {{the sex of the}} partners. The measure was signed into law by the President of Ireland as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 August 2015. The Marriage Act 2015, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment. Marriages of same-sex couples in Ireland began being recognised from 16 November 2015 and the first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples in Ireland occurred on 17 November 2015.|$|E
5|$|Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' {{new moon}} day) is {{intended}} for all ancestors, <b>irrespective</b> of the lunar day they died. It {{is the most important}} day of the Pitru Paksha. Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha can do so on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which is seen as a special place to perform the rite, and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.|$|E
5|$|The 50 Greatest Players in National Basketball Association History (also {{referred}} to as NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team or NBA's Top 50) were chosen in 1996 to honor the fiftieth anniversary {{of the founding of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA). These fifty players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers. In addition, the top ten head coaches and top ten single-season teams in NBA history were selected by media members as part of the celebration. The fifty players had to have played at least a portion of their careers in the NBA and were selected <b>irrespective</b> of position played.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights {{is defined}} as the basic human rights of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply <b>irrespective</b> of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender. They are {{enforceable}} by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing law's.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is a music chart {{compiled}} by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2005, the chart {{has been based on}} the sales of both physical and digital singles, originally on the condition that the single was available in both formats. In 2007, the rules were changed so that legal downloads of all songs, <b>irrespective</b> of whether a physical copy was available, were eligible to chart.|$|E
5|$|The {{prize is}} {{presented}} to outfielders <b>irrespective</b> of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one right fielder. In addition, only National League pitchers receive a Silver Slugger Award; lineups in the American League include a designated hitter in place of the pitcher in the batting order, so the designated hitter receives the award instead.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest <b>irrespective</b> {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of strep throat usually improve within {{three to five}} days, <b>irrespective</b> of treatment. Treatment with antibiotics {{reduces the risk of}} complications and transmission; children may return to school 24 hours after antibiotics are administered. The risk of complications in adults is low. In children, acute rheumatic fever is rare in most of the developed world. It is, however, the leading cause of acquired heart disease in India, sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Australia.|$|E
5|$|These moves {{were met}} with some criticism, as the {{preserved}} counties were created to sustain a stable and continuing layout, <b>irrespective</b> of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas. This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county {{it had never been}} administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county's limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified their borders in 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno, Conwy and Betws-y-Coed into the preserved county of Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|Tristano is {{regarded}} as one of the first to teach jazz, particularly improvisation, in a structured way. He taught musicians <b>irrespective</b> of their instrument and structured lessons to meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that would allow them to find and express their own musical feelings, or style.|$|E
5|$|Under federal law, the {{drinking}} age for the Armed Forces {{is the same}} as the state or nation where the military base is located, or {{the drinking}} age of a state or nation within 50 miles of the base. Effectively, that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21. <b>Irrespective</b> of state laws on underage consumption, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard prohibit the consumption of alcohol by underage personnel when stationed in the United States. Marines under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, <b>irrespective</b> of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience <b>irrespective</b> of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
