25|$|Some other Finno-Ugric peoples have {{autonomous}} <b>republics</b> in Russia: <b>Karelians</b> (<b>Republic</b> of Karelia), Komi (Komi Republic), Udmurts (Udmurt Republic), Mari (Mari El Republic), and Mordvins (Moksha and Erzya; Republic of Mordovia).|$|R
50|$|The four largest {{groups that}} speak Finno-Ugric {{languages}} are Hungarians (14.5 million), Finns (6.5 million), Estonians (1.1 million), and Mordvins (0.85 million). Three (Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians) inhabit independent nation-states, Hungary, Finland, and Estonia, while the Mordvins have an autonomous Mordovian Republic within Russia. The traditional {{area of the}} indigenous Sami people is in Northern Fenno-Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula in Northwest Russia and is known as Sápmi. Some other Finno-Ugric peoples have autonomous <b>republics</b> in Russia: <b>Karelians</b> (<b>Republic</b> of Karelia), Komi (Komi Republic), Udmurts (Udmurt Republic), Mari (Mari El Republic), and Mordvins (Moksha and Erzya; Republic of Mordovia). Khanty and Mansi peoples live in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug of Russia, while Komi-Permyaks live in Komi-Permyak Okrug, {{which used to be}} an autonomous okrug of Russia, but today is a territory with special status within Perm Krai.|$|R
50|$|From 1940 to 1956, {{territory}} annexed from Finland {{was incorporated}} {{with the previous}} <b>Karelian</b> Autonomous <b>Republic</b> to form the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, which had {{the status of a}} union republic in the federal structure of the Soviet Union. By this time, only about 10% of the population of this region was of Karelian or Finnish ethnic background.|$|R
50|$|The {{company have}} their rehearsals in the Cultural Centre of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic,</b> and the centre {{provides}} them with financial support. They also receive support from the Karelian Ministry of Culture.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1967 by a Veps {{resident}} of the Sholtozero village, sovkhoz worker Rjurik Lonin (1930-2009), who was originally from the Kaskez’ village, likewise located in the Prionezhskiĭ District, at the southern border of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the post-war}} {{restoration}} of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> {{there was a significant}} shortage of qualified personnel. To address that problem, the local government in cooperation with USSR Ministry of Higher Education decreed to expand the university's program in various fields, such us heavy industry, civil construction and agriculture.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{landscape}} {{continues to}} the East and extends into Russia (<b>Karelian</b> Isthmus and <b>Republic</b> of Karelia). As a consequence, {{there is no}} natural border between the two countries.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, Finns were {{involved}} in attempts to overthrow the Bolshevists in Russian Karelia (East Karelia), for instance in the failed Aunus expedition. These mainly private expeditions ended after the peace Treaty of Tartu. After {{the end of the}} Russian Civil War, and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian part of Karelia became the <b>Karelian</b> Autonomous <b>republic</b> of the Soviet Union (ASSR) in 1923.|$|R
50|$|Finnish partisans were {{involved}} in attempts to overthrow the Bolshevists in Russian Karelia (East Karelia) in 1918-20, {{such as in the}} failed Aunus expedition. They also wanted to incorporate the rest of Karelia into Finland, and cooperated with the short-lived Republic of Uhtua. These mainly private expeditions ended after the peace treaty of Tartu. After the end of the Russian Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian part of Karelia became the <b>Karelian</b> Autonomous <b>republic</b> of the Soviet Union (ASSR) in 1923.|$|R
5000|$|The modern <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> {{was founded}} as an {{autonomous}} republic within the Russian SFSR by the Resolution of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) of June 27, 1923 {{and by the}} Decree of the VTsIK and the Council of People's Commissars of July 25, 1923 from the Karelian Labor Commune.|$|E
5000|$|In 1926, {{according}} to the census, Karelians only accounted for 37.4% {{of the population in}} the Soviet <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> (which at that time did not yet include territories that would later be taken from Finland and added, most of which had mostly Karelian inhabitants), or 0.1 million Karelians. Russians, meanwhile, numbered 153,967 in Karelia, or 57.2% of the population.|$|E
50|$|Markianova {{has worked}} hard so that Karelian could be taught in the schools of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic.</b> Together with Z. M. Dubrovina from St. Petersburg, she wrote a primer called Aberi (1990). After this {{followed}} a textbook called Kirjuniekku (1992). She had also authored various books on Olonec Karelian phonetics and grammar. The {{most important of these}} is Karjalan kielioppi (Karelian Grammar, 2002).|$|E
50|$|Keksgolmsky District {{with the}} {{administrative}} center in Keksgolm was {{established as a}} part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist <b>Republic</b> (<b>Karelian</b> ASSR) in March 1940. On March 31, 1940, the Karelian ASSR was transformed into the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. On November 24, 1944, Keksgolmsky District was transferred from the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast.|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the system of}} personal female names of the Karelian population. As the author demonstrates, the collected corpus of historical and modern Karelian women’s names is yet very incomplete and severely understudied. This {{may be due to}} a number of factors, including the relative scarcity of female names recorded in historical documents and in toponymy, the limited number of sources, the lack of fundamental Russian-based research and dictionaries devoted to female names, which were often a source for many historical Karelian forms. For this reason, first, {{a significant part of the}} article deals with the reconstruction of the pre-Christian corpus of Karelian female names, as reconstructed from folklore texts and animal. The author pays special attention to the latter type of data, which was hardly considered in previous anthroponymic research. In his view, after the Christianization of the Karelians, the pagan system of names was not entirely lost, but relegated to a lower “domestic” sphere, including naming of cows and other animals. And second, based on historical documents and toponymy, the article gives a close examination of Christian female names and their numerous folk forms, which became widespread after the Christianization of the Karelians in 1227. By giving multiple evidence of such names and their forms, the author investigates the patterns of phonetic and morphological adaptation of the Russian versions of female names in the Karelian language. The study covers the data from all major settlement territories of the <b>Karelians</b> (<b>Republic</b> of Karelia, Finland, Leningrad, and Tver regions of Russia) ...|$|R
5000|$|Ludic or Ludian or Ludic Karelian (Luudi, Lyydi, or lüüdi) is a Finnic {{language}} in the Uralic language family. It is transitional between Olonets Karelian language and Veps language. [...] It originated as a northern dialect of Veps transformed under heavy Karelian influence. It is spoken by 3,000 <b>Karelians</b> in the <b>Republic</b> of Karelia in Russia, near the northwestern shore of Lake Onega, including a few children.|$|R
50|$|The Karelian {{language}} is spoken in Russia, {{mostly in the}} <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> and in a small region just north of Tver, though most residents there were expelled in 1939. Karelian has seen numerous proposed and adopted alphabets over the centuries, both Latin and Cyrillic. In 2007, the current standardized Karelian alphabet was introduced and is used to write all varieties of Karelian, {{with the exception of}} Tver Karelian.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002-2003, in {{the role}} of Artistic Director of the Musical Theatre of Karelia, Nina Rautio {{directed}} their production of Mascagni's [...] "Cavalleria rusticana", as well as taking on the part of Santuzza. In 2003 the government of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> invited her to become the Cultural Affairs Advisor {{to the president of the}} republic. She taught vocal studies at the Popov Academy of Choral Art in Moscow.|$|E
5000|$|During his life, Lonin {{was awarded}} the title of Hero of Socialist Labour (1970) and the Medal [...] "Veteran of Labour" [...] (1987). He {{was one of the}} winners of the All-Union Amateur Artists’ Festival (1985) {{as well as in the}} Second All-Union Popular Culture Festival (1987). He was given the title of Distinguished Cultural Worker of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1992, a medal and a diploma named after T. G Ryabinin for Enlightenment Work in the Russian North (1995) and an award from the Open Society Institute of George Soros for His Devoted Work.|$|E
50|$|By 2002, {{there were}} only 65,651 <b>Karelians</b> in the <b>Republic</b> of Karelia (65.1% of the number in 1926, {{including}} the Karelian regions taken from Finland which were not counted in 1926), and Karelians made up only 9.2% {{of the population in}} their homeland. Russians, meanwhile, were 76.6% of the population in Karelia. This trend continues to this day, and may cause the disappearance of Karelians as a distinct group.|$|R
50|$|Currently Russian is {{the only}} {{official}} language of the <b>republic.</b> <b>Karelian,</b> Veps and Finnish are officially recognized languages of the republic since 2004, and their survival is promoted. Finnish was the second official language of Karelia from the Winter War 1940 (annex of Finnish territories) up until the 1980s, when perestroika began. Thereafter there were suggestions to raise Karelian as the second official language, but they were repeatedly turned down.|$|R
50|$|On July 16, 1956, the SSR was {{downgraded}} from a Union Republic to an ASSR, and retroceded to the Russian SFSR. Beginning on August 9, 1990, the Karelian ASSR declared {{state sovereignty}} and renamed to the <b>Karelian</b> Soviet Socialist <b>Republic</b> (Каре́льская Сове́тская Социалисти́ческая Респу́блика; Karjalan sosialistinen neuvostotasavalta). The Karelian SSR was renamed to the Republic of Karelia on November 13, 1991 and remains a federal subject of Russia.|$|R
50|$|In her research, Markianova {{discovered}} that the Karelian language was a particularly rich one, {{from the point of}} view of word formation. She began to put this in practise when she became the head of the department of Karelian and Veps in the Karelian Pedagogical Institute. She devised an orthography for the Olonec Karelan language, which was made an official one by the leadership of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1989. The orthography for Dvina (Northern) Karelian was developed at the same time by Pekka Zaikov. Markianovas position was that both languages should have one, unified norm for writing, but she fell in the minority.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the outset}} the Karelian local {{authorities}} had been unnerved {{by all of}} this activity, not least as they had initially opposed {{the creation of the}} camp altogether. The authorities' complaints grew louder as time went by: at a meeting to discuss SLON's expansion, local authorities complained about the unfair access which SLON had to cheap labour which would put ordinary foresters out of work; at a subsequent meeting of the Karelian Council of People's Commissars (being the government of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic)</b> in February 1926 SLON was attacked for overcharging for the Kem to Ukhta road with the following summing up by an indignant Comrade Yuzhnev: ...|$|E
5000|$|Since 1997 he {{has also}} headed the Academy for the Defence of Socio-Legal Rights, a Karelian human rights NGO. As {{president}} of that body, in 2002, Yury Dmitriev wrote to the then head of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>republic,</b> Sergei Katanandov, objecting to the proposal by the Karelia Council of Veterans {{to put up a}} statue in Petrozavodsk to Yury Andropov. (KGB chairman from 1967 to 1982, Andropov headed the Komsomol in Karelia during the Great Patriotic War, from 1940 to 1944.) Katanandov did not reply to Dmitriev's letter and the 10-foot-high bust of Andropov was erected. The decision, commented Dmitriev, reflected the nation's attitude to its recent history: [...] "We don't know the past, and we don't want to know." ...|$|E
5000|$|The old Karelian {{railroad}} (Karjalan rata) between Viipuri (Viborg) and Joensuu is {{a railway}} with [...] broad gauge, {{which used to}} link Joensuu, Sortavala, Hiitola, Antrea (now Kamennogorsk) and Viipuri (Vyborg). Originally built in 1892-1894 by Finnish State Railways in the Grand Duchy of Finland, in the 1940s most of the railway up to Niirala was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Peace Treaty, Moscow Armistice and Paris Peace Treaty {{as a result of}} the Winter War and Continuation War. Now the track is located in Leningrad Oblast (<b>Karelian</b> Isthmus), <b>Republic</b> of Karelia and North Karelia. The Sortavala - Joensuu link across the border was abolished after the Continuation War, but was since restored and is currently in use for cargo traffic.|$|R
50|$|Keksgolmsky District {{with the}} {{administrative}} center in Keksgolm {{was established in}} March 1940 {{as a part of}} the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist <b>Republic</b> (<b>Karelian</b> ASSR). On March 31, 1940, the Karelian ASSR was transformed into the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. On November 24, 1944, Keksgolmsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Priozersky, and Keksgolm was renamed Priozersk. On February 1, 1963 the district was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District; on January 12, 1965 it was re-esteblished.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1930 s, the Soviet Union {{recruited}} an estimated 6, 000 Finns from North America {{to augment the}} number of skilled workers in the recently established <b>Karelian</b> Autonomous <b>Republic.</b> Using migrants' letters and memoirs held at the Immigration History Research Center, this essay examines how these North American Finns adapted and responded to fluctuating policies in the Soviet Union that originally flaunted the foreign workers as leaders in the Soviet modernization drive and as the vanguard for exporting revolution, but eventually condemned them as an enemy nation to be expunged. It also analyzes {{the extent to which}} these immigrants internalized 'building socialism' as part of their encounter with Soviet Karelia. Such an exploration requires assessing how these settlers’ ideological adaptation affected their experiences. This paper argues that by placing the North American Finns’ experience in the wider context of Soviet state building policies, these migrants’ identity formation involved participation in, avoidance of, and opposition to the terms of daily life that emerged within the purview of building socialism...|$|R
50|$|From {{the early}} 1990s on, Markianova has also {{published}} various dictionaries. In 1996, she published, together with Tatyana Boiko, her Karjal-venäläine sanakniigu (Karelian-Russian Dictionary). She also worked on developing new vocabulary for Karelian, {{under the auspices}} of Committee on National Affairs of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>Republic,</b> in the commission on terminology and orthography. Among the fruits of these labours were Lingvistiekkuterminät (Linguistic Terminology, 2000), Školasanasto (Vocabulary for Schools, 2000), Fauna- ja florasanasto (Vocabulary on Fauna and Flora, 2005), Ühteis-kunnallis-poliittine sanasto (Vocabulary for Social and Political Affairs, 2004-2004). After these books, Markianova was ready to state that now one could discuss anything in Karelian, no matter what the context. The climax of this work was the Bolšoĭ russko-karelskiĭ slovar (Russian-Karelian General Dictionary, 2011), on which she collaborated with Tatyana Boiko.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 October 2013, {{speaking}} {{during the}} Poedinok programme on the Rossia 1 television channel, {{the leader of}} Russia's extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, known for his headline-grabbing outbursts, called for imposing limits on the birth rate in the Muslim-dominated North Caucasus region of Russia, and restricting the movement of people from that region across the country. These outbursts occurred shortly after the terrorist attack in Volgograd, which left several Russians dead. Zhirinovsky later apologized for his words.During the programme, there was a live population poll conducted via text messaging and internet. Zhirinovsky won that popular vote, with over 140 thousand Russians voting in favour of him. Some Russian nationalists believe {{the best way to}} stop the uptick in Muslim migration is by using oppressive tactics to [...] "stem the tide". In 2006, in the town of Kondopoga, <b>Karelian</b> <b>republic,</b> a brawl in a café involving Chechen migrants and local Russians turned into a massive riot that lasted for several days.|$|E
50|$|In June 1944 {{during the}} Svir-Petrozavodsk {{military}} operation {{there was the}} defeat of the invaders in the south of Karelia. On June 28 of that year soviet troops entered Petrozavodsk. In autumn the whole territory of Karelia was liberated. In June 1944 the government of the Karelo-Finnish SSR decided to return the university to Petrozavodsk. On July 30, 1944 the teachers with their families and students returned to Petrozavodsk from Syktyvkar. During the war the university building was destroyed, all remaining equipment and the library were destroyed. The students and the staff of the university had to make exert every effort on its reconstruction. In the reconstruction the leaders of the <b>Karelian</b> <b>republic</b> took an active part too. The number of teaching staff of the university increased thanks to the teachers who were returning from the front. The new school year 1944 started on October 2, and 242 students began to learn. In summer 1945 the university celebrated its fifth anniversary. In August 1945 in Petrozavodsk State University the new rector V. S. Chepurnov began his activity.|$|E
2500|$|The Saint Petersburg–Hiitola railway is a [...] long railway with [...] {{broad gauge}} located in St.Petersburg, Leningrad Oblast (<b>Karelian</b> Isthmus) and <b>Republic</b> of Karelia, which links Finlyandsky Rail Terminal to Khiytola (...) through Devyatkino, Vaskelovo, Sosnovo, Priozersk and Kuznechnoye. Originally built by Finnish State Railways in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the railway {{was part of}} a trunk line from Vaasa by the Gulf of Botnia to St.Petersburg. In the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty the {{territory}} was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union. The railroad is now operated by the Russian Railways. The railroad is used by passenger trains between St.Petersburg and Sortavala. The track between Khiytola and Sortavala {{is a part of the}} Vyborg–Joensuu railroad completed in 1894.|$|R
50|$|The governorate's {{structure}} {{remained in}} {{place after the}} 1917 revolution. In 1917, the governorate thus comprised nine uyezds. On 2 March 1918, the Ust-Vashsky Uyezd with its center in Ust-Vashka was split off from the Mezensky Uyezd (On 6 February 1922 it was abolished and merged back into the Mezensky Uyezd). Also in 1918, {{the western part of}} the Aleksandrovsky Uyezd was transferred to Finland, which became independent, and the rest of the uyezd was incorporated as Murmansk Governorate. In 1920, the Kemsky Uyezd was transferred to the Karel Labour Commune, which later became the <b>Karelian</b> Socialist Soviet <b>Republic.</b> In 1922, the major part of the Pechorsky District was moved to the newly established Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast. On 15 March 1922, the Kholmogorsky Uyezd was renamed into the Yemetsky Uyezd, and the uyezds town was transferred from Kholmogory to Yemetsk.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, the {{province}} became the Karelian Labour Commune. In 1923, {{the province}} became the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist <b>Republic</b> (<b>Karelian</b> ASSR). From 1940, {{it was made}} into the Karelo-Finnish SSR, incorporating the Finnish Democratic Republic which nominally operated in those parts of Finnish Karelia that were occupied by the Soviet Union during the Winter War. Annexed territories were incorporated into Karelo-Finnish SSR, but after the Continuation War the Karelian Isthmus was incorporated into the Leningrad Oblast. Its status was changed back to an ASSR in 1956. During the Continuation War in 1941 Finland occupied {{large parts of the}} area but was forced to withdraw in 1944. Though Finland is not currently pursuing any measures to reclaim Karelian lands ceded to Russia, the [...] "Karelian Question" [...] is still a topic present in Finnish politics, but it has never been discussed officially.|$|R
