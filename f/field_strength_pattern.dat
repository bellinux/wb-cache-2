The ophiolitic bodies are (1) Refahiye (Erzincan), (2) Şahvelet (Erzurum), (3) Karadag ̆ (Erzurum) and (4) Kırdag ̆ (Erzurum). The ophiolite-related units include well-preserved sections of oceanic lithospheric and accretionary melanges with local blueschist assemblages. The ophiolite-related units in NE Anatolia are unconformably overlain by Campanian–Maastrichtian-aged sediments that were later imbricated with the ophiolitic rocks. Geochemical {{data for the}} individual ophiolite sections indicate a tholeiitic composition, depletion in Nb, enrichment in large ion lithophile elements, parallel to slightly depleted high <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> element <b>patterns</b> (compared with normal-mid ocean ridge basalt), and slightly light rare earth element-depleted to parallel rare earth element trends. These features suggest pro-gressive source depletion towards island arc tholeiites and finally boninites. A fore-arc setting is proposed for the generation of the ophiolites. In contrast, the volcanic rocks from the mélange units exhibit tholeiitic to alkaline compositions and either depletion or enrichment of rare earth element and high <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> elements.

Accompanying the experimental efforts of the LOPES project, situated at the KASCADE-Grande site of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, we have modeled the underlying emission mechanism {{in the scheme of}} coherent geosynchrotron radiation from electron-positron pairs deflected in the earth's magnetic field. As a follow-up to our earlier analytical calculations, we have developed a Monte Carlo simulation based on analytic parametrisations of air shower properties, including longitudinal and lateral particle distributions, particle energy and track-length distributions, and the longitudinal shower development as a whole.

40|$|AbstractA novel {{approach}} to create O/W/O is developed and described to achieve uniform oil drop size coated with thin layers of water. Drops were created using a test cell where the DC field is applied between different internal diameter (ID) needles (from which the O/W emulsion emits upwards into a continuous oil phase) and a grounded metal ring which was located at selected distances from the needle top. The advantages {{compared to the}} previous techniques consist of possibility of control on drop size and coating layer of the water using low electric field. A high speed imaging technique {{has been applied to}} determine drop size under different flow and electric field conditions. Without the electric field, several flow regimes were observed; stable formation of both the O/W/O emulsion and the O/W emulsion upstream of the cell was possible over a range of Reynolds numbers from 80 to 100. The effect of the electric field was found to be reverse below electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> of 60 kVm− 1, beyond this critical value there was significant impact upon the flow regime, drop size and emulsion structure.
