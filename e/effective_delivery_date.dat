40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a single machine scheduling problem with two common <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> and unequal release dates for the jobs. The {{goal is to}} maximize the cumulative number of jobs processed before each <b>delivery</b> <b>date.</b> The general problem (with K ≥ 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>dates)</b> results from a practical situation in book digitization. The two <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> case considered here is weakly NP-hard. In this paper, we show for this problem a polynomial time algorithm with an absolute guarantee of 1. By considering the two <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> problem, this paper lays the basis for an approximation algorithm for the general K <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> problem...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the spot}} date falls {{before the end}} of the month but the {{resultant}} <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is beyond the end of the target month then the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is defined by convention to be the last business day of the target month. For example, assuming all days are business days: if the spot date is 30 January, a one-month time to expiry implies <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> 30 February—however, this doesn’t exist and the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> becomes 28 February (in a non-leap year).|$|R
5000|$|For a {{trade with}} time to expiry of y months, {{the expiry date}} is found by first calculating the spot date, then moving forward y months from the spot <b>date</b> to the <b>delivery</b> <b>date.</b> If the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is a non-business day or a US holiday, move forward until an {{acceptable}} <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> is found. Finally, calculate the expiry date using an [...] "inverse spot" [...] operation; e.g., find the expiry date for which the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> would be its spot. When finding the expiry <b>date</b> from the <b>delivery</b> <b>date,</b> there must be one clear business day and one weekday (not including 1 January) in any applicable non-USD/non-CAD, non-USD/non-TRY, non-USD/non-PHP, non-USD/non-RUB, non-USD/non-KZT and non-USD/non-PKR currency. If one leg of the currency pair is a non-deliverable currency, the expiry date must be a business day of that currency.|$|R

Given a set of job-independent <b>delivery</b> <b>dates,</b> the goal is to maximize the cumulative number of jobs processed before each <b>delivery</b> <b>date.</b> We establish the complexity of the general problem.

In order to guarantee the customers’ satisfaction and sustainable success it is essential to keep the fixed <b>delivery</b> <b>date.</b> Therefore a performance measurement system needs to be applied. In the following a specific approach for the performance analysis for Virtual Enterprises is introduced. Hereby both the comprehensive approach for performance analysis and the procedure for the evaluation of the compliance to <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> are considered. This concept allows an adaptive applicability which is necessary to support the short-term management of order-specific configured Virtual Enterprises within smart networked environments...|$|R

40|$|In most {{classical}} scheduling models, it {{is assumed}} that a job is dispatched to a customer immediately after its processing completes. In many practical situations, however, a set of <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> may be fixed before any jobs are processed. This is particularly relevant where delivery is an expensive or complicated operation, for example, as with heavy machinery. A similar situation arises where customers find deliveries disruptive and thus require them to be made within a limited time interval that repeats periodically. A third possibility is that a periodic business function, for example, the supplier's billing cycle, effectively defines a <b>delivery</b> <b>date,</b> and includes all jobs that have been completed since the previous billing cycle. These situations are not adequately represented by classical scheduling models. We consider a variety of deterministic scheduling problems in which a job is dispatched to a customer at the earliest fixed <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> that is no earlier than the completion time of its processing. Problems where the number of <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> is constant, and others where it is specified as part of data input, are studied. For almost all problems considered, we either provide an efficient algorithm or establish that such an algorithm is unlikely to exist. By doing so, we permit comparisons between the solvability of these fixed <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> problems and of the corresponding classical scheduling problem...|$|R

40|$|Consider a {{group of}} product devices such as DRAM's of {{different}} specifications while such products can be purchased from the market at the spot price that fluctuates over time. Because of this, a final product-maker often makes a contract with a supplier where <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> and prices of such devices are pre-determined. In this situation, the supplier typically ignores the price volatilities and organizes its production activities based on the <b>delivery</b> <b>dates.</b> A prevalent software package using MRP for example cannot take the price volatilities into account explicitly. In this paper, a theoretical framework is exhibited where the supplier determines its production schedule based on not only the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> and the pre-determined prices but also the price volatilities of the devices...|$|R

40|$|Part IV: ICT and Emerging TechnologiesInternational audienceToday a high {{adherence}} to <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> {{is the main}} logistic target for manufacturing companies. To control the increasing complexity of production planning and control manufacturing companies use IT systems. However, the applied IT systems often do not provide a reliable forecast of <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> and thus affect the required {{adherence to}} <b>delivery</b> <b>dates.</b> The paper describes a cyber-physical approach to optimize the production planning and control towards a reliable detailed planning.
