40|$|There are {{fundamental}} differences between assets held by closed and open-end funds. Past {{research indicates that}} closed-end funds are less liquid than open-end funds. For example, {{a larger percentage of}} closed-end funds hold less liquid international securities. This paper surveys the existing evidence of the impact of <b>illiquid</b> <b>assets</b> on the prices of open and closed-end funds. Specifically, it surveys existing literature on whether the price discount typically observed on closed-end funds is the expected result given the inescapable costs associated with managing relatively <b>illiquid</b> <b>assets</b> in closed-end funds. This paper synthesizes the various observations into one coherent theme: <b>illiquid</b> <b>assets</b> appear to be a significant source of the differences in the behavior we observe between open and closed-end funds.

50|$|Liquidity is {{the ability}} to quickly resell an asset for fair or near-fair value. All else equal, an {{investor}} will want a higher return on an <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> than a liquid one, to compensate for the loss of the option to sell it at any time. U.S. Treasury bonds are highly liquid with an active secondary market, while some other debts are less liquid. In the mortgage market, the lowest rates are often issued on loans that can be re-sold as securitized loans. Highly non-traditional loans such as seller financing often carry higher interest rates due to lack of liquidity.|$|E

Liquidity risk also tends to compound other risks. If a trading organization has a position in an <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset,</b> its limited ability to liquidate that position at short notice will compound its market risk. Suppose a firm has offsetting cash flows with two different counterparties on a given day. If the counterparty that owes it a payment defaults, the firm will have to raise cash from other sources to make its payment. Should it be unable to do so, it too will default. Here, liquidity risk is compounding credit risk.|$|E

40|$|The {{manager of}} a firm that is selling an <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> has {{discretion}} as to the sale price: if he chooses a high (low) selling price, early sale is unlikely (likely). If the manager has the option to default on the debt that is collaterized by the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset,</b> the optimal selling price depends on whether the manager acts {{in the interest of}} the owners or the creditors. We model the former case. In the preferred equilibrium, the owner will always offer the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> for sale at a strictly higher price than he paid, and he will always default if he fails to sell.

30|$|We {{will now}} {{explain how the}} {{clearing}} vector p and the price q of the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> can endogenously be derived. The presence of the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> enables us to incorporate the effect of fire sales into the model. As described in the introduction, the basic economic idea is that, if a bank is unable to pay its outstanding debt in the considered period using its shares of the liquid asset and interbank payments, it can sell a proportion of its <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> holdings at the current market price. This triggers {{an increase in the}} supply of the asset that can decrease its market price during times of crisis. Consequently, other banks holding the same asset are also affected by such a price decline. In particular, if they need to sell an amount of the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> themselves, the proceeds from this transaction are diminished. At the same time, the price is further pushed down.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a market}} {{consisting}} of two correlated assets: one liquidly traded asset and one <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> {{that can only be}} traded at time 0. For a European derivative written on the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset,</b> we find a hedging strategy consisting of a constant (time 0) holding in the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> and dynamic trading strategies in the liquid asset and a riskless bank account that minimizes the expected square replication error at maturity. This mean-variance optimal strategy is first found when the liquidly traded asset is a local martingale under the real world probability measure through an application of the Kunita-Watanabe projection onto the space of attainable claims. The result is then extended to the case where the liquidly traded asset is a continuous square integrable semimartingale, and we again use the Kunita-Watanabe decomposition, now under the variance optimal martingale measure, to find the mean-variance optimal strategy in feedback form. In an example, we consider the case where the two assets are driven by correlated Brownian motions and the derivative is a call option on the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset.</b> We use this example to compare the terminal hedging profit and loss of the optimal strategy to a corresponding strategy that does not use the static hedge in the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> and conclude that the use of the static hedge reduces the expected square replication error significantly (by up to 90 % in some cases).

Note that leaving out the extra condition (3) in the initial step may lead to an incorrect result if the contagion cascade is solely triggered by the asset price effect.

40|$|The {{presence}} of illiquid assets, such as human wealth {{or a family}} owned business, complicates the problem of portfolio choice. This paper {{is concerned with the}} problem of optimal asset allocation and consumption in a continuous time model when one asset cannot be traded. This <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset,</b> which depends on an uninsurable source of risk, provides a liquid dividend. In the case of human capital we can think about this dividend as labor income. The agent is endowed with a given amount of the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> and with some liquid wealth which can be allocated in a market where there is a risky and a riskless asset. The main point of the paper is that the optimal allocations to the two liquid assets and consumption will critically depend on the endowment and characteristics of the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset,</b> in addition to the preferences and to the liquid holdings held by the agent. We provide what we believe to be the first analytical solution to this problem when the agent has power utility of consumption and terminal wealth. We also derive the value that the agent assigns to the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset.</b> The risk adjusted valuation procedure we develop can be used to value both liquid and illiquid assets, as well as contingent claims on those assets. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the optimal structure of derivatives written on an <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset,</b> such as a catastrophic or a weather event. This transaction involves two agents: a bank which wants to hedge its initial exposure towards this <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset</b> and an investor which may buy the contract. Both agents also have the opportunity to invest their residual wealth on a financial market. Based on a utility maximization point of view, we determine an optimal profile (and its value) such that it maximizes the bank's utility given that the investor decides to make the deal only if it increases its utility. In the case of exponential utility, we show that the pricing rule is a non-linear function of the structure and that the bank always transfers the same proportion of its initial exposure. In the general case, an additional term appears, depending only on the relative log-likelihood of the two agents' views of the distribution of the <b>illiquid</b> <b>asset.</b> ...|$|E
