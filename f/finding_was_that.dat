5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} {{publications}} of four major marketing journals {{on the basis}} of their diversity relative to each other, against their mission statements, and over time. One important <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the journals that make no claim to diversity tend to be quite diverse, while the one <b>that</b> strives to <b>be</b> diverse does not seem to achieve its goal. A second major <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each of the four journals has a distinct character <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily the one intended by its mission or its editors. A third major <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these patterns <b>are</b> generally stable over time and tend to persist even in the face of efforts and pleas by its editors for change...|$|R
25|$|The aim {{of another}} ELEMENT-study was {{to monitor the}} {{development}} of general mathematical ability. One finding is that those admitted to a Gymnasium after the fourth grade had showed better mathematical ability than those who stayed in primary school, ab initio. That was true for all social classes. Another <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> children of all social classes did better {{in the sixth grade}} when they were at a Gymnasium. By the end of the sixth grade, those attending a Gymnasium were two years ahead of those attending a primary school.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} that when mental {{rotation}} {{is used as a}} predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on SAT, {{there was a significant difference}} in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury, and {{has been shown in}} animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury. Ciclosporin blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Ciclosporin's neuroprotective properties were first discovered in the early 1990s when two researchers (Eskil Elmér and Hiroyuki Uchino) were conducting experiments in cell transplantation. An unintended <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> CsA was strongly neuroprotective when it crossed the blood–brain barrier. This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse.|$|E
50|$|Three major {{unexpected}} findings {{resulted from}} this work. The first <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> gradient responses in general do not evolve {{by changes in}} transcription factor (TF) binding site quality or quantity (site density) as expected, but rather by changes in the precise spacing between binding sites for morphogenic TFs and their partner TFs. The second <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> homotypic site clustering at such enhancers was largely {{the result of a}} complex evolutionary history of selection for different threshold responses in the evolving insect egg. A third-related <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> frequent selection for different responses also enriches for microsatellite repeat tracts, which are inherently unstable and most responsible for the production of novel indel alleles.|$|R

25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E
25|$|Subsidies for {{the centers}} had reached NOK300 million by 1991. Two public {{evaluations}} with {{of the project}} concluded {{that it was a}} failure. The main <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the decision to establish the centers had been taken early in the process and that reports and later work were then carried out to find areas to serve, instead of establishing if there was a market for the amount of centers. According to the report from Nordlandsforskning, only Norsk Data gained from the project. The overcapacity and costs tied up 92 percent of the public information technology budget, hindering other project which could have created value from being carried out. Lack of projects caused FUNN to not result in any advantages to the communities where it was located.|$|E
25|$|Norsk Data engaged {{a number}} of {{consultancy}} companies to analyze the firm in 1989. One important <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the customers' perception of ND's strengths and weaknesses was completely different from the employees' perception. Another was that the customers did not understand ND's strategy and a general dissatisfaction with software and the high turnover in the sales force. Also administrative routines {{were found to be}} a shortcoming and one consultant company stated that ND was the company they had investigated which had the most room for improvement. Management introduced a company-wide program to increase all employees' focus on market orientation, but the top management carried out several public blunders in poor customer management through the press. Terje Mikkelsen started negotiations to sell ND to a major competitor, but no deal was ever made.|$|E

25|$|Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, {{although}} also integrally {{connected to}} unimodal AES neurons, {{are not directly}} connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected {{in other areas of}} the cortex, resulting in the observation that cortical and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated. Stein, London, Wilkinson and Price (1996) analysed the perceived luminance of an LED in the context of spatially disparate auditory distracters of various types. A significant <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a sound increased the perceived brightness of the light, regardless of their relative spatial locations, provided the light's image was projected onto the fovea. Here, the apparent lack of the spatial rule, further differentiates cortical and tectal multisensory neurons. Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy. Nevertheless, cortical neurons governing perception, and a separate sub cortical system governing action (orientation behavior) is synonymous with the perception action hypothesis of the visual stream. Further investigation into this field is necessary before any substantial claims can be made.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} Pew Research Center <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in 2015 71% of the {{population}} of Russia declared itself Eastern Orthodox, 15% religiously unaffiliated—a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”, 10% Muslim, and 2% other Christians, while 1% belonged to other faiths. The religiously unaffiliated divided between 4% as atheists, 1% as agnostics and 10% as nothing in particular. The study cited that during the communist era the government repression of religion was widespread, and due to the Soviet anti-religious legislation; in 1991 37% {{of the population}} of Russia was Eastern Orthodox. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the affiliation to the Eastern Orthodox church have risen substantially and in 2015 about 71% {{of the population of}} Russia declared itself to be Eastern Orthodox, and the share of who identitied as religiously unaffiliated declined from a 61% in 1991 to 18% in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} question posed about congenital amusia {{is if it}} has a genetic origin. A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia. Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group. Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group. This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical. A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.|$|E

25|$|In 1128 Suero twice {{got into}} a dispute with the monastery of Corias over {{a piece of land}} at Peñaullán. He {{appointed}} two of his own knights, Martín Martínez and Pedro Menéndez, to make an enquiry into the dispute and adjudicate it. On 1 February 1129 Suero and his brother Gutierre made exchange of properties. Later that year Suero and fellow Asturian Gonzalo Peláez were sent by the king to Almazán to negotiate with Alfonso the Battler, who still laid claim to the Leonese-Castilian throne. Gonzalo had long been a rival with Suero in western Asturias. In 1131 a monk of Corias was bringing a large load of wheat from León to Laciana through the lands governed by Suero when he was stopped by two of the count's officials and assessed a toll. He refused to pay it and the dispute became violent. Subsequently, Suero was forced by the monks of Corias to make an enquiry, appointing two of his knights, Pedro Garcés and Juan Pérez, with the task. Their <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a similar dispute had occurred between Corias and Suero's brother Gutierre during the reign of Alfonso VI, and that the king had ruled the monks owed no portazgo (tolls on cartage) within the tenencia of Laciana. Suero therefore renounced his right to the toll. In 1132 Suero again judged a lawsuits involving Corias.|$|E
