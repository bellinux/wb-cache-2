DDoS <b>flooding</b> <b>attacks</b> are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services. Attackers usually gain access to a large number of computers by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack armies (i. e., Botnets). Once an attack army has been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale attack against one or more targets. Developing a comprehensive defense mechanism against identified and anticipated DDoS <b>flooding</b> <b>attacks</b> is a desired goal of the intrusion detection and prevention research community. However, the development of such a mechanism requires a comprehensive understanding of the problem and the techniques that have been used thus far in preventing, detecting, and responding to various DDoS <b>flooding</b> <b>attacks.</b> In this paper, we explore the scope of the DDoS <b>flooding</b> <b>attack</b> problem and attempts to combat it. We categorize the DDoS <b>flooding</b> <b>attacks</b> and classify existing countermeasures based on where and when they prevent, detect, and respond to the DDoS <b>flooding</b> <b>attacks.</b> Moreover, we highlight the need for a comprehensive distributed and collaborative defense approach.

This kind of attack consumes {{a large amount of}} network {{bandwidth}} or occupies network equipment resources by flooding them with packets from the machines distributed all over the world. To ensure the network usability and reliability, real-time and accurate detection of these attacks is critical. To date, various approaches have been proposed to detect these attacks, but with limited success when they are used in the real world. This paper presents a method that can real-time identify the occurrence of the DDoS <b>flood</b> <b>attack</b> and determine its intensity using the fuzzy logic. The proposed process consists of two stages: (i) statistical analysis of the network traffic time series using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Schwarz information criterion (SIC) to find out the change point of Hurst parameter resulting from DDoS <b>flood</b> <b>attack,</b> and then (ii) adaptively decide the intensity of the DDoS <b>flood</b> <b>attack</b> by using the intelligent fuzzy logic technology to analyze the Hurst parameter and its changing rate.
