The integral intensities of the two high-energy features diminish monotonically as temperature rises up, while those of the two low-energy features decrease below but increase anomalously above 180 K. A phenomenological model is established that the residual electrons in the final state of the PL transition transfer into nonradiative state via thermal hopping, and the thermal hopping produces in parallel holes in the final state and hence enhances the radiative recombination significantly.

50|$|So far, most ETLs and HTLs {{consist of}} organic materials. Most organic {{electroluminescent}} materials favor injection and transport of holes rather than electrons. Thus, the <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> generally occurs near the cathode, {{which could lead}} to the quenching of the exciton produced. In order to prevent the produced excitons or holes from approaching the cathode, a hole-blocking layer plays dual roles in blocking holes moving towards the cathode and transporting the electrons to the emitting QD layer. Tris-aluminium (Alq3), bathocuproine (BCP), and TAZ are the most commonly used hole-blocking materials. These materials can be used as both electron-transporting layer and hole blocking layer.|$|E
50|$|TiO2 {{nanoparticles}} are synthesized {{in several}} tens of nanometer scales (~100 nm). In {{order to make}} a photovoltaic cell, molecular sensitizers (dye molecules) are attached to the titania surface. The dye-absorbed titania is finally enclosed by a liquid electrolyte. This type of dye-sensitized solar cell is also known as a Grätzel cell. Dye-sensitized solar cell has a disadvantage of a short diffusion length. Recently, supermolecular or multifunctional sensitizers have been investigated so as to enhance carrier diffusion length. For example, a dye chromophore has been modified by the addition of secondary electron donors. Minority carriers (holes in this case) diffuse to the attached electron donors to recombine. Therefore, <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> is retarded by the physical separation between the dye-cation moiety and the TiO2 surface, as shown in Fig. 5. Finally, this process raises the carrier diffusion length, resulting in the increase of carrier lifetime.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{semiconductor}} lasers can be realised only {{in direct}} gap semiconductors. The reasoning behind {{that is that}} a pair of electron and hole near minima of their bands in an indirect gap semiconductor can recombine only with production of a phonon and a photon, due to energy and momentum conservation laws. This kind of process is weak in comparison with <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> in a direct semiconductor. Consequently, the pumping of these transitions {{has to be very}} intense so as to obtain a steady laser generation. Hence, the lasing transition with production of only one particle - photon - must be resonant. This means that the lasing transition must be allowed by momentum and energy conservation laws to generate in a steady form. Photons have negligible wave vectors and therefore the band extremes {{have to be in the}} same position of the Brillouin zone [...] On the other hand, for devices such as SASERs, acoustic phonons have a considerable dispersion. According to dynamics, this leads to the statement that the levels on which the laser should operate, must be in the k-space relatively to each other. K-space refers to a space where things are in terms of momentum and frequency instead of position and time. The conversion between real space and k-space is a mathematical transformation called the Fourier transform and thus k-space can be also called Fourier space.|$|E

5000|$|Starting with {{a liquid}} crystal in the nematic phase, the desired helical pitch (the {{distance}} along the helical axis for one complete {{rotation of the}} nematic plane subunits) {{can be achieved by}} doping the liquid crystal with a chiral molecule. For light circularly polarized with the same handedness, this regular modulation of the refractive index yields selective reflection of the wavelength given by the helical pitch, allowing the liquid-crystal laser to serve as its own resonator cavity. Photonic crystals are amenable to band theory methods, with the periodic dielectric structure playing the role of the periodic electric potential and a photonic band gap (reflection notch) corresponding to forbidden frequencies. The lower photon group velocity and higher density of states near the photonic bandgap suppresses spontaneous emission and enhances stimulated emission, providing favorable conditions for lasing. If the electronic band edge falls in the photonic bandgap, <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> is strictly suppressed. This allows for devices with high lasing efficiency, low lasing threshold, and stable frequency, where the liquid-crystal laser acts its own waveguide.

50|$|When a p-type {{semiconductor}} and a n-type semiconductor form a junction, {{the holes in}} the p-type side and the electrons in the n-type side tend to redistribute around the interface area to balance the local electric field, which results in a charge depletion layer. The diffusion and recombination of the electrons and holes in the junction region is close related to the optoelectronic properties of the device, which is greatly affected by the local electric field distribution. The existence of the piezo-charges at the interface introduces three effects: a shift in local electronic band structure due to the introduced local potential, a tilt of the electronic band structure over the junction region for the polarization existing in the piezoelectric semiconductor, and a change in the charge depletion layer due to the redistribution of the local charge carriers to balance the local piezo-charges. The positive piezoelectric charges at the junction lower the energy band and the negative piezoelectric charges raise the energy band in n-type semiconductor region near the junction region. A modification in the local band by piezopotential may be effective for trapping charges so that the <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> rate can be largely enhanced, which is very beneficial for improving the efficiency of a light-emitting diode. Furthermore, the inclined band tends to change the mobility of the carriers moving toward the junction.The materials for piezo-phototronics should have three basic properties: piezoelectricity, semiconductor property, and photon excitation property 5. Typical materials are the wurtzite structures, such as ZnO, GaN and InN. the three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor properties, which is the basis of piezotronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric-photon excitation coupling), optoelectronics, and piezo-phototronics piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.|$|E
40|$|Exciton {{binding energy}} and <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> {{probability}} {{are presented as}} the two important metrics for investigating effect of dot size on electron-hole interaction in CdSe quantum dots. Direct computation of <b>electron-hole</b> <b>recombination</b> probability is challenging because it requires an accurate mathematical description of electron-hole wavefunction {{in the neighborhood of}} the electron-hole coalescence point. In this work, we address this challenge by solving the electron-hole Schrodinger equation using the electron-hole explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock (eh-XCHF) method. The calculations were performed for a series of CdSe clusters ranging from Cd_ 20 Se_ 19 to Cd_ 74608 Se_ 74837 that correspond to dot diameter range of 1 - 20 nm.
