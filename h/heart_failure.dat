5|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>failure</b> {{is where}} the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> of the right heart or the left heart. Left <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> can also lead to right <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E

40|$|Proper {{diagnosis}} of <b>heart</b> <b>failures</b> is critical, since the appropriate treatments are strongly {{dependent upon the}} underlying cause. Furthermore, rapid diagnosis is also critical, since the effectiveness of some treatments depends upon rapid initiation. In this paper, a new web-based telecardiology system has been proposed for diagnosis, consultation, and treatment. The aim of this implemented telecardiology system is to help to practitioner doctor, if clinic findings of patient misgive <b>heart</b> <b>failures.</b> This model consists of three subsystems. The first subsystem divides into recording and preprocessing phase. Here, electrocardiography signal is recorded from emergency patient and this recorded signal is preprocessed for detection of RR interval. The second subsystem realizes classification of RR interval. In other words, this second subsystem is to diagnosis <b>heart</b> <b>failures.</b> In this study, a combined classification system has been designed using type- 2 fuzzy c-means clustering (T 2 FCM) algorithm and neural networks. T 2 FCM was used to improve performance of neural networks which was obtained very high performance accuracy to classify RR intervals of ECG signals. This proposed automated telecardiology and diagnostic system assists to practitioner doctor to diagnosis <b>heart</b> <b>failures</b> easily. Training and testing data for this diagnostic system are included five ECG signal classes. The third subsystem is consultation and teletreatment between practitioner (or family) doctor and cardiologist worked in research hospital with prepared web page (www. telekardiyoloji. com). However, opportunity of signal’s evaluation is presented to practitioner and expert doctor with prepared interfaces. T 2 FCM {{is applied to the}} training data for the selection of best segments in the second subsystem. A new training set formed by these best segments was classified using the neural networks classifier which has backpropagation well-known algorithm and generalized delta rule learning. Recognition accuracy rate was found as 99 % using proposed Type- 2 Fuzzy Clustering Neural Networks (T 2 FCNN) method...|$|R

5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (in particular, unstable or acute congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure)</b> increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E

In other words, if {{a patient is}} on hospice for end-stage congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> the hospice is responsible for all care related to the <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
