5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.|$|E
5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum told him it was best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E
5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E

5|$|Snow White {{is saved}} by seven dwarfs, each {{named after the}} days of the week and {{possessing}} the power to transform into a rainbow to move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another (but are only capable if all seven dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E

25|$|Although F.auricularia have {{well-developed}} wings, {{they are}} fairly weak and are rarely, if ever, used. Instead, as their main form of transportation, earwigs are carried <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another on clothing or commercial products like lumber, ornamental shrubs and even newspaper bundles.|$|E
25|$|Basically, an {{information}} society is {{the means of}} getting information <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another (Wark, 1997, p.22). As technology has become more advanced over time so too has {{the way we have}} adapted in sharing this information with each other.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{products}} {{available to help}} mobility in dogs suffering from hip dysplasia.

25|$|Because of {{the large}} size of UP, {{hundreds}} of yards throughout its rail network are needed to effectively handle the daily transport of goods <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another.

25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, Shelties can {{and have been}} used as sheepdogs and still {{participate}} in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another by causing fear-flocking and flight behavior. The instinct to herd is primarily a product of breeding. No amount of training can substitute this trait.|$|E
5000|$|Gel-Shocker (Geru-Shokkā) {{was formed}} after the {{destruction}} of Shocker, with {{the remnants of the}} organization absorbing another organization Geldam (Gerudamu-dan) based in Africa. After Ambassador Hell's defeat, The Great Leader reorganized the organization from the ground up, destroying all remaining secret bases and even liquidating the remaining troop contingent in a bloody forest massacre witnessed by unfortunate campers. Gel-Shocker troopers wore bright purple and yellow costumes, were capable of traveling <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another by transforming into sheets that would drop down onto unsuspecting victims, and were capable of taking more blunt violent abuse than their predecessors ...|$|R

25|$|Differences in {{hydraulic}} head (h) cause water to move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another; water flows from locations of high h to locations of low h. Hydraulic head {{is composed of}} pressure head (ψ) and elevation head (z). The head gradient is the change in {{hydraulic head}} per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy's law as being proportional to the discharge.|$|E
25|$|The trot is {{the working}} gait for a horse. Despite what one sees in movies, horses can only canter and gallop {{for short periods}} at a time, after which they need time to rest and recover. Horses in good {{condition}} can maintain a working trot for hours. The trot is the main way horses travel quickly <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> the next.|$|E

50|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Hungary, Gottlieb {{was forced to}} move {{with her husband and}} daughters <b>from</b> <b>one</b> hiding <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another. To avoid being recognized as a Jew when passing through checkpoints, she used to tuck her head in a bouquet of flowers. She said that the flower motifs in her designs were a tribute to the flowers that saved her life.|$|R

25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that {{is rooted in the}} ground, and {{transfer}} it <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another, the tree will no longer bear fruit. And if it does, the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of nature. I think if I had left my country, I would be the same as the tree.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{microgroove}} LP rpm {{record and}} the 45rpm single records are made from vinyl plastic that is flexible and unbreakable in normal use, {{even when they are}} sent through the mail with care <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another. The vinyl records, however, are easier to scratch or gouge, and much more prone to warping compared to most 78rpm records, which were made of shellac.|$|E
25|$|Animal locomotion, in ethology, is any of {{a variety}} of {{movements}} or methods that animals use to move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> another. Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called passive locomotion, e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), kiting (spiders) and rolling (some beetles and spiders).|$|E
50|$|Sex {{and the law}} {{deals with}} the {{regulation}} by law of human sexual activity. Sex laws vary <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>place</b> or jurisdiction <b>to</b> another, and have varied over time, and unlawful sexual acts are also called sex crimes.|$|R
50|$|In Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move <b>from</b> <b>one</b> hiding <b>place</b> <b>to</b> the next, making {{occasional}} {{contact with}} other Jews in hiding. Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, {{but it is a}} trick—the Gestapo arrest them on the train and take them to Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.|$|R
