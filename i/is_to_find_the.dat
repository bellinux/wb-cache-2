5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, their goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> bird, send {{it into the}} air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E

Random enemy encounters occasionally interrupt travel across the world map screen and hostile areas, as in other Final Fantasy related games.|$|E

5|$|Hawkwing's Journey is the 9th Super Edition {{novel that}} was {{released}} on 1 November 2016. It follows Hawkwing a apprentice, warrior and eventual deputy of Skyclan. It details the introduction of Darktail, the main antagonist of both Hawkwing's Journey and of the sixth arc A Vision of Shadow. The plot revolves around Darktail's treachery and eventually Skyclan's forced exile from the Gorge territory. Leafstar, the leader of Skyclan decides that the gorge is lost and that the clan's only hope <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Warrior Clans. So Skyclan sets out searching for the Lake territories. The book ends with Skyclan still wandering with many of its cats scattered or dead. Despite all this, the cats that remain still held their faith and continued on, trusting Starclan to lead them to the Lake.|$|E
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E

25|$|The field H {{is defined}} as the long {{wavelength}} Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> statistics of H and not the spins. Once the correlations in H are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in H.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} groups have recently explored {{the use of}} quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks. The standard approach to training Boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Another possibility is {{to rely on a}} physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.|$|E

Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions so we may transcend our context and become more godlike.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{example of}} such a problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> curve of {{shortest}} length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is obviously a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, where the optical length depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least action.|$|E
