25|$|Under {{its unique}} {{macro-economic}} and political environment, the China {{has adopted a}} special telecommunications policy and strategy for telecommunications reform. As a fundamental and strategic industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) of China has monopolized telecommunication operations {{for more than four}} decades. Recognizing its incapability of monopolizing the huge market and of meeting increasing demand, China launched a telecommunications reform that has been aimed at <b>full</b> <b>competition.</b> As the result, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and it is now being extended to pluralistic competition. In 1994, China Unicom was formed and allowed to build and to operate nationwide cellular networks. To promote fair competition in the paging service, the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{expiration}} of his ban, {{he returned to}} competition in the 2009 season. He {{won the gold medal}} at the 2009 Bolivarian Games in November, jumping a season's best of 8.25m, and also helped Venezuela's 4×100 metres relay team to a silver medal. He made few appearances in 2010, but returned to <b>full</b> <b>competition</b> the year after. He ran a 200 metres personal best of 21.22seconds in May at the national championships, placing third in the sprint after winning the long jump title. A jump of 7.72m brought him fourth place at the 2011 South American Championships in Athletics and a month later he represented Venezuela at the 2011 Military World Games in Rio de Janeiro, where he took the bronze medal with a clearance of 7.81m. With the wind right on the permissible limit, he had a jump of 8.03m at the 2011 ALBA Games – a mark which earned him the gold medal. His season came to a peak at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara as he jumped 8.05m (his third best ever) to secure the gold medal, becoming the second Venezuelan man to win an athletics gold at the competition (following Rafael Romero's 200m win in 1963).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{new designs}} were {{discussed}} but {{concerns over the}} technical aspects (a photograph or a painting inspired by a photograph) delayed a <b>full</b> <b>competition</b> for artists until 1965. Postmaster General Tony Benn and artist David Gentleman failed {{in their attempts to}} have the royal head replaced by the name of the country ("Great Britain" [...] or [...] "U.K."), but were permitted to explore temporary solutions to the commemorative head problems. This would of course have removed the uniqueness of the United Kingdom in being the only producer of postage stamps not to have its country name on its stamps in honour of its origination of the adhesive postage stamp in 1840. In 1966 Gentleman created a small single-coloured profile from a coin by Mary Gillick. The project waited until the miniaturisation of the new definitive effigy that the Stamp Advisory Committee (SAC) had advised the Postmaster General on 13 January 1965 be chosen, from profiles and engraved images based on a photograph.|$|E

2500|$|The MB2 was rebranded as Ginn Racing {{following}} Bobby Ginn's {{purchase of}} the team in 2006. He moved to Ginn's No. 13 with a [...] CertainTeed sponsorship after veteran Mark Martin and rookie Regan Smith were tapped to share the No. 01 car. In July 2007, Nemechek was released {{due to a lack}} of sponsorship for the No. 13, which was subsequently shut down. He signed with E Motorsports and although he failed his first attempt to qualify at Indy, he made his way into the field for the Michigan race weekend driving the No. 08 Fans On Board-sponsored Dodge. He spent the rest of the season driving for Furniture Row Racing, and signed a three-year contract with FRR to continue to drive in the No. 78 and help expand the team. In April 2008, at Talladega, Joe Nemechek grabbed his 10th career pole driving the No. 78 National Day of Prayer/ Furniture Row-sponsored car. [...] It marked Furniture Row Racing's first ever pole. In October 2008, Nemechek finished 11th at the Talladega race. In November 2008, Furniture Row Racing announced that they were planning on running a limited schedule in 2009 or perhaps not at all in light of the economic situation. The day after this announcement Nemechek was released from his contract and as a result making him free to pursue other opportunities for 2009 and beyond. Shortly thereafter, Joe announced that he would be bringing his NEMCO Motorsports team back to <b>full</b> <b>competition</b> in both of NASCAR's top series, Sprint Cup and Nationwide. He would race the No. 87 Chevy in Nationwide and the No. 87 Camry in Cup. Nemechek ran most of the races for both series that season, but occasionally had a younger fill in. In the Pepsi 300 at Nashville Superspeedway, Nemechek flipped after contact with several other cars. His car had minor damage, and he was able to drive it back to pit road.|$|E
