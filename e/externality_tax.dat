Irrigation impacts contribute a significant portion to the estimated forty six million dollar cost per annum of salinity in the Murray River, Australia. Policies available to regulators include <b>externality</b> <b>taxes</b> and levies. In 2002 the Victorian Government introduced a system of salinity levies in the irrigation regions of Sunraysia, northern Victoria. These levies differ from typical taxes because they also introduce trade barriers between certain locations. These trade barriers may increase the cost of reducing salinity. We use experiments to compare the salinity levy with trade barriers to an alternative salinity tax which removes the trade barriers and replaces them with a ‘large’ tax relative to other geographic zones. Our results show that the salinity tax reduces the cost of salinity interception by the government by twenty five percent as compared to the salinity levy. We observe water prices do not increase when regulation is introduced, this may be because the introduction of taxes and levies encourages buyers to act more aggressively preventing sellers from extracting surplus on trades. Further, the introduction of regulation does not increase variability in average outcomes for these markets. <b>Externality</b> <b>Taxes,</b> Experiments, Double Auction, Environmental Policy, Salinity. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Linear {{economic}} {{models were}} utilized to predict effects of various environmental control policies on individual firms. Four different linear models were specified {{and in some}} instances relatively minor changes in specification were made which resulted in additional sub-models. Models varied as to numbers and types of fixed factors, variable cost relationships, market products, and fixed factor requirements. Once each model or sub-model was described five or six policies were theoretically applied to that model. Policies used were: taxing market products, taxing variable factors, taxing a non-market externality (external diseconomy), a standard {{on the quality of the}} externality, subsidizing variable factors and subsidizing fixed factors. It was assumed that the non-market externality would be produced in a fixed ratio with market products. Furthermore, the assumption was made that alternative production techniques were available to the firm. The important aspect of the various techniques was that the proportion of the externality generated by a market product varied by production method. Consequently, strong emphasis in the analysis was placed on determining whether or not a given policy could induce the firm to switch to a lower externality generating production method. In addition to the strictly theoretical analysis a linear irrigated farm model was described. The farm model produced irrigation return flows which were considered to be creating stream pollution. From the theoretical analysis likely policies for controlling return flows were ascertained. Some of these policies were then applied to the farm model. Specifically, a water tax (variable factor tax) and a constraint on delivered water were administered to the farm model. Based on the theoretical analysis taxing market products did not appear to be a particularly desirable policy. For some models, the market product tax actually increased externality production. A tax on externality production (effluent tax) seemed to give the most consistent effects of all policies across all models. The <b>externality</b> <b>tax</b> either reduced or had no effect on externality production. The biggest shortcoming of the <b>externality</b> <b>tax</b> appeared to be administrative. Before the tax can be used the externality must be identifiable as to source. Consequently, a search was made for policies which generated results similar to the <b>externality</b> <b>tax</b> yet were not subject to the same administrative problem. It appeared that under specific conditions a variable factor tax, a tax on specialized fixed factors or a combination of a tax-subsidy scheme could be effective alternative policies. However, these latter policies, if improperly applied could result in increased externality production. Taxes as high as 65 cents per acre inch of water were applied to the farm model. Depending on assumed conditions the water tax resulted in reduced irrigation return flows. When labor was constrained tax levels needed to be higher to reduce return flows compared to the case where labor was not constrained. Placing a restraint on delivered water also reduced return flows. Again, when labor was constrained this policy was not as effective as when labor was unconstrained. The water tax policy reduced net returns to the farm model considerably more than the constraint on delivered water. The main difference in net revenues was attributable to the total water tax bill rather than reductions from other added costs and/or enterprise changes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{countries with}} {{international and local}} truck traffic decide to switch from a simple fuel tax system to a dual system of fuel and kilometer taxes. We show what drives a country to switch and how this affects the level of fuel taxes and the incentives for the other countries to also adopt the dual system. The model is partially able to explain the gradual extension of kilometer charging for trucks in Europe. The model also shows that, {{in the absence of}} diesel cars, the gradual introduction of kilometer charges will make fuel taxation for trucks virtually disappear and will lead to a system where truck use is (1) taxed mainly based on distance, but (2) is taxed too heavily. When the fuel tax must in addition serve as an <b>externality</b> <b>tax</b> for diesel cars, the introduction of distance charges for trucks will give rise to diesel taxes that are lower than the external cost of diesel cars.

40|$|The paper uses an applied general {{equilibrium}} model, calibrated to {{the situation}} in Belgium in 1990, to evaluate the welfare effects of small policy changes in the presence of transport externalities. The model incorporates three types of externalities: congestion, which has a feedback effect on the behaviour of the economic agents, air pollution and accidents. The model is used to perform balanced budget incidence simulations in which the marginal cost of public funds is calculated for four alternative policy instruments: a lump sum tax, the labour income tax, the fuel taxes and peak road pricing. For each of these instruments the marginal cost of public funds is calculated. The results of the model are compared with those of a model in which congestion, air pollution and accidents are assumed to remain constant at their initial level. The model contributes to the literature in two ways. First of all, it includes non-identical individuals which allows to analyse the equity effects of the policy reforms. The second contribution is related {{to the way in which}} the externalities are modelled: the feedback effect of congestion is explicitly taken into account and the value of a marginal time saving is determined endogenously in the model. The simulations show that the ranking of the instruments in terms of their marginal cost of public funds changes significantly when the effect of the reform on the externalities is taken into account. Secondly, regardless of the way in which the tax revenue is recycled, the welfare gain of peak road pricing is higher than that of the fuel tax. When the <b>externality</b> <b>tax</b> revenue is recycled through the lump sum tax the welfare gains are higher for the poorer than for the richer quintiles. On the other hand, the main beneficiary of revenue recycling through the labour income tax is the richest quintile. Consequently, when the social welfare function gives a higher weight to the welfare of individuals belonging to the poorer quintiles, the distributional impacts of the policy reforms cause the welfare gain to be higher when the revenue is recycled through an increase in the lump sum transfer rather than through a lower labour income tax rate. The link is made with the double dividend literature. A weak double dividend can be realised only when all individuals are given the same welfare weight. However, the inclusion of distributional considerations offers the possibility of realising a strong double dividend for low degrees of inequality aversion.

40|$|Changing {{fuel prices}} and new energy policy {{initiatives}} have heightened {{interest in the}} appropriate level of gasoline taxation. These taxes vary dramatically across countries: Britain’s tax of 50 pence per liter (about $ 2. 80 per US gallon) is the highest among industrial countries, while the United States, where federal and state taxes average about $ 0. 40 /gal, has the lowest rate (International Energy Agency 2000). The British government has defended high gasoline taxes on three main grounds. First, by penalizing gasoline consumption, such taxes reduce {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} and local air pollutants. Second, they raise the cost of driving and therefore reduce traffic congestion and traffic-related accidents. Third, motor fuel taxes in the UK provide significant government revenue—nearly one-fourth as large as that from personal income taxes (Lucy Chennells et al. 2000) —and do so efficiently since fuel has a relatively low price elasticity. A counter-argument to the externality rationale is that a better tax for all except carbon dioxide would be on something other than fuel—an emissions tax on air pollutants, peak-period congestion fees, and for accidents a tax on miles driven, preferably one that varies across people with different risks of causing accidents. Nonetheless, ideal <b>externality</b> <b>taxes</b> have not been widely implemented: they raise objections on equity grounds, they require administrative sophistication, and there is often stiff political opposition to introducing new taxes. The fuel tax, by contrast, is administratively simple and well established in principle, even at very high rates in many nations. Therefore it is entirely appropriate to consider how externalities that are not directly priced should be taken into account in an assessment of fuel taxes. As for revenues, a well-developed public-finance literature rigorously compares the efficiency of different tax instruments for raising revenues.

The main results are the following: (i) A Pareto optimal solution for insurance coverage and road safety is characterized by full insurance and a level of prevention which takes into account externalities between drivers. (ii) Without asymmetrical information, such a Pareto optimal solution can be obtained with or without a fault system for negligence if an adequate rating system is set up in order to induce individuals to take into account <b>externalities.</b> <b>Taxes</b> and subsidies can also be efficient. Government regulation of road safety is another way to reduce inefficies due to externalities. However, these interventions will not generally lead to a socially optimal level of road safety under asymmetrical information.

It is shown that one-period liability insurance contracts (assuming that the legal system can observe the individual's level of road safety activities when accidents occur) or multi-period no-fault insurance contracts (assuming an infinite horizon with no discounting) based in part on the individual's past driving record can give individually rational self-protection activity levels which are socially efficient in presence of both moral hazard and externalities.
