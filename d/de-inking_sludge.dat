40|$|<b>De-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> is a {{waste product}} {{generated}} from secondary fibre paper mills who manufacture recycled paper into new paper sheets; it refers directly to the solid residues which evolve during the de-inking stage of the paper pulping process. The current practice for the disposal of this waste is either by land-spreading, land-filling or incineration which are unsustainable. This work has explored the intermediate pyrolysis of pre-conditioned <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> pellets in a recently patented 20 kg/h intermediate pyrolysis reactor (The Pyroformer). The reactor is essentially two co-axial screws which are configured {{in such a way}} as to circulate solids within the reactor and thus facilitate in the cracking of tars. The potential application of using the volatile organic vapours and permanent gases evolved would be to generate both combined heat and power (CHP) located at paper making sites. The results show that <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> could be successfully pyrolysed and the organic vapours produced were composed of a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds and some fatty acid methyl esters as detected by liquid GC-MS. The calorific value of the oil after condensing was between 36 and 37 MJ/kg and the liquid fuel properties were also determined, permanent gases were detected by a GC-TCD and were composed of approximately 24 % CO, 6 % CH and 70 % CO (v/v%). The solid residue from pyrolysis also contained a small residual calorific value, and was largely composed of mainly calcium based inert metal oxides. The application of applying intermediate pyrolysis to <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> for both CHP production and waste reduction is in principle a feasible technology which could be applied at secondary fibre paper mills. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the removal of Cu 2 + from water using {{adsorbent}} materials prepared from paper industry waste materials (one <b>de-inking</b> paper <b>sludge</b> and other sludge from virgin pulp mill). Experimental results showed that <b>de-inking</b> paper <b>sludge</b> leads to mesoporous materials (Vmic/VT = 0. 13 and 0. 14), whereas the sludge from virgin pulp mill produces high microporous adsorbents (Vmic/VT = 0. 39 and 0. 41). Adsorbent materials were then used for Cu 2 + removal from water at acid pH. During water treatment, heavy metals lixiviation from adsorbent materials was not produced. However, important Ca and Mg leaching was observed. Final pH significantly increases after treatment of water with adsorbent materials probably due to their elevated CaCO 3 content. In general, highest Cu 2 + removal was obtained using adsorbent materials from <b>de-inking</b> paper <b>sludge.</b> This result {{could be due to}} their higher content in oxygenated surface groups, high average pore diameter, elevated superficial charge density, high CaCO 3 amount and high Ca and Mg exchange conten...|$|R
40|$|The cement {{manufacturing}} process, {{because of}} its nature, {{is one of the}} major industries that release large amounts of greenhouse gases. It is estimated that releases between 800 - 1000 kg of CO 2 per ton of clinker into the atmosphere. One of its priorities is the search for new materials that can be used as active additions, which have a direct impact on reducing gas pollutants. Recently, the Council of Ministers of the EU has adopted a directive that will introduce more stringent limits in order to reduce industrial emissions from 2016, and also wants to improve the health of the citizens as well as environmental protection. According to their intrinsic composition, paper sludge wastes can be used in many different ways such as agriculture, ceramics or even as an alternative combustible. During the last decade, a group of researchers from different Spanish institutions (Instituto Eduardo Torroja CSIC, Tecnalia and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) have established the scientific, technical and environmental bases for the use of thermally activated paper sludges as pozzolanic additions in order to obtain ecoefficient portland cement manufacture. According to available data in Europe, its said that around 2. 5 million tons of paper <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludges</b> are produced annually. These sludges are classified as inert wastes and for this reason, in most of countries are deposited in landfills with consequent environmental and social problems.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} recycled fibers {{are used in}} paper industries due to their important environmental and economic benefits. However, removing the ink, clay, coatings and contaminants from paper waste {{in order to produce}} recycled fibers creates large amounts of <b>de-inking</b> paper <b>sludge.</b> For this reason, the preparation of biochar from pyrolysis process of this kind of waste rich in cellulose fibers, carbonates and clays, and their use in soil remediation contaminated by heavy metals can be perceived as an interesting valorization alternative. The aim of the present work is to study the influence of biochar from <b>de-inking</b> paper <b>sludge</b> (HP) pyrolysis in a Ni 2 + polluted soil. Selected soil (S) was artificially contaminated with Ni 2 + at 1000 mg Ni kg(- 1) (S 1000) and then amended at a rate of 5 wt% using HP and two biochars prepared from pyrolysis of HP at 300 degrees C (HP 300) and 500 degrees C (HP 500). Non-contaminated soil (S) was used as control and amended with the same rate of HP, HP 300 and HP 500. An incubation experiment was designed and soil CO 2 emissions were measured in the different treatments during 77 days. The results have shown that CO 2 emissions followed the order S = S + HP = S + HP 300 > S + HP 500 for the non-polluted soil and the patternS 1000 + HP 300 > S 1000 approximate to S 1000 + HP > S 1000 + HP 500 for the soil spiked with Ni.

In this study, pyrolysis oil produced from <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> through an intermediate pyrolysis technique was blended with biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil, and tested in a multi-cylinder indirect injection type CI engine. The {{physical and chemical properties}} of pyrolysis oil and its blends (20 and 30 vol. %) were measured and compared with those of fossil diesel and pure biodiesel (B 100). Full engine power was achieved with both blends, and very little difference in engine performance and emission results were observed between 20 % and 30 % blends. At full engine load, the brake specific fuel consumption on a volume basis was around 6 % higher for the blends when compared to fossil diesel. The brake thermal efficiencies were about 3 - 6 % lower than biodiesel and were similar to fossil diesel. Exhaust gas emissions of the blends contained 4 % higher CO 2 and 6 - 12 % lower NOx, as compared to fossil diesel. At full load, CO emissions of the blends were decreased by 5 - 10 times. The cylinder gas pressure diagram showed stable engine operation with the 20 % blend, but indicated minor knocking with 30 % blend. Peak cylinder pressure of the 30 % blend was about 5 - 6 % higher compared to fossil diesel. At full load, the peak burn rate of combustion from the 30 % blend was about 26 % and 12 % higher than fossil diesel and biodiesel respectively. In comparison to fossil diesel the combustion duration was decreased for both blends; for 30 % blend at full load, the duration was almost 12 % lower. The study concludes that up to 20 % blend of <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> pyrolysis oil with biodiesel can be used in an indirect injection CI engine without adding any ignition additives or surfactants...|$|E
40|$|The {{two main}} wastes {{generated}} from secondary fibre paper mills are rejects (composed mainly of plastics and fibres) and <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge,</b> {{both of which}} are evolved from the pulping process during paper manufacture. The current practice for the disposal of these wastes is either by land-spreading or land-filling. This work explores the gasification of blends of pre-conditioned rejects and <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> pellets with mixed wood chips in an Imbert type fixed bed downdraft gasifier with a maximum feeding capacity of 10 kg/h. The producer gases evolved would generate combined heat and power (CHP) in an internal combustion engine. The results show that as much as 80 wt. % of a brown paper mill's rejects (consisting of 20 wt. % mixed plastics and 80 wt. % paper fibres) could be successfully gasified in a blend with 20 wt. % mixed wood chips.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{characteristics}} of intermediate pyrolysis oils derived from sewage sludge and <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> (a paper industry residue), {{with a view to}} their use as fuels in a diesel engine. The feedstocks were dried and pelletised, then pyrolysed in the Pyroformer intermediate pyrolysis system. The organic fraction of the oils was separated from the aqueous phase and characterised. This included elemental and compositional analysis, heating value, cetane index, density, viscosity, surface tension, flash point, total acid number, lubricity, copper corrosion, water, carbon residue and ash content. Most of these results are compared with commercial diesel and biodiesel. Both pyrolysis oils have high carbon and hydrogen contents and their higher heating values compare well with biodiesel. The water content of the pyrolysis oils is reasonable and the flash point is found to be high. Both pyrolysis oils have good lubricity, but show some corrosiveness. Cetane index is reduced, which may influence ignition. Also viscosity is increased, which may influence atomisation quality. Carbon residue and ash content are both high, indicating potential deposition problems. Compared with <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> pyrolysis oil (DSPO), sewage sludge pyrolysis oil (SSPO) has a higher heating value, but higher corrosiveness and viscosity. The conclusions are that both intermediate pyrolysis oils will be able to provide sufficient heat when used in diesel engine; however poor combustion and carbon deposition may be encountered. Blending of these pyrolysis oils with diesel or biodiesel could overcome these problems and is recommended for further investigation...|$|E
50|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{has found}} that {{recycling}} causes 35% less water pollution and 74% less air pollution than making virgin paper. Pulp mills can be sources of both air and water pollution, {{especially if they are}} producing bleached pulp. Modern mills produce considerably less pollution than those of a few decades ago. Recycling paper decreases the demand for virgin pulp, thus reducing the overall amount of air and water pollution associated with paper manufacture. Recycled pulp can be bleached with the same chemicals used to bleach virgin pulp, but hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydrosulfite are the most common bleaching agents. Recycled pulp, or paper made from it, is known as PCF (process chlorine free) if no chlorine-containing compounds were used in the recycling process. However, recycling mills may have polluting by-products like <b>sludge.</b> <b>De-inking</b> at Cross Pointe's Miami, Ohio mill results in sludge weighing 22% of the weight of wastepaper recycled.|$|R
40|$|The {{de-inking}} process {{produces a}} waste by-product, called <b>de-inking</b> paper <b>sludge</b> (DS), that contains paper fibers, clay particles and inks and high carbon (C) concentrations combined with low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. The use of {{high rates of}} DS to increase the soil organic matter thus requires provision of high rates of N and P for adequate plant growth. Using dinitrogen (N 2) -fixing forage legumes is an alternative to N fertilization under such circumstances. In a greenhouse study, DS rates of 0, 50 or 100 Mg ha - 1 and five rates of P (40, 80, 120, 160, or 200 kg P 2 O 5 ha - 1) were applied on two soil types, a clay loam (Pintendre) and a silty clay loam (St-Augustin). Nitrogen uptake and symbiotic N 2 fixation (SNF) were estimated in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.); Bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.) and alfalfa ineffective for N 2 fixation were used as the reference (non-N 2 fixing) crops. Atmospheric N 2 fixation was estimated by natural abundance of 15 N (δ 15 N). Under controlled conditions, high rates of DS substantially reduced δ 15 N values, particularly with high rates of P.

40|$|<b>De-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> {{generated}} from {{pulp and paper}} industry is considered hazardous since it may contain heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, and Pb. Hence, the <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> needs to be treated before being disposed of. Sludge combustion is a proven disposal technology, which generates fly ash containing a portion of the heavy metals that may leach out under uncontrolled conditions. The aim of this thesis is to implement a new multi-zone temperature combustion technique (Low-High-Low temperature combustion, LHL) to help contain and immobilize the heavy metals within fly ash particles. During the LHL, the waste will be initially fed into a low-temperature zone (< 1100 K) and then subjected to the high-temperature treatment (~ 1480 K) that will be followed by another low-temperature zone (~ 1100 K). This dissertation describes the detailed design and construction of a novel pilot-scale combustion facility, called the Multi-Mode Combustion Facility (MCF), used as a multidisciplinary research tool for investigating the thermal remediation of contaminated solid residues. The MCF is capable of operating in two different modes: Fluidized-Bed combustion mode (FBC) and Single burner furnace mode (SBF). However, this project focuses on the FBC mode (minimum fluidization velocity of 0. 42 m/s and bed temperature of 1073 K). This research compares the combustion characteristics of <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> obtained in the LHL and in the conventional combustion techniques. The following properties of particulates were studied: morphological evolution of solid particles, structural porosity, metals interactions with fly ash particles, and leachability. The LHL's final supermicron spherical fly ash went through a molten phase with submicron particles attached to the fly ash particles surfaces. Thus, reducing its porosity to 19 %. However, the amorphous final fly ash obtained in the conventional technique reveals 32 % porosity. It was found that the physical characteristics of the final LHL's fly ash are the main cause for the reduced heavy metals leachability rates of 0. 18, 0. 046, and 0. 92 % for Cd, Cr, and Pb, respectively. The conventional technique had 53. 28, 16. 79, and 5. 20 % of Cd, Cr, and Pb respectively, leaching out due to the high porosity percentages. In conclusion, the LHL technique allows for controlling the heavy metals emission from FBCs, while using a waste to energy approach and maintaining environmentally acceptable gas emission levels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} {{on the presence of}} heavy metals in contaminated wastes is reviewed. Various categories of materials produced from domestic and industrial activities are included, but municipal solid waste, which is a more complex material, is excluded. This review considers among the most abundant the following materials - wood waste including demolition wood, phytoremediation scavengers and chromated copper arsenate (CCA) timber, sludges including <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> and sewage sludge, chicken litter and spent pot liner. The partitioning of the metals in the ashes after combustion or gasification follows conventional behaviour, with most metals retained, and higher concentrations in the finer sizes due to vaporisation and recondensation. The alkali metals have been shown to catalyse the biomass conversion, particularly lithium and potassium, although other metals are active to a lesser extent. The most prevalent in biomass is potassium, which is not only inherently active, but volatilises to become finely distributed throughout the char mass. Because the metals are predominantly found in the ash, the effectiveness of their removal depends on the efficiency of the collection of particulates. The potential for disposal into soil depends on the initial concentration in the feed material...|$|E

Numerous potential strategies for hair utilisation have been proposed. However, the use of hair waste as agricultural fertiliser is one of its most promising applications due to the high nitrogen content of hair. Agricultural value of hair can be increased by composting. This paper deals with the composting of hair from the unhairing of bovine hide. Results indicated that hair cannot be either composted on its own or co-composted with <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge,</b> a chemical complementary co-substrate. However, good results were obtained when co-composted with raw sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant at hair:raw sludge weight ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and, 1 : 4 in lab scale and pilot plant scale composters.

Composting in the pilot plant composter was effectively monitored using Static Respiration Indices determined at process temperature at sampling (SRI(T)) and at 37 degrees C (SRI(37)).

40|$|If left to {{conventional}} treatment processes, {{the destruction of}} toxic organic wastewaters and associated sludge volume reduction clearly becomes an overwhelming problem. Two options, incineration and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO), exist for the complete destruction of toxic wastewaters and organic sludges. Incineration has associated problems such as very high cost and public resentment; {{on the other hand}} SCWO {{has proved to be a}} very promising method for the treatment of many different wastewaters and sludges. In early 1998 Chematur Engineering inaugurated its 250 kg/h SCWO demonstration facility and since then several successful treatability tests have been performed. Among these are tests with different complex wastes, from a SCWO process point of view. They have been performed in two different ways: 1. Making the waste treatable in an “ordinary ” SCWO unit, i. e. remove halogens and dissolved salts. 2. Making the SCWO unit able to handle the difficulties in the waste, e. g. halogens. Another waste, <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge,</b> has been treated several times. The appealing results from these tests are that, besides the complete destruction of the organic material, the remaining paper filler has shown to be good enough for reuse. This exemplifies the general possibility to destroy the organic material in the waste by SCWO and leave a “clean ” valuable inorganic material in the effluent, which could easily be recovered. The extremely clean inorganic material recovered ought to increase the interest in SCWO treatment. This type of waste may very well be the breakthrough of SCWO...|$|E
40|$|Combustion of an {{increasing}} amount of biofuel and waste woods {{has resulted in}} certain environmental advantages, including decreased emissions of fossil CO 2, SO 2 and metals. On the other hand, a number of chloride and alkali related operational problems have occurred which are related to combustion of these fuels. Alkali related operational problems have been studied in a project consisting of two parts. The overall scope has been to characterise the operational problems and to study measures to minimise them. The first part was reported in Värmeforsk report 997 where the results were summarised in a table of different measures. In part two, additional measures {{have been included in}} the test plan and initial corrosion has been studied linked to the different measures. The tests have also in part two been carried out at the 12 MW CFB boiler at Chalmers. The effect of the selected measures has been investigated concerning both deposit formation and bed agglomeration, {{and at the same time}} emissions and other operational conditions were characterised. The second part of the project has among other things focused on: • To investigate measures which decrease the content of alkali and chloride in the deposits, and consequently decrease the risk for corrosion (by investigating the initial corrosion). Focus was also on trying to explain favourable effects. • To investigate if it is possible to combine a rather low dosage of kaolin and injection of ammonium sulphate. This was done in order to reduce both bed agglomeration and problems from deposits during combustion of fuels rich in chlorine. • To investigate if co-combustion with sewage sludge, <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> or peat with high ash content, could give similar advantages as conventional additives. • Investigate if ash from PFBC is possible to use as an alternative bed material. By comparing the different measures in part two, it could be concluded that cocombustion of sewage sludge gave the best overall effect. The judgement was based on the effects concerning bed agglomeration, level of alkali chloride in the flue gas, deposits and initial corrosion. Simultaneous addition of kaolin and ammonia sulphate also had a favourable impact both in the bed and on the alkali chlorides in the gas phase. Dosage of kaolin did not reduce the effect of injected ammonium sulphate. Cocombustion of peat could also be a very attractive alternative, but it is critical to select a suitable peat type. It is of special concern to avoid peat with a high content of calcium, since it can increase the level of alkali chlorides by reacting with available sulphur. Change of bed material to ash from PFBC can decrease problems with bed agglomeration, but there is a risk of increased deposit formation and corrosion. A boiler operated with high steam data should consequently combine the change of bed material with injection of ammonium sulphate or another source of sulphur. Co-combustion of <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> from pulp and paper production can reduce problems with bed agglomeration. There is, however, an increased chance of corrosion due to the high content of calcium. Injection of sulphates may improve the situation concerning corrosion. The results also showed that low potassium chlorine content in the flue gas decreases the risk of corrosion. Increased amount of potassium chlorine content in the flue gas will not necessary give a high amount of chlorine content in the deposits if there is sulphur in the system.

The pyrolysis oils were produced in a pilot-scale (20 kg/h) intermediate pyrolysis system. Comprehensive characterisations, with a view to use as engine fuels, were carried out on the sewage sludge and <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> derived pyrolysis oils. They were both found to be able to provide sufficient heat for fuelling a diesel engine. The pyrolysis oils also presented poor combustibility and high carbon deposition, but these problems could be mitigated by means of blending the pyrolysis oils with biodiesel (derived from waste cooking oil). The blends of SSPO (sewage sludge pyrolysis oil) and biodiesel (30 / 70 and 50 / 50 in volumetric ratios) were tested in a 15 kWe Lister type stationary generating system for up to 10 hours. There was no apparent deterioration observed in engine operation. With 30 % SSPO blended into biodiesel, the engine presents better overall performance (electric efficiency), fuel consumption, and overall exhaust emissions than with 50 % SSPO blend. An overall system analysis was carried out on a proposed integrated Pyroformer-CHP system. Combined with real experimental results, this was used for evaluating the costs for producing heat and power and char from wood pellets and sewage sludge. It is concluded that the overall system efficiencies for both types of plant can be over 40 %; however the integrated CHP system is not economically viable. This is due to extraordinary project capital investment required...|$|E

Leading this approach is the atmospheric fluidized-bed combustor (AFBC). It has demonstrated its commercial acceptance in the utility market as a reliable source of power by burning a variety of waste and alternative fuels. The application of pressurized fluidized-bed combustor (PFBC) technology, although relatively new, can provide significant enhancements to the efficient production of electricity while maintaining the waste management benefits of AFBC. A study was undertaken to investigate the technical and economical feasibility of co-firing a PFBC with coal and municipal and industrial wastes.

40|$|<b>De-inking</b> <b>sludge</b> and its {{contaminants}} {{were studied}} in supercritical water (SCW), where temperature and pressure are above water's critical point of 374 ºC & 22. 1 MPa. Phase behavior of pure organics in the sludge were studied with a diamond anvil cell (DAC) technique, and optical & FT-IR microscopes. Oxidation experiments in SCW were performed in batch and flow reactors for the complex sludge and pure decachlorobiphenyl (10 -CB). From the visual observations in the DAC, homogeneous phases with water {{were found for}} cellulose at 329 ºC; for naphthalene (NT) at 383 ºC; for benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) at 508 ºC and for polystyrene (PS) at 570 ºC. Adding O 2 shifted {{the formation of the}} single phase to lower temperature. Complete dissolution of 10 -CB occurred only when excess O 2 was present (at 548 ºC with 225 % excess O 2 or at 450 ºC for 596 s with 93 % excess O 2). Adding Na 2 CO 3 significantly enhanced dissolution rate of 10 -CB, for example, using 2. 5 -mol% Na 2 CO 3, complete dissolution was achieved at 434 ºC even with low O 2 concentration (69. 5 % theoretical O 2). The homogeneous conditions are important for the oxidation study of the sludge in batch reactors. Oxidation experiments of heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cd) -, NT and BaP-contaminated sludge in SCW were conducted. It was found that all organics in the sludge, including stable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons could be almost completely oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O. The water-soluble heavy metal salts were effectively removed by precipitation to insoluble oxides and salts with little leachability. During the oxidation of 10 -CB at 225 % excess O 2, only 99. 2 % destruction rate was obtained accompanied by severe corrosion of the reactor. However, using 100 % theoretical Na 2 CO 3, all 10 -CB was destroyed at 159. 5 % excess O 2 with little corrosion. 10 -CB was also successfully destroyed in a flow reactor. Oxidation pathways of the major components of the sludge and a sequence of corrosion reactions were proposed. It can be concluded that the SCW oxidation process is an effective technique for the destruction of organic wastes including very stable hazardous compounds (e. g., BaP & 10 -CB) due to the homogeneous conditions of chemical reactions and removal of heavy metals...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{deterioration}} of the global environment forces people to increasingly take into consideration. Nowadays, concrete is the most extensively-used construction material in the world. Cement, the dominant material for manufacturing concrete, has been largely {{used in the past}} few decades. It has also been generally considered as an environmentally hazardous material, mainly due to CO 2 emissions during the production process. Thus, many industrial by-products have been used to partially substitute cement in order to generate more economic and durable concrete. Among these by-products, fly ash generated during combustion of coal has been successfully used in concrete for many years. Unlike traditional fly ash, a new type of ash may also be used. It is obtained by combustion of <b>de-inking</b> <b>sludge,</b> bark and residues of woods in a fluidized-bed system from Brompton Mill located near Sherbrooke, Canada. However, the properties and the applications of this new by-product are not well known. An investigation was carried out to characterize this new material and examine its performance as an alternative material in the production of concrete. Firstly, the chemical, physical, mineralogical, and morphological characteristics of WSA were analyzed and were compared with traditional ash. In addition, the rheological properties of pastes and mortars mixed with WSA were evaluated by tests such as the calorimeter, mini-slump, marsh cone, and compressive strength of mortar cubes. In addition, the optimum ratio of cement replaced by WSA was examined by the compressive strength of concrete at the age of 1, 7, 28 and 91 days. Herein, two different water-to-binder ratios are considered: 0. 4 and 0. 55. Finally, the comprehensive properties of WSA concrete applying to the optimum ratio was carried out in different aspects such as fresh, mechanical properties, volume-change, and durability. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use WSA as a new cementitious material in concrete. According to the experimental results, a high-range water-reducing agent was required, even at a higher water-to-binder ratio (WSA showed a high degree of water demand). It study also revealed that WSA concrete had low permeability, and resisted freezing and thawing compared to the control mixture. In addition, the high CaO content in WSA substantially increased the expansion of concrete, early in the process. This greatly compensated the autogenous shrinkage that was developed in concrete with a low water-to-binder ratio. However, WSA is not recommended for use in environments containing a high quantity of sulphate, because its higher lime phase may cause the damage to constructions...|$|E
