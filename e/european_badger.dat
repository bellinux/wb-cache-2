5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, <b>European</b> <b>badger,</b> and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
25|$|Rila Monastery Nature Park is {{inhabited}} by 202 vertebrate species. There are 52 species of mammals.

Of them the European snow vole is a relict. The large mammals include 13 Carnivora and 4 Artiodactyla species. The most typical mammals in the park are the grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, brown bear, <b>European</b> <b>badger,</b> European polecat, European otter, European pine marten, beech marten, wildcat, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois.|$|E

50|$|Asian badgers {{are mostly}} lighter in colour than <b>European</b> <b>badgers,</b> though some forms may closely {{approach}} the former species in colour, if not darker, with smudges of ocherous and brownish highlights. The flanks are {{lighter than the}} middle of the back, and the facial stripes are usually brown rather than black. Unlike the facial stripes of <b>European</b> <b>badgers,</b> those of Asian badgers narrow behind their eyes and extend above the ears. The white parts of the head are usually dirtier in colour than those of <b>European</b> <b>badgers.</b> The light stripe passing {{along the top of the}} head between the two stripes is relatively short and narrow.

2500|$|The Netherlands {{has over}} 66 {{wildlife}} crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) {{that have been}} used to protect the endangered <b>European</b> <b>badger,</b> as well as populations of wild boar, red deer, and roe deer.

[...] The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the A50 when the highway was constructed.

2500|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), <b>European</b> <b>badger</b> (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.|$|E

Although clinical cases are rare in people, they are serious and {{very difficult to}} treat. Severe disease has also been reported in other mammals and birds in zoos, {{as well as in}} poultry, pet birds, dogs and wild animals.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the epidemiology of Trypanosoma pestanai infection in <b>European</b> <b>badgers</b> (Meles meles) from Wytham Woods (Oxfordshire, UK) to determine prevalence rates {{and to identify}} the arthropod vector responsible for transmission. A total of 245 badger blood samples was collected during September and November 2009 and examined by PCR using primers derived from the 18 S rRNA of T. pestanai. The parasite was detected in blood from 31 % of individuals tested. T. pestanai was isolated from primary cultures of Wytham badger {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and propagated continually in vitro. This population was compared with cultures of two geographically distinct isolates of the parasite by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and PCR analysis of 18 S rDNA and ITS 1 sequences. High levels of genotypic polymorphism were observed between the isolates. PCR analysis of badger fleas (Paraceras melis) collected from infected individuals at Wytham indicated the presence of T. pestanai and this was confirmed by examination of dissected specimens. Wet smears and Giemsa-stained preparations from dissected fleas revealed large numbers of trypanosome-like forms in the hindgut, some of which were undergoing binary fission.
