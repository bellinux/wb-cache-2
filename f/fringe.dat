30|$|By {{analyzing}} of the simulation, we {{can also}} find that when the projector is slightly defocused (Gaussian filter size is 5 [*]×[*] 5), the phase-based optimization has the lowest phase RMS error while with the Gaussian filter size increasing, the quality of phase optimized <b>fringes</b> decreases due to the sensitivity to the filter size. The phase error of the intensity-based optimization <b>fringes</b> and the proposed <b>fringes</b> decrease sharply as filter size increases, and they outperform the phase optimized <b>fringes.</b> Because the proposed method focuses on the local structure similarity, the proposed <b>fringes</b> have the same tendency with the intensity optimization <b>fringes</b> and it outperforms the intensity-based optimization <b>fringes</b> on phase quality with all filter sizes.|$|R

5|$|After {{being told}} {{by a panel of}} Senators that <b>Fringe</b> Division is not worth the human or fiscal cost, Broyles is given the {{transformation}} device by Peter so Broyles can justify <b>Fringe</b> Division remaining active. In a separate scene, Agent Jessup is shown working at a computer, annotating an image of the creature from The Transformation with biblical verses, notably from the Book of Revelation. The final scene reveals that Charlie is actually the shapeshifter, who disposes of the real agent's body in a furnace beneath the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has <b>Fringe</b> Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, <b>Fringe</b> Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes {{this to be the}} only way to force the <b>Fringe</b> team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while <b>Fringe</b> agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew the next day and confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should she ever need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E

40|$|Effect {{of surface}} {{structures}} upon ultrathin film interference <b>fringes</b> generated from extremely thin films or epitaxial layers grown on semiconductor wafers has been studied. Since dark regions of <b>fringes</b> {{correspond to the}} places where the thin films are destroyed or absent, the <b>fringes</b> are investigated to detect uneven surfaces with undesired structures.

30|$|We can note {{first for}} the series (a) {{the absence of the}} <b>fringes</b> for SLB since the {{constraint}} is weak {{at the beginning of the}} test. The <b>fringes</b> in ILB are related to a rigid body displacement.It is a first pitfall to avoid, the presence of <b>fringes</b> on the supports is useful to detect this problem. For series (b), more <b>fringes</b> were observed for both specimens. This means that the increment of deformation is higher for series (b) than for the series (a). For both series, the presence of noise between the <b>fringes</b> is observed for ILB, the experimental conditions are less good than for the SLB beam. A filtering of the <b>fringes</b> is therefore necessary.|$|R

5|$|<b>Fringe</b> is an American {{science fiction}} {{television}} series created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci. It premiered on the Fox network on September 9, 2008, and concluded on January 18, 2013, after five seasons and 100 episodes. The series follows Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), {{all members of}} the fictional <b>Fringe</b> Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, based in Boston, Massachusetts, under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses <b>fringe</b> science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe.|$|E

50|$|An optical flat {{is usually}} placed upon {{a flat surface}} to be tested. If the surface is clean and {{reflective}} enough, rainbow colored bands of interference <b>fringes</b> will form when the test piece is illuminated with white light. However, if a monochromatic light is used to illuminate the work piece, such as helium, low-pressure sodium, or a laser, then a series of dark and light interference <b>fringes</b> will form. These interference <b>fringes</b> determine the flatness of the work piece, relative to the optical flat, to within {{a fraction of the}} wavelength of the light. If both surfaces are perfectly the same flatness and parallel to each other, no interference <b>fringes</b> will form. However, there is usually some air trapped between the surfaces. If the surfaces are flat, but a tiny optical wedge of air exists between them, then straight, parallel interference <b>fringes</b> will form, indicating the angle of the wedge (i.e.: more, thinner <b>fringes</b> indicate a steeper wedge while fewer but wider <b>fringes</b> indicate less of a wedge). The shape of the <b>fringes</b> also indicate the shape of the test surface, because <b>fringes</b> with a bend, a contour, or rings indicate high and low points on the surface, such as rounded edges, hills or valleys, or convex and concave surfaces.|$|R

5|$|Hardee {{regularly}} {{appeared in}} his own shows at the Edinburgh <b>Fringe.</b> The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982. Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – {{a series of three}} adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian's neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and, entirely naked, drove it across Bogosian's stage during his performance. Rivalling this stunt in <b>Fringe</b> infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own <b>Fringe</b> show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper's comedy critic. At the <b>Fringe</b> in 1996, The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman's Edinburgh show by abducting the act's hi-tech dummy, holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.|$|E

3000|$|Although we {{perfectly}} co-registered {{the master}} and slave SLCs and subtracted the orbital <b>fringes,</b> some <b>fringes</b> {{remain in the}} ScanSAR interferogram. Typically, ionospheric and atmospheric <b>fringes</b> are visible. A ScanSAR InSAR covers approximately 350 × 350 km, and the ionospheric effects appear at a scale of 10 km or more, while the atmospheric effects appear in a smaller scale.

50|$|Natatory <b>fringes</b> are rows of stiff hairs {{that occur}} along {{the margins of}} the hindfeet in some rodents. They occur along the plantar margins and in some cases also between the toes. Among sigmodontines, a mostly South American groups, natatory <b>fringes</b> are present in Ichthyomyini and some Oryzomyini. Among ichthyomyines, the <b>fringes</b> are poorly {{developed}} in Neusticomys but well-developed in other genera, and in Rheomys mexicanus the hairs of the <b>fringes</b> may exceed 3 mm in length. Amphinectomys, Holochilus, Lundomys, and Nectomys are the only oryzomyines with natatory <b>fringes,</b> but have them only weakly developed; one study also records them in Oryzomys. In oryzomyines, the <b>fringes</b> are an adaptation for a semiaquatic lifestyle that appeared convergently in the Holochilus-Lundomys and Nectomys-Amphinectomys lineages. The term was introduced in 1993 by Voss and Carleton in describing Lundomys.|$|R
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is the}} retrieval of the differential phase by using Moiré <b>fringes.</b> These are created as a superposition of the self-image of G1 and the pattern of G2 by using gratings with the same periodicity and inclining G2 against G1 regarding to the optical axis with a very small angle(<<1). This moiré <b>fringes</b> act as carrier <b>fringes</b> {{because they have a}} much larger spacing/period (smaller spatial frequency) than the Talbot <b>fringes</b> and thus the phase gradient introduced by the sample can be detected as the displacement of the Moiré <b>fringes.</b> [...] With a Fourier analysis of the Moiré pattern the absorption and dark-field signal can also be extracted.|$|R
