However, it is very irritating to tissue and IM administration has been associated with myonecrosis in horses, so IV administration is preferred.|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the powder properties of the <b>granule</b> <b>feed</b> material for ferrite material production is very important. The fundamental properties of a powder are the packing characteristics and the flowability of the particle bed. In this study, we investigated {{the influence of the}} granule size distributions on the void fraction and the angle of repose of the granule particle bed. We found that the size distributions, which had the minimum values of the void fraction and the angle of repose. The compression test of the ferrite granule particle bed was conducted by using a pellet test machine with the peculiar plunger and vessel. Our results confirmed the correlations between the powder properties and its compression characteristics in the granule particle bed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Flounder (Platichthys flesus), {{which is}} a {{suitable}} fish species for aquaculture, has market value in Turkey. However, its larval feeding characteristics at breeding stage need to be identified. This study aims to establish preferences of flounder among different feed options and their consumption amounts based on number of feeding and feeding times. In the present study, chironomid and mosquito larvae utilized as food sources in the nature by fish and commercially produced <b>granule</b> <b>feed</b> {{were given to the}} flounder singly and as a mixture. While the fish consumed all the food sources, chironomid larvae and mosquito larvae were notably preferred and in mixed feeding, chironomid larvae consumption increased whereas mosquito larvae consumption decreased. In conclusion, food preference of flounder was determined to comprise the living organisms fitting in its feeding behavior and habitat, therefore, they notably preferred chironomid larvae, which shows the feature of motility on the ground...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Artemia is {{commonly}} used in larvi-culture of the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Though the imported artemia is quite expensive, most of the farmers have used it in larval prawn-feeding regimen. In {{order to reduce the}} imported artemia, <b>feed</b> <b>granules</b> of the larval prawn were developed by using wet granulation method. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare physical properties of the developed granules prepared from three kinds of cellulose binders (ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). From the results, mean granule size, moisture content, density and flow rate of the granules using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were significantly different from other binders. Hydro-stability and floatability of the ethylcellulose granules was significantly different from the others (p< 0. 05). From this study, it may be conclude that the <b>feed</b> <b>granules</b> could be prepared by wet granulation method. Ethylcellulose could be the suitable binder in preparation of the prawn <b>feed</b> <b>granule...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of my work is devoted to review of {{alternative}} components in feeds for fish with special focus on insect. The second part of my work {{is based on the}} feeding experiment. Rainbow trouts (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were bred in the aquaria at the Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Water JU in Vodňany. Experiment was performed in three replications, in 300 litre aquaria with 8 - 10 fish per aquarium. Fish were divided into 5 groups according to the type of feed used. Control group was fed the commercial <b>granule</b> <b>feed</b> and the other four groups were served insect in certain percentage. It was a cricket (Acheta domesticus) and the maggots of giant mealworm beetle (Zophobas morio). Weight and length of fish was registered three times during 2 months of experiment. The sensory analysis of fish meat was done for evaluation of aroma, taste, after taste and consistence of fish muscle. The results show that diet containing insect did not significantly influence weight and growth. In the contrast, sensory analysis proved the difference in analysed parameters. The feed containing only insect was identified as an inappropriate alternative feed. In conclusion, the insect can be used as the alternative feed for fish in the aquaculture. Nevertheless, it is recommended to combine the insect with commercial feeds...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{injection}} molding {{is probably the}} most important method of Processing of consumer and industrial goods, and is performed everywhere in the world. The developing of {{injection molding}} becomes a competition from day to day. This Process now integrated with computer control make the production better in quality and Better quantity. The trends of producing a plastics product in injection molding industries are recently changing from traditional method to using the FEA analysis. For injection molding industries, time and cost is very important aspects to consider because these two aspects will directly related to the profits at a company. The next issue to consider, to get the best parameter for the injection molding process, plastics has been waste. Through the experiment, operator will use large amount of plastics material to get the possibly parameters to setup the machine. To produce the parts with better quality and quantity these molding defects are the major obstacles in achieving the targets with quality & quantity. Various defects like Short shot, colour streaks and low productivity rates are associated with the material mixing and feeding as molded plastics are often a blend of two or more materials. Colors (master batch) and other additives are often mixed (blended) with the raw plastic material prior to the molding process in molding plants. So it is very necessary to work out auto blending and auto <b>feeding</b> of plastic <b>granules</b> to the machine hopper. This paper will cover the study of automatic blending unit & central conveying system for plastic <b>granule</b> <b>feeding</b> to machine & will help in optimizing the injection molding process...|$|R

40|$|Macrogyrodactylus polypteri, a skin {{parasite}} of the African {{freshwater fish}} Polypterus senegalus, has a black pigmented gut. Unusually, the gut is striped; 4 pigmented transverse bands become apparent within 2 h {{of birth and}} intensify in colour as the parasite ages. Ultrastructurally, the gut is a syncytium, {{similar to that of}} other gyrodactylids. Within the pigmented bands, electron-dense ovoid (1. 0 μm × 0. 25 μm) <b>granules</b> accumulate in <b>feeding</b> vacuoles in the gut syncytium, and the same granules are abundant in the gut lumen. These granules have the histochemical characteristics of melanosomes, and were also found in the epidermis of the host fish. It is concluded, therefore, that the black coloration is due to melanin derived from host epithelial cells in the diet, and that this parasite, in common with most other monopisthocotylean monogeneans, is an epithelial browser. The function of the gut banding is unknown, but may create a disruptive colour pattern, more difficult to see against the pigmented scales of the host than a uniformly dark gut...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of animal tissues in various commodities. The attention was paid to foodstuffs and <b>feeding</b> <b>granule</b> containing animal tissues. The methods of DNA analysis were introduced and tested and animal species were identified in various commodities. The tests of the whole genomic DNA both chromosomal and mitochondrial were used. The PCR and PCR-RFLP methods were found to be suitable for species identification. At the beginning non-cooked raw materials were analysed. It is possible to analyse the DNA of one animal species alone or in the mixture with other DNAs. The obtained results were utilised on articles which were produced under heat treatment in the temperature range from 70 C to 200 C. These methods enable the analysis of any foodstuff. The DNA analysis can be used for the sex determination of beef, too. The work makes an effort to give an possibilities overview of using some molecular biology methods in the field of modern food control.

40|$|Oligonucleotide probes, {{designed}} from genes coding for 16 S rRNA, {{were developed}} to differentiate Methanosaeta concilii, Methanosarcina barkeri, and mesophilic methanogens. All M. concilii oligonucleotide probes (designated MS 1, MS 2, and MS 5) hybridized specifically with the target DNA, but MS 5 was the most specific M. concilii oligonucleotide probe. Methanosarcina barkeri oligonucleotide probes (designated MB 1, MB 3, and MB 4) hybridized with different Methanosarcina species. The MB 4 probe specifically detected Methanosarcina barkeri, and the MB 3 probe detected the presence of all mesophilic Methanosarcina species. These new oligonucleotide probes facilitated the identification, localization, and quantification of the specific relative abundance of M. concilii and Methanosarcina barkeri, which play important roles in methanogenesis. The combined use of fluorescent in situ hybridization with confocal scanning laser microscopy demonstrated that anaerobic granule topography depends on <b>granule</b> origin and <b>feeding.</b> Protein-fed <b>granules</b> showed no layered structure with a random distribution of M. concilii. In contrast, a layered structure developed in methanol-enriched granules, where M. barkeri growth was induced in an outer layer. This outer layer {{was followed by a}} layer composed of M. concilii, with an inner core of M. concilii and other bacteria...|$|R
