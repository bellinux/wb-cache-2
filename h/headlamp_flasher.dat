50|$|The car {{tested by}} The Times also had white leather {{upholstery}} and deep lambswool carpets, tachometer, ammeter, oil gauge, clock, <b>headlamp</b> <b>flasher</b> (vital) and water temperature gauge. Further extras were: a laminated wood steering wheel to maintain firm grip (by soaking up sweat), automatic red caution lights on open doors, a reading light, cigar lighter, twin-speaker radio and {{an air blower}} to demist the rear window.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{architecture}} of the Silver Cloud II did not change between 1959 and 1963, but there were numerous minor changes implemented, notable among them a succession of improvements to the ventilation system. [...] Interior changes in 1961 included the adoption of blue instrument lighting, {{the introduction of a}} combined indicator / <b>headlamp</b> <b>flasher</b> switch and of a handbrake warning light. A remodelled rear light assembly was introduced in May 1962 and a change to single sealed-beam headlamps was made in August 1962.|$|E
5000|$|The Series IIA Lightweight was {{replaced}} by the Series III Lightweight in 1972, soon after the replacement of the civilian Series IIA with the Series III. The vehicle remained in essence the same, with a few relatively minor changes - there are detail differences to the chassis; and a revised gearbox had syncromesh on second through fourth gears instead of just third and fourth. In the electrical department the Series III was fitted with an alternator in place of the dynamo of the Series IIa; the new indicator switch incorporates a <b>headlamp</b> <b>flasher</b> and horn; and the ignition switch was now fitted in a new steering column cowl instead of on the dashboard. The Lightweight did retain the earlier Series IIa metal dashboard even after the upgrade. Around 1980, in line with civilian models, the engine had five main bearings instead of three.|$|E

Controls for wipers, washers, horn, indicators, <b>headlamps</b> and <b>flashers</b> were mounted ergonomically on a cylindrical unit with HVAC controls using laterally arcing sliders were located oppositely on a flat control pod [...] - [...] all within finger-tip reach. In 1979 Popular Science described the system as using a [...] "finger-tip control drum." ...|$|R
50|$|In September 1955, at {{the same}} as the Taunus 12M {{received}} its update, Ford also introduced a Taunus 15M de luxe. This top-line model was identified by a particularly elaborate front grill and a two-tone paint scheme. Various luxury features hitherto unavailable or else offered only as optional extras were included in the price for buyers of the Ford Taunus 15M de Luxe. These included items such as the windscreen washer, reversing lights, tubeless tires, vanity mirrors in the sun visors and a <b>headlamp</b> <b>flasher.</b> Many of these will have been regarded as relatively mainstream in North American cars, which will have added trans-Atlantic glamour to the Taunus 15M in a country where, especially in the south of Germany, the continuing presence of large numbers of US troops enabled Fordâ€™s customers to be far more up to date than most other Europeans with trends in the US auto market.|$|E
