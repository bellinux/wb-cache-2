40|$|ABSTRACT In this article, {{we discuss}} an {{appropriate}} methodology for assessing complex urban {{programs such as}} the WHO European <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Network.</b> The basic tenets and parameters for this project are reviewed, and situated in the broader urban health tradition. This leads to a delineation of the types of questions researchers can address when looking at a complex urban health program. Such questions reach appropriately beyond traditional public health concepts involving proximal and distal determinants of health (and associated upstream, midstream, and downstream rhetoric). Espousing a multi-level, reciprocal pathways perspective on Healthy Cities research, we also adopt a distinction between impacts and outcomes of Healthy Cities. The former are value-driven, the latter intervention-driven. These approaches lead to the acknowledgment of a logic of method that includes situational and contextual appreciation of unique Healthy City experiences in a Realist Evaluation paradigm. The article concludes with a reflection of evaluation and assessment procedures applied to Phase IV (2003 - 2008) of the WHO European <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Network</b> and an interpretation of response rates to the range of methods that have been adopted...|$|E

Urban planning provides consistency for major infrastructure and land development and social health planning {{is an important factor in}} this process. A 'seven step' planning model provides the framework for <b>healthy</b> <b>city</b> needs-based planning in Qld. Organisational capacity has been built in networking and support, political and community advocacy, agency communication, health profiling, gap analysis, action planning and monitoring and evaluation. A 'Platform Approach' for partnership development has been constructed. This model advocates for government and non-government agencies and community members to form a network and engage in the business of sustainable strategic health planning on a common platform.

40|$|<b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> is now {{a global}} {{movement}} with programs running in all continents and regions both in developed and in developing countries, including Indonesia. Long before the formal <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> concept was known in Indonesia, the Indonesian government through the State Ministry of Environment introduced the Adipura program. Officially, this program does not correlate with <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> but the aims of both movements are quite similar, particularly in the aspects of green and clean cities. An examination of the two programs, Adipura and <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> in Indonesia {{is the focus of}} a recent publication. Based on a literature review, and in-depth interviews, this chapter explores and examines the evolution of the implementation of <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> in Indonesia. As Indonesia has been implementing <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> at a local level, this chapter provides the policy overview to understand policies of <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> in Indonesia and the program implementation at the local level. This study found that historically the Indonesian government has developed the Adipura program - a hygiene city or a clean and green city, long before the WHO introduced the concept of <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities.</b> Some elements of the Adipura program are similar to the <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities.</b> Indonesia started to develop pilot projects in the name of <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> in late 1998 when the WHO set the theme of the World Health Day in 1996 which was ???<b>Healthy</b> <b>cities</b> for better life???.

40|$|The Healthy Cities {{programme}} {{was created}} in 1986 by the European Bureau of the World Health Organization, which defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. This wide defintion of health is {{the base of the}} Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion signed by the members of the World Health Organization in 1986. Being a healthy city is more a process than a result : a healthy city is not a city that reached a particular health status but one that tries to improve its health status. Healthy cities have built networks to exchange their experiences with other Healthy cities. These networks are national networks. The french <b>Healthy</b> <b>cities</b> <b>network</b> {{was created in}} 1990. Seventy-two cities are members of this network. Health Promotion is not a legal competence of the cities : the ministry of Health is the main actor of the health promotion. As a consequence, joining the french <b>healthy</b> <b>cities</b> <b>network</b> is the expression of a political commitment as the cities are not legally obliged to integrate health in their policies. First, the reasons to join the <b>Healthy</b> <b>cities</b> <b>network</b> will be discussed: are the cities sincere or opportunist ? Secondly, {{it will be interesting to}} evaluate the degree of motivation of the healthy cities after they have joined the network. Thirdly, the place of health in the local urban policies of Healthy cities will be analyzed. The main motivation of the joining to the French network is the exchange of information and of experiences. The relations with town councillors or with technicians is another reason which encouraged cities to join the network. These relations can be divided into two parts : on one side, previous relations between two cities, that can encourage a city to join the other city; on the other side, joining the network is an opportunity to meet other town councillors or technicians. The third motivation of the cities is to get a label, although the selection of the cities by the network is based on their commitment on the future and not on their results. A fourth motivation appeared in the deliberations of town councils : the legitimation. Joining the network is an opportnity for the cities to legitimate their role in public health and in health promotion. Healthy cities programme is not the only one that advocates health in every local policy. Many Healthy Cities are involved in other networks or labels linked to health or sustainable developement. Two approaches, which are supported by the same methods may fit with their goals: local Agenda 21 and the “health city workshops”, or ASV (policy for deprived neighbourhoods). The main objective of the Healthy cities programme is the integration of health in all local urban policies. Threeurban policies seem to take health into account : social policy, childhood policy and sport policy. The other policies like environment, housing, transport or urbanism policies don't seem to integrate health, although they can have a real impact on health, as they can modify the living environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} whether the WHO <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> project ‘works’ has been asked ever since a number of novel ideas and actions related to community health, health promotion and healthy public policy in the mid 1980 s came together in the <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> Movement initiated by the World Health Organization.

40|$|Background: Cities are {{engines of}} health {{development}} {{and not merely}} settings for health promotion. However, political scientists contest {{the extent of their}} powers and the scope of their influence. Methodology: Assuming local governance is a locus of decision-making about intermediate determinants of health, then there are three methodological challenges to evaluating its impact: first, accounting for context; second, addressing multiple, interactive interventions; and third identifying mechanisms for change. ‘Realist’ evaluation is more appropriate for this task than traditional paradigms of public health research. Review: Commissioned evaluations of the first three phases (1987 - 2002) of the WHO European <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Network</b> are reviewed against the three methodological challenges. Conclusions: These evaluations are stronger in identifying necessary city structures and processes but weaker, as are the Network cities themselves, in identifying change mechanisms which convert sector interventions into health gains. This lacuna is addressed in Phase IV (2003 - 2008) of the Network by the themes of healthy urban planning and health impact assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this evaluation was to review the evol-ution and process of city health development planning (CHDP) in municipalities participating in the <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Network</b> organized by the European Region of the World Health Organization.

40|$|Municipal Public Health Planning in Queensland: achievements, {{barriers}} and implementation success factors. ABSTRACT Creating healthier and more sustainable cities requires {{new approaches to}} planning at the local level. Queensland Health, Local Governments and Griffith University have formed a working partnership to implement Municipal Public Health Planning (MPHP) in local government. Each city has its own culture and diversity, its own political and organisational barriers to planning, and changing health professional capacity. The Queensland <b>Healthy</b> <b>City</b> and Shires <b>Network</b> facilitates partnerships, research, training and learning environments with local government and community agencies that are developing and implementing participatory planning. <b>Healthy</b> <b>cities</b> and shires meet and compare their planning achievements. Regional and town planning schemes provide consistency for major infrastructure and land development, and local government legislation now requires cities to determine social health needs. MPHP is identified as one of several community public health planning models trialled in this research. A practical 'seven step' MPHP process provides the framework for healthy cites needs based planning. This paper discusses {{the importance of a}} 'platform approach', where government and non-government agencies and community groups form a network and engage in the business of sustainable strategic health planning. The platform approach has 3 dimensions, Governance (long-term vision, layers of planning, industry support and regulation); a Platform (mechanism for agency networking, stakeholder forum, advisory committee, terms of reference, project management); and Implementation (local strategies and priority action areas, desired outcomes, communication process and evaluation). The research findings highlight the importance of the 'platform approach'. An Implementation Model has been developed to promote the actioning of strategies in community planning. In the model health strategies 'link up' vertically to higher levels of planning, and 'link across' horizontally to address gaps in agency planning, community group concerns and resident needs. The paper will describe the research developed in evaluation of MPHP, including a summary of the qualitative evaluation methodology, results and findings of the study and a 'Platform Approach' to participatory planning and MPHP Implementation Model.

40|$|The {{development}} of new partnership structures for public health is an important goal of the World Health Organization's Healthy Cities project which covers a network of European municipalities.

We report on Developing an evidence-based approach to city public health planning and investment in Europe (DECiPHEr), a project part funded by the European Union. It had twin objectives: first, to develop and validate a vocational educational training package for policy makers and political decision takers; second, to use this opportunity to iterate a robust and user-friendly investment tool for maximizing the public health impact of ‘mainstream ’ municipal policies, programs and investments. There were seven stages in the development process shared by an academic team from Sheffield Hallam University and partners from four cities drawn from the WHO European <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Network.</b> There were five iterations of the model resulting from this process. The initial focus was CVD as the biggest cause of death and disability in Europe. Our original prototype ‘cost offset ’ model was confined to proximal determinants of CVD, utilizing modified ‘Framingham ’ equations to estimate the impact of population level cardiovascular risk factor reduction on future demand fo...|$|E
40|$|An intersectoral {{partnership}} for health improvement {{is a requirement}} of the WHO European <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Network</b> of municipalities. A review was undertaken in 59 cities based on responses to a structured questionnaire covering phase IV of the network (2003 – 2008). Cities usually combined formal and informal working partnerships in a pattern seen in previous phases. However, these encompassed more sectors than previously and achieved greater degrees of collaborative planning and implementation. Additional WHO technical support and networking in phase IV significantly enhanced collaboration with the urban planning sector. Critical success factors were high-level political commitment and a well-organized Healthy City office. Partnerships remain a successful component of Healthy City working. The core principles, purpose and intellectual rationale for intersectoral partnerships remain valid and fit for purpose. This applied to long-established phase III cities as well as newcomers to phase IV. The network, {{and in particular the}} WHO brand, is well regarded and encourages political and organizational engagement and is a source of support and technical expertise. A key challenge is to apply a more rigorous analytical framework and theory-informed approach to reviewing partnership and collaboration parameters. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Healthy</b> <b>City</b> {{approach}} toward addressing {{a variety of}} urban health challenges is increasingly important {{in the context of}} urbanization and globalization. For successful <b>Healthy</b> <b>City</b> implementation and to help planners and decision makers, as an initial step WHO introduced a tool, - capacity mapping, which aims to identify existing resources and assess capacity needs. Countries like Japan, Korea, and Australia, as well as some European and American countries have mapped their national capacity. However, for specific cases like <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities,</b> mapping capacity is rarely undertaken. Therefore, through a comparative study, this paper maps the <b>Healthy</b> <b>City</b> capacity in two selected countries: Indonesia and Korea, in order to assess comparative needs and improve <b>Healthy</b> <b>City</b> development. Based on an extensive literature review and government documents, this study found that Indonesia and Korea have similarities in the historical development and national agenda of their <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> implementation, but have differences in organizational structure, regulation, and funding support. It appears that Indonesian national policy is stronger than Korean policy; Indonesia has joint regulation by the MOHA and the MOH, which provide national guidelines for the <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> implementation, while Korea only utilizes general guidelines. However, in terms of funding availability, Korea???s <b>Healthy</b> <b>City</b> program is stronger than that of Indonesia. Korea benefits from self-financing by each city, a membership fee from the KHCP, and support from the Health Promotion Foundation, while Indonesia has limited funding and no specific membership fe...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} a study that {{explored}} {{the relationship between the}} local environmental actions of <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> programs and the adverse health impacts of climate change. The analysis is primarily based on a limited literature review of climate change and health, with particular attention to the relationships between <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> and climate change, and on documentary analysis of information from organization reports and website content associated with <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> programs in Europe and Australia. Four semi-structured interviews with key people in two <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> programs in Europe and Australia were conducted to provide infor-mation to supplement and complement the published information and to verify theme identification. The main findings of this study are that, although there is no explicit connection between the local activities of <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> programs and the potential (or actual) adverse health impacts of climate change, <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> programs are involved in many local environmental actions and some of these actions, for example, those relating to improving air quality and reducing pollution, are linked implicitly to the health impacts of climate change. Through their local relationships and their participation in regional <b>networks,</b> <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> are able to make connections between local environmental actions and the health impacts of climate change. Furthermore, expanding <b>Healthy</b> <b>Cities</b> to include eco-social sustainability as a central aim not only has the potential to strengthen the links between local environmental actions and climate change, but also pre-sents a relevant health development setting for exploring the social and environmental sustainability of <b>cities.</b> Key words: <b>healthy</b> cities; climate change; sustainability; local actio...|$|R
