A 3–0 ballgame, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> one run and leave guys on base, it's like they expect us to mess up. And when we do, they chew us out. There is no positive, nothing around here for anybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kampusch's {{official}} statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil {{would get up}} early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon {{on television and in}} the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair." [...] She was given a television and radio to pass the time with, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> jihad. I will do whatever I can by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I consider that it is impossible for me to quit my duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. I declare that my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
