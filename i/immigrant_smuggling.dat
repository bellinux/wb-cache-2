2500|$|Stack and the Union City {{police were}} {{the subject of}} {{controversy}} in July 2005 when {{it was discovered that}} Stack had received two campaign contributions totalling $3,500 from Luisa Medrano, a tavern owner indicted on 31 counts for running an illegal <b>immigrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> ring out of her two Bergenline Avenue taverns, [...] El Puerto de la Union II in Union City, and El Paisano Bar and Nightclub in Union City. Both taverns are no longer in operation. Medrano was accused of smuggling young women from Honduras, forcing them to work in bars for little money to pay off their smuggling debts, often incurring physical, emotional and sexual abuse during the operation. Stack responded by asserting that he does not accept contributions from bars and establishments, and explained that [...] " [...] used her name and address in Fairview. [...] We make it practice of not accepting donations from bar owners or establishments, and we do not accept cash." [...] Stack pointed out that Medrano's establishments were not mentioned on the form with which she made the donations, and that he decided to donate the money to the Battered Women's Shelter of Hudson County once the donations were revealed, claiming that in addition to not being aware of the source of the money, he was unaware of the illicit activities going on in the bars. Stack also defended the Union City Police, who are assigned to watch the taverns for quality of life reasons, and who incurred criticism for their apparent ignorance of the goings-on in the taverns, on the same basis, arguing that they only patrolled the streets, but did not enter the taverns when they did so, and thus, could not see what occurred in them.|$|E

[...] The organization smuggled aliens who were nationals of India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria.

Aliens would then either fly or take a boat ride into the Miami, area or walk across the Mexican border.

40|$|In 1926 Newfoundland enacted {{legislation}} to restrict immigration {{in spite of}} the fact that the island had received very few immigrants in the previous seventy years. The antecedents of the 1926 Immigration Act can be found in the colony's own immigration experience, the shift in international immigration policies after the First World War, and its relations with Canada and the United States. [...] After the First World War, Canada and the United States effectively restricted immigration to Mainland North America. This shift in immigration policy left Newfoundland with the most liberal regulations in North America and caused increasing difficulties for the colony's migrating labour force. Unlike its neighbours, Newfoundland did not experience mass immigration in the early part of the twentieth century. As a result, immigration policy was not a high priority. The colony did not have in place the administrative or legislative framework to respond to the development of international or North American restrictions. [...] Canadian and American immigration officials pressured the Newfoundland Government to restrict immigration in the wake of two organized <b>immigrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> schemes in 1925 - 26. The arrival of two small groups of eastern Europeans in St. John's enroute to the United States, and the subsequent investigations launched by the American consulate and local investigations launched by the American consulate and local officials, warned legislators that the colony could be the recipient of redirected immigrants. With an uncertain economy and a dependence on the goodwill of its neighbours to relieve its excess labour, Newfoundland reacted to concerns over <b>immigrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> by passing a new immigration act in 1926. [...] This act emulated Canadian style restrictions and ended a tradition stemming from 1906 of judging prospective immigrants, with the exception of the Chinese, by individual merit. This was significant as individual merit was replaced by blanket restrictions as a way of screening potential immigrants. The 1926 Newfoundland Immigration Act was the last stage in a trend to create uniform immigration standards for North America after the war...|$|E
