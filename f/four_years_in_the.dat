5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by <b>four</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath of the}} Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E

In addition, more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Strachan was {{announced}} as O'Neill's replacement in June 2005 and {{after winning the}} SPL title {{in his first year}} in charge, he went on to become only the third Celtic manager to win three titles in a row. He also guided Celtic to their first UEFA Champions League knockout stage in 2006–07 and repeated the feat in 2007–08 before departing the club in May 2009, after failing to win the SPL title. Tony Mowbray took charge of the club in June 2009, and he was succeeded a year later by Neil Lennon. Celtic narrowly lost out to Rangers in the league in Lennon's first season in charge, but he did gain consolation by defeating Motherwell 3–0 in the 2011 Scottish Cup Final. Lennon went on to win three league titles in a row, then announced his departure from the club in May 2014 after <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role.|$|E

After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, directly {{across the street from the}} London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E

Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time over the next <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E
