[...] "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> into the next stage, then the thing isn't {{to try and do}} a loving tribute or reference other stuff. It's to reference the actual place itself". Houser also said, [...] "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [...] movie.

500|$|In Utero {{received}} acclaim from critics, {{although some}} reviews were mixed. Times Christopher John Farley stated {{in his review}} of the album, [...] "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke said that the album is [...] "a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne commented [...] "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, [...] "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." [...] NME magazine's John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, [...] "As a document of a mind in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable {{to come to terms}} with sanity – Kurt [...] should be proud of [...] As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, [...] "In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, [...] "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." [...] Q magazine felt that the album showcases Cobain's songwriting abilities and wrote, [...] "If this is how Cobain is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop,</b> the future is lighthouse-bright". Several critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{receiving}} {{the same amount}} of sunshine as the Chablis region, Chardonnay grapes in Champagne rarely attain full ripeness due to the mean temperature of the region being around , barely above the minimum average temperature needed to ripen grapes. Therefore, the Chardonnay grapes do not fully develop their fruit flavors and the still version of Champagne can taste very [...] "un-Chardonnay"-like because of this. However, it does lessen the premium on needing to keep yields low that other wine regions [...] battle, since not much flavor is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> in the grapes, anyway. Rather, the element in Chardonnay that Champagne wine-makers look for is the finesse and balance of acidity that it brings to the blend. Some flavors that can emerge from, particularly with extended time on its lees, include creamy and nuttiness with some floral notes.|$|E

6000|$|So {{when the}} Flash freighted with {{materials}} {{for building a}} new house left the harbour of Batavia, taking away the young couple into the unknown Borneo, she did not carry on her deck so much love and happiness as old Lingard was wont to boast of before his casual friends in the verandahs of various hotels. The old seaman himself was perfectly happy. Now he had done his duty by the girl. [...] "You know I made her an orphan," [...] he often concluded solemnly, when talking about his own affairs to a scratch audience of shore loafers--as it was his habit to do. And the approbative shouts of his half-intoxicated auditors filled his simple soul with delight and pride. [...] "I carry everything right through," [...] was another of his sayings, and in pursuance of that principle he pushed the building of house and godowns on the Pantai River with feverish haste. The house for the young couple; the godowns for the big trade Almayer was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> while he (Lingard) {{would be able to}} give himself up to some mysterious work which was only spoken of in hints, but was understood to relate to gold and diamonds in the interior of the island. Almayer was impatient too. Had he known what was before him he might not have been so eager and full of hope as he stood watching the last canoe of the Lingard expedition disappear in the bend up the river. When, turning round, he beheld the pretty little house, the big godowns built neatly by an army of Chinese carpenters, the new jetty round which were clustered the trading canoes, he felt a sudden elation in the thought that the world was his.|$|E
