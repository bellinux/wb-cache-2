We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> how old I {{was because}} of where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

You can't teach heart and soul. That's what it takes to play in the game.|$|E

500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band.

This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal.
