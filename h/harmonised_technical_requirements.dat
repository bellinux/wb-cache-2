50|$|The Regulation {{provides}} that where a <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> standard exists for a construction product {{as defined by}} the Regulation, that product must be tested and certified to that standard by a notified body in order to qualify for a CE Mark. Since EN 54 is the <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> standard for fire detection and alarm products, it appears to follow that products in that field which are brought to market in the European Union must be tested against the provisions of EN 54 and certified accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{detection}} and alarm products {{placed on the}} market within the European Union must, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, conform to the European <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> standard EN 54 Fire Detection and Fire Alarm Systems.|$|R
50|$|The eurocodes are the ten European {{standards}} (EN; <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> rules) specifying how {{structural design}} {{should be conducted}} within the European Union (EU).

50|$|For {{a product}} {{to carry a}} CE Mark, it must fulfill the {{essential}} requirements. Fire alarm and Fire detection products, therefore, must follow the requirement laid down in the Construction Products Regulation for testing by a notified body {{to be carried out}} against the <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> standard in the field - EN 54.|$|R
30|$|The {{second phase}} of QFD-based expert system embarks with {{identifying}} the most important <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> based on which the end user wants to evaluate the candidate CNC turning centres. Once the desirable <b>technical</b> <b>requirements</b> are shortlisted by the end user, the range for each selected <b>technical</b> <b>requirement</b> needs to be specified. Depending on the given ranges of values for the shortlisted <b>technical</b> <b>requirements,</b> a list of feasible CNC turning centres is then extracted.|$|R
50|$|The ISO/IEC 17025 {{standard}} itself comprises five {{elements that}} are Scope, Normative References, Terms and Definitions, Management <b>Requirements</b> and <b>Technical</b> <b>Requirements.</b> The two main sections in ISO/IEC 17025 are Management <b>Requirements</b> and <b>Technical</b> <b>Requirements.</b> Management requirements are primarily related to the operation and effectiveness of the quality management system within the laboratory. <b>Technical</b> <b>requirements</b> includes factors which determines the correctness and reliability of the tests and calibrations performed in laboratory.|$|R
