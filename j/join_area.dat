As he had previously sent two of his regiments to Boston, he had only about 800 regular soldiers left in Quebec. His attempts to raise a militia met with limited success at first, as neither the ethnic French nor the English residents were willing to <b>join.</b> <b>Area</b> Indians were willing to fight on the British side, and the Crown wanted them to do so, but Carleton turned their offer down because he feared the Indians attacking non-combatants. For the same reason, he limited Guy Johnson and his Iroquois allies, who had come to Quebec from New York, to operating only in Quebec.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Al-Cu joints {{have been}} widely used in {{electronic}} and heat exchanger industries due to their excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, the use of Al in the Al-Cu joints can result in lower weight and cost of the final structure. The purpose of the current study is to join Al to Cu by furnace brazing using ultrafine Al-Si powder. To study the microstructure of the <b>join</b> <b>area,</b> the brazing tests were conducted in the range of 590 to 610 o C for 5 to 15 minutes under inert atmosphere. The microstructure of Al/Cu joints was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The elemental analysis was conducted using an energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) system. Experimental results show that two kinds of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) mainly Cu 3 Al 2 and CuAl 2 phases are formed near the interface of copper and in the braze layer region. The bulky prismatic structure which is formed on the side of Al substrate was found to be Î±-Al+CuAl 2 eutectic...|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} requirements for structural and armor {{applications in the}} future nuclear fusion reactors impose a very high barrier to be surmounted {{in order to fulfill}} the safety requirements and reliable operation of the systems. The efforts of NRG and ECN in the developing of materials by Powder / Metal Injection Molding (PIM / MIM) are very promising and show a big potential of this technique as a prospective net shape parts manufacturing method, easily scalable to industrial level. Several MIM materials were developed by the ECN and characterized at NRG within European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) Work Programme. Of them, two materials - pure tungsten (W) and tungsten doped with 1 vol% Y 2 O 3 are demonstrating good potential for likely future use. Therefore, further characterization efforts are needed. The MIM W- 1 %Y 2 O 3 material seems to be very promising material for armor applications. Extensive thermal shock testing performed at JUDITH 1 up to 1000 cycles and up to 1273 K did not cause crack formation. Additionally, two-component mock-ups were produced using MIM technology.

40|$|Purpose: Paper {{presents}} {{results of}} investigations with two layers explosively formed sandwich composite consisting of different composition joint which requires very often knowledge of structure and mechanical properties. These properties are connected with microstructure that {{is influenced by}} technological factors under cladding. Design/methodology/approach: The sample bars were prepared from explosively formed sandwich composite near the <b>join</b> <b>area.</b> The methods of the light microscopy and the hardness and tensile test for evaluation of quality of joined sandwich metals were used. Investigations by a new fatigue method in the case sandwich composite steel CrNi(18 / 10) + Ti were completed. Findings: Measurement of micro-hardness in the zone of the joint a deformation of materials shows an increase value of that. Detailed metallographic observation detected in proximity of the joints an occurrence of structural non-homogeneities. Steel and titanium interface surfaces are corrugated. New fatigue method in the case sandwich composite steel CrNi(18 / 10) + Ti were verified. Research limitations/implications: Knowledge of microstructure characteristics will be extended by the method of SEM, including micro-analysis of individual structural components and surface analysis. Influence of experiment conditions on results of fatigue test must be more elaborated in future. Practical implications: The results may be utilized for a relation between structure and properties of the investigated materials in process of manufacturing. Originality/value: These results contribute to complex evaluation of properties explosively formed sandwich composite namely for explanation of structure developed new sandwich composites. The results of this paper are determined for research workers deal by development new exploitations of new sandwich composites...|$|E

40|$|For {{assessing}} {{the quality of}} the <b>joining</b> <b>area</b> as well as researching the influence of joining parameters in combination with different materials, the principal stress components of sinter-joined micro valves were analysed. Transmission experiments have been conducted at the high-energy material science (HEMS) beamline P 07 at PETRA III, DESY. Due to the dimensions of the samples, a high spatial resolution of the measurements was required.
