2500|$|Early 'humanist' roman types were {{introduced}} in Italy. Modelled on the script of the period, they tend to feature an [...] "e" [...] where the cross stroke is angled, not horizontal, 'M's with two-way serifs, and often a relatively dark colour on the page. In modern times, that of Nicolas Jenson {{has been the most}} admired, with many revivals. Some have visible blackletter influences or other unusual features. <b>Garaldes,</b> which tend to feature a level cross-stroke on the 'e', descend from an influential 1495 font cut by engraver Francesco Griffo for printer Aldus Manutius, which was the inspiration for many typefaces cut in France from the 1530s onwards. Often lighter on the page and made in larger sizes than had been used for roman type before, French Garalde faces rapidly spread throughout Europe to become an international standard. Meanwhile, italic type evolved from a quite separate genre of type, intended for informal uses such as poetry, into having a primary use for emphasis. Italics developed from being conceived as having separate designs and proportions to being able to be fitted into the same line as roman type with a complementary design to it.|$|E
50|$|Also called Aldine, {{this group}} is named in homage to Claude Garamond and Aldus Manutius. In general, the <b>garaldes</b> have finer {{proportions}} than the humanists, and a stronger contrast between downstroke and upstroke. The weight of the <b>garaldes</b> are distributed according to an oblique axis. In France, under King Francis I, the <b>garaldes</b> were the tool which supported the official fixing of grammar and orthography.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>Garaldes</b> include Bembo and Garamond.|$|E

2500|$|Examples of {{contemporary}} <b>Garalde</b> old-style typefaces are Bembo, Garamond, Galliard, Granjon, Goudy Old Style, Minion, Palatino, Renard, Sabon, and Scala. Typefaces {{specifically in the}} [...] "Dutch taste" [...] style include Van Dijck, Van den Keere, Janson, Caslon and Ehrhardt. Contemporary typefaces with Venetian old style characteristics include the particularly faithful revival Cloister, Adobe Jenson, the Golden Type, Hightower Text, Centaur, and more loosely Goudy's Italian Old Style and Berkeley Old Style, ITC Legacy and Trinité. Several of these blend in <b>Garalde</b> influences to fit modern expectations, especially placing single-sided serifs on the 'M'.|$|R

5000|$|Old-style {{faces are}} sub-divided into Venetian (or humanist) and Garalde (or Aldine), a {{division}} {{made on the}} Vox-ATypI classification system. Venetian types tend to feature an [...] "e" [...] where the cross stroke is angled, not horizontal, and a slightly more irregular design, following the work of Nicolas Jenson; they tended to be superseded by later <b>Garaldes,</b> which proved the foundation for all succeeding styles listed below. Nonetheless, {{some have argued that}} the difference is hard to spot except to specialists, and that in any case the subdivision makes little sense for modern typefaces such as Arno, which may fuse both styles.|$|E
40|$|In {{clinical}} trials, randomization {{is always}} used to assign subjects to different treatment groups in order to eliminating bias in clinical research. When {{experts in the field}} are uncertain to whether any of the treatments is superior to another (i. e. clinical equipoise) (see, for example, Freedman, 1987 and Sugarman, 2002), it is acceptable to consider the use of complete randomization. However, when clinical equipoise does not exist, complete randomization is unacceptable because it raises an ethical problem by randomly assigning subjects to an inferior treatment. Therefore, responseadaptive design is proposed to solve this problem by skewing the allocation probabilities according to the response history of subjects. The response-adaptive design for binary response has been well studied in the literature. Wei and Durham (1978) studied the randomized play-the-winner rule which is originated from the urn model. Eisele (1994) introduced the doubly adaptive biased coin design which is a randomization procedure to target some allocation proportions. Melfi, Page and <b>Garaldes</b> (2001) introduced a sequential maximum likelihood procedure for this purpose. Rosenberger et al. (2001) studied the optimal adaptive designs for binary responses. Hu and Rosenberger (2003) provided a theoretica...|$|E

5000|$|An {{additional}} subgenre of the <b>Garalde</b> {{style that}} developed around the 17th {{century in the}} Netherlands or Germany {{has been called the}} [...] "Dutch taste" [...] (or [...] "goût Hollandois"), a tradition towards denser, more solid typefaces, often with sharp contrast between thick and thin strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of <b>Garalde</b> old-style typefaces are Bembo, Garamond, Galliard, Granjon, Goudy Old Style, Minion, Palatino, Renard, Sabon, Scala and VandenKeere, {{and in the}} [...] "Dutch taste" [...] style {{specifically}} Janson, Caslon and Ehrhardt. Examples of Venetian old style typefaces are Adobe Jenson, Berkeley Old Style, Centaur, Cloister, the Golden Type, Hightower Text, Legacy, and Trinité.|$|R
25|$|Old-style faces {{evolved over}} time, showing {{increasing}} abstraction from handwriting and blackletter models and often increased delicacy or contrast as printing technique improved. Old-style faces have often sub-divided into Venetian (or humanist) and <b>Garalde</b> (or Aldine), a division {{made on the}} Vox-ATypI classification system. Nonetheless, {{some have argued that}} the difference is excessively abstract, hard to spot except to specialists and implies a clearer separation between styles than originally appeared. Modern typefaces such as Arno and Trinité may fuse both styles.|$|R
50|$|Suitable {{for both}} text and display applications, Goudy Old Style is a graceful, {{balanced}} design {{with a few}} eccentricities, including the upward-curved ear on the g and the diamond shape of the dots of the i, j, and the points found in the period, colon and exclamation point, and the sharply canted hyphen. The uppercase italic Q has a strong calligraphic quality. Generally classified as a <b>Garalde</b> (sometimes called Aldine) face, certain of its attributes—most notably the gently curved, rounded serifs of certain glyphs—suggest a Venetian influence. The design is relatively light in colour, and {{has been described as}} particularly suitable for titles and headings.|$|R
