40|$|The article {{describes}} research of fluid flow inside an axial-flow pump that includes guide vanes, impeller and discharge diffuser. Three <b>impellers</b> with different <b>hub</b> ratio were researched. The article presents the performance curves and velocity distributions behind {{each of the}} impeller obtained by computational and experimental ways at six different capacities. The velocity distributions behind the detached guide vanes of different hub ratio are also presented. The computational results were obtained using the software tools CFX-BladeGenPlus and CFX-TASCflow. The experimental performance curves were obtained using the standard procedure. The experimental velocity distributions were obtained by probing of the flow. Good correspondence of results, both for performance curves and velocity distributions, was obtained {{for most of the}} considered cases. As it was demonstrated, the performance curves of the pump depend essentially on the <b>impeller</b> <b>hub</b> ratio. Velocity distributions behind the impeller depend strongly on the <b>impeller</b> <b>hub</b> ratio and capacity. Conclusions concerning these dependencies are drawn.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe global {{price of}} oil, {{which is both}} finite and limited in quantity, has been rising {{steadily}} because of the increasing requirements for energy in both developing and developed countries. Furthermore, regulations have been strengthened across all industries to address global warming. Many studies of hull resistance, propulsion and operation of ships have been performed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This study examined the design parameters of the propeller boss cap fin (PBCF) and <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> for 6, 000 TEU container ships to improve the propulsion efficiency. The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the correlation among design parameters. Four design alternatives of PBCF were selected from the DOE. The shape of a propeller <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> was selected as a divergent shape, and the divergent angle was determined by the DOE. Four design alternatives of PBCF were attached to the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap,</b> and the POW was estimated by CFD. As a result, the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with PBCF has a negative effect on the POW, which is induced by an increase in torque coefficient. A POW test and cavitation test were performed with a divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with PBCF to verify the CFD result. The POW test result showed that the open water efficiency was increased approximately 2 % with a divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> compared to a normal cap. The POW test result was similar to the CFD result, and the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with the PBCF models showed lower open water efficiency. This was attributed to an increase in the torque coefficient just like the CFD results. A cavitation test was performed using the 2 models selected. The test result showed that the hub vortex is increased downstream of the propeller...|$|R

Blood flow stagnation and clot formation within the pump are minimized by, among other things, providing the inducer hub with a diameter greater than the diameter of the flow straightener hub; by optimizing the axial spacing between the flow straightener hub and the inducer hub, and between the <b>impeller</b> <b>hub</b> and the diffuser hub; by optimizing the inlet angle of the diffuser blades; and by providing fillets or curved transitions between the upstream end of the inducer hub and the shaft mounted therein, and between the <b>impeller</b> <b>hub</b> and the shaft mounted therein...|$|R
