5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> density.|$|E
25|$|Most bodies, {{over most}} {{temperature}} ranges, expand on being heated. Mostly, heating a body {{at a constant}} volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls, and <b>increases</b> <b>its</b> temperature. Also mostly, heating a body at a constant pressure <b>increases</b> <b>its</b> volume, and <b>increases</b> <b>its</b> temperature.|$|R
