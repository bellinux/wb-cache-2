Kamara opted for Shutt, who was given only a 50 per cent of playing {{in the run-up to}} the match because of a slight knock, with Ian Ormondroyd, a veteran of three play-off finals with his previous club Leicester City, selected as substitute. Captain Eddie Youds, who overcame a knee problem to return to the side in defence in place of David Brightwell, was the only player not to have played in the second leg against Blackpool. Notts County's side featured only two of the players that had been relegated the previous season – Tony Agana and Shaun Murphy.

The banks took a more controlling role in the company: it could no longer pay dividends, make investments, or sign new contracts without its creditors' approval.
