In the present study, we capitalized on the in vitro discovery of a small-molecule accelerator of a-synuclein amyloid formation and assessed its effects when injected in brains of normal mice. An accelerator and an inhibitor of a-synuclein amyloid formation, as well as vehicle only, were injected into the striatum of normal mice and follwed by behavioral evaluation, immunohistochemistry, and metabolomics {{up to six months}} later. The effects of molecules injected into the substansia nigra of normal and a-synuclein knockout mice were also analyzed. When accelerator or inhibitor was injected into the brain of normal mice no acute compound toxicity was found. However, 6 months after single striatal <b>injection</b> of <b>accelerator,</b> mice sensorimotor functions were impaired, whereas mice injected with inhibitor had no dysfunctions. <b>Injection</b> of <b>accelerator</b> (but not inhibitor or vehicle) into the substantia nigra revealed singificant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive neurons after 3 months.

40|$|An {{important}} {{linear accelerator}} requirement, {{in order to}} demonstrate narrow energy spectra, is the injection of electron bunches of narrow phase spread and negligible inter-bunch current. This {{can be achieved by}} r-f transverse modulation and clipping of the beam by an aperture prior to <b>injection</b> into the <b>accelerator</b> waveguide, i. e., chopper operation. By magnetically biasing the beam {{to one side of the}} centerline, it is possible to arrange for transmission into the accelerator at a time during each r-f cycle when the radial momentum imparted to the beam by the chopper cavity is passing through zero. The low efficiency of beam utilization normally associated with this type of operation, because of the high ratio of collected to transmitted current, can be considerably improved by combining the transverse chopping action with a suitably phased longitudinal velocity modulating field as obtained from a simple prebunching cavity. Transverse r-f deflection techniques also enable sub-harmonic bunch selection and <b>injection</b> into linear <b>accelerators</b> which are used as injectors for electron synchrotrons.

40|$|The charge-exchange {{method is}} now one of the main {{techniques}} for ion <b>injection</b> into <b>accelerators</b> and storage rings. The disadvantages of conventional methods, based on the atom or ion stripping in a material target, are emittance growth, energy straggling, and production of ions in many charge states. Recently suggested stripping methods based on direct photoionization require employment of hard-UV lasers, which still do not exist and must obviously be very bulky and expensive. An alternative method, suggested for injection of proton beams, employs excitation of the atom to 3 p intermediate state with subsequent Lorentz ionization in a magnetic field gradient. This technique applies rigid requirements to laser characteristic and is not free of growing of the beam divergence. In this paper a variant of the stripping technique based on the resonantly enhanced two-photon ionization (RETPI) is considered. The technique allows ionization of singly charged ions of the elements from helium to bismuth. A variant of the technique can be used for proton injection. RETPI can be applied for both ion injection and stacking, as well as for diagnostics of ion beam characteristics on the orbit. Stripping efficiency can be about 100 % for the singly charged ions having the singlet ground state and decreases for the other ions. Special methods for “cleaning” unwanted atomic states in such ions, that can provide high stripping efficiency, are discussed. Excimer lasers with very moderate parameters can be employed for implementation of this technique for almost all elements.

Pulsations range from one pulse every few seconds to 8 - 10 per second.

40|$|The {{demand of}} exotic ions {{prior to their}} <b>injection</b> into an <b>accelerator</b> has driven the {{development}} of the charge breeding method. Existing facilities like REX-ISOLDE or ISAC at TRIUMF are already using a charge state booster for the post acceleration of radioactive ions. Planned facilities like MAFF, SPES, SPIRAL II and EURISOL have identified the need of a breeding system because of the demand for highly charged ions for low energy experiments and because of the available budget and space. Therefore the exploration and optimization of existing charge state breeders is mandatory and is supported by the I 3 -EURONS project. Central part of the planed charge breeding experiments is the MAXEBIS [1]. The electron gun, the inner electrode structure and the collector of the MAXEBIS have been modified. The MAXEBIS is a cold source, the superconducting magnet can reach up to 5 T. The high current electron gun is based on a 2 mm IrCe cathode which can be driven to a maximum emission current density of about 95 A/cm 2. A new collector has been installed which can sustain 18 kW beam power. A small surface ion source has been designed, which will provide alkaline beams for the injection of the ions into the MAXEBIS. The full MAXEBIS set-up has been moved from Frankfurt to GSI, where the charge breeding measurements will be performed. The whole beamline is homed outside GSI at the Heckhalle.
