40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>diurnal</b> fluctuations in <b>aberrations</b> and blood glucose levels (BGLs) in diabetic patients and control subjects. Methods: Twenty-one type 2 diabetic subjects (age 56 ± 11 years), 20 type 1 diabetic subjects (age 38 ± 15 years) and 20 non-diabetic controls (age 49 ± 23 years) took part in the study. The distribution of refractive errors was similar between groups (p= 0. 96). Aberrations were measured with an OPD autorefractometer (NIDEK) and analysed for a 5 mm pupil diameter. BGLs were measured using a finger stick test (Hemocue). All measurements were taken six times during the day, between 8 AM and 8 PM at approximately two-hourly intervals. Results: The coefficients of third order coma, fourth order spherical aberration, and higher-order RMS error were found to be higher in the diabetic compared to the control group. The mean variation in the third and fourth order aberrations over the twelve-hour period was found to be higher in the diabetic when compared to the control group; however, these differences were not statistically significant. The higher-order RMS error showed a negative correlation with time in the diabetic group compared to a positive correlation in the control group (gradient: - 6. 4 x 10 - 3 in type 2 diabetes, - 24. 4 x 10 - 3 in type 1 diabetes and 74. 9 x 10 - 3 in control group; ANOVA p= 0. 025). In diabetic patients, increasing BGLs showed a negative trend with the third order horizontal coma (p= 0. 44) and fourth order spherical aberration coefficients (p= 0. 61), while a positive trend was observed between BGLs and the third order vertical coma (p= 0. 58) and higher order RMS (p= 0. 47). Conclusions: Compared to controls, diabetic patients exhibit greater variation in higher order aberrations. Ocular aberration coefficients varied during the day, with fluctuating BGLs. The variation in ocular aberration coefficients is possibly due to the effect of large fluctuations in BGLs leading to hydration effects on the diabetic crystalline lens. CR: B. Huntjens, None; H.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the correspondence between two approaches to astrometric observational reductions: {{the approach based}} on angular observables used for optical observations, and {{the approach based on}} the interferometric delay observable used for very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) observations. Specifically, of interest here is the group of algorithms that have become standard in accounting for the physical effects traditionally called annual and <b>diurnal</b> <b>aberration</b> and gravitational light bending. These algorithms are important because they must be applied to all wide-angle astrometric measurements, whether ground-or space-based, and regardless of the distance of the objects observed. A procedure is presented by which VLBI algorithms can be used for optical observations. This scheme can help to guarantee consistent treatment of observational results in the tw...|$|E

Annual aberration is due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun, while <b>diurnal</b> <b>aberration</b> is due to the Earth’s rotation. In star catalogs of the pre- 1984. 0 era, it was common to include the secular part of stellar aberration (the so-called e-terms) in the published star positions. apparent place: a geocentric position (e. g. apparent right ascension and declination) in the true equinox and equator of date reference system at a specified date. apparent right ascension and declination: angular coordinates in the true equator and equinox of date reference system at a specified date. They are geocentric positions differing from the ICRS positions by annual parallax, gravitational light deflection due to the solar system bodies except the Earth, annual aberration, and the time-dependent rotation describing the transformation from th...|$|E
