The scalability of a parallel system is limited byits {{ability to communicate}} and coordinate processing. Circuit switching, packet switchingand wormhole routing are dominant switching techniques. Our simulation results show that wormhole routing and circuit switching each excel under different types of traffic. This dissertation presents a hybrid switching technique that combines wormhole routing with circuit switching in a single switch using vrtual channels and time division multiplexing. The performance of this <b>hybrid</b> <b>switch</b> is significantly impacted by the effciency of traffic scheduling and thus, this dissertation also explores the design and scalability of hardware scheduling for the <b>hybrid</b> <b>switch.</b> In particular, we introduce two schedulers for crossbar networks: a greedy scheduler and an optimal scheduler that improves upon the resultsprovided by the greedy scheduler. For the time division multiplexing portion of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>switch,</b> this dissertation presents three allocation methods that combine wormhole switching with predictive circuit switching. We further extend this research from crossbar networks to fat tree interconnected networks with virtual channels. The global "level-wise" scheduling algorithm is presented and improves network utilization by 30 % when compared to a switch-level algorithm.

The performance measure is based on the blocking probability of CBR traffic and the time delay of VBR traffic. Therefore, the objective of the dynamic bandwidth allocation is to maintain balance between blocking probability and delay under various traffic conditions.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a new <b>hybrid</b> <b>switching</b> architecture, termed as SLIP-IN, that {{combines}} electronic packet/burst with optical circuit switching. SLIP-IN architecture takes advantages of the pre-transmission idle periods of optical lightpaths and slips into them packets or bursts of packets. In optical circuit switching (wavelength-routing) networks, capacity is immediately hard-reserved upon {{the arrival of a}} setup message, but is only used after a round-trip time delay. This idle period is significant for optical multi-gigabit networks and can be used to transmit traffic of a lower class of service.

40|$|Hybrid {{circuit and}} packet {{switching}} for data center networking (DCN) has received considerable research attention recently.

40|$|Optical fibers {{have brought}} fast and {{reliable}} data transmission to today’s network. The immense fiber build-out {{over the last}} few years has generated a wide array of new access technologies, transport and network protocols, and next-generation services in the Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN). All these different technologies, protocols, and services were introduced to address particular telecommunication needs. To remain competitive in the market, the service providers must offer most of these services, while maintaining their own profitability. However, offering a large variety of equipment, protocols, and services posses a big challenge for service carriers because it requires a huge investment in different technology platforms, lots of training of staff, and the management of all these networks. In today’s network, service providers use SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork) as a basic TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) transport network. SONET was primarily designed to carry voice traffic from telephone networks. However, with the explosion of traffic in the Internet, the same SONET based TDM network is optimized to support increasing demand for packet based Internet network services (data, voice, video, teleconference etc.) at access networks and LANs. Therefore the service providers need to support their Internet Protocol (IP) infrastructure as well as in the legacy telephony infrastructure. Supporting both TDM and packet services in the present condition needs multilayer operations which is complex, expensive, and difficult to manage. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>switch</b> is a novel architecture that combines packets (IP) and TDM switching in a unified access platform and provides seamless integration of access networks and LANs with MAN/WAN networks. The ability to fully integrate these two capabilities in a single chassis will allow service providers to deploy a more cost effective and flexible architecture that can support a variety of different services. This thesis develops a <b>hybrid</b> <b>switch</b> which is capable of offering bundled services for TDM switching and packet routing. This is done by dividing the switch’s bandwidth into VT 1. 5 (Virtual Tributary - 1. 5) channels and providing SONET based signaling for routing the data and controlling the switch’s resources. The switch is a TDM based architecture which allows each switch’s port to be independently configured for any mixture of packet and TDM traffic, including 100 % packet and 100 % TDM. This switch allows service providers to simplify their edge networks by consolidating the number of separate boxes needed to provide fast and reliable access. This switch also reduces the number of network management systems needed, and decreases the resources needed to install, provision and maintain the network because of its ability to “collapse” two network layers into one platform. The scope of this thesis includes system architecture, logic implementation, and verification testing, and performance evaluation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>switch.</b> The architecture consists of ingress/egress ports, an arbiter and a crossbar. Data from ingress ports is carried to the egress ports via VT 1. 5 channels which are switched at the cross point of the crossbar. The crossbar setup and channel assignments at ingress port are done by the arbiter. The design was tested by simulation and the hardware cost was estimated. The performance results showed that the switch is non-blocking, provide differentiated service, and has an overall effective throughput of 80 %. This result is a significant step towards the goal of building a switch that can support multiprotocol and provide different network capabilities into one platform.
