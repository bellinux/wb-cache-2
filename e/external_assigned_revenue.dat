40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] – The {{purpose of this}} paper is to provide a review of an analytic methodology (knowledge valuation analysis, i. e. KVA), based on complexity and information theory, that is capable of quantifying value creation by corporate intellectual capital. It aims to use a real-world case to demonstrate this methodology within a consulting context. Design/methodology/approach – The fundamental assumptions and theoretical constructs underlying KVA are summarized. The history of the concept, a case application, limitations, and implications for the methodology are presented. Findings – Although well-known financial analytic tools were used to justify IT investment proposals, none provided a satisfying result because none offered an unambiguous way to tie IT performance to value creation. KVA provided a means to count the amount of corporate knowledge, in equivalent units, required to produce the outputs of client core processes. This enabled stakeholders to <b>assign</b> <b>revenue</b> streams to IT, develop IT ROIs, and decide with clarity where to invest. Practical implications – When stakeholders can <b>assign</b> <b>revenue</b> streams to sub-corporate processes, they have a new context for making IC investment decisions. “Cost centers” and decisions based on cost containment can be replaced. Concepts such as a knowledge market, the knowledge asset pricing model, k-betas, and a sub-corporate equities market can be developed and applied. Some of the limitations related to real options analysis can be resolved. Originality/value – This paper introduces an approach to measuring corporate intellectual capital that solves some long-standing IC valuation problems...|$|R

40|$|Earmarking is the {{practice}} of <b>assigning</b> <b>revenues</b> from specific taxes or groups of taxes to specific government activities or to broader areas of government activity. As such, it contrasts with general fund financing where monies are pooled {{to be used for}} various government purposes. In practice, earmarking has come into being via statute or via constitutional clauses mandating that certain revenues only be used for specified activities. Governments often circumvent the intentions of earmarking by withholding funds or failing to change prices or taxes or, if need be, simply suspending the earmarking arrangements.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper we present a non-technical {{analysis}} of earmarking. We then briefly review some international experience with earmarking and its apparent results. The main new contribution of the paper is the concluding description and evaluation of the nature, efficacy, and effects of earmarking in Korea. Earmarking – <b>assigning</b> <b>revenues</b> from designated sources to finance designated expenditures – is an old and popular practice in many countries around the world. In Section 1, we set out a taxonomy of earmarking to set the stage for discussion in Section 2 of the reasons why countries might decide to earmark particular revenues. In Section 3 we review briefly some international experience with earmarking and its apparent results. Against this general background, in Section 4, the main new contribution of the paper, we describe the perhaps surprising amount of earmarking in Korea and present a preliminary evaluation of its efficacy and effects. A brief Section 5 concludes. Korea, tax and expenditures, embarking...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{a growing}} number of {{countries}} around the world are <b>assigning</b> <b>revenue</b> sources and expenditure functions from central government to the lower levels of governments in terms of fiscal decentralization programs. This is because of the argument that sub-national governments are closer to the people and hence better programmed and ready to give the right services according to the local preferences at lower costs. Fiscal decentralization, as a part of public reform programs in developed and developing countries, aims to improve the autonomy of local governments. It is also known that fiscal decentralization enhances the effectiveness of provision of public services. Thus, it also contributes the economic growth at local and macro level through the enhancement of accountability and transparency of public services. Fiscal decentralization in Turkey, local expenditures as a percentage of total expenditures, remains low according to the developed and developing countries. This study tends to explore the extent of fiscal decentralization and its measurement firstly, and then will give the aspects of fiscal decentralization of Turkey at local and regional level...|$|R

Revenue sharing also does not diffuse separatist tendencies, since oil-producing SNGs would still be better off by keeping their oil revenues in full. ...|$|R
40|$|Economic theory {{provides}} some justification for earmarking. Some economists argue that by <b>assigning</b> <b>revenue</b> from specific sources to specific purposes, a government can facilitate agreement about increasing both revenue and expen-diture in {{cases in which}} {{there would be no}} consensus about raising either sep-arately. Earmarking may also protect high-priority programs from shifting majorities, inefficiency, and corruption. Most economists, however, have been skeptical about earmarking. In prac-tice, it is difficult to achieve pricing and taxation arrangements that will allo-cate resources appropriately for the service in question and yet require few administrative decisions. Often, efficient pricing and taxing lead to unbalanced budgets for the earmarked fund and hence to interdependence with the general budget. The independence of earmarked funds is further compromised because they so often depend on the government for additional, non-earmarked sources of funding, or for reiterated endorsement of decisions about prices or taxes for the earmarked sources. Governments also frequently withhold the allotted funds, fail to make necessary changes in prices or taxes, or simply suspend the earmarking arrangements. This article looks at the arguments for and against earmarking and goes on to illustrate the discussion with case studies from World Bank experience. The lessons from the real world appear to bear out the skepticism of the majority about earmarking: in general, it has not worked very well. The article, there-fore, concludes by cautioning against the practice except under certain defined and restrictive conditions...|$|R
