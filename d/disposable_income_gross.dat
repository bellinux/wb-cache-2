40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main findings resulted from indicators analysis (gross value added, gross operating surplus, gross national income, etc.) which characterize {{the institutional sectors}} – the ones emphasizing the different behaviors and results between the competition and non-competition sectors (households and general government respectively). This analysis is very necessary, because the European Commission, through the specialized directorate - DGECFIN, has included in the forecast framework the indicators regarding incomes and expenditures of institutional sectors (compensation of employees, gross <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>gross</b> saving) for member states. The macroeconomic forecast has not yet used this economic approach. The main inconvenience in estimating institutional sectors accounts forecast refers on one hand to {{the gap between the}} statistical and forecasting horizons, the statistical data regarding the institutional sectors are available only after a period of two years since the event has occurred (the data series for Romania end in 2004) and, on the other hand, the aggregates evaluation is only carried out in current prices, increasing thus the relativity of data series by using conventional deflators. Until now they are the first estimates referring to the compensation of employees and the gross disposable income. *This paper is partially based on the study “Overview of the economic results by institutional sectors”, NCP, 2007 institutional sector, households, gross value added, compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, gross national income...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The Guidelines for the FCTC Article 6 state: When {{establishing}} {{their levels}} of taxation, Parties should make tobacco products less affordable over {{time in order to}} reduce consumption. The objective is to estimate the impact of changes in tobacco affordability on tobacco consumption and tobacco excise revenues in 2011 - 2014 in 28 European Union countries. Material and Methods Tobacco affordability index was calculated using the Eurostat data on harmonized consumer price index for tobacco products (adjusted for inflation) and the adjusted <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>gross</b> Purchasing Power Standard per inhabitant. The European Commission data on tobacco revenues and tobacco sales (cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco combined) were used. Results Strong correlation between changes of tobacco affordability and tobacco sales is observed in the EU- 28. Tobacco consumption declined in the EU- 28 in 2011 - 2014, while tobacco excise revenues were stable. Countries where tobacco became less affordable mainly due to tax and price increases (UK, France, Romania) observed a decline in consumption and growing revenue. Countries, where tobacco became less affordable mainly due to the economic recession (Greece, Spain, Ireland) had a decline in consumption and a reduction in revenue. Countries, where tobacco became more affordable (Lithuania, Bulgaria, Austria) had an increase in consumption and revenue. Conclusions Tobacco taxation can ensure both tobacco consumption decline and revenue increase only if taxation is a key factor of tobacco affordability reduction. Otherwise, in years of economic recession consumption declines, but revenue does not increase; while in years of economic growth revenue increases, but consumption does not decline...|$|E

First, both ICI and TARSU show a moderate regressive impact with respect to household <b>disposable</b> <b>gross</b> <b>income,</b> while PIT on dwellings other than the main residence is progressive. Second, all households owning the main residence gain from the 2008 housing taxation reform, but tax cuts are mostly concentrated on the last three deciles of household equivalent <b>disposable</b> <b>gross</b> <b>income,</b> so that the richest benefited most. Finally, by including imputed rent from owner-occupied dwellings as a component of the personal income tax base, we find that overall inequality is reducing; broadening the personal income tax base could lead to a consistent reduction of tax rates...|$|R
30|$|The {{extent to}} which {{automatic}} stabilizers mitigate the impact of income shocks on household demand essentially depends on two factors. Firstly, the tax and transfer system determines {{the way in which}} a given shock to <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> translates into a change in <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> For instance, {{in the presence of a}} proportional income tax with a tax rate of 40 %, a shock on <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> of one hundred Euros leads to a decline in <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of 60 Euros. In this case, the tax absorbs 40 % of the shock to <b>gross</b> <b>income.</b> A progressive tax, in turn, would have a stronger stabilizing effect. The second factor is the link between current <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and current demand for goods and services. If the income shock is perceived as transitory and current demand depends on some concept of permanent income, and if households can borrow or use accumulated savings, their demand will not change. In this case, the impact of automatic stabilizers on current demand would be equal to zero. Things are different, though, if households were liquidity constrained. In this case, their current expenditures do depend on <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> so that automatic stabilizers play a role. However, in this paper, we will concentrate on the first factor, the stabilization of <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> aftershocks on <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> (see Dolls et al. 2012 for the stabilization of household demand).|$|R

This analysis, produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), examines how taxes and benefits redistribute income between various groups of households in the United Kingdom. It shows where different types of households and individuals are in the income distribution {{and looks at the}} changing levels of income inequality over time. The Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) {{is the source of the}} microdata on households from 2008 - 09 onwards. Previously, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS) was the data source. Derived variables are created using information from LCF/EFS and control totals from a variety of different government sources including the United Kingdom National Accounts (ONS Blue Book), HM Revenue and Customs, Department for Transport, Department of Health, Department for Education and Employment, and Department for Communities and Local Government. Main Topics : The analysis considers the distribution of household income using five income measures in order to assess the effect of government intervention. The five income measures are: original income: includes income from employment, private pensions, investment income and income from other non-government sources <b>gross</b> income: original <b>income</b> plus cash benefits <b>disposable</b> income: <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> minus direct taxes (income tax, employees' National Insurance contributions and local taxes) post-tax income: <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> minus indirect taxes final income: post-tax income plus benefits in kind (from education, the National Health Service (NHS), travel and housing subsidies) Standard Measures: Households are ranked by equivalised <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> using the McClements equivalence scale (see methodology notes in the documentation for further details) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the evidence {{on the distribution of}} income in the Netherlands by constructing decile and quintile income shares for gross- and for <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> covering almost the entire twentieth century. It suggests some interpretations of the general trends, while the cyclical properties of the Dutch income distribution are empirically investigated through time-series analysis. It shows that income inequality experienced a marked decrease over the period 1914 – 1975, but remained stable ever since. Since the observed dynamics are notably different between <b>gross</b> and <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> taxation and redistribution played an influential role in determining the income distribution. More unemployment is associated with more <b>income</b> inequality in <b>gross</b> <b>income,</b> but this association vanishes when the distribution of <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> is concerned. Actual inflation does not have a strong effect on the size distribution of <b>gross</b> or <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> but speculation that a transitory increase in inflation reduces the income inequality seems justified (cyclical economic prosperity being pro-poor). On the other hand, regression on moving averages of unemployment and inflation showed that longer periods of high inflation and high unemployment increase the income inequality. ...|$|R
