5000|$|In 2008-2009, Icade still owned some 35,000 housing units, {{of which}} almost 2,000 were still state-subsidised, 15,000 {{had once been}} subsidised and almost 20,000 had never been subsidised4. The French finance market {{authority}} (AMF) valued these properties at 1.426 billion euros in 2006. On 12 December 2008, Icade announced its intention to sell all its residential property assets, including its social housing: in all, over 30,000 housing units. A group comprising some twenty social housing trusts and led by the Société Nationale Immobilière (SNI), a subsidiary of Caisse des Dépôts, applied to buy these housing units. The sale of these social housing units10, criticised by some because it required social housing organisations to pay [...] "again" [...] for buildings {{that had already been}} built using [...] "public money", enabled Icade to pay its shareholders an <b>exceptional</b> <b>dividend</b> of 206 million euros in 2011, a total of 4 euros per share11.|$|E
40|$|Pakistan's {{rebound from}} the global {{financial}} crisis has been slow and fragile, and unless it changes course swiftly, it could face the prospects of a second balance of payments crisis {{in less than five}} years. Its recovery from the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis has been the weakest in South Asia, featuring a unique double-dip growth pattern. With high fertility, Pakistan will double the size of its already young population by 2025. The only way to convert this massive demographic bulge from a political and social burden to an <b>exceptional</b> <b>dividend</b> is through rapid and inclusive growth that creates millions of new and better jobs. In sum, the two main challenges are improving the types of jobs available and enabling people to move into those more productive activities. The binding constraints to Pakistan's growth are both emerging and structural. Emerging constraints include massive cuts in electricity access and macroeconomic instability, leading to high country risk and a sudden stop in external and domestic financing. Structural constraints include low access to domestic finance and government and market failures (micro risks) that impede investment, entrepreneurial activity, and competitiveness, blocking the transition from low-productivity to high-productivity jobs. Pakistan is at a turning point. It could stick to a status quo of piecemeal reforms leading to partial and unsatisfactory outcomes, which at best would lead it to recover its modest historic growth rate of 4 - 4. 5 percent, or it could aim for a bold reform agenda supporting rapid growth (on or above 7 percent) and job creation. Both options are possible, but the former would make it very difficult for Pakistan to meet the aspirations of its people, and especially of its youth...|$|E
