5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement <b>factor</b> <b>H,</b> which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E

25|$|In healthy individuals, {{complement}} is used {{to attack}} foreign substances, and the complement system is highly regulated {{to prevent it from}} damaging healthy tissues and organs. However, in most patients with aHUS, it has been demonstrated that chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement can result from production of anti-factor H autoantibodies or from genetic mutations in any of several complement regulatory proteins (e.g., <b>factor</b> <b>H,</b> factor HR1 or HR3, membrane cofactor protein, factor I, factor B, complement C3, and thrombomodulin). This results in platelet activation, damage to endothelial cells (cells that line the blood vessels), and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), damage to multiple organs, and often, death.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} pathway is continuously activated {{at a low}} level, analogous to a car engine at idle, {{as a result of}} spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond (C3 is mildly unstable in aqueous environment). The {{alternative pathway}} does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways. C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by <b>factor</b> <b>H</b> and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (<b>factor</b> <b>H,</b> factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E

40|$|Incubation of {{encapsulated}} and nonencapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans {{in normal}} human serum (NHS) leads to activation and binding of potentially opsonic fragments of complement component C 3 to the yeast cells. Analysis of the molecular forms of C 3 after incubation of encapsulated cryptococci in NHS {{showed that the}} percentage of bound C 3 occurring as iC 3 b approached 100 % after 8 min. The percentage of bound C 3 occurring as iC 3 b on nonencapsulated cryptococci never exceeded 70 %, even after 60 min of incubation in NHS. Conversion of C 3 b to iC 3 b was assessed further by incubating C 3 b-coated cryptococci for various times with a mixture of complement <b>factors</b> <b>H</b> and I at 40 % of their respective physiological concentrations. Most, if not all, of the C 3 b on encapsulated cryptococci was converted to iC 3 b at a single fast rate. Conversion of C 3 b to iC 3 b on nonencapsulated cryptococci did not follow a single rate constant and appeared to have a fast and a slow component. Studies of the requirements for <b>factors</b> <b>H</b> and I in cleavage of C 3 b to iC 3 b showed steep dose-response curves for both factors in the case of encapsulated cryptococci and shallow curves with C 3 b bound to nonencapsulated cryptococci. Taken together, our results indicate that C 3 b molecules bound to encapsulated cryptococci have a uniformly high susceptibility to conversion to iC 3 b by <b>factors</b> <b>H</b> and I. In contrast, {{a significant portion of the}} C 3 b bound to nonencapsulated cryptococci is very resistant to conversion to iC 3 b by <b>factors</b> <b>H</b> and I...|$|R

2500|$|Instead, {{electrons}} are dislodged {{only by the}} impingement of photons {{when those}} photons reach or exceed a threshold frequency (energy). Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted from the material regardless of the light intensity or {{the length of time}} of exposure to the light (rarely, an electron will escape by absorbing two or more quanta. However, this is extremely rare because by the time it absorbs enough quanta to escape, the electron will probably have emitted the rest of the quanta.). To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy hν.

50|$|Due to {{the central}} role that <b>factor</b> <b>H</b> plays in the {{regulation}} of complement, {{there are a number}} of clinical implications arising from aberrant <b>factor</b> <b>H</b> activity.

Underactive <b>factor</b> <b>H</b> may result in increased complement activity on healthy host cells - resulting in autoimmune diseases.

50|$|Given {{the central}} role of <b>factor</b> <b>H</b> in {{protecting}} cells from complement, {{it is not surprising that}} several important human pathogens have evolved mechanisms for recruiting <b>factor</b> <b>H.</b> This recruitment of <b>factor</b> <b>H</b> by pathogens provides significant resistance to complement attack, and therefore increased virulence.

40|$|Blood of {{patients}} with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) 1 contains variable amounts of abnormal erythrocytes that are unusually sensitive to the hemolytic action of complement (1, 2). Lysis of these cells is mediated by the alternative pathway and is enhanced in serum of reduced pH (3 - 6). The {{results of this study}} suggest that the increased susceptibility of PNH erythrocytes to lysis by complement is due to a deficiency in membrane-associated, Factor H-like regulatory activity. Initiation of the alternative pathway is a spontaneous process (7, 8), resulting in the random deposition of C 3 b on cell surfaces (9, 10). C 3 b bound to activators of the alternative pathway such as certain bacteria, fungi, viruses, and virus-infected cells, is relatively resistant to inactivation by the control proteins <b>Factors</b> <b>H</b> and I.
