The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were left on the cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water pipes and easing of the tax burden on the residents of Ani.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence.

It should <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus is {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} was reassigned from Hazen's Brigade to the Middle Department on December 6, 1781. On this date, {{a portion}} of the regiment went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where they guarded prisoners taken at Yorktown. They were on this detail for 10 months with prisoners under guard at Lancaster, York and Reading. The most notable prisoner under Hazen's watch during this time was 20-year-old Captain Charles Asgill. On May 3, 1782, upon orders by Washington, he was selected to <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> retaliation for the brutal summary execution of American Captain Joshua Huddy by the British. In November 1782 his life was spared after heartrending correspondence by his family and intervention by the Queen of France.|$|E
5|$|The second floor, {{reserved}} as {{the chamber}} for the Senate, was more ornate and adorned with heavy red drapes. By 1796, the room featured 32 secretary desks {{very similar to}} the desks that are still used in the current Senate chamber in the United States Capitol; 28 of the desks at Congress Hall are original. Portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, presented as gifts from the French monarch following the American Revolution, <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> adjoining committee rooms. A fresco of an American bald eagle is painted on the ceiling, holding the traditional olive branch to symbolize peace. Also on the ceiling, a plaster medallion {{in the form of a}} sunburst features 13 stars to represent the original colonies. The design mirrors a similar pattern on the floor, where a carpet made by William Sprague, a local weaver, features the shields of each of the 13 original states. The carpet seen today is a reproduction of the original.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{has had a}} long {{association}} with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uzès. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to Nîmes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the king's new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.|$|E
25|$|Fallen Monarchs, {{considered}} to be Baker's masterpiece, was painted in the Ballston Lake area.

5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have one baby per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their eyes closed and will <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the nursery while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a nipple constantly until they are two weeks old. At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized. Females may be sexually mature in the fall after their birth, but males may take a year longer. About half of females and most males breed during their first autumn.|$|E
