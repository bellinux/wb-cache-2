40|$|Myanmar {{has been}} {{experiencing}} natural teak forest degradation, consequent affect of over-exploitation of teak above the prescribed cut limit, and challenging of restoring its degraded forests. The un-sustainable way of teak production {{from the natural}} forests of Myanmar is the main driving factor {{to point out the}} currently applied Brandis yield model for Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) of teak and to propose an alternative model for the yield regulation of teak. This study was composed of five chapters: introduction, study site and data set, preliminary analysis of teak conditions in natural forests, developing alternative approach for yield regulation, discussion and conclusion. Under the system of Myanma Selection System (MSS), it was believed that the future consistent supply of teak would be ensured by following AAC with the prescribed <b>girth</b> <b>limit</b> for exploitable teak trees and felling cycle of thirty-year. Through the preliminary analysis on existing yield model, this study addressed that no forest stands had been harvested in accordance with AAC. Decreasing <b>girth</b> <b>limit</b> and shortening felling cycles were observed in the selected research site. In fact, this yield regulation model was developed over centuries for the sustainable teak productivity of the virgin natural forests which were almost untouched by disturbances. The author also examined disturbance finding in each girth class of teak stock. The loss of younger stems of teak between two felling cycles was suggested mainly due to illegal logging by local people staying near the forest sites. To resolve the drawbacks of existing yield model, the new model was developed by considering the utility of maturities as an index in the sustainable management of natural teak in stand levels. The concept of the maturity is to check whether the trees in each girth class moved to next higher class over years and if moved, the maturity was considered increase. As long as we found the maturity increase across the girth classes, that stand could be considered as stable and chosen for harvest. While Brandis’ method was applicable only for the forests with the excess amount of mature trees, the new one would be feasible to apply in the current situation of natural forests which has been facing the problems of degradation and over-exploitation of timber in Myanmar. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 04 - 13; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3846 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学系研究科森林科学専...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the effects, 40 y later, of silvicultural interventions on forest structure, stand productivity and composition {{and diversity of}} species in Bobiri Forest Reserve in Ghana. Data were gathered from stands treated under three silvicultural systems: the Tropical Shelterwood System (TSS), the Post-exploitation System (PES) and the <b>Girth</b> <b>Limit</b> Selection System with post-harvest refinement (GLS), along with comparative data from unlogged (UNL) forest. Forty years later, the treated stands were structurally similar 40 to unlogged forest, although stem densities {{were higher in the}} former relative to the latter. Six dominant families of species were common to both treated and unlogged forest. Species richness and diversity were higher in PES, GLS and UNL forest relative to TSS forest. In contrast to unlogged forest where shade tolerant species were dominant, non-pioneer light-demanders were dominant in the treated stands. Liana densities were similar in the different types of treated forest but higher in unlogged forest. The numbers of commercial species were not different between treated and unlogged forest, although whereas > 50 % of species in TSS forest were commercial, > 50 % of species in PES, GLS and UNL forest were non-commercial species.  Additionally, the densities of commercial stems were about twice higher in TSS and PES relative to unlogged forest. Total standing volumes of crop trees DBH> 30 cm in GLS (~ 349 m 3 ha - 1) and TSS (308 m 3 ha - 1) were comparable to ~ 251 m 3 ha - 1 in unlogged forest but higher relative to ~ 242 m 3 ha - 1 in PES. The desirable commercial species contributed > 50 % of total standing volume of crop trees in TSS and PES forest but < 40 % in GLS and unlogged forest. Also, there was better representation of good quality commercial stems in treated forest relative to unlogged forest. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Following a very sudden, {{early and}} deep frost {{at the end}} of autumn 1998, the {{availability}} of weakened trees (mainly beech trees) reached very high levels in Southern Belgium in the spring of 1999. Consequently, the ambrosia beetles Trypodendron domesticum L. and T. signatum (Fabricius) (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) initiated outbreaks and, in 2000 and 2001, they heavily contributed to the depreciation of nearly 1, 600, 000 m 3 of stem volume (to upper <b>limit</b> <b>girth</b> of 22 cm) in the natural regions of “Ardenne” and “Belgian Lorraine”. Because of the lack of biogeographical data on both insects, of their conspicuous aggressiveness towards apparently healthy trees and of the economic importance of the beech wood chain in Belgium, a large-scale survey was undertaken in 2001, in order to outline the range of both ambrosia beetles in Wallonia. To this effect, a network of 172 traps baited with ethanol was set up, attempting to cover the Walloon beech forest as representatively as possible. Two other scolytids and one lymexylonid were also frequently caught, which made it possible to outline their regional distribution too. Although the damage was limited to the Ardenne and Belgian Lorraine, T. domesticum and T. signatum are widespread throughout Wallonia. We discuss these results, their long-term validity, the secondary pest status of these insects and the need for a permanent monitoring of the major forest pest species and diseases.

40|$|Paper {{is devoted}} to studies of {{linguistic}} dynamic system of dimen-sion n ≥ 2 over arbitrary commutative ring K, i. e. family F of nonlin-ear polynomial maps fα: Kn → Kn depending on ”time ” α ∈ {K− 0 } such that fα− 1 = f−α and fα 1 (x) = fα 2 (x) for some x ∈ Kn implies α 1 = α 2, each map fα has no invariant points. The neighbourhood {fα(v) |α ∈ K − { 0 }} of element v defines the graph Γ(F) of a dynamical system on the vertex set Kn. We shall refer to F as linguistic dynamical system of rank d ≥ 1 if for each string a = (α 1, [...] ., αs), s ≤ d, where αi + αi+ 1, is not a zero divisor for i = 1, [...] . d − 1, vertices v and va = fα 1 × [...] . × fαs(v) in the graph are connected by a unique pass. For each commutative ringK and even integer number n 6 = 0 mod 3 there is family of linguistic dynamical system Ln(K) of rank d ≥ 1 / 3 n. Let L(n,K) be the graph of a dynamical system Ln(q). If K = Fq graphs L(n, Fq) form a new family of graphs of large <b>girth.</b> The projective <b>limit</b> L(K) of L(n,K), n→ ∞ is well defined for each commutative ring K, in case of integral domain K graph L(K) is a forest, if K has zero divisors the girth of K is dropping to 4. We introduce some other families of graphs of large girth related to the dynamical systems Ln(q) in case of even. The dynamical systems and related graphs {{can be used for}} the development of symmetric or asymmetric cryptographical algorithms. These graphs allow us to es-tablish the best known upper bounds on the minimal order of regular graphs without cycles of length 4 n, n is odd ≥ 3. 1 Key Words: Infinite groups acting on graphs, dynamical systems, graph...|$|R
