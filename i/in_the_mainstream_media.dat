25|$|The Skeptical Environmentalist was {{controversial}} {{even before}} its English-language release, with anti-publication efforts launched against Cambridge University Press.

25|$|The first {{extensive}} {{scientific study}} of OBEs was made by Celia Green (1968).

25|$|Concern about {{possible}} carcinogenic properties of aspartame was originally raised and popularized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> by John Olney in the 1970s {{and again in}} 1996 by suggesting that aspartame {{may be related to}} brain tumors. Reviews have found that these concerns were flawed, due to reliance on the ecological fallacy and the purported mechanism of causing tumors being unlikely to actually cause cancer. Independent agencies such as the FDA and National Cancer Institute have reanalyzed multiple studies based on these worries and found no association between aspartame and brain cancer.|$|E
25|$|Manson is {{best known}} for his band's records {{released}} in the 1990s, most notably Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals, which, along with his public image, earned him a reputation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> as a controversial figure and a negative influence on young people. In the U.S. alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum status and three more went gold, and the band has had eight releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Manson has been ranked number 44 in the Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader, and has been nominated for four Grammy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP zealously {{embraced the}} use of {{alternative}} media to promote itself in a way different from the negative portrayal that featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media.</b> On its website—which had been established in 1995—it created an internet television channel, 'BNPtv'. It has created blogs that cover different themes without being explicitly political {{in order to promote}} the party's message. The BNP established an online marketing platform, Excalibur, through which to sell its merchandise. In 2003, the BNP claimed that it had the most viewed website of a political party in Britain, and by 2011 was claiming to have the most viewed such website in Europe. In September 2007, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that Hitwise, the online competitive intelligence service, said that the BNP website had more hits than any other website of a British political party.|$|E

25|$|Sherine first {{proposed}} {{the campaign in}} June 2008 in a guardian.co.uk Comment is Free blog post, Atheists – gimme five in the Guardian. She expressed her frustration that the Christian organisation JesusSaid.org was allowed to use bus advertising to promote the web address of a website that said that all non-Christians would burn in hell for all eternity. Sherine called on atheists to counter this kind of evangelical advertising by donating five pounds towards a positive philosophical advert. Her idea was taken up by political blogger Jon Worth, {{who went on to}} set up a PledgeBank page. The PledgeBank page closed on 31 July 2008, having received 877 of the 4,679 pledges necessary for the original target of £23,400. This event attracted some limited comment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> early in August. Sherine then wrote a follow-up Comment is free article, Dawkin 'bout a Revolution, detailing events since the original piece. In response, the British Humanist Association offered to lend the campaign its official support and undertook to administer all donations. Sherine then asked Richard Dawkins for a quote for the campaign, at which point he offered to match the first £5,500 raised.|$|E

500|$|When [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was released, {{many writers}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> were still debating the {{longevity}} and {{overall quality of}} South Park. With the series still in its earliest stages, the episode continued to shock many with its frequent use of profanities by children and the apparent instability of school teacher Mr. Garrison. Audiences were especially shocked by the violence depicted among children during a South Park history play, which included the use of guns and portrayed the bloody slaughter of Native Americans {{at the hands of}} white settlers. Audiences were also shocked and offended by Chef's sexually suggestive song about Gifford. Nevertheless, several reviewers declared [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] a significant improvement over the pilot, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", and felt it went in a much more satirical direction.|$|E
500|$|Reception of Knight's idea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> {{has been}} mixed.

Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in The Independent, noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive. At The Guardians website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as [...] "in many ways laudable", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of enculturation.|$|E

Attempting to reduce London Underground fares, his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and underprivileged minorities, despite stiff opposition. Livingstone was heavily criticised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>media</b> for supporting controversial issues like republicanism, LGBT rights, and a United Ireland, and given the moniker [...] "Red Ken". Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which in 1986 abolished the GLC. Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987, he became closely associated with anti-racist campaigns.
