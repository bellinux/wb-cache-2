50|$|Diffusion flames can be laminar {{diffusion}} flames (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and turbulent diffusion flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the <b>discharging</b> <b>velocity</b> of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the flame shapes. With increase in <b>discharging</b> <b>velocity</b> of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.|$|R

Jet opening ratios equal to 10 and 20 are considered, with air <b>discharge</b> <b>velocities</b> ranging from I to 10 m/s. The facility and the experimental approach used in this work are described and justified in many details. Results are presented in terms of leakage flow rates.

The global efficiency of an air curtain is greatly improved by the adjunction of an air recirculation circuit due to enhanced system stability. A critical jet exit velocity corresponding to transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime of the channel flow inside the air curtain diffuser was found. For <b>discharge</b> <b>velocities</b> larger than this critical velocity an asymptotic behaviour is observed for every air curtain tested. At the lower nozzle exit velocities, the non-recirculated twin-jet system exhibits a weird behaviour.

In this work, we have compared the discharge structures and the axial propagation velocities of discharges. First, we have studied a needle-to-plane configuration without tube. For applied voltages in the range 7 − 18 kV, we have observed in experiments and in simulations that a plasma ball starts to develop around the needle tip. Then, for applied voltages less than 14 kV, in experiments, the discharge rapidly splits into several streamer channels with a main axial streamer. In simulations, we have computed only the main axial discharge. For applied voltages higher than 14 kV, in experiments and in simulations, we have observed that the discharge propagates with a cone shape in the gap. For all studied voltages, a good experiment/modeling agreement is obtained on the axial propagation velocity of the discharge, which increases with the applied voltage. Then, we have studied the propagation of discharges inside capillary tubes with radii in the range 37. 5 − 300 µm. In experiments and simulations, we have observed that for small tube radius, the discharge front is quite homogeneous inside the tube and becomes tubular when the tube radius increases.

Two estimates from radar-altimeter measurements of elevation change by European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS) (+ 28 and - 31 Gt/year) lie in the upper part, whereas estimates from the Input-minus-Output Method (IOM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) lie in the lower part (- 40 to - 246 Gt/year). We compare the various estimates, discuss the methodology used, and critically assess the results. Although recent reports of large and accelerating rates of mass loss from GRACE=based studies cite agreement with IOM results, our evaluation does not support that conclusion. We find that the extrapolation used in the published IOM {{estimates for the}} 15 % of the periphery for which <b>discharge</b> <b>velocities</b> are not observed gives {{twice the rate of}} discharge per unit of associated ice-sheet area than the 85 % faster-moving parts. Our calculations show that the published extrapolation overestimates the ice discharge by 282 Gt/yr compared to our assumption that the slower moving areas have 70 % as much discharge per area as the faster moving parts. Also, published data on the time-series of <b>discharge</b> <b>velocities</b> and accumulation/precipitation do not support mass output increases or input decreases with time, respectively. Our modified IOM estimate, using the 70 % discharge assumption and substituting input from a field-data compilation for input from an atmospheric model over 6 % of area, gives a loss of only 13 Gt/year (versus 136 Gt/year) for the period around 2000. Two ERS-based estimates, our modified IOM, and a GRACE-based estimate for observations within 1992 to 2005 lie in a narrowed range of + 27 to - 40 Gt/year, which is about 3 % of the annual mass input and only 0. 2 mm/year SLE. Our preferred estimate for 1992 - 2001 is - 47 Gt/year for West Antarctica, + 16 Gt/year for East Antarctica, and - 31 Gt/year overall (+ 0. 1 mm/year SLE), not including part of the Antarctic Peninsula (1. 07 % of the AIS area...|$|R
