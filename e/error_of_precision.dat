40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [61108019]Based on {{the study}} of laser diode self-mixing {{interference}} effects, a simple and effective method that can improve fringe precision is presented. By employing an external reflecting mirror, theoretical and experimental results show an assured increase about two or three times in the resolution of the displacement measurement, which means a fringe shift is corresponding to a near 1 / 6 wavelength displacement of the target. At a small angle range, when the fringe precision is not fixed, this method can still have a relative high precision and a large measurement range. The maximum measurable displacement and <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>precision</b> are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realize {{adaptive}} compensation for positioning <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>precision</b> measurement platform, a new method {{has been proposed}} based on monitoring measurement environment and support vector regression for ensuring the high-precision of measurement platform used for optical element in different measurement environment. Firstly, a prediction model was established with the theory of support vector regression (SVR), using several group data of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure in different environment for predicting the maximum positioning error value. Then SVR was used iteratively to predict the positioning error value of any position, using both maximum positioning error value and environmental factors. Finally, the positioning error was input to the controller for compensation. Instruments including Renishaw laser interferometer along with temperature and humidity sensors were applied to experiments with the precision measurement platform. Experimental results indicate that, comparing the prediction data with the measured data, {{the average of the}} absolute difference is 0. 88 μm, and the Pearson's square of correlation coefficient is 0. 99. After adaptive compensation, the average of positioning error decreases to 1. 4 μm from 43 μm. It concludes that this method is feasible and accurate...|$|E

40|$|Traditional bath {{recirculation}} cooler for {{precision machine}} tools always has the uniform and open-loop cooling strategy onto different heat generating parts.

Specially, in order to illustrate the advantages of this system, constant supply cooling powers strategy is presented with its applications onto {{a certain type of}} built-in motorized spindle. Consequently, advantages of the proposed strategy based on the differentiated multi-loops bath recirculation system are verified experimentally in the environment within consistent temperature (TR = 20 ± 0. 3 °C). Compared with room temperature tracing strategy based on the traditional bath recirculation cooler, the constant supply cooling powers strategy is verified to be advantageous in spindle temperature stabilization and thermal errors decrease. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{sought to}} explore the {{interaction}} of the impulsivity trait with response uncertainty. To this end, we used a reaching task (Pellizzer and Hedges in Exp Brain Res 150 : 276 - 289, 2003) where a motor response direction was cued at different levels of uncertainty (1 cue, i. e., no uncertainty, 2 cues or 3 cues). Data from 95 healthy adults (54 F, 41  M) were analysed. Impulsivity was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version 11 (BIS- 11). Behavioral variables recorded were reaction time (RT), <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> commission (referred to as 'early errors') and <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>precision.</b> Data analysis employed generalised linear mixed models and generalised additive mixed models. For the early errors, there was an interaction of impulsivity with uncertainty and gender, with increased errors for high impulsivity in the one-cue condition for women and the three-cue condition for men. There was no effect <b>of</b> impulsivity on <b>precision</b> <b>errors</b> or RT. However, the analysis of the effect of RT and impulsivity on precision errors showed a different pattern for high versus low impulsives in the high uncertainty (3 cue) condition. In addition, there was a significant early error speed-accuracy trade-off for women, primarily in low uncertainty and a 'reverse' speed-accuracy trade-off for men in high uncertainty. These results extend those of past studies of impulsivity which help define it as a behavioural trait that modulates speed versus accuracy response styles depending on environmental constraints and highlight once more the importance of gender in the interplay of personality and behaviour...|$|R

The real movements are along the x, y, and z-axis directions, respectively; it will back to the diagonal line for one complete cycle motion. In each step movement, the spindle is stopped and the laser tracker detects the coordinates of the three caves by putting the target sensor ball into caves sequentially.

40|$|Abstract. Proving partial {{correctness}} of floating point programs {{is a hard}} verification problem. This is in part because <b>error</b> analysis <b>of</b> finite <b>precision</b> computation is difficult and {{in part due to}} the high complexity of the generated verification conditions. Typical verification conditions that arise in this context are predicates with real inequalities as atoms and therefore numerical constraint solvers seem a natural choice for the automation of such proofs. Freely available numerical constraint solvers are typically based on inter-val arithmetic due to existence of mature interval algorithms and rela-tively low computational cost. However, the pathological loss <b>of</b> <b>precision</b> that such arithmetic incurs may limit the applicability of interval based solvers for the type of first order numerical constraints that result from floating point verification problems. We propose to use function enclosures as the numerical type to base a dedicated solver on.
