5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} come <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> {{a lot of}} people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book <b>Face</b> <b>to</b> <b>Face</b> <b>with</b> Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E

5|$|Part of Guderian's {{original}} plan {{had called for}} a feint south towards and behind the Maginot Line, to mask the intention to thrust to the channel. General Franz Halder had dropped this from Fall Gelb, but Guderian resurrected it and ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to attack across the Stonne plateau. In this innocuous town, a vicious two-day battle took place in which the Germans came <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, for the only time. One of these tanks, commanded by Pierre Billotte, proved invulnerable to German anti-tank fire and took 140 hits, and knocked out 13 German tanks (two PzKpfw IV and eleven PzKpfw III) {{and a number of}} anti-tank guns. It transpired that the French had concentrated their own armour there to mount another attack on the Sedan bridgeheads. The battle of Stonne took place between 15 and 17 May, and the town changed hands 17 times. Ultimately the failure of the French to hold it meant the final failure to eliminate the Sedan bridgeheads.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On {{his return to the}} city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as they}} {{received}} the news, Rana Bahadur and his group proceeded towards Kathmandu. Some troops were sent by Kathmandu Durbar to check their progress, but the troops changed their allegiance when they came <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the ex-King. Damodar Pande and his men were arrested at Thankot where they were waiting to greet the ex-King with state honors and take him into isolation. After Rana Bahadur's reinstatement to power, he started to extract vengeance on those {{who had tried to}} keep him in exile. He exiled Rajrajeshhwori to Helambu, where she became a Buddhist nun, on the charge of siding with Damodar Pande and colluding with the British. Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, were executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Rana Bahadur also punished those who did not help him while in exile. Among them was Prithvipal Sen, the king of Palpa, who was tricked into imprisonment, while his kingdom forcefully annexed. Subarnaprabha and her supporters were released and given a general pardon. Those who had helped Rana Bahadur to return to Kathmandu were lavished with rank, land, and wealth. Bhimsen Thapa was made a second kaji; Ranajit Pande, who was the father-in-law of Bhimsen's brother, was made the mul kaji; Sher Bahadur Shah, Rana Bahadur's half-brother, was made the mul chautariya; while Rangnath Paudel was made the raj guru (royal spiritual preceptor).|$|E
50|$|Children who do {{not have}} Autism learn to relate the body {{movements}} that they see with the emotions and mental states of others when they have <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> interactions <b>with</b> other children. Having <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> interactions <b>with</b> other people, helps children increase their knowledge of what these body movements represent. After seeing these representations being used multiple times, children are then able to make inferences about the representations and the people making them. This means that the children {{will be able to make}} an assumption about a person that they interact with in the future since they already understand what the body movements and or body language represents.|$|R

5|$|Lexie takes {{part in a}} {{surgery on}} a patient named Alison Clark (Caroline Williams) and informs her husband Gary Clark (Michael O'Neill) {{that it was a}} success. However, moments later Alison suffers a stroke and falls into a coma that she is deemed {{unlikely}} to wake from. As Alison had signed a DNR form, Lexie is forced to turn off the machine keeping her alive, despite Gary begging her to stop. After failing in an attempt to sue the hospital, a grief-stricken Mr. Clark later returns to the hospital with a gun, seeking revenge on Lexie, Derek and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). After witnessing Mr. Clark shoot a nurse dead, Mark shields Lexie during the shooting and the pair attempt to save a critically wounded Alex. Seeking supplies, Lexie heads out into the hospital and comes <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> Mr Clark who attempts to shoot her, but she is saved by a SWAT team member who wounds Clark at the last moment allowing her to escape. Lexie and Mark proceed to save Alex's life, but Lexie is disappointed and irritated when a delirious Alex calls for his ex-wife, Izzie, while nearly dying instead of Lexie. After a showdown with Richard, Gary Clark eventually commits suicide, having killed eleven people and wounding another seven, as well as causing Meredith to suffer a miscarriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
