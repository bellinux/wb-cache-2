25|$|The {{economic}} losses affected everyone. Banks {{and insurance companies}} were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure {{was about the same}} whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a <b>depleted</b> <b>stock</b> of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock.

50|$|Thomas Taro Higa (September 22, 1916 - February 11, 1985) was {{a wartime}} hero {{both in the}} United States and Okinawa. Serving with the U.S. Army's 100th Battalion, Higa was {{critically}} wounded during heavy fire in Italy. Though shot in the back, he managed to carry two fellow soldiers to safety, thus earning him a Purple Heart and Silver Star. After being wounded, the military used Higa's charm and dedication to his country {{to help in the}} recruitment efforts. Higa stood center stage at relocation camps speaking out to Japanese-Americans, helping to gain awareness and support. Then, because of his tri-lingual (Japanese, Okinawan, & English) capabilities, he was asked to convince Okinawans hiding in caves to come out and surrender to safety before the caves were blown, thus sparing their lives. Higa risked his own life entering these caves unarmed, but in the end, saved several villages. After the war, Higa helped with efforts to rebuild Okinawa, sending pigs donated from Hawaii to replenish their <b>depleted</b> <b>stock.</b> In 1983, Higa was honored by the Okinawan government for his efforts during and after the war. In 2015, NHK produced the docudrama Nikkeijin Who Saved Okinawa (okinawa wo sukutta nikkeijin) in Higa's honor.|$|E

40|$|Distribution {{patterns}} of catchability were evaluated {{for the red}} grouper Epinephelus morio (Serranidae) on the Campeche Bank off the northern Yucatan coast of Mexico. Catchabilityat-length values were estimated with a method based on a transition matrix. Five years of catch and effort data for the Mexican mid-fleet {{were used for the}} estimation procedure. Two main patterns were found within the bank. The first occurred in the deepest areas and {{in the eastern part of}} the bank, where catchability increased with size. The second was close to the coasts, where lower values of catchability were observed, even in large sizes. These results suggest that the main area of aggregation for reproduction with higher values of catchability is in the eastern part of the bank (22 – 23 °N, 87 – 88 °W). Catchability differences suggest that spatial managementpolicies must be implemented to allow <b>depleted</b> <b>stock</b> to recove...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) have {{attracted much attention}} {{as a tool for}} sustainable fisheries management, restoring <b>depleted</b> fisheries <b>stocks</b> and maintaining ecosystems. However, even with total exclusion of fishing effort, <b>depleted</b> <b>stocks</b> sometimes show little or no recovery over a long time period. Here, using a mathematical model, we show that multiple stable states may hold the key to understanding the tendency for fisheries stocks to recover because of MPAs. We find that MPAs can have either a positive effect or almost no effect on the recovery of <b>depleted</b> fishing <b>stocks,</b> depending on the fish migration patterns and the fishing policies. MPAs also reinforce ecological resilience, particularly for migratory species. In contrast to previous reports, our results show that MPAs have small or sometimes negative effects on the recovery of sedentary species. Unsuitable MPA planning might result in low effectiveness or even deterioration of the existing condition. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} form {{a valuable}} {{source of income}} for the poor fisherfolk along Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay areas of South-east-coast of India. Owing to the high demand in international market and inadequate fishery management practice, the commercial sea cucumber species have been over-exploited leading to the extinction of sea cucumber populations in several habitats. The "Convention on International Trade in Endangered species of Wild Fauna and Flora" (CITES) has recommended inclusion of sea cucumbers in the list of endangered animals and cited the reasons as limited mobility, late sexual maturity, density depended reproduction, low rates of recruitment and ease of collections for their overexploitation and subsequent resource depletion. The releasing of hatchery produced juveniles of commercial sea cucumber species to their natural habitat, a process called restoration, restocking or reseeding is gaining momentum world wide, as the only way for replenishing the <b>depleted</b> <b>stock</b> of sea cucumbers...|$|E
40|$|Cod (Gadus morhua) are preyed upon by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) {{and there}} is debate over the impact this has had on the decline of stocks and their {{prospects}} for recovery. We analysed a <b>depleted</b> <b>stock</b> to the West of Scotland and show that seal predation rate {{is consistent with a}} type II functional response. Forward projections of a model including the functional response under varying levels of fishing and seal population size suggest that stock recovery is possible under current conditions but there is a modest probability that the stock will decline further in both the short and long term. The potential recovery is fragile and sensitive to relatively small increases in either fishing or seal predation. Forward projection models that exclude the functional response estimate a lower probability of stock decline and may underestimate the risk to the stock. At low stock sizes and high fishing mortality rates functional response models project slower recovery but the opposite is true at low fishing mortality...|$|E
40|$|The {{green sea}} turtle {{is one of the}} {{long-lived}} species that comprise the charismatic marine megafauna. The green turtle {{has a long history of}} human exploitation with some stocks extinct. Here we report on a 30 -year study of the nesting abundance of the green turtle stock endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. We show that there has been a substantial long-term increase in abundance of this once seriously <b>depleted</b> <b>stock</b> following cessation of harvesting since the 1970 s. This population increase has occurred in a far shorter period of time than previously thought possible. There was also a distinct 3 - 4 year periodicity in annual nesting abundance that might be a function of regional environmental stochasticity that synchronises breeding behaviour throughout the Archipelago. This is one of the few reliable long-term population abundance time series for a large long-lived marine species, which are needed for gaining insights into the recovery process of long-lived marine species and long-term ecological processes.
