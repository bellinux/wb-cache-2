5000|$|The {{glass master}} is rotated in the {{electroforming}} tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution {{over the surface}} of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not electroconductive. Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, premaster mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodepostion directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition (invented by Luigi Brugnatelli and often credited to another Luigi - Sr. Galvani). The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane to electroforming) This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to ±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high tolerances of gassing rings and centre clamps. This thickness control requires <b>electronic</b> <b>current</b> control and baffles in the solution to control distribution ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceQuantum <b>electronic</b> <b>currents</b> can be {{determined}} directly from off-diagonals of the one electron reduced density matrix. Behaviour of the density matrix in a natural orbital expansion is well understood, whereas very {{little is known about}} the current density expressed in any orbital basis. Given the relationship of the current to the density matrix, it seems plausible that improved approximations to the reduced density matrix should lead to better descriptions for the current density. To examine how improved approximations to the reduced density matrix are related to the current density, an upper limit to the error resulting from truncating a natural orbital expansion of the current is found and related to the density matrix and kinetic energy expressed in the same basis. As a consequence, it is confirmed that quantum transport formulations leading to an accurate one-electron reduced density matrix will deliver controllable and well-behaved approximations for quantum <b>electronic</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} general theory to {{calculate}} the steady-state heat and <b>electronic</b> <b>currents</b> for nonlinear systems using a perturbative expansion in the system-bath coupling. We explicitly demonstrate that using the truncated Dyson-series leads to divergences in the steady-state limit, thus {{making it impossible to}} be used for actual applications. In order to resolve the divergences we propose a unique choice of initial-condition for the reduced density matrix, which removes the divergences at each order. Our approach not only allows us to use the truncated Dyson-series, with a reasonable choice of initial condition, but also gives the expected result that the steady-state solutions should be independent of initial preparations. Using our improved Dyson series we evaluate the heat and <b>electronic</b> <b>currents</b> upto fourth-order in system-bath coupling, a considerable improvement over the standard quantum master equation techniques. We then numerically corroborate our theory for archetypal settings of linear systems using the exact nonequilibrium Green's function approach. Lastly, to demonstrate the advantage of our approach we deal with the nonlinear spin-boson model to evaluate heat current upto fourth-order and find signatures of cotunnelling process.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{show that}} a nanoelectromechanical system can be mechanically actuated by a heat flow through it via an electron-electron interaction. In contrast to most known actuation mechanisms in similar systems, this new mechanism does not involve an <b>electronic</b> <b>current</b> nor external ac fields. Instead, the mechanism relies on deflection-dependent tunneling rates and a heat flow which is mediated by an electron-electron interaction while an <b>electronic</b> <b>current</b> through the device is prohibited by, for instance, a spin-valve effect. Therefore, the system resembles a nanoelectromechanical heat engine. We derive a criterion for the mechanical instability and estimate the amplitude of the resulting self-sustained oscillations.

40|$|Self-ordered anodic TiO 2 {{nanotubes}} (ATNTs) {{and related}} various nanostructures have received extensive attention in recent years. However, {{the relationship between}} porous morphology and anodizing current-time curve has not been quantitatively elucidated. Here, the simulation and separation of anodizing current-time curves are proposed to overcome this challenge. In this paper, ATNTs were anodized in the same electrolyte under a constant voltage at various temperatures. The interesting {{results show that the}} significant differences of nanotube length and surface morphology are mainly dependent upon the temperatures rather than the applied voltage. Simulation of the anodizing current-time curves obtained at various temperatures was performed through a theoretical formula. Then the total anodizing current was successfully separated into ionic current and <b>electronic</b> <b>current.</b> It is found that the ionic current and <b>electronic</b> <b>current</b> make different contributions to the growth of ATNTs. There is a linear correlation between nanotube length and ionic current, while the pore sizes and surface morphology are related to <b>electronic</b> <b>current.</b> The present results will provide a useful method to better understand the inherent formation mechanism of ATNTs.
