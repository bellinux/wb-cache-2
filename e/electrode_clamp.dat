As a new {{intelligent}} material, the ionic polymer-metal composite(IPMC) can {{be driven}} under low voltage with large deformation, {{and has been}} widely used in biomedical and robotic systems. Traditional IPMC testing system is bulky, high cost, and inconvenient to use. In order to achieve the portability and convenience of the IPMC testing system, a small and low-cost IPMC tester was designed. The power supply and control system of the tester were integrated into an IPMC <b>electrode</b> <b>clamp.</b> The main research work included control system circuit design, <b>electrode</b> <b>clamp</b> and overall exterior design. The displacement measurement {{results showed that the}} design for the IPMC tester was correct and feasible...|$|E

40|$|Electrodeposition {{of metals}} from {{solution}} is usually {{accompanied by the}} simultaneous discharge of hydrogen ions or water molecules. When hydrogen is liberated at an iron/steel surface during electrodeposition, {{a portion of the}} hydrogen is absorbed by the metal surface and then diffuses into the interior. The diffused hydrogen produces some detrimental effects, such as reduction in ductility and loss in mechanical strength, leading to hydrogen embrittlement. The present paper reports investigations on hydrogen permeation measurements in zinc-manganese alloy deposition using a modified <b>electrode</b> <b>clamp</b> for easy removal and fixing of the electrode.

All process parameters except <b>electrode</b> <b>clamping</b> force have been considered to be constant during RSW. Three different electrode force level have been considered and then dimensions of nuggets, HAZ and gaps have been obtained numerically. Three kinds of spot welded models with three different gap values between sheet joints have been simulated using Ansys code. Non-linear analysis was performed to obtain the local stress and strain ranges and then, Morrow equation with particular consideration of residual stress and gap distance effects {{has been applied to}} estimate fatigue lives. The results show that, with increasing the electrode force, the gap values between sheet joints increase. The results also reveal that the center region and the roots of nuggets have surrounded by the relatively large amounts of tensile residual stresses and also increasing the electrode force, reduce the amounts of residual stresses. The comparison between numerical results of fatigue lives and experimental data provided good agreement between numerical predictions and experiments...|$|R
40|$|While {{investigating}} the fatigue strength of spot-welded joints, {{the effects of}} sheet spacing or gap amounts between sheet joints may be considered {{as one of the}} most important parameters on the fatigue life duration of the joints. The main goal of the present work is to study the influence of sheet spacing on the fatigue life of 5083 -O aluminium alloy spot welded tensile-shear joints. The amounts of sheet spacing are the average values over three measurements of photograph observation of the cut-off surfaces from the nugget centre of the spot-welded joints. The amounts of gap distances between spot weld sheet joints for three different <b>electrode</b> <b>clamping</b> force levels were 0. 09 mm, 0. 11 mm and 0. 13 mm, respectively. The values of notch strength reduction factors have been obtained at all levels of applied loads based on volumetric approach. The fatigue lives of spot welded joints have been obtained according to the volumetric method using the notch strength reduction factors and the available smooth S-N curve of 5083 -O aluminium alloy sheets. The results based on the volumetric approach have been compared with the experimental fatigue test data and there is good agreement between numerical predictions and experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the <b>electrode</b> <b>clamps)</b> or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the bus tubes or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. The processes occurring on the electrodes and in the liquid phase during the arc discharge in the liquid phase (ADL) have been considered in the present work and we explain the mechanism of carbon nanostructures (CNS) formation proposing the model based on the analysis of existing regularities in behaviour of charged particles under extreme temperature and pressure gradients. The CNS synthesis by ADL method has been performed in dielectric liquids: hydrocarbons, liquid gases (N 2, Ar, He etc.), deionized water and others. Suspension containing clusters of synthesized nanostructures has been formed by the synthesis. The efficiency of this method is sharply increased by using arc discharge in the liquid phase where powder reagent layer is used as anode. To increase the frequency of <b>electrodes</b> <b>clamping</b> and moving apart, an electromagnetic vibrator {{has been used in}} this method and it brings and takes away the cathode from the powder reagent at a specified frequency. For ADL, nanostructures form simultaneously at several points on the conducting particle surface as a result of microscopic acts of arc discharge. These nanostructures are generated from the liquid phase and anode vapors and represent the product exhibiting rather interesting physical and chemical properties. Based on the analysis of the observations performed in the course of carbon nanostructures synthesis, the model of nanostructures formation by arc discharge in the liquid phase has been proposed in this paper.

Co-expression of C-terminal polypeptides corresponding to the final 440, 318, 220 and 150 amino acid residues of Kv 2. 1 all resulted in a significant reduction in the functional expression of the full-length channel. A truncated version of Kv 2. 1 lacking the final 318 amino acids of the C-terminal domain (Kv 2. 11 – 535) exhibited similar electrophysiological properties to the full-length channel. Co-expression with either the 440 or 318 residue polypeptides resulted in a reduction in the activity of the truncated channel. In contrast, the 220 and 150 residue C-terminal fragments had no effect on Kv 2. 11 – 535 activity.
