Synthetic <b>jets</b> are <b>devices</b> used mainly for flow control and heat transfer.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the {{development and use of}} a novel methodology to study corrosion under aqueous electrolyte drops ranging in diameter from 20 – 1000 μm, the most common deposited aerosol size range found in coastal marine environments. A drop-on-demand inkjet printer was custom built by coupling a commercial <b>jetting</b> <b>device</b> with a programmable two-axis stage. Singular droplets of sodium chloride solution were deposited onto steel and pure iron substrates with various surface finishes, followed by an isohumidity exposure for 24 hours. The volume loss increased with drop diameter according to a power law with an exponent of approximately 2 for highly polished steel and iron, increasing to 3 for iron with higher surface roughness. Attack was primarily filiform-like for the smallest drops, whereas deep, separate pits formed under the largest drops. Corrosion was not consistently observed under all drop sizes. The fraction of drops that showed no corrosion increased with decreasing drop size for all substrates. This behavior appears to have a strong dependency on the microstructure and surface finish. Corrosion initiation on 1010 steel was dominated by manganese sulphide inclusions when a mirror surface finish was maintained. For high purity iron, initiation was dominated by surface roughness. © The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

40|$|Solder Jetting, {{typically}} {{used to create}} variable bumps in flip chip applications, {{can be adapted to}} be a versatile assembly and packaging technology for hybrid photonics and MEMS. Instead of applying the solder bumps prior to the chip placement the approach that is reported here handles the <b>jetting</b> <b>device</b> by means of a 6 -axis robot independently from the complex assembly environment necessary for hybrid photonic and MEMS mounting and with the ability to reach even complex and 3 D-shaped joining geometries. After placing the respective components within the system to be assembled and after reaching the desired alignment state that often require micron and submicron accuracy the jetted solder volume creates the joint between the component and the system plattform. The metallic solder alloy is advantageous over standard adhesives due to better temperature, radiation and long term stability, making it favourable e. g. for high power applications, but it also serves for electrically and thermally conducting joints, thus with thermal management functionality. It is able to form joints between a wide variety of materials for components and system platform, if the prerequisite of metallized and wettable joining surfaces is fulfilled. But additionally our investigations show that by proper parameterization micron and submicron alignment stability for the component to be joined can be maintained during the application and resolidification of the liquidly applied solder. For lens and fiber joining numbers of radial alignment stability better than 1. 5 ± 0. 5 µm are reported when using 760 µm diameter SnAgCu-solder spheres.

40|$|The jet {{printing}} of solder paste from a uid dynamics perspective involves viscosity change due to varying shear rate and eventual break o of the ejected solder paste droplet from the uid in the printer head. The ability {{to model the}} jetting process in a simulation package is important {{as it can be}} used as a tool for future development of the <b>jetting</b> <b>device.</b> The jetting process is modelled as a two phase (air - solder paste) ow with interface tracking performed using phase eld method and temporal stepping based on a second-order Backward Di erence Formula with relaxed tolerences. This thesis investigates the droplet morphology, volume and speed predictions for three di erent piston actuation modes and solder paste viscosity denitions given by the Carreau- Yasuda model. A Darcy condition with the porosity parameter is calibrated equal to unity such that the droplet speed is within the realistic range of 20 m/s - 30 m/s. The simulations are compared against previous simulation results from IBOFlow, performed within a collaboration between Mycronic AB and Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre. As the Carreau models cannot capture the dependence of the uid viscosity of ow history, an indirect structure based viscosity model is used to compare the thixotopic behaviour. The expressions for the parameters of the structure based viscosity model are derived based on an analytical model which assumes that shear rate is constant. Experimental data for constant shear rate is curve tted on a Carreau model and an initial estimate of the parameters are obtained. The parameters are then adjusted to match experimental thixotopic behaviour. This method can be used to obtain parameter values for structure based viscosity models for uids with no previous data. Once the solder paste is ejected through the nozzle and the piston retracts, the uid undergoes stretching. Studying lament stretching during jetting is dicult as it can be driven by both droplet and piston motion. The data from an extensional rheometer is analyzed to study the lament stretching phenomenon for solder pastes. An analytical model for the critical aspect ratio is derived for a Newtonian uid lament undergoing a pure extension and modelled as a cylinder whose radius is decreases with time. The exponential decrease of the lament radius predicted by the analytical model is found to reproduce the experimental observations very well. The lament radius calculated based on the lament height from the experiments and analytical model shows that the model captures the stretching process, but the formation of beads usually seen in suspensions is not accounted for...|$|E

The heat transfer performances have been enhanced through the design of innovative synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices,</b> as the twin synthetic <b>jets</b> <b>device.</b> Obviously the heat transfer performances of the classic and innovative synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices</b> are strictly related to their impinging flow field. Therefore the behavior of impinging single and twin circular synthetic jets in phase opposition is experimentally investigated by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at Reynolds and Strouhal numbers equal to 5100 and 0. 024, respectively. Several nozzle-to-plate distances (H), ranging between 2 and 10 nozzle diameters (D), have been investigated. The time-averaged behavior of the velocity components has been reported and discussed. Their distributions, near the impinging plate, have been described. For the single jet, at short nozzle-to-plate distances (H/D 6), the axial velocity profile is bell-shaped. This is ascribed to the adverse pressure gradient strength and the potential core-like region extension. External oscillations are observed in all the flow field quantities near the impinging plate at 2 diameters from the stagnation point due to a secondary counter rotating vortex ring generation. The presence of such a counter rotating vortex ring decreases as the nozzle-to-plate distance increases. Comparing the two synthetic jet configurations, higher axial velocity and turbulence level but lower axial phase-correlated organized contribution to velocity have been found for the twin case because of the jets interaction. The evolution of the flow field for both configurations has been explained through phase-averaged measurements. High turbulence is observed along the shear layer emanated by the nozzle edge and in the vortex ring core. During the suction phase the saddle point shows a different behavior in the two configurations. In the single case, the saddle point reaches the impinging plate causing injection of air from the plate into the device. Differently the twin configuration generates two saddle points which do not reach the impinging plate {{because of the presence}} of the other impinging synthetic jet...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{air distribution}} {{systems that are}} based on confluent jets; this system can be of interest for the establishment of indoor environments, to fulfill the goals of indoor climate and energy-efficient usage. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide deeper understanding of the flow field development of a supply device that is designed based on wall confluent jets and to investigate the ventilation performance by experimental and numerical methods. In this study, the supply device can be described as an array of round jets on a flat surface attached to a side wall. Multiple round jets that issue from supply device apertures are combined at a certain distance downstream from the device and behave as a united jet or so-called confluent jets. Multiple round jets that are generated from the supply device move downward and are attached to the wall at the primary region, due to the Coanda effect, and then they become wall confluent jets until the floor wall is reached. A wall jet in a secondary region is formed along the floor after the stagnation region. The characteristics of the flow field and the ventilation performance of conventional wall confluent jets and modified wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>devices</b> are investigated experimentally in an office test room. The study of the modified wall confluent jets is intended to improve the efficiency of the conventional one while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort in an office environment. The results show that the modified wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> can provide acceptable thermal comfort for the occupant with lower airflow rate compared to the conventional wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device.</b> Numerical predictions using three turbulence models (renormalization group (RNG k– ε), realizable (Re k– ε), and shear stress transport (SST k– ω) are evaluated by measurement results. The computational box and nozzle plate models are used to model the inlet boundary conditions of the nozzle device. In the isothermal study, the wall confluent jets in the primary region and the wall jet in the secondary region, when predicted by the three turbulence models, are in good agreement with the measurements. The non-isothermal validation studies show that the SST k– ω model is slightly better at predicting the wall confluent jets than the other two models. The SST k– ω model is used to investigate the effects of the nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle array configuration, and inlet discharge height on the ventilation performance of the proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device.</b> The nozzle diameter and number of nozzles play important roles in determining the airflow pattern, temperature field, and draught distribution. Increased temperature stratification and less draught distribution are achieved by increasing the nozzle diameter and number of nozzles. The supply device with smaller nozzle diameters and fewer nozzles yields rather uniform temperature distribution due to the dominant effect of mixing. The flow behavior is nearly independent of the inlet discharge height for the studied range. The proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> is compared with a mixing supply device, impinging supply device and displacement supply device. The results show that the proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> has the combined behavior of both mixing and stratification principles.

In order to demonstrate the application feasibility of this device to thermal processing, the effects of nozzle diameter and material loading on the characteristics of the arc and plasma jet were studied. On increasing the nozzle diameter, the jet power decreases by 0. 5 ? 1 kW but the stable operating region expands. In addition, this device operates stably with material loading. It is confirmed that the new type of device proposed would be very useful for various material processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental work}} on {{a new type of}} transient water <b>jet</b> <b>device.</b> A spark discharge at one focus of a two-dimensional, elliptical, water filled cavity creates a shock wave which converges towards the other focus. There it enters an axisymmetric duct and is converted into a plane shock wave which moves out from the plane of the ellipse. When the plane wave reaches the free surface {{at the front of the}} nozzle a water jet is emitted. The Schliereren technique is used to study the process of wave convergence in the cavity. Resulting jet speeds form a simple non-optimized device are also measured. The fundamental idea appears to work and the results are promising, but difficulties remain.
