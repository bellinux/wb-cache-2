5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} <b>Debye</b> <b>length.</b> However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt was {{recently}} {{suggested that the}} electrostatic double-layer force between colloidal particles might weaken at high hydrostatic pressure encountered, for example, in deep seas or during oil recovery. We have addressed this issue {{by means of a}} specially designed optical trapping setup that allowed us to explore the interaction of a micrometer-sized glass bead and a solid glass wall in water at hydrostatic pressures of up to 1 kbar. The setup allowed us to measure the distance between bead and wall with a subnanometer resolution. We have determined the <b>Debye</b> <b>lengths</b> in water for salt concentrations of 0. 1 and 1 mM.

25|$|The {{electrical}} and physiological properties of ion channels are experimentally measured by inserting the channel into a lipid membrane separating two baths containing solutions of specific concentrations. A constant electrostatic bias is applied across the channel by immersing the electrodes {{in the two}} baths. Formulating boundary conditions that accurately represent these contact regions may require enormously large bath regions and is a challenging task. Beyond a <b>Debye</b> <b>length</b> from the membrane the electrostatic potential and ion densities do not vary appreciably. This assumption has been supported {{by the results of}} continuum results presented earlier. For typical salt concentrations used in ion channel simulations, the <b>Debye</b> <b>length</b> is of the order of 10 Å. Using the assumption, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the potential at the two domain boundary planes that are transverse to the channel, taking care that these planes are sufficiently far from the membrane.|$|E

However, when oriented parallel to plasma flow, slotted tapes are more efficient than holed or solid tapes; and 3) When the tapes were oriented parallel to the flow, the electron current collected on holed tapes decreases with increasing hole size until a minimum is attained, beyond which it start...|$|R

50|$|The Debye sheath (also {{electrostatic}} sheath) is a {{layer in}} a plasma which has a greater density of positive ions, and hence an overall excess positive charge, that balances an opposite negative charge {{on the surface of}} a material with which it is in contact. The thickness of such a layer is several <b>Debye</b> <b>lengths</b> thick, a value whose size depends on various characteristics of plasma (e.g. temperature, density, etc.).|$|R
25|$|For {{electrolyte}} solution in a channel with a macro- or micro-scaled radius, surface charges {{at the wall}} attract counterions and repel co-ions due to electrostatic force. Therefore, an electrical double layer exists between the wall of channel and the solution. The dimension of the electrical double layer {{is determined by the}} <b>Debye</b> <b>length</b> in this system, which is typically much smaller than the channel radius. Most of the solution in the channel is electrically neutral due to the shielding effect of the electrical double layer.|$|E
25|$|Bussard asserted, {{by using}} {{superconductor}} coils, {{that the only}} significant energy loss channel is through electron losses proportional to the surface area. He also stated that the density would scale with {{the square of the}} field (constant beta conditions), and the maximum attainable magnetic field would scale with the radius. Under those conditions, the fusion power produced would scale with the seventh power of the radius, and the energy gain would scale with the fifth power. While Bussard did not publicly document the reasoning underlying this estimate, scaling results from multiplying the fusion power density (proportional to density squared, or B4) with the volume (proportional toR³). On the other hand, if it is important to maintain the ratio of the <b>Debye</b> <b>length</b> or the gyroradius to the machine size, then the magnetic field strength would have to scale inversely with the radius, so that the total power output would actually be lower in a larger machine. if true, it would enable a model only ten times larger to be useful as a fusion power plant.|$|E
500|$|Since plasmas {{are very}} good {{electrical}} conductors, electric potentials play an important role. The potential as it exists on average {{in the space between}} charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the [...] "plasma potential", or the [...] "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a Debye sheath.

40|$|International audienceThe mutual {{impedance}} probe {{is an active}} radio frequency probe, designed to measure in situ the bulk plasma properties. An ideal configuration consists of both a transmitting and a receiving dipole, whose baseline {{is at least a}} few <b>Debye</b> <b>Lengths.</b> Due to various accommodation constraints on the spacecraft, the transmitter may only be a monopole. In that case, the image of the transmitter charge is distributed over the whole spacecraft surface. The operating principle consists in injecting a frequency-variable current through the transmitter, in a frequency range that encompasses the plasma frequency (or upper hybrid frequency in a magnetised plasma), and measuring the induced voltage at the receiver. Assuming a transmitted current I(f) of constant amplitude that induces a potential difference V(f) at the receiver dipole, the {{mutual impedance}} probe provides the coupling complex impedance Z(f) = V(f) /I(f) between the transmitter and the receiver as a function of frequency. The impedance depends on the plasma properties, in particular the bulk density and temperature (in case of a Maxwellian distribution) of the electron population. The measurement principle is illustrated with in situ observations from the Mutual Impedance Probe (RPC-MIP), one of the five sensors of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) on the ESA Rosetta mission. RPC-MIP has been providing regular measurements of the comet plasma environment since early August 2014 when Rosetta was within 100 km from the nucleus of its target comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. RPC-MIP operates in the frequency range from 7 kHz to 3. 5 MHz that allows covering the plasma density range expected during the mission from solar wind to deep coma densities. RPC-MIP operates in two geometrical configurations. In the baseline configuration, the transmitter and receiver dipoles are aligned on a 1 m-beam. The transmitter-receiver distance, of the order of 50 cm, allows probing plasmas with <b>Debye</b> <b>lengths</b> up to 20 - 25 cm. For longer <b>Debye</b> <b>lengths,</b> MIP uses as the transmitter, one of the two Langmuir Probes of the RPC-LAP instrument located at about 4 m from the MIP receiving dipole, which allows probing plasma with <b>Debye</b> <b>lengths</b> up to about 2 m. Based on the same principle the Permittivity Probe (SESAME-PP), attached to the Rosetta Lander Philae, measures the electrical properties of the cometary surface material in the frequency range 20 Hz to 10 kHz.
