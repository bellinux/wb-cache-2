40|$|As mobile Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) become greater {{entrenched in}} society and {{with the nature of}} work changing, more and more {{international}} organizations are embracing and/or considering formalizing the phenomenon of ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD). The gist of BYOD is the use of privately owned devices and software to access and work with organizational resources. There is however little that is known about the degree to which organizations in South Africa are embracing the BYOD phenomenon. In this paper, we explored how employees in organizations in South Africa perceive the use of their privately owned devices for work. The results from 61 employees suggest that there is a strong awareness of the BYOD concept among employees. Employees also appear to believe that although their employers are aware of the use of privately owned devices for work, the employers are reluctant to formally create BYOD organizational strategies. The findings suggest that the laxity of employers in South Africa to deal with the BYOD phenomenon as an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> could result in considerable security challenges for organizational data.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Brundtland Report "Our Common Future" in 1987 and the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, sustainable development has been widely accepted as an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> on global, national and local scales. The problems to be addressed under the sustainability heading are extremely diversified. On the one hand there are the developing countries of the South experiencing rapid population growth and environmental degradation.

Also, the increase of consumption and wealth in the North does not necessarily parallel an improvement of the quality of life. Most severe and diversified problems are encountered in cities: from traffic congestion and air pollution to unemployment, disruption of social networks and crime.

40|$|The February Council {{meeting will}} be a pilot of “Council 2. 0 ” – {{a new way of}} {{discussing}} <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>importance.</b> This approach puts into action the feedback gathered during the assessment phase that Council wants to be more focused on the major issues of the discipline. We will be using a new methodology to engage Council as collaborative strategic partners using the process of a mega issue discussion. Mega issues are overriding <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> that cut across multiple goals or outcome areas. They address key strategic questions the organization must ask and answer, illuminating choices the organization must make and the challenges that will need to be overcome in moving forward toward the envisioned future. If adopted by Council as a way of operating in the future, the process will evolve over time to reflect the culture of APA. Rationale for This Mega Issue Status and Dialogue: Technological innovations have dramatically changed the world in which the discipline resides. Those changes impact every aspect of psychology: how it is taught, the tools available to researchers, options opening to practitioners, means of dissemination of scientific information and how we communicate {{with each other and with}} external groups. Further, those same changes, as well as changes in the market place and in social connections, have huge implications for APA as an organization, how it goes about fulfilling its mission and whether it retains its role as a central organizing structure for the discipline into the future. APA has historically been in a reactive stance with regards to technological change, and has recently spent significant energy trying to catch up. How does the organization change to get ahead of the curve? Is it possible for APA to be recognized as the go-to organization for understanding the interface of human behavior and technology? Because we view the world through a linear lens, we tend to anticipate that future changes will continue but in a manageable way. Yet the signs point to exponential rates of change and fundamental shifts in the impact that technology has on daily life, and by extension, on the discipline of psychology...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEnergy storage by {{batteries}} {{has become}} an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>importance.</b> A scientific breakthrough {{in this context is}} the lithiumion battery. Indeed, lithium-ion batteries can store up to three times more electricity and generate twice the power of nickel–metalhydride batteries now in use, making possible great improvements in energy storage for electric vehicles and portable electronics. Major investments are beingmadefor thecommercial development of Li-ion batteries and there are government funds available offering $billions in grants for research, development, and manufacturing. In this context, we wish to call attention to a deceptive paper that recently appeared in Nature [1], which has receivedmuch publicity since it announced an impossibly high recharging rate capability for a Li-ion battery of 9 s! Close examination of the work [1] shows that the authors have no direct evidence in support of such a high recharging rate, but imply their dramatic conclusion only from the high discharge rate. Experienced batterymaterials scientistswould understand that the charge and discharge processes of batteries are basically asymmetric, resulting in rates of discharge that are generallymuch higher than rates suitable for recharge! The ability of a battery to be rechargedina fewseconds, as the authors claim,would indeed be of great benefit, but this goal remains unmet despite the claims of Kang and Ceder [1] as we will explain herein. The olivine material LiFePO 4, used in thework reported by Kang and Ceder [1] is a very promising material that was first proposed in 1996 [2]. Hydro Quebec (HQ) recognized the potential of this material for Li-ion batteries after discussions with Professor John Goodenough in the same year.

The data was collected through a questionnaire administered on randomly selected respondents from 5 different organizations and analyzed with SPSS and Smart partial least square softwares.

In recognition of the growing need for integrated reporting, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA-UK) recently included integrated reporting in the revised syllabus for 2015. This is not unconnected to the backdrop that different <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> in accounting have {{found their way to}} the management accounting curriculum, to ensure the subject remains externally-oriented, forward-looking, and societally-relevant.
