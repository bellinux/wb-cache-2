25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from <b>bright</b> nickel <b>plating</b> solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|R

40|$|A {{holistic}} approach to replacing chromium <b>bright</b> <b>plate</b> and the associated wastes from that electroplating industry is taken. The ideas and strategies associated with integrating nanotechology coating production with green chemistries are explored in new horizons for metallic coatings. Thus a literature review of metal coating technology, exploring the best and commonly accepted technology along with new and emerging plating technology is presented. This places emphasis on selection of metal alloy replacements (Mo, Fe, Co, Sn) for Cr and Cr alloys. Selection of final metals for trial in experimental alloys related to their considered contribution towards bright finish and their physical and corrosion properties. Based {{on the concept of}} using a large organic delivery molecule to produce nano-metallic plate structures, two ligands were employed, Gluconate (G) and Dithizone (D). Co/Fe and Co/Fe/Sn experimental alloys were produced (using these ligand metal complexes) via four plating technology systems (galvanic batch process, dynamic flow process, sonochemical process and brush sono technique). Electroplate coating thicknesses are reported via calculations employing density, mass and volume considerations. Chemical and structural analysis i. e. (XRD, AAS, SEM, AFM), hardness via the phase tool within the AFM system are reported. Decisions about future work are reported, based on fmdings and progress to date. These findings indicate coating thickness in the range 3. 58 IlID to 69. 45 urn and relate them to plating conditions and methodology. They also illustrate that nano-coatings are being produced but there is inconsistency of the surface structures i. e. individual nano-particles (of the order 140 nm diameter) are seen, but also conglomerates as large as 4000 nm diameter are observed. Reassessment of the whole research obtainable goals, for this area of advancement, within a 3 -year time frame is made. The plating processes and production of test specimens is concluded to be far too labour intensive and a step limiting factor in this research. To this end, a major final conclusion relating to the use of robotics and automation of experimental plating processes is presented as an aid to future research.

5000|$|Several {{companies}} now offer hand-painted finishes for metalwork, {{as well as}} a more permanent look that can be achieved with powder-coated finishes. For {{the low end of the}} market, imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum. Tin is now fashionably used for art work, back splashes, cabinet faces, wainscoting and much more. For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original 1 x 2 in furring strips. There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation.

The mouldering tapestry, which, in his father's time, had half covered the walls of this stately apartment, and half streamed from them in tatters, had given place to a complete finishing of wainscot, the cornice of which, {{as well as the}} frames of the various compartments, were ornamented with festoons of flowers and with birds, which, though carved in oak, seemed, such was the art of the chisel, actually to swell their throats and flutter their wings. Several old family portraits of armed heroes of the house of Ravenswood, together with a suit or two of old armour and some military weapons, had given place to those of King William and Queen Mary, or Sir Thomas Hope and Lord Stair, two distinguished Scottish lawyers. The pictures of the Lord Keeper's father and mother were also to be seen; the latter, sour, shrewish, and solemn, in her black hood and close pinners, with a book of devotion in her hand; the former, exhibiting beneath a black silk Geneva cowl, or skull-cap, which sate as close to the head {{as if it had been}} shaven, a pinched, peevish, Puritanical set of features, terminating in a hungry, reddish, peaked beard, forming on the whole a countenance in the expression of which the hypocrite seemed to contend with the miser and the knave. [...] "And it is to make room for such scarecrows as these," [...] thought Ravenswood, [...] "that my ancestors have been torn down from the walls which they erected!" [...] he looked at them again, and, as he looked, the recollection of Lucy Ashton, for she had not entered the apartment with them, seemed less lively in his imagination. There were also two or three Dutch drolleries, as the pictures of Ostade and Teniers were then termed, with one good painting of the Italian school. There was, besides, a noble full-length of the Lord Keeper in his robes of office, placed beside his lady in silk and ermine, a haughty beauty, bearing in her looks all the pride of the house of Douglas, from which she was descended. The painter, notwithstanding his skill, overcome by the reality, or, perhaps, from a suppressed sense of humour, had not been able to give the husband on the canvas that air of awful rule and right supremacy which indicates the full possession of domestic authority.

The project aims {{to answer the}} question of whether the giant galaxies are fair tracers of the large scale struc-ture and whether the voids are really empty. This pa-per is the third of a series of papers dedicated to this project. The survey was based on a sample selected from the HQS (Hamburg Quasar Survey) - IIIa-J digitised ob-jective prism plates and the main selection criteria was the presence of emission-lines, mainly of the [OIII] 5007 line. Positions, heliocentric redshifts, detected emission-lines and nding charts are provided for ELGs in a re-gion North of the Coma Supercluster, 30 : 5 < < 45 : 5, centred around 13 : 5 h.

This study measures the effect a Uralane coating has on the initiation and growth of tin whiskers, on the ability of this coating to prevent a tin whisker from emerging from the coating, and on the ability to prevent shorting. A sample of fourteen brass substrates (1 inch by 4 inches by 1 / 16 inch) were plated by two separate processes: half of the specimens were 'bright' tin plated directly over the brass substrate and half received a copper flash over the brass substrate prior to 'bright' tin plating. Each specimen was coated on one half of the substrate with three bi-directional sprays of Uralane 5750 to a nominal thickness of 25 to 75 micrometers (1 to 3 mils). Several specimens of both types, Cu and non-Cu flashed, were placed in an oven maintained at 50 C as others' work suggests that this is the optimal temperature for whisker formation. The remaining specimens were maintained at room ambient conditions. The surfaces of each specimen have been regularly inspected using both optical (15 to 400 x power) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). Many types of growths, including needle-like whiskers, first appeared approximately three months after plating on the non-conformally coated sides of all specimens. At four months, 4 to 5 times more growth sites were observed on the coated side; however, the density of growth sites on the non-conformally coated side has since increased rapidly, and now, at one year, is about the same for both sides. The density of growth sites is estimated at 90 /sq mm with 30 percent of the sites growing whiskers (needle-like forms) with the potential to cause short circuit bridging. The average growth rate of the needle-like whiskers on the non-conformally coated areas is about 130 micrometers per year with some outliers reaching 800 micrometers after one year. It is more difficult to make growth measurements under the conformal coat. As yet no whiskers have been observed to penetrate through the coating surface, however, a number of tin nodules appear on the verge of breaking through the thinner regions of the coating surface. These domes are developing sharper and sharper tips, as if a growing whisker is about to push its way through a tough skin. Our observations are that the specimens with copper flash show a much lower density of nucleation sites and significantly slower whisker growth compared to the specimens that have only <b>bright</b> tin <b>plating</b> over brass. The specimens kept at room temperature have a higher whisker density than those stored at 50 C. This is an unexpected result and does not agree with the published findings of others. All of the whiskers originate from small surface defects (thin, tiny scratches) that appear over the entire surface of each specimen...|$|R
