5|$|Ao {{allegedly}} set up shell companies {{a network}} of secret bank accounts in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands {{with the help of}} friends and family members to launder bribe money. Ao's father Ao Veng-kong, brother Ao Man-fu, and sister-in-law Ao Chan Va-choi were charged with setting up overseas bank accounts and shell companies for Ao Man-long to handle kickbacks. The total deposits {{in more than a dozen}} Hong Kong bank accounts under his father's name exceeded HK$157 million as of December 2006. The three family members pleaded not guilty, claiming Ao Man-long opened the bank accounts <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>All</b> family members were sentenced to prison terms by a decision of the Macau Court of Second Instance on 30 October 2008.|$|E
5|$|As Sadness reinstalls {{the core}} memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives {{home to her}} parents and breaks down crying, confessing that she misses Minnesota. As her parents comfort her, they tell her that they also miss Minnesota and Joy and Sadness work the console together, {{creating}} a new core memory that combines their emotions; a new island forms representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco. In the end, a year later {{at the age of}} 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted a few new ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories from combinations of her emotions). Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a new expanded console with room <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E
5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E

Dan {{finds it hard to}} relate to Susan and begins to question her part in his and Libby's lives. Karl books a holiday <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> to get away and talk. Dan and Susan argue about where the baby will be brought up and Dan says that he regrets agreeing to the surrogacy. When Dan goes for a walk, Susan follows him and they continue to argue. Dan walks away and Susan tries running after him, but she trips and falls. She calls out, but Dan does not hear her and he walks off. Libby and Karl find Susan and rush her to the hospital, where Susan miscarries. Susan attends the memorial for Libby and Dan's baby and during Dan's speech, she lashes out at him. As everyone leaves the park, Susan collapses and reveals that she cannot feel her legs. Susan has an MS relapse, but she recovers. Susan and Karl take up golf, and Susan also enrols in a media course at Eden Hills University. She begins receiving threats, which tell her to leave the university. Susan is deeply upset by the threats and her family worry that the stress will lead to an MS relapse.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kadaj and {{his colleagues}} are {{recruiting}} children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight and Loz kidnapped Marlene. All the kidnapped children are taken to the ruins of the mystical Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren and announces his intention <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, he is overpowered by Kadaj's gang, but is rescued by his old comrade Vincent Valentine. Demoralized by his failure, Cloud asks if sin can ever be truly forgiven, to which Vincent nonchalantly replies that he has never tried to forgive. Cloud decides to keep fighting and returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population. With the help of his companions from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.|$|E

25|$|Biba's layout was {{innovative}} and {{was set to}} enhance the clothes rather than just to hold them.

25|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships had to be hastily refitted—in {{two weeks in the}} case of Finland. Of the fourteen ships, ten, including Finland, were designated to carry human passengers; the other four were designated as animal ships. The ten ships designated to carry troops had to have all of their second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Finland, uniquely among the fourteen ships, already carried guns and {{did not need to be}} refitted <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>All</b> the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators.

25|$|Many former Imperial Japanese Army {{soldiers}} {{fought with}} the Viet Minh - {{perhaps as many as}} 5,000 volunteered their services throughout the war. These Japanese stayed behind in Indochina soon after World War II concluded in 1945 out of a peak number of 50,000 - the majority of which were repatriated to Japan by the then occupying British. For those that stayed behind, fighting with the Viet Minh became a more attractive idea than returning to a defeated and occupied homeland. In addition the Viet Minh had very little experience in warfare or government so the advice of the Japanese was welcome. Some of the Japanese were ex-Kenpeitai who were wanted for questioning by Allied authorities. Giap arranged <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> to receive Vietnamese citizenship and false identification papers. Some Japanese were captured by the Viet Minh during the last months of the war and were recruited in to their ranks.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC60268-4.|$|E

500|$|Fuchs {{arrived in}} England on 24 September 1933. Jessie Gunn {{was a member}} of the Wills family, the heirs to Imperial Tobacco and benefactors of the University of Bristol.

A paper on [...] "A Quantum Mechanical Calculation of the Elastic Constants of Monovalent Metals" [...] was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1936. By this time, Mott had a number of German refugees working for him, and lacked positions <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> He did not think that Fuchs would make much of a teacher, so he arranged a research post for Fuchs, at the University of Edinburgh working under Max Born, who was himself a German refugee. Fuchs published papers with Born on [...] "The Statistical Mechanics of Condensing Systems" [...] and [...] "On Fluctuations in Electromagnetic radiation" [...] in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He also received a Doctorate in Science degree from Edinburgh. Fuchs proudly mailed copies back to his father in Germany.|$|E
