5|$|Public Law 105-229, {{commonly}} referred to as the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses Protection Act, states that the Bankers on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120–130horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine Porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freeze</b> <b>branding</b> {{is used as}} an {{alternative}} to the more traditional hot branding. This process involves the use of a hot iron to scar an animal's skin, which can be painful and traumatizing to the animal. <b>Freeze</b> <b>branding</b> has been gaining in popularity as a less painful way to permanently mark and identify animals. There has been debate whether <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> truly is less painful than hot branding, but studies conducted to compare the pain of the two methods have concluded that <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> is indeed less painful.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freeze</b> <b>branding</b> {{was tested}} as a marking system on frogs. Previous ways of marking {{amphibians}} {{that were to}} be recaptured included tagging and mutilation. <b>Freeze</b> <b>branding</b> {{is an example of}} tagging. It has no permanent effects other than to identify individuals. Mutilation, on the other hand can particularly affect an individual’s life history. Toe-clipping is commonly used, but it can affect the anuran’s motor skills and can cause weight loss. These things will all affect the mortality rate of the amphibians. Very few methods meet all of the requirements; however <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> is one of them.|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> is less painful than hot-iron branding, it is still less commonly used. This {{is due to the}} fact that <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> is more expensive because the materials are less common and can evaporate if they are not kept properly cooled. Conversely, to heat a brand all that is required is fire. To freeze it requires either liquid nitrogen or dry ice. These can both be relatively uncommon, especially in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Free-roaming mustangs are <b>freeze</b> <b>branded</b> on {{the left}} side of the neck by the BLM, using the International Alpha Angle System, a system of angles and alpha-symbols that cannot be altered. The brands begin with a symbol {{indicating}} the registering organization, in this case the U.S. Government, then two stacked figures indicating the individual horse's date of birth, then the individual registration number.

5000|$|Since April 1978, all free-ranging mustangs and burros {{rounded up}} by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service have been {{identified}} with a <b>freeze</b> <b>brand</b> on the left hand side of their neck. Since then it has become extremely rare to find a mustang without a <b>freeze</b> <b>brand.</b> [...] The brand first denotes the registering organization, which is the US Government, {{as it is the}} BLM that brands the mustangs. This is followed by the year of birth, which is the two numbers following the registration symbol, stacked vertically, showing only the last two digits of the birth year. The last section is the registration number. This consists of six numbers that indicates the area where the animal originated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freeze</b> <b>brands</b> {{are used}} {{in a number of}} ways. For example, they are used as an {{indicator}} that an animal belongs to a herd, which are all marked with the same brand, and as a way to tag animals that will later be recaptured for research. It is typically used on cattle, horses, and dogs.|$|R
50|$|Immediately after branding, an {{indented}} {{pattern of}} the brand shows for a few minutes. Then the area begins to exhibit swelling, which will subside after about five days. After a month {{the top layer of}} skin will shed and, on pigmented animals, after two months the white hair will begin to grow. At three months the process is complete and the full <b>freeze</b> <b>brand</b> is visible.|$|R
5000|$|A type of {{deliberate}} human-created scarring {{that results in}} white hair is <b>Freeze</b> <b>branding,</b> a method of permanently marking a horse for identification purposes. Some forms of hot branding may also scar lightly enough to leave white hairs rather than bare skin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freeze</b> <b>branding</b> was {{developed}} by Dr. Keith Farrell of Pullman, Washington and was first used in Sweden around 1966.

50|$|There are {{benefits}} and drawbacks to <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> {{as opposed to}} hot-iron branding. Some of the benefits are that it causes almost no permanent harm to the animal’s skin, it is far less painful than a hot-iron brand, the freeze brands are highly visible no matter the time of year, and there is less blotching and distortion with a freeze brand. However <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> can have some problems. For example, {{it takes a lot}} longer to do properly than a hot brand and requires more specialized equipment. Also, the hair on pigmented animals must grow back in before the brand can be read and results can vary from animal to animal. If it is to be used to denote ownership, some states do not recognize it as a legal brand for designating ownership of livestock.|$|E

40|$|Movements of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), a major {{fisheries}} species, across {{marine reserve}} boundaries were investigated on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Mark-release-recapture and ultrasonic telemetry {{were used to}} assess movements. Mark-release-recapture used hook and line as the method of capture and underwater visual census (UVC) as the "recapture" tool. Catch rates were significantly higher in zones closed to fishing, despite UVC indicating no significant differences in density between closed and open zones. Of 183 fish marked with numerical <b>freeze</b> <b>brands,</b> 93 estimates of movements of branded fish were obtained. No branded fish was recorded to cross the reserve boundaries during the 2 -month study, probably due to the initial decision to allocate capture effort evenly across the study area, rather than concentrating it on reserve boundaries. Fish carrying ultrasonic transmitters, and having home ranges straddling reserve boundaries, crossed boundaries on average 15. 3 times•month⁻¹. The mean distance moved by <b>freeze</b> <b>branded</b> specimens between capture and recapture was significantly larger in areas closed to fishing than in those open to fishing. However, mean distance moved per day determined by ultrasonic telemetry did not differ between areas closed and open to fishing. This study suggests low flux rates of adult P. leopardus across marine reserve boundaries...|$|R

5000|$|In one study, {{pain was}} {{measured}} by monitoring heart rate as well as plasma cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and hormone concentration through the collection of blood samples. An increase {{in any of these}} or vocalization by the animal was said to indicate an increase in pain. Twenty-seven calves were branded with either a hot-iron <b>brand</b> (H), <b>freeze</b> <b>brand</b> (F), or a [...] "sham" [...] brand (S), with the sham-branded cattle acting as a control group. A jugular cannula was inserted into the jugular vein in order to convey fluid and collect data; these were inserted into each calf one day before the experiment. To minimize systematic bias, researchers used blocking to separate by temperament, weight, and sex. Random assignment was called upon to denote the order and day on which the animals were branded. While being branded, ten blood samples and heart rate measurements were taken at uneven intervals between five minutes pre- and twenty minutes post-branding.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to traditional hot branding, animals today {{may also be}} marked for identification by <b>freeze</b> <b>branding,</b> by tattooing, by ear tags, or by having a microchip embedded into the animal, usually in the neck.

50|$|Meyenberg {{became a}} very {{profitable}} company {{because of its}} government contracts. But, its Fosters Freeze franchised stores were falling behind the new fast food trend of offering hamburgers and other hot foods. The company helped its franchisees update and remodel their stores so they could include hamburgers,french fries and Mexican food on their menus. The move made the old stores very profitable. But it didn't provide Meyenberg with any increased franchise royalties {{for the sale of}} these hot foods, even though they were marketed under the Fosters Freeze name.In the early 1970s, Meyenberg was acquired by Vornado, an east coast retailer which had operated under the trade name of Two Guys. Vornado was only interested in the milk producer's strong cash flow position. Several years after the expiration of its government contracts, Meyenberg Milk Products was sold to Bob Sardella of Sacramento in the 1976 a restaurant real-estate site developer of over 400 locations for Sambo's, KFC, Burger King and ARCO. Sardella soon sold Meyenburg Milk and the Yellville AR Milk plant and closed the Milk plant/Dairy in Ripon, CA and meat packing plant in Compton, CA to cut losses so he could focus on rebuilding the Fosters <b>Freeze</b> <b>brand.</b> Sardella encountered franchisee resistance as he attempted to update and create more uniformity in the outdated franchise agreement. His son & grandson have continued to own and operate one of the chains most successful stores in Auburn, CA. (30+ years). Sardella ended up selling the franchise rights to his President of the company Bill Wagner of Santa Barbara, a retired executive of Sambo's, a West Coast restaurant chain. Wagner wasn't able to expand the chain and sold the franchise to Bill Boudier,a Northern California franchisee with stores throughout the Sacramento area, Kerry Mulligan and their silent partners.|$|R
50|$|Cold {{branding}}: This rare {{method of}} branding {{is the same}} thing as strike branding, except that the metal branding tool is subjected to extreme cold (such as liquid nitrogen) rather than extreme heat. This method will cause the hair on the brand to grow back white and will not cause keloiding. This process is also used in livestock and called <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> in that context.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional hot-iron branding, <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> uses a branding iron {{that has been}} chilled with a coolant such as dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Rather than burning a scar into the animal, a freeze brand damages the pigment-producing hair cells, causing the animal's hair to grow white where the brand has been applied. Freeze brands cause less damage to the animals' hides than hot iron brands, and can be more visible. Horses are frequently freeze-branded. At this time, hogs cannot be successfully freeze branded, as their hair pigment cells are better protected. Also, <b>freeze</b> <b>branding</b> is slower, more expensive, less predictable (more care is required in application to assure desired results), and in some places does not constitute a legal brand on cattle. When an animal grows a long hair coat, the freeze brand is still visible, but its details are not always clear. Thus, it is sometimes necessary to shave or closely trim the hair so that a sharper image of a freeze brand can be viewed.|$|E
