40|$|Recent {{research}} {{explored the}} application of mechanical flocculation ahead of a novel flotation/filtration process (Counter Current Dissolved Air Flotation/Filtration [...] COCO DAFF(TM)) and compared it to the process performance seen when <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation</b> was used. The energy input to the system, {{expressed in terms of}} the mean velocity gradient, G (s- 1), and retention time, t, were used as a guideline for comparison between the two types of flocculation. Generally, better COCO DAFF(TM) performance resulted from using mechanical flocculation as against that using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation.</b> High G values (in excess of 80 s- 1) were found to give best results, as opposed to values of 30 - 60 s- 1 utilised ahead of conventional treatment. The effect of flocculation contact time on the COCO DAFF(TM) process was also studied. Current design practice typically utilises 20 - 30 minutes flocculation contact time. It was found that process performance, in terms of water quality, did not deteriorate excessively if the contact time was reduced to as little as 2 minutes, but filter run times were found to be proportional to contact time...|$|E
40|$|A laboratory-scale reactor {{was used}} to {{simulate}} a water treatment process sequence of rapid mix, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation,</b> upflow clarification with a floc blanket, and lamellar sedimentation to accomplish removal of colloidal particles. This process sequence, followed by chlorination, has been employed to create affordable designs for water treatment in the Global South. This study focused on variables affecting performance of the floc blanket including: condition of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation,</b> raw water turbidity, coagulant dose, upflow velocity through the floc blanket, floc blanket height, and bulk density and solids concentration of the floc blanket. An upflow clarifier velocity between 90 - 110 m/day produced the best floc blanket performance for most influent turbidities studied. The results show that particle removal efficiency in lamellar sedimentation improved linearly with respect to floc blanket heights up to 45 cm. Improved performance is also correlated with increased hydraulic flocculator residence time and energy dissipation rate. At floc blanket heights above 45 cm, there is still improvement in performance for most cases, but improved performance and blanket height no longer follow a linear relationship. Lamellar sedimentation with a capture velocity of 10 m/day is a key component in improving clarifier performance when utilizing a floc blanket. Future {{studies are needed to}} determine mechanisms of particle removal in a floc blanket. ii...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a {{national}} turbidity standard for runoff water leaving highway construction sites at 280 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). Meeting this standard {{can be challenging}} as turbidities of runoff waters can exceed 15, 000 NTU. The objective {{of this research was}} to assess polyacrylamide (PAM), a coagulant aid used in water treatment, to help meet the EPA turbidity regulation. Twelve commercially available PAM types were studied, {{selected on the basis of}} charge type (cationic, nonionic, anionic), charge density (0 - 100 %), and molecular weight (0. 1 - 28 Mg mol- 1). Jar tests were conducted with runoff waters from AHTD construction sites and synthetically made formulations of tap water blended with bentonite, illite, kaolinite, and Arkansas Red Dirt. Jar tests were completed at PAM doses between 0. 5 - 20 mg L- 1 and the turbidity of the supernatant was measured following a quiescent settling period. Results showed that anionic PAMs with low charge densities were most effective at reducing supernatant turbidities, likely due to enhanced interparticle bridging. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation</b> tests were done with two PAM types in lab-scale continuous flow reactors and at a controlled field site. It was concluded that anionic PAMs at a dose of 10 mg L- 1 provided adequate turbidity reduction and that channel baffling induced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation</b> and further reduced effluent turbidities...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafiltration {{membranes}} {{are becoming}} increasingly prevalent in potable water treatment applications. This trend {{can be attributed to}} the improved cost effectiveness of membrane systems as compared to conventional treatment technologies and to progressively more stringent water quality regulations. In particular, increased awareness related to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and halo-acetic acids (HAAs) has required utilities to improve the removal of their organic precursors. Excellent removal rates of as high as 75 % for TOC and 95 % for colour have been achieved for at drinking water plants using ZeeWeed Â® immersed ultrafiltration membranes in combination with a coagulant, pH control, and/or powdered activated carbon (PAC). As compared to a conventional plant using coagulation-flocculationclarification-filtration, a membrane system incorporating coagulant addition can be designed with a reduced <b>flocculation</b> <b>hydraulic</b> retention time and with the eliminatio...|$|R
5000|$|The Navalis AWP system {{utilizes}} a seven-stage {{process in}} order to treat wastewater. [...] The first stage involves wastewater entering the shaker screens which removes any noticeable solids. Then the wastewater is passed through an AET Roughing Reactor which help with chemical equalization and load. Then the influent is treated by a three-stage particle removal process which involve chemical <b>flocculation,</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> Separation, Tubular Filtration, and Ultra Filtration membranes. The waste influent is then passed through Oxidation Reactors which serve to oxidize pollutants and aid the production of carbon dioxide gas and water. The seventh and final stage consists of a powerful Ultraviolet Reactor in which the ozonated water is broken down into oxygen compounds that provide further treatment of the water. The leftover solids are then oxidized which provide safe bio-disposal or land based discharge if needed.|$|R
40|$|Gravity driven {{hydraulic}} flocculators {{that operate}} {{in the absence of}} reliable electric power are better suited to meet the water treatment needs of communities in the global south than conventional mechanical flocculators. However, current knowledge regarding the proper design and operation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation</b> systems is insufficient. Of particular interest to the AguaClara research team is the optimal fluid shear level needed to produce low turbidity water. The Flocculation Residual Turbidity Analyzer (FReTA) was developed as tool for measuring the floc sedimentation velocity distribution and the post-sedimentation residual turbidity of a flocculated suspension. These two properties are central to the design and operation of unit processes following flocculation in a water treatment plant. FReTA measures the turbidity of a flocculent suspension undergoing quiescent sedimentation. The fixed distance across which flocs must travel to clear the measurement volume in FReTA allows sedimentation velocities to be calculated from the raw turbidity data. By fitting the transformed turbidity data with a modified gamma distribution, the mean and variance of the sedimentation velocity distribution can be obtained along with the post-sedimentation residual turbidity. A hydraulic tube flocculator was used to study how fluid shear levels affect the settling properties of a flocculated alum-kaolin suspension. FReTA was employed to quantitatively compare the effects of varying fluid shear and hydraulic residence time on the sedimentation velocity distributions and the post-sedimentation residual turbidities of flocculated suspensions formed in the tube flocculator. Results showed that shear induced floc break up occurred at all velocity gradients evaluated. There was a correlation between high floc settling velocities and low residual turbidities, both of which were optimized at low fluid shear levels and long fluid residence times. This study showed that, for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>flocculation</b> systems, low turbidity water was produced when fluid shear was kept at a minimum...|$|E
