5|$|What <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> dismaying is {{the mess}} our milling and baking {{concerns}} succeed in making with the dearly bought grain {{that goes into}} their grist. Quite simply it is wasted on a nation that cares so little {{about the quality of}} its bread that it has allowed itself to be mesmerized into buying the equivalent of eight and a quarter million large white factory-made loaves every day of the year.|$|E
25|$|Morals excite passions, {{and produce}} or prevent actions. Reason itself <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> {{impotent}} in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.|$|E

While a girl of stronger character and active intelligence would have employed the time in digesting plans of future retaliation and revenge, Clytie's dull brain and placid nature <b>were</b> <b>utterly</b> perplexed and shaken.|$|R
25|$|The commandments in the Hebrew Bible against idolatry forbade the {{practices}} and gods of ancient Akkad, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. The Hebrew Bible states that God has no shape or form, <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> incomparable, is everywhere and cannot {{be represented in}} a physical form of an idol.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Earth, Rider struggles to {{readjust}} due to his failure to complete high school. Unknown to him, the planet Xandar <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> destroyed in an attack by the space pirate Nebula. With the help of Night Thrasher, Rider regains his powers and joins the New Warriors superhero team, where he becomes close friends with Speedball. Richard briefly dates Yale student Laura Dunham and teammate Namorita.|$|E
25|$|David Anthony Higgins as Craig Feldspar, Lois's {{overweight}} coworker at the Lucky Aide Drugstore, who has {{a secret}} crush on Lois. He is very geeky and self-absorbed and in the rare event he is given actual powers. he can also be as bossy as Lois, but much less competent as her. Craig also has a non-existent relationship with his estranged father, who <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> obsessed with running his gym.|$|E

25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors. However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing demographics, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> important to educate physicians to be culturally competent {{so that they can}} effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|Total depravity (also called {{absolute}} inability {{and total}} corruption) is a theological doctrine that {{derives from the}} Augustinian concept of original sin. It is the teaching that, {{as a consequence of}} the fall of man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin and, apart from the efficacious or prevenient grace of God, <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> unable to choose to follow God or choose to accept salvation as it is freely offered.|$|E
25|$|While {{the states}} of the Old World have dealt with these threats {{primarily}} by means of existing institutions and legal systems, the United States appears to have made a fundamentally different choice: considering that neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism, it decided to develop new legal concepts. This legal approach <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> alien to the European tradition and sensibility, and is clearly contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|E

25|$|In {{a number}} of places the ancient texts assert that God has no shape or form and <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> incomparable; thus no idol, image, idea, or {{anything}} in creation could ever capture God's essence. The narrative in Deuteronomy 4 recounts that when the Israelites were visited by God at Mt. Sinai {{at the time the}} Ten Commandments were given, they saw no shape or form and this is stated as a reason why any physical representation of the divine is prohibited – no idols of humans, animals, or heavenly bodies were to be made. Rather than use an idol, God chose to reveal himself in words, by working through people, and by working in history.|$|E
25|$|Pierre becomes {{friends with}} a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by {{interacting}} with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harsh Russian winter. After months of trial and tribulation—during which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the French—Pierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov killed in action.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether {{we are concerned}} with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E

500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{commented that}} the parkour from the {{performance}} was [...] "really awesome". Thomas Inksweep from Stylus magazine reported that [...] "'Jump' <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> sensational.

[...] The song was included in both the CD and DVD of the live album, The Confessions Tour.|$|E
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi spawns {{yet another}} career-redefining {{hit in the}} sweet, soulful [...] "Fly Like a Bird", an honest-to-God {{religious}} mantra about redemption. Set against a low-key, organ-spiced groove that recalls mid-'70s R, Carey opens with a pretty, wispy vocal and buoyant harmonies throughout the first chorus before she waves her arms, parts the clouds and wails to the heavens as a mile-high wall of gospel background vocals joins in for the crescendo. The flight of 'Bird' from humble call for deliverance into a frenzied ecclesiastic hymn <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> spine-tingling. A joyful noise.|$|E

[...] Time Out London called it [...] "dazzling, fabulously sassy and uplifting," [...] explaining [...] "It's not all glitz and high-kicks...there are some grittier moments {{that give the}} show an edgier feel." [...] And Digital Spy proclaimed it [...] "hilarious, heartwarming, and {{a hell of a}} lot of fun," [...] offering special praise for the show's star: [...] "Matt Henry...truly steals the show...He <b>is</b> <b>utterly</b> commanding in the role, and you instantly root for him." ...|$|E
