5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E

40|$|Literature {{review and}} {{synthesis}} <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> aquatic protists {{focused on the}} role of temperature in the formation of massive annual algal blooms in high-latitude ecosystems.

Maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> herbivorous protists declined more rapidly with decreasing temperature than did those of phototrophic protists, and at the very low temperatures common to high-latitude ecosystems, the maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> herbivorous protists were less than half the maximal <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> phototrophic protists. <b>Growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> herbivorous protists were consistently lower than those of bacterivorous protists and were unrelated to differences in cell volume between the two groups.

The three heterotrophic groups had similar slopes (0. 12 for bacterivorous protists, 0. 10 for herbivorous protists, and 0. 13 for copepods) that were approximately double that of phototrophic protists (0. 06). The massive annual algal blooms observed in high latitudes are due in part to a fundamental difference in the relationship between growth and temperature for phototrophic protists and their grazers...|$|R
