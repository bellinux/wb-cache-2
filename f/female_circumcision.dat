5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting and <b>female</b> <b>circumcision,</b> is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where FGM is common, the practice's many variants {{are reflected in}} dozens of terms, often alluding to purification. In the Bambara language, spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as bolokoli ("washing your hands") and in the Igbo language in eastern Nigeria as isa aru or iwu aru ("having your bath"). A common Arabic term for purification has the root t-h-r, used for male and <b>female</b> <b>circumcision</b> (tahur and tahara). It is also known in Arabic as khafḍ or khifaḍ.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as <b>female</b> <b>circumcision</b> or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E

40|$|For decades feminists {{worldwide}} {{have addressed}} and combated the harmful practice of female genital mutilation, while largely overlooking male circumcision as genital mutilation. The practices {{of male and}} <b>female</b> <b>circumcisions</b> {{are the result of}} mainstream ideologies that shape our understandings and consciousness of sexuality and health. The larger framework within which circumcision operates is referred to as “circumcisionism. ” Circumcisionism is the hegemonic view that genital circumcision is a normative and acceptable practice. This paper focuses on circumcision of non-consenting male minors, arguing that it is genital mutilation and that the practice should be a feminist issue, as well as a human rights concern. Feminists are encouraged to recognize male circumcision and that Western culture embraces genital mutilation as a perfunctory, yet harmful practice. Travis Wisdo...|$|R
5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as <b>female</b> <b>circumcision,</b> {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with male circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E

50|$|Farasuto Forest {{is among}} the few {{remaining}} and now isolated forest patches left {{in the whole of}} the Gambia. It transpires that the forest surrounding Farasuto was cut down about 60 years ago (from local information), that is in the late 1940s. The section which is now the reserve was in earlier days used as a place for ceremonial male and <b>female</b> <b>circumcisions</b> and was therefore spared. It may be compared with the somewhat larger Abuko forest which will be known to many visitors to the country. Abuko is the Gambia’s largest remnant block of forest (around 45 ha, 110 acres; more if you include the reserve’s woodland) and is apparently the Gambia’s most visited tourist destination. Farasuto Forest is small in comparison (4.5ha, 11 acres) and lies about 10 miles south-east of Abuko.|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{universal}} applicability {{of human rights}} has been a symbol of hope that peace and justice {{in the world is}} possible, since the late 1940 s. Although it is a fiction, and anthropology can proof this bringing countless evidence, strong general awareness of this idea still inspires many in their strive for freedom and dignity as well as opposition to violence. The aim of this thesis is to bring two controversial examples, illustrating how and why value-driven struggle for promotion of human rights fails. The aim is nevertheless not to compromise this noble idea but to contribute to its more thorough understanding as well as more effective implementation. A chapter on so called <b>female</b> genital <b>circumcision</b> (also known as female genital mutilation) offers critical analyses of the international campaign for eradication of this practice, led by international feminist movement since the late 1970 s. The attention is drawn mainly to manipulation of facts and unfair argumentation, thanks to which the so called <b>female</b> genital <b>circumcision</b> was labelled cruel practice of backward societies serving degradation and control of women, making more structured understanding of reality impossible.

40|$|Background: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), {{is now one}} of the {{greatest}} challenges facing the world. Sexual transmission is the primary route of human immunodeficiency virus infection worldwide. Male circumcision is being considered as strategy to reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS. Material and Methods: The present study was conducted on 200 HIV positive clients. They were screened for bacterial causes of STIs (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum and Gardnerella vaginalis). Results: There were 138 males and 62 females. The males were examined and the circumcision status was observed. In the <b>females,</b> <b>circumcision</b> status of their male partners was observed. The coinfection of HIV and STIs in circumcised and uncircumcised cases was found out. Diagnosis was made using standard tests. A total of 23 % cases were diagnosed to have HIV -STI coinfection. Most common diagnosed diseases were Chlamydia (10 %), Gonorrhoea (9 %), Bacterial Vaginosis (4. 8 %) and Syphilis (2. 5 %). The coinfection rate in uncircumcised cases was found to be higher (29. 2 % in males and 39. 2 % in females) as compared to the circumcised cases (14. 2 % in males and 13. 6 % in females). Conclusion: The present study suggests that circumcision is a protective factor for acquisition of STIs in HIV positive clients but other factors like sexual behaviours, use of barrier contraceptives, drug abuse etc also play a role...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{possible}} {{association of}} {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI) with ritual circumcision on the eighth day of life was studied by analyzing the epidemiology of urinary tract infections {{during the first year}} of life in 169 children with UTI (56 males and 113 females) born in Israel from 1979 to 1984. Forty-eight percent of the episodes of UTI occurring in males appeared during the 12 days following circumcision, and the increased incidence during that period was highly significant. The median age of the males at the time of the UTI was 16 days, compared with seven months in <b>females.</b> Ritual Jewish <b>circumcision</b> as practiced in Israel may be a predisposing factor for UTI during the 12 -day period following that procedure...|$|R
5000|$|Numbers of circumcised females {{decrease}} in lower age brackets. Among all females surveyed in a 2011 study of over 15,000 individuals, 75.5% of women aged 10-29 report being circumcised. The practice {{appears to be}} more common in rural areas where 83.7% of females have experienced FGM. While these numbers are lower than older age brackets, they are largely consistent with the 10- to 29-year-old group surveyed in an identical 2008 study. [...] This would suggest that any decline in practice has slowed significantly or stagnated. The same study showed the majority of respondents, both male and <b>female,</b> believed that <b>circumcision</b> was necessary for girls (64%). More men (70.3%) believed it was needed than women (57.6%). Belief in the practice is stronger in the lower income quintiles and considerably weaker in the upper quintiles.|$|R

25|$|Notwithstanding these facts, {{there is}} a belief amongst some Muslims – {{particularly}} though not entirely exclusively in (sub-Saharan) Africa – that <b>female</b> <b>circumcision</b> (specifically the cutting of the prepuce or hood of the clitoris) is religiously vindicated by {{the existence of a}} handful of ḥadīths which apparently recommend it.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Whether {{immigrant}} children receive unnecessary treatments and surgical procedures {{to a greater}} extent than non-immigrants remains controversial. The study investigates whether hospitalization rates differ between immigrant and non-immigrant preschool children and the extent to which such differences relate to specific pathological conditions. Methods: All discharges occurring to children aged 1 - 5 years between 2005 and 2007 in the Italian Region of Veneto (4, 8 million inhabitants) were analyzed by Diagnosis Related Groups-DRGs. Crude and age-standardized hospitalization rate ratios-RRs of immigrant versus Italian children were computed. Results: Hospitalization rates for medical conditions were similar between immigrant and Italian children. However, hospitalization rates among {{immigrant children}} were significantly lower than those among Italians for all the most frequent surgical DRGs. RRs of immigrant versus Italian children were 0. 46 (0. 41 - 0. 51) for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy and 0. 46 (0. 38 - 0. 57) for testes procedures in males; 0. 44 (0. 38 - 0. 49) for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy and 0. 47 (0. 34 - 0. 65) for extraocular procedures in <b>females.</b> Only <b>circumcision</b> procedures were more frequent (four-fold excess) among immigrants. Conclusion: Hospitalization rates for all most frequent surgical procedures are significantly lower among immigrants compared to non-immigrant preschool children. Reduced surgery rates among immigrants might result from a complex interplay between parental attitudes and knowledge on pediatric conditions, language barriers, and access to primary care...|$|R
40|$|<b>Female</b> genital mutilation/female <b>circumcision</b> (FGM/FC) {{refers to}} a group of {{traditional}} practices that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural, religious, or other non-therapeutic reasons. These practices are usually performed by a nonmedical practitioner in the home or other nonclinical setting. Complications occurring immediately after the practice as well as those encountered months and years afterward can result in disability or premature death. In 1996 Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop estimates of the prevalence of women and girls with or at risk for FGM/FC in the United States.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					There {{has been}} a large decline in <b>female</b> genital <b>circumcision</b> (FGC) in Egypt in recent decades. Understanding how this change has {{occurred}} so rapidly {{has been a}}n area {{of particular interest to}} policymakers and public health officials alike who seek to further discourage the practice elsewhere. 				 				 					 						Methods 					We document the trends in this decline in the newest cohorts of young girls and explore the influences of three pathways&# 8212;socioeconomic development, social media messages, and women&# 8217;s empowerment&# 8212;for explaining the observed trends. Using the 2005 and 2008 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys, we estimate several logistic regression models to (1) examine individual and household determinants of circumcision, (2) assess the contributions of different pathways through which these changes may have occurred, and (3) assess the robustness of different pathways when unobserved community differences are taken into account. 				 				 					 						Results 					Across all communities, socioeconomic status, social media messages, and women&# 8217;s empowerment all have significant independent effects on the risk of circumcision. However, after accounting for unobserved differences across communities, only mother&# 8217;s education and household wealth significantly predict circumcision outcomes. Additional analyses of maternal education suggest that increases in women&# 8217;s education may be causally related to the reduction in FGC prevalence. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Women&# 8217;s empowerment and social media appear to be more important in explaining differences across communities; within communities, socioeconomic status is a key driver of girls&# 8217; circumcision risk. Further investigation of community-level women&# 8217;s educational attainment for mothers suggests that investments made in female education a generation ago may have had echo effects on girls&# 8217; FGC risk a generation later...|$|R
