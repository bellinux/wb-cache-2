30|$|The {{coefficients}} of two {{variables related to}} brightness show that driving in darkness increases the probability of the crash. The following two reasons can explain this result: First, the <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlight</b> at night bothers the opposite direction driver’s vision and {{makes it difficult for}} the driver to measure the distance accurately and increases the probability of the crash. Second, driving in darkness causes drowsiness and deviation to the left and increases the probability of a head-on crash.|$|E

5000|$|From launch, Chrysler {{also offered}} a [...] "Sportspack" [...] {{option for the}} GL 2.0-litre. This {{included}} exterior striping, quartz-halogen <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights,</b> a sports steering wheel, low-fuel warning light, tachometer and steel belted radial tyres.|$|R
50|$|Night View Assist: optional, uses two {{near-infrared}} (NIR) illuminators {{mounted in}} the headlamp clusters and a camera in the windshield. The infrared beams are {{picked up by the}} camera and an image is displayed in the instrument cluster. Mercedes-Benz claims that this system provides the same viewable distance as <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights,</b> without blinding oncoming motorists.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, the {{existing}} lighting on a vehicle {{is modified to}} create warning beacons. In the case of wig-wag lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights,</b> or, in some countries, the rear fog lights. It can also involve drilling out other lights on the vehicle to add ‘hideaway’ or ‘corner strobes’.|$|R
5000|$|A {{prismatic}} rear-view mirror—sometimes {{called a}} [...] "day/night mirror"—can be [...] {{to reduce the}} brightness and glare of lights, mostly for <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> of vehicles behind which would otherwise be reflected directly into the driver's eyes at night. This type of mirror is made {{of a piece of}} glass that is wedge-shaped in cross section—its front and rear surfaces are not parallel.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{information regarding the}} market-weighted prevalence of lightemitting diode (LED) light sources for exterior lighting on model year 2008 vehicles sold in the U. S. The main findings were as follows: (1) LEDs are employed to some degree for virtually all required exterior lighting functions on U. S. vehicles (<b>high-beam</b> <b>headlighting</b> is the exception, for which LEDs are expected to appear later in 2008), and (2) rear signaling and marking functions show the highest usage of these light sources. Supplemental information about headlamp bulb types, headlamp optics, and rear turnsignal color is also presented...|$|R
50|$|As NIT Trichy’s {{contribution}} to Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan, PSR invited school {{children in the}} neighbourhood to witness and take part in Pragyan 2017. Dhisai, the JEE awareness campaign was conducted this year with help from Tamil Nadu government. A mock JEE test was conducted in six centers across Tamil Nadu. Under the Catalyst initiative, science experiments were demonstrated to students of two neighbouring schools. Pragyan Pizza Project was a pet project of PSR; customers at Domino's Pizza, Trichy were gifted saplings which could be planted in their surroundings. A fire safety awareness campaign was conducted with help from personnel from Tamil Nadu Fire Rescue Services. The state-level final round of Veetukku Oru Vignaani, a science exhibition contest for school students conducted by the Puthiya Thalaimurai television network was hosted by Pragyan at NIT Trichy. A Campus Initiative Week was celebrated in which volunteers of the team took many steps to improve life in the campus. An awareness campaign {{against the use of}} <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> was also conducted.|$|R
40|$|Most deer–vehicle {{collisions}} (DVCs) {{occur at}} night when deer are active {{and the ability of}} motorists to see them is impaired. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the ability of motorists to detect deer at night and examine select factors which may influence detection distances. We examined the ability of motorists to detect deer at night and the factors that influence detection using deer decoys, volunteer motorists, and a series of driving courses. Deer decoys were detected at significantly greater distances when located on the right rather than on the left side of the road and when road 2 ̆ 7 s edge. Detection distances were significantly longer for <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> versus low-beam headlights. Moving decoys were detected at similar distances to stationary ones. Additionally, decoys were detected at greater distances in the absence of reflectors than in their presence. The frequency of nocturnal DVCs can be reduced by using high-beam headlamps and minimizing the number of roadside reflectors, signs, and other bright objects that distract the driver 2 ̆ 7 s attention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{enhanced}} method for detecting light blobs (LBs) for intelligent headlight control (IHC). The main {{function of the}} IHC system is to automatically convert <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> to low beam when vehicles {{are found in the}} vicinity. Thus, to implement the IHC, it is necessary to detect preceding or oncoming vehicles. Generally, this process of detecting vehicles is done by detecting LBs in the images. Previous works regarding LB detection can largely be categorized into two approaches by the image type they use: low-exposure (LE) images or autoexposure (AE) images. While they each have their own strengths and weaknesses, the proposed method combines them by integrating the use of the partial region of the AE image confined by the lane detection information and the LE image. Consequently, the proposed method detects headlights at various distances and taillights at close distances using LE images while handling taillights at distant locations by exploiting the confined AE images. This approach enhances the performance of detecting the distant LBs while maintaining low false detections. Index Terms—Intelligent headlight control (IHC), lane detection, light blob (LB) detection, low-exposure (LE) image, vanishing-point estimation. I...|$|R
5000|$|Just more of {{the same}} for 1953 Sixty Special, as all the {{attention}} was towards the new Eldorado convertible. Minimal trim changes to the Sixty Special included wider rocker panel moldings, which moved the chrome louvers higher up on the rear doors, and a revised grille and bumper. However, significant engineering changes were made to the 1953 models, including a new 12-volt electrical system and a jump in power for the 331 cuin L engine - now rated at [...] Two new notable options debuted this year. First, the $619.55 trunk-mounted air conditioning unit - developed by Frigidaire - was available in all closed-body Cadillac models. Second, the dashboard-mounted [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] became available. This automated system, which automatically dimmed the <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> when a forward-facing sensor indicated oncoming traffic, would become a Cadillac option for nearly the next forty years. Also available - for $325 - was a set of five wire wheels, which hadn't been seen on factory Cadillacs since the 1930s. Wire wheels would occasionally continue to be optionally available through 1992. The minor changes for the 1953 Sixty Special worked wonders, as sales of the $4,304 car was now up to a record 20,000 copies. Weight was up to 4415 lb, and optional wire wheels would add an additional 30 lb.|$|R
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|R
2500|$|... 1979 saw the crossed-flag emblems on {{the nose}} and fuel door revert to those seen on the '77 model. Three popular {{features}} introduced on the '78 pace car replicas made it into this year’s production: the new bucket seats, {{the front and rear}} spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard anti-theft alarm system. Tungsten-halogen <b>high-beam</b> <b>headlights</b> became standard as did an AM-FM radio, {{and for the first time}} a cassette tape player could be added as a $234 option. Heavy duty shock absorbers could now be ordered without the full Gymkhana suspension. An auxiliary electric engine cooling fan was first installed, but only on L-82 equipped cars with air conditioning. Rocker panels and rear window trim were painted black. Output for all engines increased due to new [...] "open flow" [...] mufflers. The dual-snorkel air intake introduced on L-82 cars the previous year was now fitted to all cars and the base engine now generated [...] The optional L-82 engine increased to [...] This was the final year a manual gearbox could be ordered with the L-82 engine. This was also the last year for the M21 close-ratio 4-speed, a gearbox that, as in previous years, required the optional L-82 engine. A wide-ratio 4-speed was available for all cars. Noteworthy is that about 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In '79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes. This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.|$|R
