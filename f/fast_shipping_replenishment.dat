50|$|The Combat Logistics Force was {{formerly}} called the Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force. After a 2012 reorganization, this program now maintains the 32 government-operated fleet underway <b>replenishment</b> <b>ships</b> {{from the former}} Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF), such as dry cargo/ammunition <b>ships,</b> <b>fast</b> combat support <b>ships,</b> ammunition <b>ships,</b> and fleet <b>replenishment</b> oilers.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. An analytical {{approach to the}} problem of replenishing task forces at sea is investigated, using a random walk model. The type of replenishment operations considered consists of two <b>replenishment</b> <b>ships</b> of different types, each replenishing L combatant ships of different types. The combatant ships are initially distributed into queues of length M and N between the two <b>replenishment</b> <b>ships.</b> As each combatant ship completes its first replenishment, it then enters the queue of the other <b>replenishment</b> <b>ship.</b> Thus each combatant ship is replenished by both <b>replenishment</b> <b>ships.</b> <b>Replenishment</b> times for the combatant ships are assumed to be independent, positive valued random variables whose distributions are dependent upon both <b>replenishment</b> <b>ship</b> type and combatant <b>ship</b> type. The <b>replenishment</b> of the task force is completed whenever 2 L replenishments, two for each combatant ship, are completed. The total replenishment time is shown to be the maximum of certain partial sums of the individual replenishment times. A general expression for the distribution function of the total replenishment time is sought by various methods of analysis. A computer simulation is used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the form of the distribution function of total replenishment time for a specific underway replenishment operation. Some examples are discussed. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|A leader–follower {{synchronization}} output {{feedback control}} scheme is presented for the <b>ship</b> <b>replenishment</b> problem where only positions are measured. No mathematical model of the leader ship is required, and the control scheme relies on nonlinear observers to estimate velocity and acceleration of all ships to realize the feedback control law. The scheme yields semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop errors. The bound {{is a function of}} the main ship acceleration, and under the assumption of zero main ship acceleration the closed-loop errors are semi-globally exponentially converging. The results are verified through experiments on a model-scale ship...|$|R
