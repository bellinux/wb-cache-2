2500|$|Amanpour {{is married}} to American James Rubin, a former US Assistant Secretary of State and {{spokesman}} for the US State Department during the Clinton administration and an informal adviser to former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and to former President Barack Obama. Their son, Darius John Rubin, was born in 2000. Having previously lived in London, they moved back to New York City in 2010, where they rented an apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side. But in May 2013, Rubin announced that the family would return to London to work on several projects, and in October of the same year, Amanpour stated {{that she and her}} husband would be relocating to London permanently: [...] "Right now I'd have to say that London is my home... My family are in England, and my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> loving reacquainting ourselves with all the friends we left behind".|$|E
2500|$|Oates founded The Ontario Review, a {{literary}} magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, {{her husband and}} fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the U.S. and Canada: [...] "We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature." [...] In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as [...] "a marriage of like minds—both my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it—we trade {{and we talk about}} our reading at meal times…".|$|E
2500|$|That same day, Jean {{responded with}} a public statement, saying [...] "I wish to tell you {{unequivocally}} that both my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> proud to be Canadian {{and that we have}} the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," [...] and {{went on to say that}} in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E
5000|$|My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a {{short-lived}} black-and-white British sitcom starring Evelyn Laye <b>and</b> her <b>husband</b> Frank Lawton, who played themselves. It ran for seven episodes in 1956. My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> written by Geoffrey Kerr and James Leasor. It {{was made for}} the ITV network by Associated-Rediffusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{forgot that}} you strip women, you Northern soldiers! But I forgot, too," [...] she added, with a sarcastic smile, [...] "that you <b>are</b> also my <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in your room." ...|$|R
5000|$|My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a typical}} {{domestic}} sitcom {{made for the}} refined <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> wife team Evelyn Laye and Frank Lawton. As well as typical comedy situations for domestic sitcoms, My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also featured humorous songs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thus far, {{you know}} {{little or nothing}} about me, Mr. Dexter," [...] I said. [...] "You are, as I believe, quite unaware that my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> not living {{together}} at the present time." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was beginning, [...] "Oh no, oh no," [...] but I cut in. [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{on our way}} to {{the next}} Regionic capital, and we are {{somewhat}} hurried. You will be quite well looked after by the neighbors here, and I see that we are rather in your housekeeper's way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't suppose I've {{enjoyed the}} last quarter of an hour, do you?" [...] said Lady Blemley bitterly. [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> very fond of Tobermory--at least, we were before this horrible {{accomplishment}} was infused into him; but now, of course, the only thing is to have him destroyed as soon as possible." ...|$|E
50|$|My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> a British sitcom {{starring}} Mollie Sugden and William Moore that {{aired on}} ITV from 9 January 1987 to 20 May 1988. It was written and created by Pam Valentine and Michael Ashton.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know Junius half {{as well as}} I wish I did," [...] said Annie, as she {{finished}} the letter, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very sure, indeed, that he will make a good <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad he has got Roberta March--as he wants her." ...|$|R
50|$|You <b>are</b> the <b>Husband</b> Lord, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the soul-bride.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} down {{to be with you}} also, and to help my husband. I shall take charge of the nursing and tending of your sick, and I hope I shall be of some real use to you. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> so sorry for you in your trouble. I know you will be brave and patient. We will all do our best, and be hopeful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young {{people will}} be young people, Monsieur Bertram," [...] Madame Vaillant said, smiling, [...] "and my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> not of {{those who think that}} it is {{necessary}} to carry a prim face, and to attire one's self in ugly garments, as a proof of religion. Youth is the time for mirth and happiness, and nature teaches a maiden what is becoming to her; why then should we blame her for setting off the charms God has given her to their best advantage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you happen}} to {{remember}} that your <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> as near as may be of about the same height? Very good, so far. Did you, in the next place, miss Bowmore's traveling coat and cap from their customary peg? I am the thief, dearest lady; I put them on my own humble self. Did you hear a sudden noise in the hall? Oh, forgive me--I made the noise! And it did just what I wanted of it. It brought the spy up from the kitchen, suspecting that something might be wrong.|$|E
60|$|The {{confusion}} that followed was indescribable. The doors were almost barricaded. My sister <b>and</b> her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> allowed through easily enough, {{as we were}} known to be subscribers, but almost every one else seemed to be undergoing a sort of cross-examination. My brother-in-law was disposed to be irritable.|$|R
6000|$|... "These cups," [...] she said, [...] "were all the {{personal}} property of my <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> therefore free to take them. Many {{of them have}} been in his family for a very long time. Their sale will enable me to live until I can form some plans for the future." ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite Lassie {{doing well}} with the TV audiences, Tommy Rettig sought release from his {{contract}} in the popular series' fourth season. [...] Clayton quit the production as well at that time. [...] "My home life was being absolutely wrecked," [...] she explained. [...] "I had four children <b>and</b> a <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always working".|$|R
6000|$|As I was hurrying out of {{the gates}} of the gardens I looked in the {{direction}} of the railroad station, and there I saw Pomeroy pulled by one bath-chair man and the other one talking to him. In twenty bounds I reached him. [...] "Go back for your young lady," [...] I cried to Robertson, Angelica's man, [...] "and bring her here on the run. She sent me for you." [...] Away went Robertson, and then I said to the astonished Pomeroy, [...] "Sir, there is no time for explanations. Your lady-love will be with you in a minute. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> going to Edinburgh to-morrow, and I have looked up all the trains. There is one which leaves here at twenty minutes past six. If she comes soon you will have time to catch it. Have you your baggage ready?" ...|$|E
60|$|In the hospitals, {{among these}} American young men, I could not {{describe}} {{to you what}} mutual attachments, and how passing deep and tender these boys. Some have died, but the love for them lives as long as I draw breath. These soldiers know how to love too, when once {{they have the right}} person and the right love offered them. It is wonderful. You see I am running off into the clouds, but this is my element. Abby, I am writing this note this afternoon in Major H's office--he is away sick--I am here {{a good deal of the}} time alone. It is a dark rainy afternoon--we don't know what is going on down in front, whether Meade is getting the worst of it or not--(but the result of the big elections cheers us). I believe fully in Lincoln--few know the rocks and quicksands he has to steer through. I enclose you a note Mrs. O'C. handed me to send you--written, I suppose, upon impulse. She is a noble Massachusetts woman, is not very rugged in health--I am there very much--her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> great friends too. Well, I will close--the rain is pouring, the sky leaden, it is between 2 and 3. I am going to get some dinner, and then to the hospital. Good-bye, dear friends, and I send my love to all.|$|E
5000|$|Al Mana married American {{pop singer}} Janet Jackson in 2012. On April 6, 2016, Jackson announced, [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{planning}} our family", resulting in her postponing her tour. On October 12, 2016, Jackson confirmed {{she was expecting}} her first child with Al Mana. Their son Eissa was born January 3, 2017. In April 2017, Jackson's representative confirmed Jackson and Al Mana had separated on an undisclosed date.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor young woman. She {{has lost}} her <b>husband,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid, now has lost her friends also. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{told that she}} is not well off;--and from what <b>I</b> see <b>and</b> hear, <b>I</b> fancy that here in England a young lady without a dowry cannot easily replace a lover. I suppose, too, Miss Trefoil is not quite in her first youth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The theatres?" [...] {{said another}} lady. [...] "How {{you must have}} enjoyed them. I just love the theatres. Last week my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> at the Palatial--it's moving pictures--where they have that film with the motor {{collision}} running. It's just wonderful. You see the motors going at full speed, and then smash right into one another--and all the people killed--it's really fine." ...|$|R
6000|$|In England {{we should}} {{certainly}} {{not have done}} all this in public, <b>and</b> my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> terribly put to the blush; indeed, I felt my whole head and neck burning, and {{caught a glimpse of}} myself in a dreadful mirror, my white bridal dress and flaxen hair making my fiery face look, my brothers would have said, 'as if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> skinned.' ...|$|R

5000|$|In such a time, Greig once noted to {{the student}} body [...] "My husband and I {{would like to tell}} you how much we have enjoyed working with you... It has given us {{constant}} and deep pleasure to see you grow intellectually and artistically under our care. Those of you who are now going on to University carry with you our wishes for your success and happiness - and also much affection. Remember that my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> now a part of your lives, and will always be here to help you. Visit us - we shall miss you! Those of you who were not offered a place with us in the coming year, do not lose heart - try to apply the methods which you were shown at Thornton wherever you go. Work hard and you will have the success you hope for. Those of you coming back - we have much work to do..." ...|$|E

5000|$|One day, as Margarete and Söfren sit by Mari's bedside, Margarete confesses: [...] "My first <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> engaged {{for many}} years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow. We knew that the widow was weak and could {{scarcely}} live long. It was a sore temptation to us. God forgive us ... we built our happiness on the hope of another's death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{that night}} we sat together, our arms round each other, each {{strengthening}} each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next evening had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{on our way to}} London, but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger, and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future.|$|R

40|$|Extract] We {{recently}} had a fence installed at our house. The company arrived at 7 : 30 a. m. and worked until 5 : 30 p. m. But {{they were unable to}} complete the job, so they had to come back late on a Friday night to finish up. It was the only other time they had available. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> both busy scientists, one tenured and one not, with two small children. Yet, one of the fence installers commented on how lucky we are to have a schedule flexible enough to be at home at a certain time to meet up with workers, to take children to appointments, or to do whatever it is we need to do. He was right...|$|E
40|$|Coming from a {{large family}} of dentists, I have always known that I {{wanted to be a}} dentist myself. It was {{important}} for me to attend a college where I would be able to have the education that would make me a competitive candidate for dental school. I began undergrad at NSU in 2003, majoring in Biology, and graduated in 2006 with my Bachelor’s in Science. I was involved in several extracurricular activities and had a student job on campus. In 2007, I began my journey as a dental student at Nova Southeastern University College of Dental Medicine, where I obtained the latest and most advanced education among some great leaders and innovators in the dental field. After graduating Dental School in 2011, I was an associate dentist in private practice and corporate dental offices, allowing me to continue to expand my knowledge in dentistry and in the dental business. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> now business owners of Cox Dental Care, PA. I love my job as a dentist, I get to know people and make an impact on their oral and systemic health. During my presentation I will share my path provide some tips that I have acquired during my career...|$|E
3000|$|When <b>I</b> married, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{not able}} to afford for an apartment. Both my parents and my parents in law {{qualified}} for pension benefits {{and they were the}} kind of middle class in a relatively good financial situation. Hence, they provided monetary assistance, paying the down payment for us. They were not expecting us to repay the money. We are not planning to give money to them every month, but we will definitely provide financial support when they need it. (Worker, 29) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Amy Roloff {{commented on}} the {{beginnings}} of the show: [...] "TLC came to us about five or six years ago, and so we suddenly realized we were given a great opportunity to educate people about dwarfism. When it was offered that we do a show about our lives, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> like, [...] "Wow, nothing like this has even been on the air." [...] Nothing had depicted dwarfism in an everyday way. Lo and behold, a few episodes turned into six seasons. And here we are." ...|$|R

"I feel sure of one thing, {{that it will}} be a great {{saving to}} your <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> nearly sure that that ought not to be a matter of {{indifference}} to him.
