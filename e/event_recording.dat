60|$|Dreams only form {{subjects}} of good dream-stories when the vision coincides with and adequately represents an unknown {{event in the}} past, the present, or the future. We dream, however vividly, {{of the murder of}} Rizzio. Nobody is surprised at that, the incident being familiar to most people, in history and art. But, if we dreamed of being present at an unchronicled scene in Queen Mary's life, and if, after the dream was recorded, a document proving its accuracy should be for the first time recovered, then there is matter for a good dream-story. {8} Again, we dream of an event not to be naturally guessed or known by us, and our dream (which should be recorded before tidings of the fact arrive) tallies with the news of the event when it comes. Or, finally, we dream of an <b>event</b> (<b>recording</b> the dream), and that event occurs in the future. In all these cases the actual occurrence of the unknown event is the only addition to the dream's usual power of crumpling up time and space.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} problem with such free-form <b>event</b> <b>records</b> {{is that each}} application developer individually determines what information {{should be included in}} an audit <b>event</b> <b>record,</b> and the overall format in which that record should be presented to the audit log. This variation in format among thousands of instrumented applications makes the job of parsing audit <b>event</b> <b>records</b> by analysis tools (such as the Novell Sentinel product, for example) difficult and error-prone. Such domain and application specific parsing code included in analysis tools is also difficult to maintain, as changes to event formats inevitably work their way into newer versions of the applications over time.|$|R

30|$|It {{should also}} be noted that almost all of the 25 % fire <b>events</b> were <b>recorded</b> in sites {{spanning}} three sub-areas across the study area (eastern, western, and central sites), whereas most of the 10 % fire <b>events</b> were <b>recorded</b> in sites restricted to only one or two sub-areas (Figure 6). Exceptions were 1670 (25 % fire <b>event</b> <b>recorded</b> in two sub areas), and 1864 (10 % <b>event</b> <b>recorded</b> in three sub-areas). Given the large sample size during the 1860 s, it seems likely that the 1864 fire event was actually two separate, non-contiguous burns. This convergence of evidence implies that the 25 % composite MFI is likely reflective of extensive, wind-driven fire events.|$|R
