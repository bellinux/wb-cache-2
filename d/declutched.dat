25|$|At 19:00 {{overheating}} alarm {{was received}} from the cooling water system of the port main engine and its power had to be reduced to half. At times the engine had to be run at full power for {{short periods of time}} to keep the bow facing the wind. Shortly after 22:00 the speed of the starboard main engine suddenly dropped from 1,000 rpm to roughly 270 rpm, but was restored when the engine was <b>declutched</b> from the shaft. When the second engineer closed the clutch at the normal coupling speed of 400 rpm, the engine stalled. After restarting he attempted coupling the engine again at 1,000 rpm, but it still would not run faster than 270 rpm when connected to the shaft. When the captain received a report that the starboard main engine was no longer usable he decided to abandon the ship and ordered the evacuation of the remaining crew at 22:16. The combination turned parallel to the waves with port side facing the wind and began to drift uncontrollably.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream {{up through the}} rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then <b>declutched</b> prior to executing the take-off run.|$|E
50|$|A few cars, {{notably the}} Alfa Romeo Alfetta, Porsche 924, and Chevrolet Corvette (since 1997), sought a more even weight {{distribution}} between {{front and back}} by placing {{the weight of the}} transmission {{at the rear of the}} car, combined with the rear axle to form a transaxle. The clutch was mounted with the transaxle and so the propeller shaft rotated continuously with the engine, even when in neutral gear or <b>declutched.</b>|$|E

On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or [...] "synchro-rings" [...] are used {{in addition to the}} dog clutch to closely match the rotational speeds of {{the two sides of the}} (<b>declutched)</b> transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then <b>declutched.</b> The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled drag hinges with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to {{leap into the}} air. With all the engine power now applied to the forward thrusting propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.|$|E
5000|$|Pulse and Glide {{consists}} of rapid acceleration {{to a given}} speed (the [...] "pulse" [...] or [...] "burn"), followed by a period of coasting or gliding down to a lower speed, {{at which point the}} burn-coast sequence is repeated. Coasting is most efficient when the engine is not running, although some gains can be realized with the engine on (to maintain power to brakes, steering and ancillaries) and the vehicle in neutral. Most modern petrol vehicles cut off the fuel supply completely when coasting (over-running) in gear, although the moving engine adds considerable frictional drag and speed is lost more quickly than with the engine <b>declutched</b> from the drivetrain.|$|E
50|$|In large ships, an {{emergency}} stop button pulls the countershaft for the fuel pumps to the stop position, cutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch propeller, the stop button may <b>declutch</b> the engine from the propeller.|$|R
40|$|The solo duck wave-energy {{converter}} (WEC) captures {{power in}} a point absorber manner, hence it exhibits high power-capture efficiency within only a narrow bandwidth. Passive control {{is characterized by a}} unidirectional power flow, and thus its engineering implementation can be simplified. In this paper, two typical passive control strategies, latching and <b>declutching</b> control, are applied to the solo duck WEC to improve its power-capture performance at wave periods larger and smaller than the natural period of the WEC, respectively. Special attention is paid to the peak value of instantaneous WEC performance parameters, including the peak motion excursion, the peak power take-off (PTO) moment, and the peak-to-average power ratio, when the captured power is maximized. Performance differences between the linear and coulomb loads are also investigated. Results show that both latching and <b>declutching</b> control can effectively improve captured power, but also incidentally increase the peak motion excursion and peak-to-average power ratio. When under latching and <b>declutching</b> control, the coulomb load leads to the same maximum relative capture width and peak motion excursion as the linear load, but presents smaller peak PTO moment and peak-to-average power ratio than the linear load, hence making the coulomb load the better choice for the solo duck WEC...|$|R
50|$|The new MCT {{transmission}} {{is essentially the}} 7G-Tronic transmission without a torque converter. Instead of a torque converter, it uses a compact wet startup clutch to start the car off, and also supports computer-controlled double <b>declutching.</b> The MCT (Multi-Clutch Technology) acronym refers to a planetary (automatic) transmission’s multiple clutches and bands for each gear.|$|R
50|$|A {{major problem}} with the {{autogyro}} was driving the rotor before takeoff. Several methods were attempted {{in addition to the}} coiled rope system, which could take the rotor speed to 50% of that required, at which point movement along the ground to reach flying speed was necessary, while tilting the rotor to establish autorotation. Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then <b>declutched</b> before the take-off run.|$|E

The Discovery Cruises web site listed her gross tonnage as 20,186, top speed as 18 kn and passenger capacity as 698. Propulsion was by four Fiat medium speed diesel engines with a combined power output of 18,000 shaft horsepower. The engines were individually clutched and geared in pairs to each of the two shafts which drive controllable pitch propellers. This arrangement enabled one or more engines to be shut down and <b>declutched</b> as required. Last registry was under the Saint Kitts and Nevis flag.|$|E

50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic <b>declutching</b> when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|R

50|$|These {{control the}} {{transmission}} system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting.

50|$|A novel {{alternative}} to the lift jet for auxiliary vertical thrust is to be employed by the VTOL Lockheed F-35B version of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program. This {{does not have a}} jet lift engine, but a central lift fan that is powered by the main engine via a driveshaft. When not needed, it is <b>declutched</b> from the engine so that it does not consume power (analogous to the transfer case of a four-wheel drive vehicle). The operational viability of this system remains to be seen, and all of the above drawbacks still apply: it is dead weight in flight, and together with the aircraft's internal weapons bays it takes up a great deal of internal space, reducing fuel and avionics load and requiring a bulkier and wider fuselage cross-section (which passes on to the A and C versions, even though they don't have a fan or V/STOL capability). It has, however, in pre-operational testing proven the ability to take off vertically and go supersonic in level flight in the same mission, a first for a combat aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Serious {{problems}} were encountered with the Porpoise-class' diesel-electric drive. This drove {{the decision to}} radically alter the propulsion plant. The Salmons were fitted with a so-called [...] "composite drive". In this arrangement, two main engines in the forward engine room drove generators in the fashion set by the Porpoises. In the after engine room, two side-by-side engines were clutched to reduction gears which sat forward of the engines, with vibration-isolating hydraulic clutches. The propeller shafts led aft {{from each of the}} reduction gears, and were sited outboard of the engines. Two high-speed electric motors were mounted outboard of each shaft, connected directly to the reduction gears. For surfaced operation the engines were clutched in to the reduction gears and drove the propellers directly, with the generator engines providing additional voltage to the motors. For submerged operation, the direct drive engines were <b>declutched</b> from the reduction gears and the motors drove the shafts with electricity supplied by the batteries. Since World War I the US Navy had sought a 21-knot fleet submarine to maneuver with the Standard-type battleships. The first attempts, with the [...] and the Barracuda-class [...] "V-boats" [...] in the 1920s, were failures due to unreliable engines. The Salmons were the first US submarine class to achieve the desired speed of 21 knots with a reliable propulsion plant. However, this unusual arrangement was quite cramped, making maintenance and repairs in the aft engine room somewhat difficult.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the sliding clutch gear and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the <b>declutch</b> mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the sliding clutch and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The <b>declutch</b> mechanism required adjustment to allow full drive lug engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the clutch drive lugs. To better evaluate the operation of the clutch components, the grease was cleaned out of the compartment and a boroscope used so that the action of the clutch could be seen.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Rajesh Rajamani. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 259 pages, appendices A-D. The {{amount of energy}} being consumed is increasing each year, with the highest sector being the transportation industry. Within the transportation sector, the highest area of oil consumption is in the small and lightweight vehicle category. With increasing oil prices and decreasing supply, methods of reducing oil consumption have been studied. One is by developing a hybrid vehicle, which combines {{the internal combustion engine}} with an additional power source. For lightweight vehicles, electric hybrid vehicles have been thoroughly studied. While hydraulic hybrids have been studied for larger applications such as delivery trucks and buses, little research has been done in the area of small, lightweight vehicles. Hydraulics have a higher power density than electronics, so hydraulic hybrids can get better performance than electric hybrids while reducing fuel consumption. In this research, a series and power-split architecture is studied for a passenger vehicle. Because of the additional hydraulic power source along with energy storage, the optimal way to control these vehicles is not known. Therefore, an energy management strategy must be developed to determine the optimal strategy for splitting the power between the engine and the hydraulics. Three different methods are used to develop the energy management strategy - a rule-based strategy based on dynamic programming results, stochastic dynamic programming, and model predictive control. An experimental hardware-in-the-loop setup is used to replicate a series hybrid in which the different energy management strategies are tried. Through simulation and experimentation, it was found that not one strategy works best in all scenarios, and variables such as knowledge of duty cycle and energy storage {{must be taken into account}} when developing the strategy. An input-coupled power-split hybrid was also studied, which combines the mechanical efficiency of the parallel hybrid with the engine management of a series hybrid. Through a series of simulations, a strategy that <b>declutched</b> the engine from the drivetrain while the vehicle is stopped gave a significant reduction in fuel consumption. Another advantage of the power-split architecture is the ability to operate the vehicle in different modes by declutching the engine and removing hydraulic units by the use of valves. By using this strategy, the fuel economy can be almost doubled over a baseline strategy which operates only in power-split mode. Finally, the size of the accumulator can have an effect on the fuel consumption, with a smaller accumulator leading to less fuel consumed; however, if the accumulator is too small, the performance starts to degrade with a downsized engine. The results of this research can be used to develop a toolbox that can be used for developing energy management strategies by having the user enter a model, objective function, and duty cycle for a system. By using other information, such as knowledge of duty cycle, the toolbox can determine the best method of developing the control strategy, reducing the amount of time and resources for developing an optimal control strategy...|$|E
