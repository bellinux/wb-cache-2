40|$|Although {{they usually}} {{comprise}} less than 10 percent of forest cover in western forests, <b>hardwoods</b> contribute greatly to sustaining biological richness. <b>Hardwoods</b> are highly preferred as cavity sites, are preferred foraging sites for several bird species, encourage insectivorous mammals and amphibians, and provide preferred substrate for many cryptogams and invertebrates. In the Pacific Northwest, two cavity-nesting species choose <b>hardwoods</b> for 70 {{percent or more}} of their nest sites, while many prefer <b>hardwoods,</b> even in coastal forests where <b>hardwoods</b> are scarce. Because many forest-dwelling species in the Pacific Northwest show strong preferences for <b>hardwoods,</b> <b>hardwoods</b> should be retained and managed as desired trees...|$|R

In four study landscapes, maps of forest cover for four time periods (1950, 1970, 1990, and projections for 2030) were combined with maps of potential forest types to measure changes in the extent and spatial pattern of northern <b>hardwoods,</b> cove <b>hardwoods,</b> mixed <b>hardwoods,</b> and oak-pine.

5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other <b>hardwood</b> species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other <b>hardwood</b> tree species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forests of}} the Black Mountains are {{typically}} divided into three zones based on altitude: the spruce-fir forest, the northern <b>hardwoods,</b> and the Appalachian <b>hardwoods.</b> The southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest (sometimes called the [...] "boreal" [...] or [...] "Canadian" [...] forest) is dominated by red spruce and Fraser fir, and coats the elevations above 5500 ft. The northern <b>hardwoods,</b> which consist primarily of beech, yellow birch, and buckeye, thrive between 4500 ft and 5500 ft. The more diverse Appalachian <b>hardwoods,</b> which include yellow poplar and various species of hickory, oak, and maple, dominate the slopes and stream valleys below 3000 ft.
