5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by <b>fixer</b> Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E

40|$|Paradoxically, {{symbiotic}} dinitrogen (N 2) <b>fixers</b> {{are abundant}} in nitrogen (N) -rich, phosphorus (P) -poor lowland tropical rain forests. One hypothesis {{to explain this}} pattern states that N 2 <b>fixers</b> have an advantage in acquiring soil P by producing more N-rich enzymes (phosphatases) that mineralise organic P than non-N 2 <b>fixers.</b> We assessed soil and root phosphatase activity between <b>fixers</b> and non-fixers in two lowland tropical rain forest sites, but also addressed the hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonisation (another P acquisition strategy) is greater on <b>fixers</b> than non-fixers. Root phosphatase activity and AM colonisation were higher for <b>fixers</b> than non-fixers, and strong correlations between AM colonisation and N 2 fixation at both sites suggest that the N–P interactions mediated by <b>fixers</b> may generally apply across tropical forests. We suggest that phosphatase enzymes and AM fungi enhance the capacity of N 2 <b>fixers</b> to acquire soil P, thus contributing to their high abundance in tropical forests...|$|R
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted <b>Fixer,</b> who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{the brainchild}} of Square Enix {{producer}} Masaru Oyamada, who had {{made a name for himself}} within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii, Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series. Instead of a social or card-based game, which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time, Oyamada wanted to create an action role-playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers, something which would worry him throughout its production. The main staff were made up of Oyamada, director Masato Yagi, and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki. Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series. After the initial release of Rise of Mana, Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post-launch content producer Naofumi Takuma. Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board, but Ando would have nothing to do with the project. Development began in July 2012. The game was constructed using the Unity engine. In addition to staff from Square Enix, main development was done by Japanese developer Goshow, and its server security and technical assistance was handled by <b>Fixer.</b> The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist Taiki, while another artist Ryota Murayama handled NPC and monster designs. The game's key art was created by in-house designer Dairaku Masahiko: he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo Isono died in 2013. Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to Isono's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism. The game's title was indicative of the title's nature as a new entry in the Mana series; other than a small card-battle mobile game in 2013, Circle of Mana, Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007.|$|E

40|$|This book {{reveals that}} ‘fixers’—local experts on whom foreign correspondents rely—play {{a much more}} {{significant}} role in international television newsgathering than has been documented or understood. Murrell explores the frames though which international reporting has traditionally been analysed and then shows that <b>fixers,</b> who have largely been dismissed by scholars as "logistical aides", are in fact central to the day-to-day decision-making that takes place on-the-road. Murrell looks at why and how <b>fixers</b> are selected and what their significance is to foreign correspondence. She asks if <b>fixers</b> help introduce a local perspective into the international news agenda, or if <b>fixers</b> are simply ‘People Like Us’ (PLU). Also included are excerpts from interviews with TV correspondents and <b>fixers</b> and in-depth case studies of correspondents in Iraq and Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|Dinitrogen {{fixation}} by plants (in symbiosis with root bacteria) is a {{major source}} of new nitrogen for land ecosystems 1. A long-standing puzzle 2 is that trees capable of nitrogen fixation are abundant in nitrogen-rich tropical forests, but absent or restricted to early successional stages in nitrogen-poor extra-tropical forests. This biome-scale pattern presents an evolutionary paradox 3, given that the physiological cost 4 of nitrogen fixation predicts the opposite pattern: <b>fixers</b> should be out-competed by non-fixers in nitrogen-rich conditions, but competitively superior in nitrogen-poor soils. Here we evaluate whether this paradox {{can be explained by the}} existence of different fixation strategies in tropical versus extra-tropical trees: facultative <b>fixers</b> (capable of downregulating fixation 5, 6 by sanctioning mutualistic bacteria 7) are common in the tropics, whereas obligate <b>fixers</b> (less able to downregulate fixation) dominate at higher latitudes. Using a game-theoretic approach, we assess the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which these fixation strategies emerge, and examine their dependence on climate-driven differences in the nitrogen cycle. We show that in the tropics, transient soil nitrogen deficits following disturbance and rapid tree growth favour a facultative strategy and the coexistence of <b>fixers</b> and non-fixers. In contrast, sustained nitrogen deficits following disturbance in extra-tropical forests favour an obligate fixation strategy, and cause <b>fixers</b> to be excluded in late successional stages. We conclude that biome-scale differences in the abundance of nitrogen <b>fixers</b> can be explained by the interaction between individual plant strategies and climatic constraints on the nitrogen cycle over evolutionary time...|$|R

40|$|Post-war Iraq is so {{dangerous}} that Western television correspondents {{have been forced}} to change their modus operandi and rely more heavily on locally-hired <b>fixers.</b> This article asks if the virtual absence of overseas reporters from Iraq’s streets has led to a less authentic news gathering role. Conversely, it may have delivered a more nuanced form of editorial and logistical task-sharing. This research draws on interviews conducted in 2007 and 2008 with twenty foreign correspondents, two senior news managers and five <b>fixers.</b> It employs Bourdieu’s analysis of cultural capital as a framework to examine the exchange of different forms of power and expertise between the players. Where trust is now at the forefront of this news gathering relationship, this research deconstructs the methods by which <b>fixers</b> are recruited and deployed.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the N 2 <b>fixers</b> in the tall Spartina alterniflora and short S. alterniflora marsh soils was investigated. Zero-order kinetics and first-order kinetics of acetylene reduction were {{used to describe the}} activity of the N 2 <b>fixers</b> in marsh soil slurries. It was found that the Vmax values were approximately 10 times greater for the N 2 <b>fixers</b> in the tall Spartina than in the short Spartina marsh when raffinose was used as the energy source. In addition, the (Ks + Sn) values were approximately 4 to 15 times lower for the N 2 <b>fixers</b> in the tall Spartina than in short Spartina marsh. First-order kinetics of nitrogen fixation for several substrates indicate that the N 2 <b>fixers</b> in the tall Spartina marsh were two to seven times more active than those in the short Spartina marsh. Ammonium chloride (25 μg/ml) did not inhibit nitrogen fixation in the tall Spartina marsh, but there was a 50 % inhibition in nitrogen fixation in the short Spartina marsh. On the other hand, sodium nitrate inhibited nitrogen fixation almost 100 % at 25 μg/ml in both soil environments. Amino nitrogen (25 to 100 μg/ml) had little or no effect on nitrogen fixation. The results indicate that the N 2 <b>fixers</b> in the tall Spartina marsh were physiologically more responsive to nutrient addition than those in the short Spartina marsh. This difference in the two populations {{may be related to the}} difference in daily tidal influence in the respective areas and thus provide another explanation for the enhanced S. alterniflora production in the creek bank soil system...|$|R
