The thermal insulation performances observed, even ten times better than common heat insulation materials can be achieved by applying VIPs, resulting in a great potential for the reduction of energy loss in thermal space with slim exterior-protected walls (Fricke et al. 2008; Baetens 2010; Nussbaumer et al. 2006; Nussbaumer et al. 2005; Brunner et al. 2012; Caps et al. 2001). The flat VIPs contain a porous core material which withstands the atmospheric air pressure, a gas-tight barrier envelope that is optimized for low air & moisture leakage rate and for a long service life to maintain the internal vacuum level, and getter or gas absorption materials, if necessary, to absorb internal gas from leakage or other sources. That is, the VIPs make use of vacuum to suppress heat transfer due to rarefied gaseous conduction (Bouquerel et al. 2012 a; Bouquerel et al. 2012 b; Alam et al. 2011). So the thermal adiabatic property of VIPs dramatically depends on the core materials and the internal gas pressure. The porous materials, such as, micro-open <b>foam,</b> nano-structured <b>power</b> and fine fiber, are commonly used as core materials of VIPs, which are easily evacuated and have minimum thermal conduction effect (Kwon et al. 2009). The heat transfer processing in VIPs is via solid conduction, rarefied gas conduction, radiation and convection occurring at interface of gas and solid wall which is nearly zero, is always ignored in calculation. The solid conduction and radiation depends on the structure, the porosity and properties of core materials, while the gas conduction by the residual gases embraced in the caves depends on the internal gas pressure which maybe increased with time. So the ETC. of VIPs must be function of the variables mentioned above.|$|R
