40|$|The {{nucleoprotein}} (NP) of the {{influenza virus}} exists as trimers, and its tail-loop binding pocket {{has been suggested}} as a potential target for antiinfluenza therapeutics. The possibility of NP as a drug target was validated by the recent reports that nucleozin and its analogs can inhibit viral replication by inducing aggregation of NP trimers. However, these inhibitors were identified by random screening, and the binding site and inhibition mechanism are unclear. We report a rational approach to target influenza virus with a new mechanism-disruption of NP-NP interaction. Consistent with recent work, <b>E</b> <b>339</b> A, R 416 A, and deletion mutant Delta 402 - 428 were unable to support viral replication {{in the absence of}} WT NP. However, only <b>E</b> <b>339</b> A and R 416 A could form hetero complex with WT NP, but the complex was unable to bind the RNA polymerase, leading to inhibition of viral replication. These results demonstrate the importance of the <b>E</b> <b>339</b> [...] . R 416 salt bridge in viral survival and establish the salt bridge as a sensitive antiinfluenza target. To provide further support, we showed that peptides encompassing R 416 can disrupt NP-NP interaction and inhibit viral replication. Finally we performed virtual screening to target <b>E</b> <b>339</b> [...] . R 416, and some small molecules identified were shown to disrupt the formation of NP trimers and inhibit replication of WT and nucleozin-resistant strains.

To explore further upstream the role played by this peptide, nonpeptidic agonists and antagonists of the apelin receptor are required. To identify such compounds that do not exist to date, we used an original fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay to screen a G-protein-coupled receptor-focused library of fluorescent compounds on the human EGFP-tagged apelin receptor. This led to isolated <b>E</b> <b>339</b> - 3 D 6 that displayed a 90 nM affinity and behaved as a partial agonist with regard to cAMP production and as a full agonist with regard to apelin receptor internalization.

40|$|Background— Inherited long-QT {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} prolonged QT interval on the ECG, syncope, and sudden death caused by ventricular arrhythmia. Causative mutations occur mostly in cardiac potassium and sodium channel subunit genes. Confidence in mutation pathogenicity is usually reached through family genotype-phenotype tracking, control population studies, molecular modeling, and phylogenetic alignments; however, biophysical testing offers {{a higher degree of}} validating evidence. Methods and Results— By using in vitro electrophysiological testing of transfected mutant and wild-type long-QT syndrome constructs into Chinese hamster ovary cells, we investigated the biophysical properties of 9 KCNQ 1 missense mutations (A 46 T, T 265 I, F 269 S, A 302 V, G 316 <b>E,</b> F <b>339</b> S, R 360 G, H 455 Y, and S 546 L) identified in a New Zealand-based long-QT syndrome screening program. We demonstrate through electrophysiology and molecular modeling that 7 of the missense mutations have profound pathological dominant-negative loss-of-function properties, confirming their likely disease-causing nature. This supports the use of these mutations in diagnostic family screening. Two mutations (A 46 T, T 265 I) show suggestive evidence of pathogenicity within the experimental limits of biophysical testing, indicating that these variants are disease-causing via delayed- or fast-activation kinetics. Further investigation of the A 46 T family has revealed an inconsistent cosegregation of the variant with the clinical phenotype. Conclusions— Electrophysiological characterization should be used to validate long-QT syndrome pathogenicity of novel missense channelopathies. When such results are inconclusive, great care should be taken with genetic counseling and screening of such families, and alternative disease-causing mechanisms should be considered...|$|R

40|$|Paramutation and {{transposon}} silencing are two epigenetic {{phenomena that}} have intrigued and puzzled geneticists for decades. Each involves heritable changes in gene activity without changes in DNA sequence. Here we report the cloning {{of a gene}} whose activity {{is required for the}} maintenance of both silenced transposons and paramutated color genes in maize. We show that this gene, Mop 1 (Mediator of paramutation 1) codes for a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whose activity is required for the production of small RNAs that correspond to the MuDR transposon sequence. We also demonstrate that although Mop 1 is required to maintain MuDR methylation and silencing, it is not required for the initiation of heritable silencing. In contrast, we present evidence that a reduction in the transcript level of a maize homolog of the nucleosome assembly protein 1 histone chaperone can reduce the heritability of MuDR silencing. Together, these data suggest that the establishment and maintenance of MuDR silencing have distinct requirements.

MutS performs {{the task of}} locating mismatched base pairs, loops and lesions and initiating MMR, and the fundamental question of how this protein targets specific sites in DNA is unresolved. To address this question, we examined the interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh 2 -Msh 6, a eukaryotic MutS homolog, and DNA in real time. The reaction kinetics reveal that Msh 2 -Msh 6 binds a variety of sites at similarly fast rates (kON ∼  107  M- 1  s- 1), and its selectivity manifests in differential dissociation rates; e. g., the protein releases a 2 -Aminopurine:T base pair approximately 90 -fold faster than a G:T mismatch. On releasing the 2 -Ap:T site, Msh 2 -Msh 6 is able to move laterally on DNA to locate a nearby G:T site. The long-lived Msh 2 -Msh 6 ·G:T complex triggers {{the next step in}} MMR—formation of an ATP-bound clamp—more effectively than the short-lived Msh 2 -Msh 6 · 2 -Ap:T complex.

The nucleoprotein is also essential for transcription and replication during the virus life cycle. In the H 5 N 1 NP structure, the tail loop region is important for NP to form oligomers. Here, by an RNP reconstitution assay, we identified eight NP mutants that had different degrees of defects in forming functional RNPs, with the RNP activities of four mutants being totally abolished (<b>E</b> <b>339</b> A, V 408 S P 410 S, R 416 A, and L 418 S P 419 S mutants) and the RNP activities of the other four mutants being more than 50 % decreased (R 267 A, I 406 S, R 422 A, and E 449 A mutants). Further characterization by static light scattering showed that the totally defective protein variants existed as monomers in vitro, deviating from the trimeric/oligomeric form of wild-type NP. The I 406 S, R 422 A, and E 449 A variants existed as a mixture of unstable oligomers, thus resulting in a reduction of RNP activity. Although the R 267 A variant existed as a monomer in vitro, it resumed an oligomeric form upon the addition of RNA and retained {{a certain degree of}} RNP activity.

We find that different XRBs follow different anti-correlations between Γ and ξ when ξ is less than a critical value, while they follow the same positive correlation when ξ is larger than the critical value. This anti-correlation and positive correlation are also found in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) and luminous QSOs respectively. The anticorrelation and positive correlation of different XRBs roughly converge to the same point (logξ = − 2. 1 ± 0. 2,Γ = 1. 5 ± 0. 1), which may correspond to the accretion mode transition, since that the anti-correlation and positive correlation between Γ and ξ are consistent with the prediction of advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and standard disk/corona system respectively. We note that traditional low-hard state are divided into two parts by the cross point logξ ∼ − 2. 1, i. e., faint-hard state in the anti-correlation part and bright-hard state in the positive correlation part.

Most adolescents said they brushed their teeth three times or more a day (77. 7 %). The most common oral hygiene aids were toothbrush (97. 6 %), toothpaste (90. 5 %) and dental floss (69. 1 %). Females brushed their teeth with higher frequency than males (p= 0. 001). Main brushing times were after lunch (80. 3 %), before breakfast (73. 5 %) and before going to sleep (62. 5 %). Most adolescents (82. 7 %) said they {{did not need to be}} reminded to brush. Significantly, more males than females said they needed to be reminded (p= 0. 017). Mothers were the main person to remind them to brush (66. 1 %) and the person who gave them their first instructions on the importance of teeth cleaning (81. 3 %).

The treatments consisted of five spacings between plants (0. 30, 0. 35, 0. 40, 0. 45 and 0. 50 m) and the application or non application of chicken manure to the soil cover in a dose of 10 ton. ha- 1, arranged in randomized blocks of 5 x 2 with four replicates. The maximum plant height (282. 92 cm) was achieved at 200 days after the transplant (DAT), with 0. 35 m between plants and without the application of chicken manure. The leaf area was significantly influenced by {{the interaction of the}} spacings between plants and the application of chicken manure, presenting a linear growth of 32, 009 cm 2 plants- 1. The biggest fresh and dry weight yields in leaves were 31, 571 and 3, 339 kg ha- 1, respectively, with a 0. 30 m spacing between the plants. The biggest yields of both fresh and dry weights of the stems and fruits of roselle plants were obtained in the soil with chicken manure.

40|$|The {{candidate}} {{black hole}} X-ray binary Swift J 1753. 5 - 0127 faded to quiescence in 2016 November, after a prolonged outburst that {{was discovered in}} 2005. Nearly three months later the system displayed renewed activity that lasted through 2017 July. Here, we present radio and X-ray monitoring over ~ 3 months of the renewed activity to study the coupling between the jet and the inner regions of the disk/jet system. Our observations cover low X-ray luminosities that have not historically been well-sampled (Lx~ 2 e 33 - 1 e 36 erg/s; 1 - 10 keV), including time periods when the system was both brightening and fading. At these low luminosities Swift J 1753. 5 - 0127 occupies a parameter space in the radio/X-ray luminosity plane that is comparable to "canonical" systems (<b>e.</b> g., GX <b>339</b> - 4), {{regardless of whether the}} system was brightening or fading, even though during its > 11 -year outburst Swift J 1753. 5 - 0127 emitted less radio emission from its jet than expected. We discuss implications for the existence of a single radio/X-ray luminosity correlation for black hole X-ray binaries at the lowest luminosities (Lx < 1 e 35 erg/s), and we compare to supermassive black holes. Our campaign includes the lowest luminosity quasi-simultaneous radio/X-ray detection to date for a black hole X-ray binary during its rise out of quiescence, thanks to early notification from optical monitoring combined with fast responses from sensitive multiwavelength facilities.

The study was conducted on 15 -month old green turfgrass under a randomized complete block design with four replications. The following plant regulator and doses were tested: trinexapac-ethyl (113 + 113, 226 + 113, 226 + 226, 452 + 113, 452 + 226, 452 + 452, 678 + <b>339</b> <b>e</b> 904 + 452 g a. i. /ha- 1), prohexadione-calcium (100 + 100 e 200 + 200 g a. i. ha- 1) and bispyribac-sodium (40 + 40 e 60 + 60 g a. i. ha- 1), {{as well as an}} untreated control. The turfgrass was mowed again at 3. 0 cm aboveground and the second plant regulator was applied when 'Meyer' zoysiagrass was between 5. 0 and 6. 0 cm high. The effect of the treatments was visually rated for visual injury, plant height, height and number of flower rachis, and total dry mass production of clippings. Only bispyribac-sodium had visual symptoms of injury on 'Meyer' zoysiagrass, and no intoxication was observed at 28 days after the second application (DAAB). The sequential applications of trinexapac-ethyl, prohexadione-calcium and bispyribac-sodium reduced by more than 80 % the total clipping dry mass produced by 'Meyer' zoysiagrass. All the plant regulators tested also showed promising results in reducing the height and emission of rachis, especially when trinexapac-ethyl was applied at the doses 452 + 452, 678 + 339 and 904 + 452 g a. i. ha- 1. 'Meyer' zoysiagrass turfgrass can be handled with the sequential application of a plant regulator, which reduces the need for mowing over a period up to 110 days after the application of the second plant regulator, and it also avoids deleterious visual effects over turfgrass...|$|R
40|$|Na Amazônia, o fogo é ainda o {{principal}} trato cultural utilizado no preparo de solo para agricultura e pecuária, tanto pelos pequenos como pelos grandes fazendeiros. Combinando à baixa fertilidade do solo e ao baixo preço da terra, assim que as fontes naturais de nutrientes são exauridas, as áreas são abandonadas e novas florestas primárias são derrubadas e queimadas. Por conta disso, grandes extensões de área da Amazônia são cobertas por florestas secundárias originadas de áreas abandonadas pela agricultura ou pastagem. Este estudo foi conduzido em uma área experimental usada em uma pesquisa sobre eficiência de combustão e emissão de gás carbônico da floresta amazônica, localizada aproximadamente 50 km ao norte de Manaus. A vegetação da área experimental foi derrubada e queimada em 1991, simulando as condições em que o pequeno agricultor prepara o solo para plantios de subsistência. Dez anos após a queimada, a floresta secundária ainda é bastante diferente da floresta original. As espécies vegetais dominantes são, principalmente, das famílias botânicas Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Burseraceae, Cecropiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Melastomataceae, Mimosaceae, Sapindaceae e Sterculiaceae. O estoque de biomassa recuperado, dez anos após a formação da capoeira estudada, é de aproximadamente 16 %, ou seja, a capoeira apresenta um estoque médio de 56, 2 t. ha- 1 ± 12 (IC 95 %), enquanto que o estoque da floresta primária <b>é</b> de <b>339,</b> 7 t. ha- 1 ± 66, 7 (IC 95 %). In Amazonia, fire {{is widely}} used for soil preparation in the agriculture and cattle ranching, either by small or big farmers. The combination of low {{fertility of the soil}} and low price of the land usually leads to typical shift cultivation as soon as the natural sources of nutrients are exhausted, when new primary forests are felled and burned. Due to that, secondary forests originated from abandoned agriculture or pasture activity projects cover huge areas in the Brazilian Amazônia. This study was carried out in the Tropical Forestry Experimental Station (EEST/INPA), around 50 kilometers north of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas State. A secondary forest ("capoeira"), 10 years old, was selected for this study; its land use history includes clear cutting followed by fire. Two different samples of primary forests were included as control plots for the "capoeira". All individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 5 cm were measured and recorded in a single area of 0, 4 ha for each treatment. Ten years after burning, the secondary forest is still very different in comparison with primary forest, in terms of important parameters of the vegetation structure, such as floristic composition, abundance, frequency, dominance, index of value of importance (IVI) and the diameter distribution. In "capoeira" studied the dominant species are mainly of the following botanical families: Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Burseraceae, Cecropiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Melastomataceae, Mimosaceae, Sapindaceae and Sterculiaceae. The estimates of dry biomass were 56. 2 t. ha- 1 ± 12 (CI 95 %) and 339. 7 t. ha- 1 ± 66. 7 (CI 95 %) for "capoeira" and primary forest, respectively...|$|R

The age-dependent {{resistance}} to severe disease is determined primarily by maturation of the host, but strains of virus can be selected that overcome the increased resistance of mature animals. Sindbis virus (SV) strain AR 339 causes fatal encephalitis in newborn mice and nonfatal encephalitis in weanling mice, whereas NSV, a neuroadapted strain of SV, causes fatal encephalitis in weanling {{as well as}} newborn mice. We have previously shown that the E 2 glycoprotein of NSV contained His- 55, whereas AR <b>339</b> <b>E</b> 2 had Gln- 55 (S. Lustig, A. C. Jackson, C. S. Hahn, D. E. Griffin, E. G. Strauss, and J. H. Strauss, J. Virol. 62 : 2329 - 2336, 1988) and that SV with E 2 containing Gly- 172 was more virulent for newborn mice than SV with E 2 containing Arg- 172 (P. C. Tucker and D. E. Griffin, J. Virol. 65 : 1551 - 1557, 1991). Here we tested the vinrlence for both newborn and older mice of SV containing {{a number of different}} amino acids at E 2 position 55 (His, Gln, Lys, Arg, Glu, Gly) in combination with both Gly- 172 and Arg- 172. All the viruses were virulent for newborn mice, but the residues at both 55 and 172 influenced the virulence of the virus, and there were differences in virulence observed among the various viruses. However, only viruses with His- 55 were fully virulent for 14 -day-old mice, and this virulence was independent of the residue at position 172. Virus with Lys- 55 was virulent for 7 -day-old mice, although slightly attenuated relative to His- 55. Viruses with His- 55 grew more rapidly and to higher titer in the brains of 7 - and 14 -day-old mice, in N 18 neuroblastoma cells, and in BHK cells. Our data suggest that His- 55 is important for neurovinrulence in older mice and acts by increasing the efficiency of virus replication...|$|R
