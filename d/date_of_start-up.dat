40|$|This {{document}} updates {{the status}} of OPERA after the last SPSC report of April 2009 to which we refer for the subjects not addressed in detail here. The report presents {{the progress of the}} various subsystems and informs about the recent start of the 2009 CNGS run. The effect and the consequences of the strong earthquake in the LNGS area are also discussed. The main message is that OPERA has started the 2009 run with only two weeks delay with respect to the initially foreseen <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>start-up.</b> This important milestone has been achieved thanks to the dedication of the OPERA members and to the strong commitment of LNGS and of its staff...|$|E
30|$|Existing {{enterprise}} {{owners and}} those who closed their business were asked about the specific <b>date</b> <b>of</b> business <b>start-up</b> and exist date, in case the start-up had already closed. This information allowed the researchers to establish a business operation spell for each firm, and the spell might be either completed or right-censored {{at the time of}} survey. The established spell is the dependent variable with a value of 1, if the spell is right-censored, and 0, if the spell is completed. The survey had also detailed information on the socio-demographic and economic background of the owner/manager, as well as firm, industry, and business strategy characteristics. Moreover, the sample survey had detailed information regarding the feature of the owner as well as the firm during the setting up of the business, the quality of the support program, the respective gaps and challenges experienced by MSE operators, and the labor market status of the youth before and after self-employment, which are important variables in the survival analysis.|$|R

50|$|To {{mark the}} exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> its {{original}} <b>start-up,</b> Wonderful Radio London International (WRLI) was planning its own return {{as a full-time}} radio station broadcasting from {{off the coast of}} England beginning in December 1984. (This was during the period in which both Radio Caroline and Laser 558 were broadcasting successfully from ships off the British coast, though not without harassment from the authorities.) After the demise of The Texas Night Train marathon program, the WRLI team approached attorney Arturo Gonz√°lez in Del Rio with a new proposal. Since XERF reception reports had been received from Europe when the power was maintained at 250,000 watts, it was proposed that Wonderful Radio London would take over the entirety of the hours after midnight Central Time. This would correspond to 6 AM Greenwich Mean Time or Universal Coordinated Time. Under the joint call sign of Wonderful Radio London via XERF and operating as a full service station at full power, Big L would be able to attract both the additional funding and advertising necessary to also make the new offshore project into a commercial success.|$|R

Organizations can benefit from growth in many ways, including greater efficiency through economies of scale, increased power, the ability to withstand environmental change, increased profit and increased prestige for organizational members.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with Bayesian estimation and prediction in the context <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> demonstration tests in which rejection of a unit is possible when a pre-specified number of failures is observed prior to obtaining the number of consecutive successes required for acceptance of the unit. A method for implementing Bayesian inference on the probability of success is developed for use when the test result <b>of</b> each <b>start-up</b> is not reported or even recorded, and only the number of trials until termination of the testing is available. Some errors in the related literature on the Bayesian analysis <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> demonstration tests are corrected. The method developed in this paper is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method incorporating data augmentation, and it additionally enables Bayesian posterior inference {{on the number of}} failures given the number <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> trials until termination to be made, along with Bayesian predictive inferences on the number <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> trials and the number of failures until termination for any future run <b>of</b> the <b>start-up</b> demonstration test.

40|$|Start-ups is the {{new wave}} of firms which are now {{mushrooming}} around Malaysia. However, as this wave is still at its infancy the success rate <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia is extremely low. It has been long established that organisational culture does indeed effect the performance of a firm, however there haven‚Äôt been any reports on the effect of organisational culture on the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this report is to investigate how different types of organisational cultures contribute to the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia. In order to do that,this research has decided to use a quantitative approach through the usage of a questionnaire to acquire the all relevant data. 80 requests were send out but there were only 43 respondents. This report has successfully revealed the different existing organisational culture types in current firms and also identified the main organisational culture types existing within each participating start-ups. After which the report successfully examine the effects of the organisational cultures to the corresponding start-ups. The conclusion obtained from this report is that firstly, organisational culture does effect the success <b>of</b> the <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia. Second, contrary to what was concluded in the literature, both bureaucratic and competitive culture was proven to {{have a positive effect on}} the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia.

Using a sample from an original survey conducted in 2008, we identify whether initial funds and founder-specific characteristics relate to R&D investment <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> firms in Japan. It is found that internal finance is positively associated with R&D investment. It is also found that founders with higher educational background, prior innovation output and academic affiliation tend to raise more funds for R&D.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} factors {{determining the}} scale <b>of</b> business <b>start-ups</b> using data sets from Japan. It shows that age, education, parents' occupation (company manager), business experience, and assets owned {{at the time}} <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> have a significant {{positive impact on the}} scale <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> funding, while independent start-up has a significantly negative impact. Furthermore, entrepreneurs motivated by a desire to contribute to society, a desire to make use of assets, the influence of others and social status have more funds for start-up, whereas those motivated by a desire for individual discretion, dissatisfaction with current remuneration, a desire for life-long work, unemployment, and a desire for more freedom have fewer funds for start-up. The study showed start-ups that make use of funding from public agencies are significantly larger than those that do not, particularly those that do not borrow from any financial institution. This suggests the possibility of constraints on liquidity at the time <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> and that government funding assistance for start-ups would be effective in expanding the scale of such ventures. The study also verified the impact of funding scale at the time <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> on subsequent business performance. Even taking account of entrepreneur attributes and the industry being entered, the analysis showed that more funding at the time <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> had a positive impact on a venture's performance measured by growth in employee numbers. From the perspective of increasing employment opportunities, this indicates the validity of policies that facilitate larger-scale funding for start-ups. ...|$|R

30|$|Concerning {{firm and}} {{industry}} characteristics, start-up size has the expected {{positive effect on}} MSEs‚Äô survival, implying the larger {{the size of the}} setup, the lower is the probability of dropout. We capture the impact of financial resource at the time <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> using the size <b>of</b> the <b>start-up</b> capital, {{and it turns out that}} larger amount <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> capital reduced the risk of dropout. Entrepreneurs, who invested more than Birr 100, 000 (USD 3700), had a significantly higher probability of survival than the others, suggesting that an adequate amount <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> capital is a key factor for a firm‚Äôs survival. Unlike Kalleberg and Leicht (1991), a solo type of business setup had a significant positive effect on MSEs‚Äô survival than cooperatives. This might be associated with the complete control and decision-making power that the owner enjoys, as well as being free from corporate tax.|$|R

40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{are very important}} to employment creation, poverty alleviation and the sustainable economic development of a nation. Encouraging SMEs, especially start-ups is crucial for sustainable economic growth. However, the failure rate <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> SMEs in South Africa is one of the highest in the world. In reviewing the literature of the causes of the failure <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> SMEs, access to finance emerged as a prime challenge. Start-up SMEs find it very difficult to obtain external finance from commercial banks and venture capitalists. The national and provincial governments in South Africa have realised that access to finance is a major constraint to the growth and survival <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> SMEs and have put in place certain measures to improve access to finance by <b>start-up</b> SMEs. One <b>of</b> the primary measures put in place by government to improve access to finance by start-up SMEs is the provision of Business Development Service by some government agencies. This research investigates the role of Business Development Services Providers (BDSs) in improving access to finance for start-up SMEs. Questions arise as to why the failure rate <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> SMEs is high in South Africa despite all these government measures aimed at assisting start-ups to access finance. Empirical research was conducted to investigate the role of BDS in improving access to finance by start-up SMEs. The instrument used for data collection was the self-administered questionnaire. The statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, T-test, ANOVA, correlation and regression analysis. The Cronbach‚Äüs alpha was used as a measure of reliability. The results of the study revealed that: Access to finance is still a major problem hindering the survival <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> SMEs. There is a lack of awareness of BDS providers and their services by the majority <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> SMEs. There is a significant positive relationship between the use <b>of</b> BDS by <b>start-up</b> SMEs and success in accessing finance. Start-up SMEs that are aware of BDS do make use of the services. The results suggest that BDS are important to improving access to finance by start-up SMEs. However, {{there is a need to}} build awareness and encourage the use <b>of</b> BDS by <b>start-up</b> SMEs to improve their access to finance and ultimately increase their chances of survival...|$|R
