40|$|Four {{experiments}} explored possible temporal summation in olfaction and {{the common}} chemical sense. In one experiment, participants judged the perceived magnitude of various concentrations and durations (1. 25 - 3. 75 s) of the pungent odorant ammonia and the nonpungent odorant <b>isoamyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> The perceived magnitude of ammonia increased during an inhalation whereas the magnitude of <b>isoamyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> did not. Time-intensity trading relations for ammonia indicated nearly perfect temporal summation. In another experiment, modulation of the concentration of ammonia during an inhalation led to assessments of perceived magnitude that confirmed {{the high degree of}} temporal summation seen in the first experiment. That is, approximately equal time-integrated mass of inhaled ammonia led to approximately equal perceived intensity. A third experiment indicated that temporal summation for ammonia arose from its pungency rather than from its odor, a fourth that trigeminally-mediated reflex apnea in response to ammonia also exhibits temporal summation. The degree of temporal summation measured with the reflex came very close to that assessed psychophysically. When stimulated with ammonia, the common chemical sense behaves more like a total mass detector than a concentration detector. The investigation raises the possibility that the short-term sensory reaction to most pungent stimuli may follow this simple rule...|$|E

The esters synthesized were isoamyl acetate, isoamyl propionate, <b>isoamyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> and isoamyl octanoate. Very low yields (3 - 4 %) of isoamyl acetate were obtained, but high yields {{for the other}} three esters were obtained under both supercritical and solvent-free conditions. The yields of esters of the even-carbon acids, isoamyl acetate, butyrate, and octanoate, increased with increasing chain length, whereas the yield of isoamyl propionate was {{higher than that of}} <b>isoamyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> The optimum temperature of the reaction was higher under supercritical conditions (45 degreesC) than under solvent-free conditions (35 - 40 degreesC). The effects of other parameters such as alcohol concentration, water concentration, and enzyme loading were investigated. An increase in the water concentration decreased the conversion significantly in supercritical carbon dioxide but not under solvent-free conditions. The optimum ratio of alcohol to acid was dependent on the extent of inhibition by the acid. Although providing a higher apparent yield by being run in a highly concentrated medium, the overall conversion under solvent-free conditions was lower than that under supercritical conditions for similar enzyme concentrations, indicating that the synthesis of esters in supercritical carbon dioxide might be a viable option...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of high-pressure homogenisation on the aroma retention of mixed sodium caseinate-whey protein (2 % + 2 % w/v) emulsions. For this purpose, raw and pasteurised emulsions, with different fat contents (5 %, 8 % and 15 % w/v) and subjected to different homogenisation pressures (0, 18, 100 and 150 MPa), were produced. The retention of seven aroma compounds (hexanal, benzaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate) was evaluated by static headspace gas chromatography. Results showed that aroma release was affected by the presence and the quantity of the lipid phase. As regards homogenisation, an increase in the retention of hexanal with homogenisation pressure was observed and interactions between hexanal and caseinate were suggested.

Seven {{strains of the}} yeast Wickerhamomyces pijperi {{were used for the}} fermentation of glucose-added whey (whey-g). Twelve aroma compounds (isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, 2 -phenylethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>butyrate,</b> ethyl propionate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl benzoate) were identified in the fermented broth using headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The major components were ethyl acetate (several tens to hundreds ppm), acetaldehyde (several tens ppm) and isoamyl alcohol (about 10  ppm). The strong fruity odor of ethyl benzoate (about 1  ppm) was detected in the broth of W. pijperi YIT 8095 and YIT 12779. The balance of aroma compounds produced was varied depending on the media used, and ethyl benzoate was only produced when using whey-g. The variation in the {{production of}} the aroma compounds over time using W. pijperi YIT 12779 at various culture temperatures (from 15 – 30 °C) was also studied. From the results we propose that W. pijperi {{could be used as a}} novel microorganism for production of aroma compounds from whey.|$|R

An impetus for this research is the increasingly strict European legal standards pertaining to the levels of health hazard volatile compounds (e. g., methanol) {{and the lack of}} comprehensive studies on this topic for Portuguese bagaceiras. Assays were performed by gas/liquid chromatography for alcohols (methanol, 2 -butanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -methyl-propanol, allylic alcohol, 1 -butanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, hexanol,trans- 3 -hexenol,cis- 3 -hexenol,trans- 2 -hexenol, and 2 -phenyl-ethanol), carboxylic acids (isobutyric, isovaleric, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acids), esters (ethyl acetate, ethyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, diethyl succinate, 2 -phenyl-ethyl-acetate, and ethyl dodecanoate), as well as for an aldehyde (ethanal) and its acetal (diethoxy- 1 - 1 -ethane). The average values obtained for Portuguese bagaceiras(and the corresponding ranges) were comparable with corresponding values for grape pomaces manufactured in other Mediterranean countries (viz.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{heterologous}} expression of alcohol acetyltransferase (AATase) genes in Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum {{for the production of}} the esters isoamyl acetate, butyl acetate and butyl <b>butyrate.</b> <b>Isoamyl</b> acetate, butyl acetate and butyl butyrate are esters that confer a fruity aroma and taste to the materials in which they are found. AATases are a class of enzymes that have been found to enzymatically catalyze the reaction between alcohols and acyl-CoAs to produce the corresponding ester. Butanol, acetyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA, the substrates necessary for butyl acetate and butyl butyrate production, are produced in high concentrations by C. acetobutylicum, making it an ideal host for the expression of genes for AATases. Previous studies have characterized AATases in yeast, and expressed them in E. coli, {{but this is the first}} report of ester production by AATase activity in C. acetobutylicum. The genes ATF 1 and ATF 2, encoding AATase I and AATase II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and SAAT encoding a strawberry alcohol acetyltransferase, Saatp, have previously been sequenced. Biochemical studies have shown them to possess AATase activity. For this thesis, ATF 1, ATF 2, and SAAT were subcloned and expressed in E. coli. Ester production was determined by head-space gas analysis on a gas chromatagraph. AATase I in E. coli cultures and cell-free extracts produced more ester than AATase II did with each alcohol substrate that was investigated. Saatp produced less ester than AATase I, but more than AATase II. The ester butyl butyrate was detected in cell-free extracts of E. coli expressing SAAT, but not in cell-free extracts expressing ATF 1 or ATF 2. ATF 2 was also expressed in C. acetobutylicum for the production of isoamyl acetate and butyl acetate. Ester concentrations in C. acetobutylicum strains expressing ATF 2 were lower than ester concentrations in E. coli strains expressing ATF 2. The expression of ATF 2 in C. acetobutylicum demonstrates the viability of using this organism for natural ester production via microbial fermentation...|$|R
40|$|Within {{this work}} the control {{software}} of a molecular beam FT microwave spectrometer {{has been developed}} and some fruit esters have been studied by microwave spectroscopy. With the spectrometer broad band scans can be performed and highly resolved measurements at certain frequencies can be carried out. The program package developed has a modular structure {{in order to allow}} for easy changes within the individual modules. Moreover, a user-friendly program surface has been developed. The individual hardware components of the spectrometer were controlled via a timer/counter board. This board allowed for short allocation times (a few ns) and enabled phase synchronous repetition of the experiment. When the control software of the fast A/D converter (up to 100 MS/s) was developed it was found, that the start of the recording showed some jitter with respect to the trigger signal. This problem has been solved by a special hard and software. The biggest disadvantage of the spectrometer is its narrow bandwidth due to the big quality factor of the resonator and the long time needed for sampling a broad frequency range. Within the spectroscopic part of this work some fruit esters (ethyl isovalerate, ethyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, and ethyl acetate) were studied by microwave spectroscopy. These molecules are relatively large for microwave spectroscopy, but their vapour pressure turned out to be sufficient to observe them in the gas phase. At the beginning of the investigations broad band scans were carried out and the lines found were remeasured at high resolution. As a result of such an analysis the rotational constants of the respective molecules were obtained and compared with the quantum chemical predictions. When methyl internal rotation was observed, also the angles of the internal rotor axis with respect to the principal axes could be compared. In the case of ethyl isovalerate the analysis of the broadband scan yielded the rotational constants of one conformer. Some c-type transitions could be observed, thus a significant dipole moment component in c direction is present. By ab initio calculations a conformer was predicted which was in agreement with the observed rotational constants, however it showed up a mirror plane perpendicular to the c axis. This would cause a zero dipole moment in c direction which is in contradiction to the experimental results. In this case future ab initio calculations are necessary to find a geometry which is in agreement with the experimentally observed conformer. In the case of ethyl butyrate the evaluation of the spectrum yielded two sets of rotational constants which allowed an unambiguous assignment of two different conformers. Both conformers (EBU- 1 and EBU- 2) are near prolate tops. Isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate showed splittings due to low barrier internal rotation. In both cases the internal rotor is a methyl group. For each substance one conformer was found. The barrier to internal rotation was very close to 100 cm- 1 for both molecules. Also these molecules are near prolate tops...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Key {{research}} {{areas in}} modern enology {{are related to}} the production of wine of consistent quality, {{as well as to the}} improvement of existing wine quality through the enhancement of the sensory properties of wine. The formation of glycerol during alcoholic fermentation is highly relevant to both these issues. Since the early years of the zo" century, glycerol has been positively associated with the quality of wine and it is thought to impart important mouth-feel sensations such as "viscosity", "smoothness" and "body". In general, it is considered that glycerol concentrations higher than those normally found in wine, can contribute towards the improvement of wine quality. It has also been suggested that increased concentrations of glycerol can enhance the aroma of wine. On the basis of these perceptions, several strategies have been developed to favour the production of glycerol during the fermentation process and over a period of years, a large volume of data has been collected that relates to various aspects regarding glycerol production during alcoholic fermentation. To date, however, several aspects regarding the relationship between glycerol and wine quality remain unclear. The reasons for this situation can mainly be ascribed to the lack of reliable analytical data to serve as a basis for investigating the relationship between glycerol and wine quality, as well as the preponderance of empirical and anecdotal evidence. Despite numerous opinions regarding optimal glycerol concentrations in wine, glycerol is indeed seldom assayed on a routine basis and targets with respect to specific wine grape cultivars and glycerol concentrations have largely remained unspecified. To date, very little information regarding glycerol concentrations in South African wines has been published. The analytical techniques that are most frequently used for the quantification of glycerol in grape juice, fermenting must and wine are not easily automated and this aspect placed severe limitations on the generation of large volumes of analytical data on glycerol concentrations in these matrices. This project was undertaken with the aim to holistically address some of the unresolved issues relating to the relationship between glycerol and wine quality. This also implied the development and optimisation of analytical techniques suitable for the rapid and accurate determination of glycerol in fermentation media, as well as in finished wine. In the first stage of this project a quantitative database was established that contained the analytical data on the glycerol concentrations of a statistically significant number of wines of adjudged quality, as well as additional information for each wine regarding the geographic origin, vintage, routine chemical analyses and the yeast strain(s) used for the production of the wine. The relevance of glycerol in wine for the modern South African winemaker was evaluated through the establishment of a quantitative database that contained the opinions of an expert panel of 15 South African winemakers, enologists and wine chemists on topics relating to glycerol in wine. In the second stage of the project the data captured in the databases were used to investigate aspects regarding the relationship between glycerol and wine quality. From the data captured in the qualitative database, it was clear that the topic regarding glycerol in wine was important to the South African winemakers and it was also evident that there was a need for the development and optimisation of methods suitable for the routine analysis of the glycerol concentrations in grape juice, fermenting must and wine. The opinions of the panel members also highlighted the issue that the mouth-feel property of wine was considered to be an area where the quality of some wines could be further improved. The quantitative database contained the information on the glycerol concentrations of 450 commercial South African table wines of adjudged quality. The premium cultivars Chardonnay, Chenin blanc, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Pinotage were used for the purpose of investigating the relationship between glycerol concentration and wine quality. The wines represented a wide variety of wine styles, including dry white, off-dry white, dry red and late harvest wines. The average glycerol concentration was significantly associated with the wine style. In white wines the average glycerol concentration was much lower than in the red wines (6. 82 gIL versus 10. 49 gIL, respectively). No significant relationship between the final glycerol concentration and the geographic origin, vintage and the yeast strain used for the fermentation was found. Wine quality could not be significantly associated with glycerol concentration in the red wines. In the white wines, the relationship between glycerol concentration and wine quality was significant, but due to the very small differences in the average glycerol concentrations of the wines of different quality ratings, the statistical significance is probably of little practical value. The effect of glycerol on the volatility of a selection of esters and higher alcohols was also investigated. Solid-phase microextraction, followed by gas chromatography, was used to analyse the composition of the headspace at equilibrium between the liquid phase and the gas phase of a model wine, and a dry white wine that contained a basal concentration of 5. 4 gIL glycerol. Results showed that incremental increases in the glycerol concentrations over a range of 1 - 10 gIL in the model wine and in a Chenin blanc wine, were not accompanied by a proportional increase or decrease in the abundance of the aroma components in the headspace. The volatile components tested were <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>butyrate,</b> ethyl valerate, ethyl lactate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol. For all the volatile components tested, the difference between the headspace composition of samples containing the lowest glycerol concentration, and those containing the highest glycerol concentration, was not significant. However, sufficient experimental evidence was obtained to indicate that increasing glycerol concentrations had an effect on the volatility of aroma components, and that the effect is of a complex and non-linear nature. In the third phase of the work Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to establish and optimise methods for the accurate and rapid quantification of glycerol in wine. For this purpose calibrations were developed for the quantification of glycerol in dry wine and late harvest wines. The accuracy of prediction was evaluated by means of the standard error of prediction that was 0. 38 gIL for the dry wines and 0. 65 gIL for the sweet wines. Large variations are introduced in the FT-IR spectra of wine by factors such as process technology, cultivar and geographic origin, and this variation can have an effect on the accuracy of the analytical data generated when employing FT-IR spectroscopy. Using glycerol prediction in wine as a model system, principal component analysis of the FT-IR spectra was done in order to establish quality control measures for the detection of poorly predicted, or outlier samples. A classification model, based on principal component analysis, was established that enabled the interpretation and classification of the outlier samples in the data set in 100 % of the cases tested. This work forms the basis for expanding the quality control measures for the detection of wines of which the FT-IR spectra are highly unnatural, as well as for establishing quality control measures to ensure that accurate analytical data are generated when FT-IR is used. FT-IR spectroscopy was also used to develop a rapid screen for the evaluation of the fermentation profiles of wine yeasts. For this purpose, a selection of wine yeasts, which included commercial wine yeasts frequently used in winemaking in South Africa, as well as a selection of hybrid Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts, that were obtained through a selective breeding strategy aimed at increasing glycerol concentrations were used. Calibrations necessary for the accurate quantification of glycerol, volatile acidity, ethanol, reducing sugar and glucose, in Chenin blanc must and a synthetic must were developed and optimised. This work forms the basis upon which the scope of the analysis, both in terms of the number of components that can be measured, as well as the medium in which the yeasts are being evaluated, can be enlarged. This would be valuable for future applications in both the research as well as the industrial environment. The method that was developed serves to illustrate how this application can play a supportive role in yeast development programmes, through the speeding up of the initial stages of yeast strain evaluation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a hygienized rennet paste (HRP) and a defined strain starter IFPL on the {{volatile}} fraction of goat cheese (Majorero) was examined. Three batches were made and those cheeses produced either industrially (IL) or in artisanal manner (AL) were compared with the experimental lot (EL), which included both HRP and IFPL starter in its manufacture. Analysis of the volatile fraction was by static headspace connected to GC-MS and this disclosed a total of 28 components belonging to the following chemical families: fatty acids, esters, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols. Most of the volatile components identified appeared in all lots but at different concentrations. IL cheeses were distinguished from the other lots, including HRP in their manufacture, essentially by a lower presence of esters and FFA (both branched-chain and aliphatic acids). The use of HRP and a defined strain starter culture (including Lb. casei IFPL 731 as adjunct) directly affected lipolysis degree. This was reflected {{in an increase in}} the mono-and diglyceride concentrations and in a greater content of short-chain FFA, particularly butanoic acid, an important flavour component, which imparts a desirable sharp, >piquant> taste to Majorero cheese.
