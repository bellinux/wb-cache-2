5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 15 May 218, Elagabalus was taken, by either Julia Maesa or Gannys, to the camp of the Legio III Gallica at Raphanea and {{presented}} to the soldiers stationed there. In one account of the events, Elegabalus was saluted as Antoninus by the soldiers, after his father Caracalla whose official name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Enticed by Julia's bribes, the legion proclaimed Elagabalus the righful Emperor of Rome on 16 May 218. In Gibbon's opinion, Macrinus {{might have been able}} to stop the rebellion in this early stage, but failed to contain <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to decide on an appropriate course of action and instead remained at Antioch.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always up to some mischievous business.|$|R
25|$|Work {{started in}} the same year; {{the ends of the}} {{crescent}} were started first. The project was then delayed when Otto ran out of money; he returned to the West Indies to secure more funds, then came back to Brighton and supervised the completion of the crescent, which happened in 1807. Unlike many contemporary and later developments in Brighton, Otto was able to take his time to complete <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not wholly dependent on it for his financial success: his plantations were still his main source of income.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Adonis joined the Minneapolis-based American Wrestling Association. In 1979, he formed a tag team with Jesse Ventura. The team was called The East-West Connection because Adonis was from New York (in the East), while Ventura was billed from California (in the West). The East-West Connection {{was awarded the}} AWA World Tag Team Championship on July 20, 1980, when Verne Gagne (one half of the tag champions with Mad Dog Vachon) was unable to defend <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> vacationing in Europe. They held the belts until June 14, 1981, when they were {{defeated}} by Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell.|$|E
500|$|However, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening later stated {{during an}} {{appearance}} at the 1998 World Animation Celebration convention in Pasadena, California that [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson, {{but he could not}} receive credit for <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under contract to another record label. Groening told a crowd at the convention that had gathered for a [...] "The Simpsons tribute" [...] that it had [...] "always [...] amazing to me that no one ever found out that Michael Jackson wrote that song. [...] He was a big fan of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Gemini {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be Mani's first Tamil film, though he had already starred in Vaanchinathan (2001). There have been varying accounts on how he was cast: while Vikram claims to have suggested Mani {{for the role of}} Teja, Saran said in one interview that casting Mani was his idea, and contradicted this in another interview, saying that Mani was chosen on his wife's recommendation. While searching for an unfamiliar actor for the DGP's role, Saran saw Murali in Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001) and found him [...] "very dignified". He chose Murali as he wanted that dignity for the role. Though he had planned to make Murali a villain {{at the end of the}} film, Saran decided against <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "amazed to see awe in everyone's eyes when Murali entered the sets and performed".|$|E
500|$|This {{fragment}} of spoof autobiography {{is distinct from}} the rest of the Coleman oeuvre in having no relation to girls' school fiction. It records Brunette's early life as the daughter of an eccentric priest, brought up in a tumbledown Cornish cliff-top house. Apart from descriptions of the house and its contents (some of which may be drawn from Larkin's own childhood home in Coventry), much of the narrative is taken up with a comical description of an attempt to launch the local lifeboat. Larkin's biographer Richard Bradford is struck by the distinctive tone in the fragment, different from anything else written under Coleman's name. The text breaks off suddenly; Motion surmises that Larkin abandoned <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eager to begin work on the first Coleman novel. Booth describes the prose as [...] "a mix of Daphne du Maurier nostalgia and surreal farce".|$|E
500|$|David Geffen, {{founder of}} Geffen Records, {{had the idea}} to record the album The Simpsons Sing the Blues based on The Simpsons, to be {{released}} in time for Christmas 1990. The writers wrote humorous lyrics for the actors to perform over blues and hip hop. The album faced great publicity before its release. One particular element that was highly publicized was Michael Jackson's involvement, which was denied {{around the time of the}} album's release. Early published reports attributed Jackson as the composer of [...] "Do the Bartman", which Groening denied in a press release. However, Groening revealed in 1998 that [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson, but he could not receive credit for <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under contract to another record label. Jackson was a fan of The Simpsons, especially Bart, and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show, which is how [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] came about. Jackson eventually guest-starred in the episode [...] "Stark Raving Dad".|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was baptized}} a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} mass as a child, {{but did not}} have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, leaving the children to be raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, [...] "I was changed– permanently changed– by that experience. It was like a miracle to me". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of Quilters and Alms for the Middle Class, the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey, Jr., were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attracted to a female member.|$|E
500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{credits the}} {{influence}} for his song [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder {{and leader of}} the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to <b>it...</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Entering 2008, Baseball America ranked Davis {{the number}} two {{prospect}} in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted [...]333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he {{going to be able to}} do it at the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies' {{scriptwriting}} {{was affected}} {{by the development of}} a head cold and overrunning script constraints; he was annoyed that he had written [...] "dialogue [...] been dying to write" [...] with a [...] "faint heart" [...] because he would have to cut <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> behind schedule, he was forced to cancel plans to attend Piper's wedding and almost cancelled plans to celebrate the New Year with his boyfriend. These problems affected his first draft of the Doctor's conversation with his companions and encounter with Davros; he dismissed it as [...] "lame shit" [...] which would waste licence-payers' money, and replaced it with a different version hours later. The conversation features all of the Doctor's companions simultaneously talking to the Doctor; Tate, Tennant, and director Graeme Harper made the creative decision to have the Doctor ignore any mention of the Daleks because they thought the Doctor's joviality in the scene would be otherwise inappropriate. He eventually finished the script at 1am on New Year's Eve. Cook reviewed the last pages of the script and suggested that the episode should air without a trailer; Davies agreed by noting that [...] " [...] never send out preview discs of the last episode" [...] and that any advertisements for [...] "Journey's End" [...] could [...] "just show lots of Daleks and a repeat of [...] "I'm regenerating" [...] The episode was officially submitted on : the preparation date for [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End".|$|E
500|$|When Mirkin {{took over}} as show runner, he listed actor James Woods {{as one of the}} people he would most like to guest star on the show. Michael Caine was {{originally}} supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead. Woods was one of animation director David Silverman's favorite guest stars. Mirkin said he provided one of the [...] "most fantastic" [...] performances ever on the show, and commented that he [...] "nailed" [...] all of his lines and was [...] "so funny, right {{at the top of his}} head". Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a [...] "fearless guy" [...] and he was [...] "so excited to do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a huge fan of the show". Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods's tendency to hesitate while speaking was [...] "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic. [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] features the popular Simpsons song [...] "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen. The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.|$|E
2500|$|The genus Daubentonia {{was named}} after the French naturalist Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton by his student, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in 1795. [...] Initially Geoffroy {{considering}} using the Greek name Scolecophagus ("worm-eater") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered. [...] In 1863, British zoologist John Edward Gray coined the family name Daubentoniidae.|$|E

Gillespie was to appear at Carnegie Hall for the 33rd time. The line-up included: Jon Faddis, James Moody, Paquito D'Rivera, and the Mike Longo Trio with Ben Brown on bass and Mickey Roker on drums. But Gillespie didn't make <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in bed suffering from pancreatic cancer. [...] "But the musicians played their real hearts out for him, no doubt suspecting that he would not play again. Each musician gave tribute to their friend, this great soul and innovator in the world of jazz." [...] In 2002, Gillespie was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame for his contributions to Afro-Cuban music.|$|E
2500|$|North Africa, {{comprising}} north Tunisia {{and eastern}} Algeria in the Vandal period, became a Roman province again, {{from which the}} Vandals were expelled. Many Vandals went to Saldae (today called Béjaïa in north Algeria) where they integrated themselves with the Berbers. Many others were put into imperial service or fled to the two Gothic kingdoms (Ostrogothic Kingdom and Visigothic Kingdom). [...] Some Vandal women married Byzantine soldiers and settled in north Algeria and Tunisia. The choicest Vandal warriors were formed into five cavalry regiments, known as Vandali Iustiniani, stationed on the Persian frontier. Some entered the private service of Belisarius. The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia states that [...] "Gelimer was honourably treated and received large estates in Galatia. He was also offered the rank of a patrician but had to refuse <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not willing to change his Arian faith". In the words of historian Roger Collins: [...] "The remaining Vandals were then shipped back to Constantinople to be absorbed into the imperial army. As a distinct ethnic unit they disappeared". Some of the few Vandals remained at North Africa while more migrated back to Spain.|$|E
