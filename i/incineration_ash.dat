40|$|Radioactive {{contamination}} in the Tokyo metropolitan {{area in the}} immediate aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident was analyzed via surface soil sampled during a two-month period after the accident. 131 I, 134 Cs, and 137 Cs were detected in these soil samples. The activity and inventory of radioactive material in the eastern part of Tokyo tended to be high. The 134 Cs/ 137 Cs activity ratio in soil was 0. 978 ± 0. 053. The 131 I/ 137 Cs ratio fluctuated widely, and was 19. 7 ± 9. 0 (weighted average 18. 71 ± 0. 13, n = 14) in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The radioactive plume with high 131 I activity spread into the Tokyo metropolitan area and was higher than the weighted average of 6. 07 ± 0. 04 (n = 26) in other areas. The radiocesium activity and inventory surveyed in soil from a garden in Chiyoda Ward in the center of Tokyo, fell approximately 85 % in the four months after the accident, and subsequently tended to rise slightly while fluctuating widely. It is possible that migration and redistribution of radiocesium occurred. The behavior of radiocesium in Tokyo was analyzed via monitoring of radiocesium in sludge <b>incineration</b> <b>ash.</b> The radiocesium activity in the <b>incineration</b> <b>ash</b> was high at wastewater treatment centers that had catchment areas in eastern Tokyo and low at those with catchment areas in western Tokyo. Similar to the case of the garden soil, even in <b>incineration</b> <b>ash,</b> the radiocesium activity dropped rapidly immediately after the accident. The radiocesium activity in the <b>incineration</b> <b>ash</b> fell steadily from the tenth month after the accident until December 2016, and its half-life was about 500 days. According to frequency analysis, in central Tokyo, the cycles of fluctuation of radiocesium activity in <b>incineration</b> <b>ash</b> and rainfall conformed, clearly showing that radiocesium deposited in urban areas was resuspended and transported by rainfall run-off...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{comparison}} of Swedish and Danish legislation on recycling of MSWI (Municipal Solid Waste Incineration) residues for construction purposes.

To do this, text analysis has been performed on Swedish and Danish environmental legislation with focus on recycling of <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> for constructions. In Denmark, use of <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> was very common and large amounts were recycled during the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s.

Objective of the workings that led to this thesis was to find an applicable, valid and generally accepted laboratory method for the determination of the source strength. Four batch tests, DEV S 4 test, soil saturation extract, NH 4 NO 3 extract and pH-stat test (at pH 4, 5, 6, 7, 11) were performed with the sandy and fine fractions of sediment dredged from the port of Bremen-City, municipal waste <b>incineration</b> <b>ash</b> and demolition waste. Saturated column tests were run with the municipal waste <b>incineration</b> <b>ash,</b> the demolition waste and the sandy fraction of harbour sediments. The sandy fraction of the harbour sediments was also incorporated in an unsaturated column unit.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} result of the {{investigation}} on manufacturing lightweight aggregate by incorporating municipal solid waste (MSW) <b>incineration</b> fly <b>ashes</b> and reaction ashes with reservoir sediments. The investigation was first performed in a laboratory scale to assess the effects of the composition and the firing conditions on the properties of the resulting aggregate. Afterward. a big amount of aggregates was manufactured in a pilot scale using a commercially available rotary kiln. Physical properties of the synthetic aggregates were subsequently assessed. In addition, compressive strength of the concrete made from the manufactured aggregates was experimentally measured. The investigation shows that the analysis results for the MSW <b>incineration</b> fly <b>ashes</b> and reaction ashes are not in the limits of the expandable region of Riley's ternary diagram due to the low content of SiO(2). Therefore, they can only be used as additives. The proper content for MSW <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> should not exceed 30 %, except compositional adjustment using oxide constituents. The particle density of the manufactured aggregates using a commercially available rotary kiln was 0 99 g/cm(3), which is significantly lower than normal density aggregate. Moreover, its dry loose bulk density is 593 kg/m(3), which meets the requirements of ASTM C 330 with bulk density less than 880 kg/m(3) for coarse aggregate. On the other hand, the results of toxicity test meet the Taiwan Environmental Regulatory requirements, which demonstrate that the aggregate thus fabricated is non-hazardous for construction use.

Tests for density, stiffening time, bleed, settlement, sorptivity, water absorption, moisture content, California bearing ratio, initial surface absorption, and compressive strength were carried out on the CLSM mixtures. Study for corrosivity and leaching of heavy metals and salts on the bleed and leachate were also performed. The compressive strength of CLSM tested ranged from 0. 36 to 4. 40 MPa.

This paper presents the findings of a preliminary investigation carried out on the performance of industrial waste <b>incineration</b> bottom <b>ash</b> as CLSM. CLSM mixes were designed using industrial waste <b>incineration</b> bottom <b>ash,</b> and cement. Tests for density, setting time, bleed, and compressive strength on cubes under various curing conditions, corrosivity, and leaching of heavy metals and salts were carried out on the CLSM mixtures, and the results discussed. Compressive strength for the designed CLSM mixtures ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 7 MPa. It is shown that the variations in curing conditions have less influence on the compressive strength of CLSM at high values of water to cement ratio (w/c), but low values of w/c influences the strength of CLSM. The CLSM produced does not exhibit corrosive characters as evidenced by pH. Leaching of heavy metals and salts is higher in bleed than in leachate collected from hardened CLSM. Cement reduces the leaching of Boron in bleed. It is concluded that there is good potential for the use of industrial waste <b>incineration</b> bottom <b>ash</b> in CLSM. Â© 2009 Elsevier B. V.

Provtagning av askor har skett inom ramen för detta projekt samt kompletterats med prov från tidigare undersökning av kritiska metaller i avfallsaskor (Johansson m. fl., 2013). Resultaten visar att halterna av metaller och klorerade dioxiner och furaner huvudsakligen var i nivå med vad som redovisats i tidigare undersökningar. Bromerade dioxiner och furaner kunde påvisas i samtliga prov. Vid utvärdering av resultat har samma toxikologiska ekvivalensfaktor (TEF) används för bromerade dioxiner och furaner som för motsvarande klorerad kongen.

Sweco Environment {{was commissioned}} by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to do a screening study of metals and brominated and chlorinated dioxins and furans in <b>ashes</b> from <b>incineration</b> of waste and biofuels. The study has two primary objectives: a. to assess whether the composition of <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> can serve as indicator for the monitoring of the change of use of environmentally harmful substances in society. b. to {{provide a basis for}} evaluation of risks in connection to the use of ashes Eleven metals (arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, vanadium, and zinc) as well as chlorinated and brominated dioxins and furans were analysed in the ashes. The study included 25 samples from the following matrices: · 8 samples of municipal solid waste <b>incineration</b> (MSWI) bottom <b>ash</b> · 5 samples of MSWI fly ash · 6 samples of biofuel <b>incineration</b> bottom <b>ash</b> · 6 samples of biofuel <b>incineration</b> fly <b>ash</b> Samples from biofuel <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> included two samples of each fly and bottom ashes from plants that include recycled wood in their fuel mix. Sampling was undertaken in accordance with a simplified method based on NT Envir 004. A minimum of three samples were collected over a period of one to two weeks. Samples collected within this project were complemented with saved samples from a previous project on critical metals in waste <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> (Johansson et al 2013). All sampling was undertaken by participating incineration plants. Metal concentrations detected in this study were broadly similar to concentrations shown in previous studies (WSP 2012, Johansson et al 2013), though the variation was large (which is in agreement with results in other studies). Metal concentrations in <b>ashes</b> from <b>incineration</b> of biofuels containing recycled wood are generally higher than in ashes from plants using pure biofuels. However, the mean mercury concentration is slightly higher in fly <b>ash</b> from <b>incineration</b> of pure biofuels. Chlorinated dioxins and furans were detected in all samples. The total concentrations varied between 12. 9 and 340, 000 ng/kg dw corresponding to between 0. 88 and 4, 300 ng WHO-TEQ/kg dw (upper bound). Concentrations of chlorinated dioxins and furans were generally higher in fly ashes than in bottom ashes. Results are presented in Table A. The results from analyses of municipal waste <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> showed similar results as in the study performed in 2006 by Avfall Sverige (Avfall Sverige 2009). However, the analyses of biofuel ashes showed higher concentrations in this study than in previously reported studies (WSP 2012, Bjurström 2006). There was no difference in the concentrations of dioxins and furans in the ashes from ecycled wood and pure biofuels. Brominated dioxins and furans were detected in all samples. The total concentrations varied between 12 and 29, 600 ng/kg dw. There are no toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for brominated dioxins and furans. To calculate WHO-TEQ sums for the brominated species in the samples, the TEFs for the corresponding chlorinated species were used. WHO-TEQ sums for the brominated species varied between 0. 3 and 140 ng/kg dw (upper bound). Results are presented in Table B. Table B. Results from analyses of brominated dioxins and furans in <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes.</b> Results from the analyses of brominated dioxins and furans indicated similar levels in MSWI bottom ash as in a Taiwanese study (Wang et al 2010), however the distribution was larger in this study. Concentrations in MSWI fly ash was slightly higher in this study compared to the Taiwanese study. Similar to the Taiwanese study, results from this study indicated higher concentrations in MSWI bottom ash than in MSWI fly ash. No previous studies of brominated dioxins and furans in biofuel ashes were found. The results from this study indicate lower concentrations in biofuel ashes than in MSWI ashes. As opposed to MSWI ashes, concentrations are higher in fly <b>ash</b> from <b>incineration</b> of biofuels than in bottom ash. No effects could be seen from the use of recycled wood in the fuel mix in biofuel incineration plants on the concentrations of brominated dioxins and furans. For the purpose of describing risks in connection with use of ashes, a simplified assessment has been made by comparing the concentrations in this study with concentrations deemed to be of negligible risk to {{human health and the environment}} (Swedish: mindre än ringa risk) for aggregates from recycled materials, as described in a guidance document from Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket 2010). The comparison shows that these concentrations were exceeded in all samples. This does not mean that the ashes are not suitable for use in aggregates, but that the use is subject to an individual assessment in each case. Only total concentrations has been analysed within the scope of this study, and no speciated analyses were undertaken. Risks associated with unwanted compounds in the ashes are not only connected to the total concentrations in the ashes, but to a large extent also to the leachability of those compounds. In order to decide whether an ash is suitable for recycling for a certain purpose, additional characterisation is required. Furthermore, the risk associated with potential exposure or contamination in relation to that specific usage should be highlighted. Also, positive environmental effects from the use of ashes should be taken into account when evaluating the suitability of its use. Recycling of ashes as aggregate may substitute virgin materials, thereby saving natural resources. Overall, the results obtained in this study, correlate well with results from previous studies. Brominated dioxins and furans, which are not as extensively studied previously, were detected in all samples in this study. The contribution to WHO-TEQ is small in most samples, compared to the contribution from chlorinated dioxins and furans. In MSWI bottom ash, the contribution to WHO-TEQ is larger from brominated than from chlorinated dioxins and furans. However, the sum of WHO-TEQ in MSWI bottom ash is low compared to the concentrations in fly ash. In conclusion, the study showed that incinerator ashes are not suitable as indicator for the monitoring of the change of use of environmentally harmful substances in society. Municipal and industrial wastes are often incinerated together and since municipal waste is imported for incineration in Sweden, the ashes will not reflect changes in consumption patterns in Sweden...|$|R

The design mix satisfied the stability criteria as stipulated by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). The resilient modulus of the mix at optimum binder content was, however, slightly lower than that of the conventional W 3 B wearing course.

(2, 3) Thus, both economic and environmental reasons suggest the use of these ashes. This paper mainly summarizes some of the conclusions of the research carried out during the execution of CRAFT project BRST-CT 96 - 5085, where leather <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> generated by two different pilot combustion systems, respectively a fixed grill incinerator (FGI) and a fluidized bed incinerator (FBI) were characterized and chromium was leached using a mixed pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical route as well as a full hydrometallurgical route...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the sinter-crystallization {{behavior}} of a glass from municipal solid waste <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes</b> was investigated. The crystallization kinetics were estimated by DTA at different heating rates and the formed crystalline phases were evaluated by XRD. The sintering was studied at different heating rates and at different holding temperatures by dilatometry, measuring the % of linear shrinkage, while {{the structure of the}} sintered samples was observed by SEM. The bending strength and the Young modulus were evaluated after heating at 5 and 20 K/min and 1 h holding at 1123 K. The DTA show two overlapped crystallization peaks, corresponding to 440 and 430 kJ/mol activation energies of crystallization. The XRD highlight that the crystallization starts by pyroxene formation, followed by anorthite and gehlenite. The sintering of the glass particles is inhibited by the crystalline phase formation and stops after the formation of 10 % of crystal phase. Higher densification may be obtained by applying fast heatin...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{substance}} flows of six heavy metals through economy and environment {{has been described}} for the year 1990. The considered metals are: copper, lead, zinc, chromium, cadmium and mercury. With scenario calculations, the effect of current environmental policy measures and additional measures on the substance flows in 2010 is determined. This investigation has been performed in order of the Ministery of Housing, Physical Planning and the Environment because concerning the objectives the environmental norms of the selected heavy metals are exceeded in different environmental compartments and products (like sewage sludge or <b>incineration</b> <b>ashes).</b> The study shows that current environmental policy leads to considerable reductions; however not sufficient to reach the desired environmental quality. Therefore, the report gives a summary of additional policy measures, which are effective according to scenario calculations. Another objective of the investigation {{was to determine the}} effectivity of the environmental policy concerning the theme of squandering: the proper management of stocks of heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|In the PhosForYou project, the PASCH process, {{formerly}} {{designed to}} recover phosphorous from sewage-sludge <b>incineration</b> <b>ash,</b> is extended {{to start from}} dried sewage sludge directly. One of the major steps in this process is the reactive extraction of heavy metals from a leach liquor, followed by fractional precipitation. The process is realized on pilot-plant scale and tested in bypass at waste-water treatment plants. The process param-eters will be optimized to maximize process efficiency depending on the local situation with respect to impurities and water content. The product is a phosphate, which can directly be used in fertilizer formulations...|$|E
40|$|A {{chemical}} recycling method by using phase separation {{was applied to}} municipal waste slags. Glasses were prepared from <b>incineration</b> <b>ash</b> and ash-melted slag, where B(2) O(3) was added to promote phase separation. The glasses were heat-treated at temperatures higher than their glass transition temperatures, and they were soaked in hydrochloric acid, leaching CaO, Fe(2) O(3), K(2) O, and S. Transparent and colorless solids containing ca. 80 mass% of SiO(2) were successfully obtained as residues. It was suggested that phase separation took place not in the heat-treatment but in the vitrification process, and further characterizations are however required to investigate the phenomena at microscopic levels in the recycling processes...|$|E

In combination with mature metallurgical technologies of coking by coke oven, regenerative flame furnace technology and melting by electric arc furnace, technologies of regenerative fixed bed pyrolysis technology for household waste, co-coking technology for waste plastic and blend coal, and <b>incineration</b> <b>ash</b> melting technology by electric arc technology for medical waste were respectively developed to improve current unsatisfied sorting status of waste. The investigation results of laboratory experiments, semi-industrial experiments and industrial experiments as well as their economic benefits and environmental benefits for related technologies were separately presented...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} <b>incineration</b> (MSWI) <b>ash</b> {{is used in}} part as raw {{materials}} for cement clinker production {{by taking advantage of}} the high contents of SiO(2), Al(2) O(3), and CaO. It is necessary for environmental reasons to establish a material utilization system for the <b>incineration</b> waste <b>ash</b> residue instead of disposing these ashes into landfill. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the feasibility of replacing clinker raw materials by waste ash residue for cement clinker production. MSWI bottom ash and MSWI fly ash are the main types of ashes being evaluated. The ashes were mixed into raw mixture with different portions of ash residue to produce cement clinker in a laboratory furnace at approximately 1400 A degrees C. X-ray diffraction and X-ray florescence techniques were used to analyze the phase chemistry and chemical composition of clinkers in order to compare these ash-based clinkers with commercial Portland cement clinker. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|R
