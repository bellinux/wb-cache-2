500|$|Anwar Ibrahim, former UMNO deputy President {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and {{the de facto}} leader of the {{opposition}} Pakatan Rakyat coalition, chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of [...] "ketuanan rakyat" [...] (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not what the people want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, actors Hiroyuki Sanada, Hal Yamanouchi, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima {{had been}} cast as Shingen, Ichirō, Mariko and Yukio, respectively. Additionally, Will Yun Lee was cast as Harada, and Brian Tee as Noburo Mori. By July 2012, Deadline.com said Jessica Biel would play Viper. However, at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Biel said {{her role in}} the film was [...] "not a done deal", explaining, [...] "People <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> this. I don't know {{anything}} about it. It's a little bit too soon for that kind of an announcement". A few days later, negotiations between Biel and 20th Century Fox had broken down. Later in July, Fox had begun talks with Svetlana Khodchenkova to take over the role. Somewhat unusually for action movies, The Wolverine features four female lead roles and [...] "passes the Bechdel Test early and often", according to Vulture. Mangold noted that he wrote his heroines so that [...] "they all have missions. They all have jobs to do other than be the object of affection", intent of avoiding the [...] "worn out" [...] trope of the woman in jeopardy.|$|E
500|$|... "The Queen and I" [...] {{features}} extensive {{samples from}} ABBA's [...] "Dancing Queen", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional {{account of his}} march into the British House of Commons and Buckingham Palace to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport ("When cancer is the killer/John Player run the league") and lambasts the [...] "tabloid mentality" [...] ("They all <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Princess Di's dress"). The Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] is briefly sampled. After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show Top of the Pops, as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels, Drummond cries [...] "Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!". The acerbic [...] "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" [...] follows. A [...] "stunning audio collage" [...] featuring an AIDS public information film, a rerecording of glamour model Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)", and the nursery rhyme [...] "Ring a Ring o' Roses", [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the AIDS crisis.|$|E

Jai is annoyed when Nikhil <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> their father would run things so Jai reminds Nikhil that they run the factory, not their father. Jai soon befriends Faye Lamb (Kim Thomson) and takes a shine to Maisie Wylde (Alice Coulthard). Jai is annoyed with Priya's bad {{behaviour}} and tells her to either stop or move out of his house.|$|R
5000|$|At one point, Ruth takes a short holiday {{to visit}} her Aunt. When she comes back, May has made a chicken dinner and keeps making odd {{comments}} about how tasty the chicken is because it was slaughtered properly. Ruby is silent during the meal {{and appears to be}} high. When Ruth finally asks her mother why she <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the chicken, her mother explodes with the story that Ruby strangled and hung the chicken in the coup for May to find.|$|R
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the things you want to talk about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soda Stereo was the {{beginning}} of a globalization movement that incorporated local musicians into a great continental rock movement, up to the point of leading local critics to wonder: [...] "Does it make sense to <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> [...] "national rock [...] "?". In many parts of Latin America, including Colombia, [...] "Soda Stereo became the expression of the musicality and poise of a new generation, one which tried to differentiate themselves from that of those in their thirties in the 1980s who preferred the Dominican merengue, by beginning to listen and sing rock in Spanish." [...] In Chile, Soda not only marked a whole generation with their looks, lyrics and music, but especially by way of the intense emotional relationship developed between the band and its fans, which was a decisive factor to [...] "de-nationalize" [...] the band and make it an expression, and not only young people in a particular country, but youth as a sector uniform social issues and common languages, something that rock and roll had not been achieved so far in the Spanish-speaking countries due to language barrier.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you. Decades in and Adam Ant sounds fresher than ever, reinvigorated he sounds like he has just started ... As Adam strips down to semi nakedness during the filthy Physical- the long, slow f—k of the set has reached its climax. It seems astonishing {{when you think about it}} but Adam Ant is currently fronting one of the best rock n roll shows in the UK right now." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Homeland Preparedness News, “Former {{members of}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection downplayed {{the idea that}} a wall alone would be enough to {{strengthen}} the U.S. southern border in a Senate hearing on 4, 2017, framing it {{as part of a broader}} strategy.” U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said during the hearing that while Americans want a secure border, she has “not met anyone that says the most effective way is to build a wall across the entirety of our southern border. The only one who <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> that is President Trump.” ...|$|R
50|$|Spanning {{the years}} 1947-65, the film follows the {{maturation}} of Ah-ha (Ah-hsiao) {{as he and}} his family (parents, grandmother, older sister, three brothers) cope with the shock of leaving their homeland (the grandmother <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> returning to the mainland to visit the ancestors). Having been only a child during the move, Ah-ha quickly acclimatizes himself to the new country, often putting him at odds with his more traditional family; he joins a street gang and has to choose between that life and taking the college entrance exam.|$|R
5000|$|Time Magazine writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode was a [...] "sufficiently stunningly bloody episode {{to make up}} for several episodes of smoke exhalations and {{brooding}} looks." [...] Poniewozik, however, criticized the [...] "dropped-like-a-brick mention of Vietnam in the office conversation. It’s plausible that people were starting to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Vietnam in 1963, but there are better ways than by kicking off a dialogue, My dad <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Vietnam." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wasnt sure if it was a [...] "pivotal episode of Mad Men", but that [...] "if this episode isn’t bound to be a classic, who cares - Mad Men certainly is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, boys, if {{you really}} want to be good to Mac, you can do it in this way. Don't <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> things he can't do, or go and tell what fun you have had batting your ridiculous balls about. Get some nice book and read quietly; cheer him up about school, and offer to help him study by and by; you can do that better than I, because I'm only a girl, and don't learn Greek and Latin and all sorts of headachy stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An idée fixe. You know. One {{of those}} things fellows get. Like Uncle Tom's {{delusion}} that everybody who is known even slightly to the police is lurking in the garden, waiting {{for a chance to}} break into the house. You <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> this chap at Cannes, and there never was a chap at Cannes, and I'll tell you why I'm so sure about this. During those two months on the Riviera, it so happens that Angela and I were practically inseparable. If there had been somebody nosing round her, I should have spotted it in a second." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Ormond really {{lost her}} {{patience}} with him, and felt {{better than she}} had {{for a long time}} by scolding him in good earnest. She told him he was talking very blasphemously, and when he urged that his morality was directly in line with Parnell's, and Parnell was an archbishop, she was so vexed that she would not go to drive with him that morning, though he apologized and humbled himself in every way. He pleaded that it was such a beautiful day, it must be the last they were going to have; it was getting near the equinox, and this must be a weather-breeder. She let him go off alone, for he would not lose the drive, and she watched him out of sight from her upper window with a heavy heart. As soon as he was fairly gone, she wanted to go after him, and she was wild all the forenoon. She could not stay indoors, but kept walking up and down the piazza and looking for him, and at times she went a bit up the road he had taken, to meet him. She had got to thinking of the tramp, though the man had gone directly off down another road after he had his breakfast. At last she heard the old creaking, rattling buggy, and as soon as she saw Ormond's bare head, and knew he was all right, she ran up to her room and shut herself in. But she couldn't hold out against him when he came to her door with an armful of wild flowers that he had gathered for her, and boughs from some young maples that he had found all red in a swamp. She showed herself so interested that he asked her to come with him after their midday dinner and see them, and she said perhaps she would, if he would promise not to <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the things that made her so miserable. He asked her, 'What things?' and she answered that he knew well enough, and he laughed and promised.|$|E
50|$|Anna (Malese Jow) finds Jeremy at the Grill and he thanks her for {{her help}} {{regarding}} his history paper. Anna <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> vampires but Jeremy still {{does not believe in}} the stories and tries to get away. Anna tries to ask him out but Jeremy leaves for the school dance. She later goes to the school dance herself and finds him, asking him for Jonathan's journal. Jeremy says that he lent it to Alaric, something that makes Anna upset and her face change (Anna is a vampire). Jeremy notices but she tells him it is nothing and she walks away.|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{although}} she likes, {{and is able}} to enjoy, sex, she is very reluctant to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, especially in public. But all around her, people <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> freely <b>about</b> sex in general and also about their own sex lives, whereas Esther does not even want to imagine her father sleeping with Henia Borenstein, and is slightly embarrassed when she sees them holding hands under the table.|$|R
6000|$|The Prince had looked, {{with the}} question, as if this, again, could trouble him, and it {{determined}} in his companion a slight impatience. [...] "You <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{such things as}} if they were our affair at all. I feel, at any rate, that I've {{nothing to do with her}} doubts and fears, or with anything she may feel. She must arrange all that for herself. It's enough for me that she'll always be, of necessity, much more afraid for herself, REALLY, either to see or to speak, than we should be to have her do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we aren't." [...] And Charlotte's face, with these words--to the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them-- fairly lightened, softened, shone out. It reflected as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck. It made her look for the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption--so apt is the countenance, as with a finer consciousness than the tongue, to betray a sense of this particular lapse. She might indeed, the next instant, have seen her friend wince, in advance, at her use of a word that was already on her lips; for it was still unmistakable with him that there were things he could prize, forms of fortune he could cherish, without at all proportionately liking their names. Had all this, however, been even completely present to his companion, what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it? She applied it then, though her own instinct moved her, at the same time, to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadn't heretofore by a hair's breadth deviated. [...] "If it didn't sound so vulgar I should say that we're--fatally, as it were--SAFE. Pardon the low expression--since it's what we happen to be. We're so because they are. And they're so because they can't be anything else, from the moment that, having originally intervened for them, she wouldn't now be able to bear herself if she didn't keep them so. That's the way she's inevitably WITH us," [...] said Charlotte over her smile. [...] "We hang, essentially, together." ...|$|E

Everyone <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> these last three years at the club, winning two promotions and then staying in the Premier League."

She runs back to the car, lights a cigarette and drives away. However, she soon has an accident and is trapped by the seatbelt.

Joey buys a delicious {{sandwich}} but {{is not allowed to}} eat it in Gary's car, so he <b>keeps</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it, much to the annoyance of Ross and Chandler. Ross accidentally turns on the beacon, prompting Gary to move him from the front seat. During the ride, a car backfire scares them all, leading to Joey diving over Ross in an attempt to save him. This causes problems between Chandler and Joey because Joey apparently wanted to save Ross instead of Chandler, his best friend. However, it turns out that Joey didn't want to save Ross, but save his sandwich, which is, according to him, [...] "the greatest sandwich in the world".|$|R
