5000|$|These {{bags are}} known as green bags in Australia due to their {{relative}} environmental friendliness and usual (though far from universal) green color. Green Bags and similar reusable shopping bags are commonly distributed {{at the point of}} sale by supermarkets and other retail outlets. They are intended to be reused repeatedly to replace the use of hundreds of High-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bags. Most green bags are made of 100% Non-woven Polypropylene (NWPP) [...] which is recyclable but not biodegradable. Some companies claim to be making NWPP bags from recycled material, however with current manufacturing techniques this is not possible. All NWPP bags are made from virgin material. Similar bags are made of <b>jute,</b> <b>canvas,</b> calico or hemp but are not discussed here. A typical base insert is 200x300 mm and weighs 30 g. It is generally made of a stiff plastic.|$|E
50|$|Raiba {{lived in}} a 100 square feet {{tenement}} with his mother, {{his wife and three}} children. This space served too as the studio. Canvas in those was not easy to come by and was usually imported. During his time in Kashmir stretched cloth on a board served as his canvas. Jute when stretched tight is extremely taught, but the fibres from the strains of jute often shed. Being from a plant that grows in standing water, with humid conditions, the fibre resists decay by humidity and is apt for tropical temperatures. It is readily available and cheap. Using jute for its availability and cost, Raiba soon devised a method of priming the stretched jute, using techniques learnt during his training to be a muralist at school. He would prepare the surface of his <b>jute</b> <b>canvas</b> by creating a white sticky solution of white clay paste, fevicol (gum adhesive), water and ground bricks. The gum adhesive would act as the binder and bring in the colour. The prepared canvas had a taught smooth surface that was dull white in colour. The process is time consuming as the jute strings absorb the solution easily but the pores between them take time to fill. It takes 15 layers of application before the stretched jute {{can be used as a}} canvas. Raiba, is distinct in his use of jute, he changes the surface of the material to resemble a canvas and does not use it in its natural form. While painting there is a deep absorption of the paint into the surface, leaving a rough texture on the surface, altering the shades of the paint. Even after years of having been painted these canvases do not develop cracks or have any fungal damage in comparison to the common canvas. The placement of subjects within his paintings borrow from the murals, narrating multiple stories, histories through intricate images that often go unnoticed but remain essential.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary 3 D {{printing}} and traditional craft rarely {{meet in the}} same creation. They tend to live in different worlds. In this paper, the author argues for merging these two distinct traditions. To that end, he developed hybrid basketry, a medium where 3 D-printed structures are shaped to allow the growth and development of hand-woven patterns. While the 3 D-printed plastic elements contribute the aesthetics of the digital curvatures and manifolds, the hand-woven reed, <b>jute,</b> and <b>canvas</b> fibers infuse the baskets with a unique organic appeal. The author discusses his motivation, describes the making process, and presents four hybrid baskets, integrating a deeper discussion on the place of craft and tradition within our contemporary approach to design and fabrication.

50|$|From 1949-53 {{he studied}} at Bezalel Art School, Jerusalem; and from 1959-63 at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. His work is figurative and {{primarily}} {{based on the}} figure of Woman. Gueffen works in large format, primarily in oils on canvas. His latest works are Collage, oil and sack on natural <b>canvas,</b> <b>jute</b> or wood. He produces many drawings, and works essentially from sketches of models. He has also illustrated certain books: 'Robinson Crusoe' published by the Israeli publisher Amoved in the 1960s and he provided the illustrations for 'The World's Best Jewish Jokes' by Ben Eliezer, published in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Sammoun {{works in}} a series of images from one palette. He works with oils on <b>jute</b> and linen <b>canvas,</b> {{applying}} a heavy impasto, created in fast emotional bursts of energy. The result is a spontaneous rendering of the subject, as if a flickering effect of light is coming through, reflected by the colors he places side by side and {{on top of one another}} on his canvas. Critics like Noel Meyer of MAGAZIN' ART have said, [...] "Sammoun attempts to make his audience feel the wind blow through the trees, the heat in the air and the colours of the sky ..." [...] Victor Forbes Editor of Fine Art Magazine, has said that [...] "Sammoun's emotional investment in each work is evident in every canvas." ...|$|R
40|$|Donald Brothers of Dundee were factory weavers who {{designed}} and manufactured rough woven textures as furnishing fabric between 1896 - 1983. This thesis examines Donald Brothers' emergence as makers of decorative cloth within an artistic framework that established the aesthetic for texture, and by {{close examination of}} their sampled fabrics sheds light on the design and meaning of woven texture for the Arts & Crafts interior between 1896 - 1914. Chapter 1 examines the basic unpublished documentation of the Donald businesses which establishes that the firm's historical involvement in Dundee's coarse cloth trade conditioned their emergence as makers of decorative texture in 1896. The aesthetic context that precipitated this emergence is considered in chapters 2, 3 and 4, through a study of contemporary movements in painting, architecture and hand-crafted textiles. The appreciation for texture {{as an object of}} design in Britain and America is explained. Chapter 5 provides an analysis of the industrial basis and practicalities of running Donald Brothers between 1896 - 1914. Examination of the firm's records builds up a profile of the men who directed the firm and the methods by which they shaped its design and marketing policy. Chapters 6 - 9 form the heart of the thesis. They examine in detail the unique sample book records to establish the character of Donald Brothers' materials, manufactured between 1896 - 1914. Chapter 6 is devoted to a study of their plain and printed jute canvases used for wallcoverings. Chapter 7 examines their range in plain and printed linens and their uses, while chapter 8 explores in detail developments in their figured weaves. Chapter 9 focuses on the originality of the rougher textures developed in <b>jute</b> <b>canvas</b> and linen between 1906 - 1914. The relationship of these factory woven fabrics to the fashionable hand-woven fabrics of the Arts & Crafts Movement is defined. Chapter 10 examines the unpublished business records of Gustav Stickley in order to establish the importance of Donald Brothers' materials to the Craftsman aesthetic. The contribution their fabrics made within the Craftsman, Arts & Crafts home is defined. In conclusion it is claimed that Donald Brothers' early textures were Arts & Crafts in design and manufacture and quintessential Arts & Crafts fabrics for use within the American Craftsman interior in the early twentieth century...|$|E
