25|$|Chucho {{was arrested}} by Querétaro police chief Rómulo Alonso after {{arriving}} home from a performance at the Iturbide Theater. His wife María Bermeo and a suspected accomplice were arrested at the same time. Four other women were arrested as accomplices later. All were charged with robbing a local store after police found cash, goods and tools such as master keys, <b>drills</b> and <b>rope</b> in one of Chucho’s residences. Further investigation revealed his real identity.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crown block}} is the {{stationary}} {{section of a}} block and tackle that contains a set of pulleys or sheaves through which the <b>drill</b> line (wire <b>rope)</b> is threaded or reeved and is opposite and above the traveling block.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of the traveling block, crown block and wire <b>rope</b> <b>drill</b> line gives the ability to lift weights {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of pounds. On larger drilling rigs, when raising and lowering the derrick, line tensions over a million pounds are not unusual.|$|R

5000|$|Technical {{problems}} {{plagued the}} early mining efforts, requiring {{the development of}} new mining technology to support the challenge. German engineer Philip Deidesheimer created a timbering system for mining tunnels called square sets, which enabled the retrieval of huge amounts of silver ore in a safe manner. Square set timbering, roots blowers, stamp mills, the Washoe Pan milling process, Cornish pumps, Burleigh machine <b>drills,</b> wire woven <b>rope,</b> miners’ safety cages and the safety clutch for those cages; even the Sutro tunnel all had a place in supporting the exploitation of the rich ore body. As technological advancements, these were used many times over in later mining applications. In 1876 one observer reported that in Virginia City, “every activity {{has to do with the}} mining, transportation, or reduction of silver ore, or the melting and assaying of silver bullion.” ...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, mandatory noise standards have been developed that specify time-noise limits of mine personnel exposure. Most affected by elevated noise levels is the pneumatic roof bolter operator, {{both in terms of}} levels near or in excess of 115 dbA and in terms of length of exposure. Therefore, the principal emphasis of this Bureau of Mines report is on pneumatic drill noise control. It is not the intent of this report to suggest any drill redesign; instead, methods are suggested to reduce the noise level by complementing existing machines. An integral muffler system and a separate muffler system were tested in an attempt to lower pneurnaric drill noise levels. Pneumatic drills, when new, operate at about 115 dbA when drilling in sandstone. Using the drill muffler systems, it was possible to decrease the noise level of a 115 -dbA s <b>rope</b> <b>drill</b> to approximately 100 dbA...|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Zigong have been {{drilling}} {{in the area for}} Salt since before the Han Dynasty (76-88 A.D.) to extract salt from brine. Some historian estimates are that China has been active in producing salt since about 6000 BC. The brine aquifers in the area have salinity of at least 50 grams per liter. The classical method of drilling and production was the following: a drilling rig is erected and a borehole is drilled using a <b>drilling</b> bit and <b>rope.</b> Brine is extracted by dropping a long tube down the borehole. A membrane valve then captures the brine for retrieval on the surface. Once the brine is retrieved it's then piped to flat pans for boiling. In the boiling process some water and crushed yellow soybean is added. The soybean absorbs the impurities in the salt. Once boiled, a yellow layer is formed - this is scraped off leaving absolutely pure salt. The salt is a medium grain salt with different size flakes which have a very strong and unique salt taste. This salt has no additives so it does clump. Locals use grains of rice in the salt to keep the salt from clumping.|$|R
40|$|Background: Performing laparoscopic {{procedures}} re-quires {{special training}} {{and has been}} documented as {{a significant source of}} surgical errors. “Warming up ” before performing a task has been shown to enhance perfor-mance. This study investigates whether surgeons benefit from “warming up ” using select video games immediately before performing laparoscopic partial tasks and clinical tasks. Methods: This study included 303 surgeons (249 men and 54 women). Participants were split into a control (n 180) and an experimental group (n 123). The exper-imental group played 3 previously validated video games for 6 minutes before task sessions. The Cobra Rope partial task and suturing exercises were performed immediately after the warm-up sessions. Results: Surgeons who played video games prior to the Cobra <b>Rope</b> <b>drill</b> were significantly faster on their first attempt and across all 10 trials. The experimental and control groups were significantly different in their total suturing scores (t 2. 28, df 288, P. 05). The overall Top Gun score showed that the experimental group per-formed marginally better overall. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that subjects com-pleting “warming-up ” sessions with select video games prior to performing laparoscopic partial and clinical tasks (intracorporeal suturing) were faster and had fewer errors than participants not engaging in “warm-up. ” More study is needed to determine whether this translates into supe-rior procedural execution in the clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that short, pre-operative practice with a simulator, box trainer, or certain video games can temporarily improve one's basic laparoscopic skills; the so-called warm-up effect. In this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that Underground video game made for training basic laparoscopic skills, {{can also be used}} for a pre-operative warm-up. 29 laparoscopic experts were randomized into two different groups, which were tested on two different days. Group 1 (n = 16) did a laparoscopic skill baseline measurement using the FLS peg transfer test and the Top Gun cobra <b>rope</b> <b>drill</b> on day 1, and did the same tests on day 2 after a 15 min session with the Underground game. Group 2 (n = 13) did the same, but started with the video game, followed by baseline measurement on day 2. This way, each participant served as its own control. Video recordings of both tasks were later analyzed by two blinded reviewers. On day 1, group 2 was 14. 33 % (P = 0. 037) faster in completing the peg transfer test. A trend toward better cobra rope scores is also seen. When comparing the average improvement between both days, group 1 -which used the game as a warm-up on day 2 -showed a 19. 61 % improvement in cobra rope score, compared to a 0. 77 % score decrease in group 2 (P = 0. 002). This study shows that the Underground video game {{can be used as a}} pre-operative warm-up in an experimental setting...|$|R
