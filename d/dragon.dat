5000|$|AD&D 2nd edition and D&D 3rd edition divided true <b>dragons</b> {{further into}} three main categories: {{chromatic}} <b>dragons,</b> such as green and black <b>dragons,</b> which are evil-aligned; metallic <b>dragons,</b> such as {{gold and silver}} <b>dragons,</b> which are good; and neutral-aligned gem <b>dragons,</b> rare creatures that possess psionic abilities. In addition, there were other sub-species of true <b>dragons</b> that did not fit into the three main categories. For example, mercury and steel <b>dragons</b> {{would seem to be}} metallic <b>dragons,</b> but in the Dungeons & <b>Dragons</b> world they are considered to be outside of the main family of metallic <b>dragons</b> because of various biological differences (though the book <b>Dragons</b> of Faerûn did list them as metallic <b>dragons).</b> The [...] "lung dragons" [...] or spirit-dragons of Oriental Adventures are also true <b>dragons.</b>|$|R

It was not until <b>Dragon</b> WarriorVII was released that <b>Dragon</b> Quest became critically acclaimed in North America, although reception was still mixed. The series gained more universal praise with <b>Dragon</b> QuestVIII, and began to sell better outside Japan and <b>Dragon</b> QuestIX sold over 1million copies outside Japan.|$|E

Chromatic <b>dragons</b> are presented in the Monster Manual and Draconomicon: Chromatic <b>Dragons.</b> Metallic <b>dragons</b> are presented in the Monster Manual 2 and Draconomicon: Metallic <b>Dragons.</b> Catastrophe <b>dragons</b> are presented in Monster Manual 3.
