5|$|Bosworth {{was born}} on January 2, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. She is {{the only child of}} Patricia (n√©e Potter), a homemaker, and Harold Bosworth, a former {{executive}} for Talbots. She was born with heterochromia iridum, and has a hazel right <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> blue left eye. At the age of six, Bosworth's family relocated from San Francisco to various parts of the country due to her father's job. She was raised mainly on the East Coast, spending the rest of her youth in Massachusetts and Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses a shorten version of Peters' remix. The visual portrays Hamasaki in a dark laboratory, being surrounded by keyboards, electronic devices and a black bird. Throughout the music video, several people start to wear headphones and follow Hamasaki, with them eventually starting {{to listen to the}} song and observing TV monitors of the singer. Each person, including Hamasaki, wears black eye shadow on one <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> code on their hand. Over the clip, the singer is seen singing to the recording in the laboratory, with interspersed scenes portraying her wearing the outfit used for the single's artwork. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki, includingA Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), and the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014).|$|E

5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ivan again reached Category4 {{status as}} it entered the Caribbean Sea. Subsequently, it {{underwent}} an eyewall replacement cycle, and for about 18hours the intensity remained constant as it paralleled the northern coast of Venezuela offshore. Another period of rapid deepening began late on September 8 as its motion {{turned to the}} west-northwest. Hurricane Hunters recorded flight-level sustained winds of 180mph (290km/h) {{to the north and}} northeast of the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dropsonde about 630feet (190m) above the surface recorded winds of 200mph (325km/h) and an extrapolated pressure of 916mbar (27.05inHg). Based on the reports, it is estimated Ivan attained Category 5 status at 0600UTC on September 9, while located about 90miles (145km) north of Aruba. At the time, the cyclone was forecast to strike southern Florida as a major hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> thick black malar streak.|$|E

5|$|Scyllarides latus was {{originally}} {{classified in the}} genus Scyllarus, along with the four other slipper lobsters known at the time (Scyllarus arctus, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, Thenus orientalis and Arctides guineensis). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely Thenus and Ibacus. In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made the error of including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus. This was first recognised by the ichthyologist Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised Arctus with Scyllarus, and erected a new genus Scyllarides to hold the species that De Haan had placed in Scyllarus. Scyllarides {{is placed in the}} subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|With the {{subtropical}} ridge to its north, Isa tracked {{to the north}} and gradually curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status; at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16. Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under-analyzing the strength of the {{subtropical ridge}}. By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite a potential threat to Guam the typhoon remained 260km (160mi) south of the island. It gradually curved to the north, and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1-min winds of 270km/h (165mph). At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155km/h (100mph).|$|E
25|$|When {{one image}} is {{presented}} to one <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> very different image {{is presented to}} the other (also known as dichoptic presentation), instead of the two images being seen superimposed, one image is seen for a few moments, then the other, then the first, and so on, randomly {{for as long as}} one cares to look. For example, if a set of vertical lines is presented to one <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other, sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines, and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines.|$|E

25|$|When {{the images}} {{presented}} to the eyes differ only in their contours, rivalry {{is referred to as}} binocular contour rivalry. When the images {{presented to the}} eyes differ only in their colours, rivalry is referred to as binocular colour rivalry. When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their lightnesses, a form of rivalry called binocular lustre may be seen. When an image is presented to one <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as contour dominance. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would be invisible were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to one <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as flash suppression.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{conventional}} surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap {{is made in}} the scleral wall of the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble {{on the surface of the}} eye.|$|E
