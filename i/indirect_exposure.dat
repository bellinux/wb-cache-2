40|$|Sorption of emitted gas-phase organic {{compounds}} onto material surfaces affects {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS) composition and exposures indoors. We have introduced a new metric, the exposure relevant emission factor (EREF) that accounts for sorptive uptake and reemission to give the mass of individual ETS constituents available for exposure over a day in which smoking occurs. This paper describes month-long experiments to investigate sorption effects on EREFs and potential ETS exposures under habitual smoking conditions. Cigarettes were smoked in a 50 -m(3) furnished room over a 3 -h period 6 - 7 days per week, with continuous ventilation at 0. 3, 0. 6, or 2. 1 h(- 1). Organic gas concentrations were measured every few days over 4 -h "smoking", 10 -h "post-smoking" and 10 -h "background" periods. Concentration patterns of volatile ETS components including 1, 3 -butadiene, benzene and acrolein {{were similar to those}} calculated for a theoretical non-sorbing tracer, indicating limited sorption. Concentrations of ETS tracers, e. g. 3 -ethenylpyridine (3 -EP) and nicotine, and lower volatility toxic air contaminants including phenol, cresols, and naphthalene increased as experiments progressed, indicating mass accumulation on surfaces and higher desorption rates. Daily patterns stabilized after week 2, yielding a steady daily cycle of ETS concentrations associated with habitual smoking. EREFs for sorbing compounds were higher under steady cycle versus single-day smoking conditions by similar to 50 % for 3 -EP, and by 2 - 3 times for nicotine, phenol, cresols, naphthalene, and methylnaphthalenes. Our results provide relevant information about potential <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> from residual ETS (non-smoker enters room shortly after smoker finishes) and from reemission, and their importance relative to direct exposures (non-smoker present during smoking). Under the conditions examined, <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> accounted for a larger fraction of total potential exposures for sorbing versus non-sorbing compounds, and at lower versus higher ventilation rates. Increasing ventilation can reduce <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> to very low levels for non-sorbing ETS components, but indirect routes accounted for similar to 50 % of potential nicotine exposures during non-smoking periods at all ventilation rates.

30|$|Lastly, Fig.  9 {{provides}} us with a comprehensive picture of the existing financial exposures among the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area {{and the rest of}} the world across the considered financial instruments. The comprehensive analysis of the euro area financial system as a multilayer macro-network allows us to obtain further insights on the challenging problem of estimating the financial interdependencies existing between the banking sector and both the real and the financial sector, enabling the consideration of the relevant <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> via the different financial instruments considered together. Further, this analysis {{provides us}} also with a map of the potential channels through which distress may propagate as a consequence of shocks of different nature. Both the insights on the estimate of financial interdependencies and the map of the potential distress propagation channels could not be obtained with a single layer analysis. In order to make more homogeneous the different layers of the multilayer macro-network of financial exposures, we compute weights as percentages of the total assets of the source institutional sectors. Moreover, for the sake of clarity, we remove links with a weight below 1 %. By focusing on the most relevant links (with a weight above 10 %) connecting the different institutional sectors of the euro area via loans and deposits, debt securities, and equity, we can identify the existence of relevant <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> of the banking system to the financial sector. In particular, as shown in Fig.  9, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about 16 % of their total financial assets to Non-Financial Corporations, via loans and deposits. In turn, Non-Financial Corporations are exposed for about 10 % of their total financial assets to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. The chain continues both via equity and debt securities to the Rest of the World arriving i) to Other Financial Institutions via loans and to Non-Financial Corporations via equity, or ii) coming back to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem via loans and equity, or iii) to Non-Financial Corporations via equity, making restart the chain from the beginning in all three cases. Further, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem also exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about the 20 % of their total financial assets to Households, via loans and deposits. In turn, Households, other than being exposed to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem for about 30 % of their total financial assets via loans and deposits, are exposed for about 19 % of their total financial assets to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. From this point the chain starts to coincide with the previous one. These findings shed light on the existence of <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> of the banking system to the financial sector, and in particular, to Non-MMF Investment Funds, and Other Financial Institutions, that could not be identified if the financial system was not regarded as a multilayer financial network, leading to an underestimation of the exposures of the banking sector to the financial sector and the potential associated risks.|$|R

Estimating health hazards from <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> to organic chemicals involves an ecosystem's approach to understanding the unique behavior of complex mixtures. Metabolism by microbial organisms fundamentally alters these complex mixtures as they move through food chains.

We find that direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>exposures</b> to climate-policy-relevant sectors represent a large portion of investors’ equity portfolios, especially for investment and pension funds. Additionally, the portion of banks’ loan portfolios exposed to these sectors is comparable to banks’ capital. Our results suggest that climate policy timing matters.
