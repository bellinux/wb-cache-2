50|$|This two-storey villa was {{constructed}} in 1923 after Andres Gawat, a police captain, won in a lottery. It is located at 2307 Medel Street. The house is characterized by having a plain exterior, exhibiting walls made of hardwood and the traditional sliding capiz windows with iron grills. Board panels around the house were arranged vertically and horizontally. Repairs {{have been made to}} the walls to replace decayed panels. Galvanized iron sheets were utilized as main roof and canopies. Poured concrete was used on the floor on the first storey while <b>hardwood</b> <b>board</b> panels were installed on the floor on the second storey of the house.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{railroad}} was built of trestles constructed from the region's native hemlocks. The rails were 6 x 12 in hemlock timbers approximately 20 to 30 ft long, placed on edge. The rails were surfaced with a half-inch thick, {{two and a half}} inch wide (.5 x 2.5 in) iron strap screwed to the top. After a short time in service, the hemlock was discovered to be too soft, and a 4 in wide <b>hardwood</b> <b>board</b> was positioned under the iron.

5000|$|In North America, market {{practices}} for dimensional lumber made from hardwoods varies {{significantly from the}} regularized standardized 'dimension lumber' sizes used for sales and specification of softwoods - <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> are often sold totally rough cut, or machine planed only on the two (broader) face sides. When <b>Hardwood</b> <b>Boards</b> are also supplied with planed faces, it is usually both by random widths of a specified thickness (normally matching milling of softwood dimensional lumbers) and somewhat random lengths. But besides those older (traditional and normal) situations, in recent years some product lines have been widened to also market boards in standard stock sizes; these usually retail in big box stores and using only a relatively small set of specified lengths; in all cases hardwoods are sold to the consumer by the board-foot (...) , whereas that measure is not used for softwoods at the retailer (to the cognizance of the buyer).|$|R

50|$|The {{internal}} {{walls of the}} brick core are plastered and the rooms have highly decorative s plaster ceilings, ceiling panels and cornices. It is understood that the ceilings were timber-boarded originally, and that these boards survive above the plaster. Flooring throughout is of timber. That in the parlour and dining room is later, narrow <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards,</b> but the front bedroom has earlier wide boards, possibly pine.|$|R
50|$|In the Americas, two-bys (2×4s, 2×6s, 2×8s, 2×10s, and 2×12s), {{named for}} {{traditional}} board thickness in inches, {{along with the}} 4×4 (3.5 × 3.5 in), are common lumber sizes used in modern construction. They are the basic building blocks for such common structures as balloon-frame or platform-frame housing. Dimensional lumber made from softwood is typically used for construction, while <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> are more commonly used for making cabinets or furniture.|$|R
50|$|The front {{verandah}} {{has recently}} had the original floorboards replaced with new <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards.</b> A length of early handrail and dowel balustrade {{exists on the}} northwest corner. The verandah was until recently enclosed to create a sleep-out, with a second stair leading to the ground on the east side. Evidence of this stair exists {{in the form of}} holes to one of the verandah posts where the handrail was let in.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} two windows, {{matching}} {{those of the}} sides, to the front wall, one {{each side of the}} double entry doors. The interior is a single room, with the timber wall and roof framing exposed. The floor is of narrow (about 50mm) <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards.</b> The rear door is boarded and braced, and retains some original hardware.

50|$|To {{the west}} of the farm house is a large barn {{constructed}} primarily of hardwood slabs and milled weatherboards with a corrugated iron roof. The barn is 15 metres by 10 metres and is elevated off the ground. The floor of the central section is made of <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards,</b> while the lower floors to either side are laid with large timber slabs. The building has been rebuilt recently and some roof framing and sheeting are therefore quite recent. Some new hardwood slabs have been introduced recently.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{construction}} differs {{across the}} coach house complex. In the kitchen building {{the wall to}} the semi enclosed southern verandah is constructed from rough sawn vertical timber slabs spanning from the ground to the pitching point of the lean-to roof. In the boarding house {{the southern end of}} the east facing verandah has been enclosed with butt jointed pit sawn <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> spanning vertically from floor level to the pitching point of the lean-to verandah roof. The eastern exterior wall to the boarding house is clad with dressed tongue and groove timber boards.|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{are built}} from planed and polished <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> - often ebony - that are slotted {{into each other}} using tongue and groove joinery. The internal timbers often feature bas-relief carvings of ancestors, jewelry, animals, fish and boats with a balance {{of male and female}} elements that is essential for Niassan concepts of cosmic harmony. The more opulent houses are further decorated with freestanding wooden carvings and the internally exposed rafters are adorned with jaw bones from pigs that were sacrificed for the workers' feast {{at the time of the}} houses' completion.|$|R
50|$|Adjoining {{the cattle}} yards {{is a part}} open purpose {{designed}} stand for the auction of cattle and horses. The arena has U shaped plan of tiered seating around the sales pen and a raised auctioneers platform over the gate entry to the sales pen. The construction is steel pipe framing with an aluminium roof sheeting on hardwood rafters. The tiered seating is of <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> fixed on angle iron supports in a slat style. Adjoining the sales arena are two loading ramps constructed of concrete and steel pipe rails. Two timber carved cattle heads adorn two posts to indicate the cattle area.|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of the hardwood lumber industry is devoted to the processing of lumber into secondary wood products (like furniture parts). <b>Hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> are typically remanufactured into smaller parts by a series of rip and cross cuts with no consideration of parts placement or the location of defective areas. These cuts yield pieces, in accordance with the manufacturers cutting bill, that are free of defective area. The entire process is labor intensive and results in a substantial loss of valuable lumber. With traditional gang/rip methods yields of 50 % are considered to be very good. These losses increase with operator fatigue and inexperience...|$|R
50|$|The railway cream shed {{is located}} within the Melawondi railway yard facing east {{adjacent}} to the Mary Valley branch railway line, {{and is the only}} remaining structure within the yard. The cream shed is a square timber structure, set on low timber and concrete stumps and sheltered by a gabled corrugated iron roof. The shed is timber framed and is clad and lined with horizontal <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> separated by open spaces, with the interior boards offset to cover the outside spaces. Double timber doors open out to towards the timber platforms {{on either side of the}} shed. The front platform is missing some timber boards.|$|R

50|$|The {{expansion}} of dairy production {{during the early}} twentieth century led to the construction of cream sheds by Queensland Railways at stations and sidings throughout the state. Cream sheds were built to a standard design; measuring 10 ft x 10 ft (3.05 x 3.05 m), clad and lined with horizontal <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> separated by open spaces, with the interior boards offset to cover the outside spaces. The spacing of the boards improved air circulation, resulting in a cooler storage space, reducing the risk of the cream spoiling before reaching the butter factory. Double doors opened out to platforms {{on either side of the}} shed for placement and retrieval of cream cans. Sheds were set on low stumps and were sheltered by a gabled roof.|$|R
50|$|The 1892 {{core of the}} {{building}} incorporates two large cells, each with an exercise yard and two smaller cells with a single L-shaped yard. Exercise yards are enclosed by concrete walls, {{three and a half}} metres in height. Each of the yards is separately entranced by iron doors with peep holes and large draw bolt locks. In each of the four 1892 cells, railway iron rails are imbedded horizontally in concrete piers between the top of the external walls and the ceiling, providing ventilation. The remand cell has railway iron rails spanning the room {{at the top of the}} walls spaced 25 centimetres apart, the ends being imbedded into the walls. The ceilings are lined with tongue and groove <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1907, {{the eclectic}} {{interests}} of the land baron Henry E. Huntington brought the ancient art of surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking {{for a way to}} entice visitors to the area of Redondo Beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 16-foot <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original [...] "Long board", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo.|$|R
50|$|Exterior {{walls to}} the {{remainder}} of the building are rendered and finished with shallow ruled ashlar. The western elevation is punctuated by four large double-hung sash windows shaded by curved timber-framed window hoods. Verandahs wrap around the east and north. The south end of the east verandah is open and stop chamfered posts with capitals are supported on recent metal stirrups and bearers are supported on low masonry piers. The verandah roof is timber-framed and the floor is lined with wide <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards.</b> Two door openings to the east verandah flank a large double-hung timber sash window. At the south end, a timber paneled door with glazed fanlight opens into the manager's office and the northern opening houses glazed French windows which open into the vestibule {{to the rear of the}} manager's office.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is located on}} the western side of the facade and is accessed from the street via two concrete steps with risers finished with tessellated tiles. A pair of painted timber paneled doors with an arched and glazed fanlight above provides access into a small entry vestibule which is lined with timber paneling to walls and ceilings and <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> to the floor. The vestibule recesses into and provides access to the building's foyer space via another pair of timber paneled swing doors with two glazed and arched panels inset. A tall, arched window with double-hung sashes and a masonry sill is located to the east of the front entrance together with a basement window. Windows on the upper level are similar in design but are slightly shorter in height.|$|R
50|$|The highly intact Amamoor, Kandanga and Melawondi cream sheds {{demonstrate}} the principal characteristics of railway cream sheds built alongside Queensland railway lines {{to facilitate the}} transport of dairy produce during the twentieth century. Located adjacent to the railway line in station yards and built to a standard design, the small square sheds are clad and lined with horizontal <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> separated by open spaces on both the interior and exterior, with those on the interior offset to cover the spaces on the exterior. The boards are spaced to improve air circulation, resulting in a cooler internal storage area. The sheds stand on low stumps, are sheltered by gabled roofs and have double doors that open out to platforms {{on either side of}} the shed for placement and retrieval of cream cans.|$|R

40|$|Avoid {{the expense}} of {{kiln-dried}} lumber by processing and drying your own lumber at home. Anyone who has done much woodworking knows how expensive high quality, kiln-dried, hardwood lumber can be. Even kiln-dried construction lumber is expensive. Besides expense, there also may be problems with finding certain species of wood, highly figured wood, or <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> thicker than one inch (4 / 4). One way to avoid these problems is to dry your own lumber. Green, unsurfaced, or unplaned lumber {{can be obtained from}} many small sawmills in Nebraska and surrounding states. You may also want to obtain your own logs and hire a sawmill operator to cut them to your specifications. These logs could come from your own land or could be purchased from a woodlot owner. Even shade trees that need to be removed can sometimes be used in this way...|$|R
50|$|The railway cream shed sits {{within the}} {{southern}} end of the Amamoor railway station yard, facing west adjacent to the Mary Valley branch railway line. The cream shed is a square timber structure, set on low timber stumps and sheltered by a gabled corrugated iron roof. The shed is timber framed and is clad and lined with horizontal <b>hardwood</b> <b>boards</b> separated by open spaces, with the interior boards offset to cover the outside spaces. Double timber doors open out to towards the timber platforms on either side of the shed. A set of low timber steps with a concrete block base lead up to the northern end of the platform facing the railway. A guard log is positioned in front of the northern elevation. The recent mural adorning the external timber boards of the shed is not of heritage significance.|$|R
