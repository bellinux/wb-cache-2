5|$|Additional Confederate {{activity}} in Louisiana occurred on June 29 at Goodrich's Landing. Confederates attacked a plantation and army training center run by <b>former</b> <b>slaves.</b> The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured {{over a hundred}} <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> before disengaging {{in the face of}} Ellet's Marines. Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and showed the Confederates could cause only momentary disturbances in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> were allowed to vote. Republicans began {{looking for a way to}} offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of <b>former</b> <b>slaves,</b> or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} day, Booth was in {{the crowd}} outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window.

2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that if a slave sought refuge with the Israelites, the Israelites were not to turn the slave over to the slave’s master, but were to let the <b>former</b> <b>slave</b> live in any place the <b>former</b> <b>slave</b> might choose and not ill-treat the <b>former</b> <b>slave.</b> A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|R

5|$|African {{slaves were}} {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slaves, <b>former</b> <b>slaves,</b> {{and their descendants}} were not eligible under the Constitution to be citizens. Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes {{were considered to be}} outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon was {{loyal to}} the Union during the Civil War. He {{represented}} his county and his state {{in a number of}} failed conventions that sought to resolve the upcoming conflict before it began. In 1864, he joined Kentucky governor Thomas E. Bramlette in an audience with President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> as Union soldiers in Kentucky. Dixon died on April 23, 1876.|$|E
5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the <b>former</b> <b>slaves,</b> without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the states would not accept.|$|E

5|$|On September 19, Grant's army {{defeated}} Confederates at the Battle of Iuka, then successfully defended Corinth, inflicting heavy casualties. On October 25, Grant assumed {{command of}} the District of the Tennessee. In November, after Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Grant ordered units under his command to incorporate <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> into the Union Army, giving them clothes, shelter and wages for their services.|$|E
5|$|The Corps of Colonial Marines {{were two}} Marine units raised from <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> for {{service in the}} Americas by the British {{at the behest of}} Alexander Cochrane. The units were created at two {{different}} times, and were later disbanded once the military threat had disappeared. Apart from being instigated in each case by Cochrane they had no connection with each other.|$|E
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution {{was adopted}} on July 9, 1868, {{as one of}} the Reconstruction Amendments. The {{amendment}} addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress.|$|E

5|$|The first Corps was a {{small unit}} that served in the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810, {{recruited}} from <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> to address the shortage of military manpower in the Caribbean. The locally-recruited men were less susceptible to tropical illnesses than were troops sent from Britain. The Corps followed {{the practice of the}} British Army's West India Regiments in recruiting slaves as soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Another radical leader, Communist {{spokesman}} and one-time {{leader of}} American {{forces in the}} Spanish Civil War Harry Haywood, was born in 1898 in South Omaha as Haywood Hall to parents who were <b>former</b> <b>slaves.</b> In 1913 his father was beaten by a white gang at the South Omaha meatpacking plant where he worked, forcing the family {{to move from the}} city. The African Blood Brotherhood, started in Omaha, contributed to radicalizing Haywood when he joined it the group in Chicago, where his family had moved in 1915.|$|E
5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for <b>former</b> <b>slaves,</b> hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|Despite Grey Worm and Missandei's objections, Tyrion Lannister {{arranges}} {{a diplomatic}} {{meeting with the}} masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis. He proposes a deal allowing the cities seven years to transition away from slavery, while compensating the masters for any losses. In return, the masters will cease their support of the Sons of the Harpy. As the masters deliberate, Tyrion is confronted by the <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> of Meereen, who oppose any kind of negotiation with the masters. Grey Worm and Missandei reluctantly support Tyrion, but in private they warn him that the masters, whom they are both familiar with, will use him if he tries to use them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and <b>former</b> <b>slaves,</b> meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for <b>former</b> <b>slaves,</b> but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E

Another {{influential}} black pioneer of the time, {{and a friend of}} the Robinson's, was America Newton.|$|R
5|$|Lucretia and James Mott visited {{central and}} western New York {{in the summer}} of 1848 for a number of reasons, {{including}} visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary. Lucretia Mott's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went.|$|E
5|$|Senator Henry Wilson, {{founder of}} the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery {{political}} stance. After the war, {{he became one of}} the leading Radical Republicans in Congress, pressing for civil rights for <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> and harsh treatment of former Confederates. In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of his History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power, a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{tensions}} existed {{with the}} Spanish. Writing from HMS Royal Oak, off Mobile Bay, on 15 March 1815, Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm, Cochrane's subordinate {{commander of the}} Mobile Squadron, assured Don Mateo Gonzalez Manrique, the Governor at Pensacola, that Post-Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer (a son of George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer) of , had been detailed to conduct a strict enquiry into the conduct of Nicolls and Captain Woodbine, regarding the property losses of Spanish inhabitants of Florida. Malcolm believed that in cases where <b>former</b> <b>slaves</b> could not be persuaded {{to return to their}} owners, the British government would undertake to remunerate the owners.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the freed slaves continued to work for their former masters, but as free people, receiving wages for their labor. If the <b>former</b> <b>slave</b> decided not to work for his former master, the Protectors Office would pay the former master 23% of the <b>former</b> <b>slave's</b> estimated value, {{as a form of}} compensation.|$|R
