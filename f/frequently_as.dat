5|$|After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed <b>frequently.</b> <b>As</b> the {{southern}} governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, as only {{the centre of}} Vietnam was under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter of Catholic missionaries, while Minh Mạng was a staunch Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished and the region was put under direct control.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated <b>frequently.</b> <b>As</b> late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E

5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> boys on {{surviving}} Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made <b>frequently.</b> <b>As</b> the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|By 1196 de Gray was in {{the service}} of Prince John (later King John), and was keeper of John's seal by 1198.

He also served as John's secretary, and <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> a deputy for the Lord Chancellor, Hubert Walter. Shortly after John became king, de Gray began travelling between England and the continent on royal business, and for {{the first two years of}} John's reign was active in the royal chancery, sealing royal charters.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on in the}} 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 {{straight}} scoreless innings, winning {{three consecutive}} games during that time. However, he won less <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> the season wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished {{the season with a}} 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, {{and at the end of}} May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. By the end of the season, he had a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, after nine years pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the Washington Senators for pitcher By Speece and outfielder Carr Smith.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons Johnson {{featured}} intermittently in the first team. He scored five goals in 12 appearances for the first team in 1920–21, playing more regularly for the reserves, for whom he was the leading goalscorer with 18 goals. He became a regular first team selection in 1922–23, playing 35 matches. In 1923 Manchester City moved from Hyde Road to a new stadium, Maine Road, in the Moss Side area of the city. Johnson scored in the first match at the new stadium, against Sheffield United. While Johnson was a regular goalscorer {{at this point in}} his career, he did not score as <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> teammates Frank Roberts and Horace Barnes. Firmly established in the first team, he missed only one match in the 1924–25 season.|$|E

Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as bura or less <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> sirocco. The sunniest {{parts of the country}} are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000hours of sunshine per year.|$|E
5|$|Robinson idolized Henry Armstrong and Joe Louis as a youth, and {{actually}} {{lived on the}} same block as Louis in Detroit when Robinson was 11 and Louis was 17. Outside the ring, Robinson got into trouble <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> a youth, and was involved with a violent street gang. He married at 16. The couple had one son, Ronnie, and divorced when Robinson was 19. He finished his amateur career with an 85–0 record with 69 knockouts–40 coming in the first round. He won the Golden Gloves featherweight championship in 1939, and the organization's lightweight championship in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E

5|$|The {{stopping}} {{patterns on}} the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line have generally been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E
5|$|West {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was crew chief in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify {{the best and worst}} umpires. West was identified as the best MLB umpire by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect to the worst umpire, 6 percent of players in the survey selected West. Only three umpires were named more <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> worst umpire in the survey. A 2007 review of umpire strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West was the most consistent umpire in the major leagues.|$|E

5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. New York and Chicago remained {{the center of}} skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> a result of competition between rival cities for status and investment. Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the Carew Tower Complex in 1930. In Detroit, the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928. Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the Terminal Tower in 1929; the latter, built by the Van Sweringen brothers, was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world. Seattle had built Smith Tower in 1914, and the Los Angeles local government granted itself an exemption from city planning restrictions {{in order to build}} the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928. In 1928, the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence.|$|E
