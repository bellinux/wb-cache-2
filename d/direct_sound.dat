5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
25|$|In acoustics, comb {{filtering}} {{can arise}} in some unwanted ways. For instance, when two loudspeakers are {{playing the same}} signal at different distances from the listener, there is a comb filtering effect on the signal. In any enclosed space, listeners hear a mixture of <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> and reflected sound. Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> and a comb filter is created where the two combine at the listener.|$|E

30|$|In 2004, Faller and Merimma {{reported}} that IC relates to perceiving sound image width and stability, {{as well as}} sound field ambience [46, 47]. On the other hand, by the precedence effect [48, 49] of spatial hearing—sound source localization depending primarily on the <b>direct</b> <b>sounds</b> to the ears and essentially irrespective to reflection and reverberation—which contributes to lowering IC, Faller proposed that our auditory system use ITD and ILD to localize sound sources only if IC approaches 1. Since <b>direct</b> <b>sounds</b> to the ears have near 1 cross-correlation, this explains the precedence effect.|$|R
25|$|The {{interaction}} of a loudspeaker system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the <b>direct</b> <b>sound,</b> cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and {{this is part of the}} reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David Griesinger and Steve Barbar {{developed}} LARES in 1988 {{while working}} at Lexicon, originally located in Waltham, Massachusetts. Lexicon had become respected for its digital reverberation products used for professional sound recording and concert sound reinforcement. The name LARES is an acronym of Lexicon Acoustic Reinforcement and Enhancement System. In 1989, Griesinger and Barbar, {{at the request of}} acousticians Neil Muncy and Robert Tanner, installed the first production LARES system in the Elgin Theatre in Toronto. This initial system used two microphones placed at the balcony's front edge to pick up sound from the stage. The microphone signals were treated electronically, and the resulting signals were sent to 116 loudspeakers positioned in the ceiling and under the balcony. Griesinger presented a technical paper on the concept, process and results to the Audio Engineering Society. A primary component of the electronic treatment was the addition of enough digital delay to make the enhanced loudspeaker output wave arrive at its target seating area at the same time or soon after the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> from the stage. Reverberation was digitally synthesized and added to the signal, and patented time variant signal processing was employed to overcome coloration from acoustic feedback between the microphones and loudspeakers. Two LARES mainframes were used, one for the 60 underbalcony speakers and one for the 56 loudspeakers in the main ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|Direct-field {{acoustic}} testing, or DFAT, is {{a technique}} used for acoustic testing of aerospace structures by subjecting them to sound waves created by an array of acoustic drivers. The method uses electro-dynamic acoustic speakers, arranged around the test article to provide a uniform, well-controlled, <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> field at {{the surface of the}} unit under test. The system employs high capability acoustic drivers, powerful audio amplifiers, a narrow-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) controller and precision laboratory microphones to produce an acoustic environment that can simulate a helicopter, aircraft, jet engine or launch vehicle sound pressure field. A high level system is capable of overall sound pressure levels in the 125–147dB for more than one minute over a frequency range from 25Hz to 10kHz.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from {{one or more of the}} surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the <b>direct</b> <b>sound,</b> thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary. While the patent has expired, [...] "Pressure Zone Microphone" [...] and [...] "PZM" [...] are still active trademarks of Crown International, and the generic term [...] "boundary microphone" [...] is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is [...] "Phase Coherent Cardioid" [...] or [...] "PCC," [...] but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.|$|E

5000|$|An {{anechoic}} chamber ("an-echoic" [...] meaning non-reflective, non-echoing or echo-free) is a room designed to completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves.

40|$|SummaryIn the {{precedence}} effect, sounds emanating {{directly from}} the source are localized preferentially over their reflections. Although most {{studies have focused on}} the delay between the onset of a sound and its echo, humans still experience the precedence effect when this onset delay is removed. We tested in barn owls the hypothesis that an ongoing delay, equivalent to the onset delay, is discernible from the envelope features of amplitude-modulated stimuli and may be sufficient to evoke this effect. With sound pairs having only envelope cues, owls localized <b>direct</b> <b>sounds</b> preferentially, and neurons in their auditory space-maps discharged more vigorously to them, but only if the sounds were amplitude modulated. Under conditions that yielded the precedence effect, acoustical features known to evoke neuronal discharges were more abundant in the envelopes of the <b>direct</b> <b>sounds</b> than of the echoes, suggesting that specialized neural mechanisms for echo suppression were unnecessary...|$|R

50|$|In {{enclosed}} rooms {{not only}} the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> from a sound source is arriving at the listener's ears, but also sound which has been reflected at the walls. The auditory system analyses only the <b>direct</b> <b>sound,</b> which is arriving first, for sound localization, but not the reflected sound, which is arriving later (law of the first wave front). So sound localization remains possible even in an echoic environment. This echo cancellation occurs in the Dorsal Nucleus of the Lateral Lemniscus (DNLL).|$|E
50|$|Haas {{found that}} humans {{localize}} sound {{sources in the}} direction of the first arriving sound despite the presence of a single reflection from a different direction. A single auditory event is perceived. A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving within 5 to 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> without being perceived as a secondary auditory event (echo). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection's direction has no significant effect on the results. A reflection with attenuated higher frequencies expands the time span that echo suppression is active. Increased room reverberation time also expands the time span of echo suppression.|$|E
