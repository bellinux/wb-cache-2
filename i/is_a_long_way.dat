25|$|Cooper's {{contribution}} was {{in response to}} claims of mediaeval origin for the scroll. Andrew Sinclair, a leading proponent of Freemasonry's descent from the Knights Templar, hailed it as a great mediaeval treasure, comparable with the Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral. His claim arises from what opponents describe as an optimistic reading of radiocarbon dating, and creative interpretation of the panels. The Tabernacle is claimed to be King Solomon's Temple, with the tents removed in Sinclair's reproduction. Sinclair and his supporters also have trouble with lodge 128 of the Antients. It is variously claimed to be in Yorkshire, or Prince Edwin's Lodge in Bury (a Moderns Lodge constituted in 1803). In 1785, 128 was meeting in the Crown and Feathers, Holborn, London. Robert Lomas, a supporter of the early dating, now sees part of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in one of the altar inscriptions and much of the symbolism. This would place the document to {{the second half of the}} Eighteenth century in a conventional history of the Rite, but Lomas believes it to be mid-fifteenth, again based on radiocarbon dates, which make the side panels younger than the central strip. Realistically, agreement on the scroll, its context and symbolism <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> off.|$|E

500|$|On appeal, the Court of Appeal {{held there}} was a valid trust. Giving the leading {{judgment}} Dillon LJ said the trust was valid, first, because {{it was necessary for}} there to be one to enforce the terms of the employment contract. Second, he distinguished Re London Wine Co, saying, [...] "That case <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from the present. It is concerned with the appropriation of chattels and when property in chattels passes. We are concerned with a declaration of trust". He instead concluded that as there was no tangible distinction between the shares, and as such no reason to hold the trust void just because the shares had not been segregated. As such, the trust was valid.|$|E

500|$|Originally 11 Melbury Road, {{the house}} was renumbered as 31 Melbury Road in 1967. It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road {{designed}} by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that [...] "The house is getting on famously and looks stunning... It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by what I hear he says of his, but my opinion is the universal one." [...] Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927. Fildes was {{survived by his wife}} and six children. [...] In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Nimrod {{three and a}} half stars out of five, calling it an [...] "invigorating, if occasionally frustrating listen", and although he praised Armstrong's [...] "gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies", he noted that [...] "the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed." [...] Greg Kot of Rolling Stone enjoyed the album's melodic nature as well as the [...] "measure of sincerity" [...] present in Armstrong's vocals. [...] Kot appreciated the return of the band's [...] "juvenile sense of humor" [...] that he felt was lacking on Insomniac, and praised the musical diversity on the record, remarking, [...] "This music <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from Green Day's apprenticeship at the Gilman Street punk clubs, in Berkeley, Calif. But now that the band has seen the world, it's only fitting that Green Day should finally make an album that sounds as if it has." ...|$|E

This brings the staff {{out of the game}} and back to the reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing that Phyllis's character was the murderer. Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin remarks that Savannah <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> away, but does so in character; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the [...] "date" [...] was just part of the game. Erin says she was also just playing, but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew she thought the date was real.|$|E

500|$|Footage {{from the}} first episode was {{screened}} at New York Comic Con in October 2015, while the first trailer for the season was released in November. Alice Walker of Screen Rant felt that [...] "this promo highlights {{the best parts of}} the show. Fast paced and slick, Atwell is still incredibly charming....There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go before we see if they can build on the momentum from the previous season, but so far it looks like a fun adventure." [...] Conversely, Kaitlin Thomas at TV.com called the promo [...] "weird", asking, [...] "Why is ABC marketing Agent Carter like it's one of the network's casually daft melodramas instead of a well-written drama...From a tonal and thematic standpoint, the series depicted in that trailer feels like the polar opposite of what it actually is....cutting together a bunch of scenes of Peggy punching people or holding a gun does not make her a badass when its framed in this way, and frankly, it's no wonder people aren't tuning in if that's the type of show they think this is." [...] In March 2016, Maureen Ryan, writing for Variety, described the season's promotion as [...] "lackluster", and blamed it, as well as other factors that included [...] "the botched rollout of Season 2", on the season's ultimately poor viewership.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go." ...|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's {{try to figure out}} why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeysâ€”first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E
