5000|$|The JK <b>flip-flop</b> augments the {{behavior}} of the SR <b>flip-flop</b> (J=Set, K=Reset) by interpreting the J = K = 1 condition as a [...] "flip" [...] or toggle command. Specifically, the combination J = 1, K = 0 is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination J = 0, K = 1 is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination J = K = 1 is a command to toggle the <b>flip-flop,</b> i.e., change its output to the logical complement of its current value. Setting J = K = 0 maintains the current state. To synthesize a D <b>flip-flop,</b> simply set K equal to the complement of J. Similarly, to synthesize a T <b>flip-flop,</b> set K equal to J.
