5|$|Released (19.1.0.28) on September 6, 2011, Norton Internet Security 2012 {{brought new}} {{features}}. One {{of the new}} features included in the new release is Download Insight 2.0, which not only monitors files for safety but also the stability of a given <b>file.</b> <b>That</b> means that if a file is stable on Windows 7, but unstable on Windows XP, XP users will be notified of the file's instability.|$|E
5|$|An f-deck is a data <b>file</b> <b>that</b> {{contains}} {{a record of}} the fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix is any position estimate of the storm center. An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level penetrations through the storm center. Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{versions}} of the PowerBook100's QWERTY layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63keys and an international ISO version with 64keys. The caps lock key on the PowerBook100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System7 operating system software includes an extension <b>file</b> <b>that</b> causes an icon of the international caps lock symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar when Caps Lock is active.|$|E

5000|$|UndeletePlus restores deleted files. It {{can also}} recover <b>files</b> <b>that</b> have been emptied from the Windows recycle bin, {{permanently}} deleted files within Windows using the [...] shortcut, and <b>files</b> <b>that</b> have been deleted from within CMD. Users can also restore <b>files</b> <b>that</b> had been deleted from {{a flash memory}} drive. UndeletePlus is part of Phoenix's eSupport.com line.|$|R
5000|$|Symantec, {{makers of}} Backup Exec, states that “An Incremental backup backs up only the {{selected}} <b>files</b> <b>that</b> have their archive bit set to ON, setting {{them back to}} OFF. This results in a backup of all <b>files</b> <b>that</b> are new or changed since the last backup, {{whether it was a}} full or an incremental...A Differential backup will back up all selected <b>files</b> <b>that</b> are new and changed since the last full backup.” ...|$|R
5|$|A {{secretary}} at the FBI office, Dorothy Bahnsen (Jane Perry), helps Dales find a <b>file</b> <b>that</b> mentions Gissing, {{one of the}} two other men mentioned by Bill who had committed suicide. She explains that she files all the unsolved cases under X because there is more room under X than U. Gissing's body is still in the morgue and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing's chest. Dales goes to Skur's wife and tells her what was done to her husband and that he wants to expose the experiments. Skur's wife goes down into the backyard bomb shelter to tell Skur, but he is overcome by his parasite and kills her.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS <b>file</b> <b>that</b> changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|Under most circumstances, the {{blacktip reef shark}} has a timid {{demeanor}} and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack <b>File</b> <b>that</b> are attributable to the blacktip reef shark. Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water, {{and a way of}} discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.|$|E
50|$|In early September 2007 The DoD {{released}} fourteen pdf <b>files</b> <b>that</b> contained all 464 Summary of Evidence memos {{prepared for}} the first annual Board hearings, and ten <b>files</b> <b>that</b> contained all 333 Summary of Evidence memos {{prepared for the}} second annual Board hearings.|$|R

5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal <b>file</b> <b>that</b> Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

50|$|Hierarchical Storage Management is a {{means of}} {{transferring}} <b>files</b> <b>that</b> are not used for some period of time to less expensive storage media.

25|$|Conversely, {{the symbol}} width could be set at 8, {{even if only}} values 0 and 1 are used; these data would only require a 2-color table. Although {{there would be no}} point in {{encoding}} the <b>file</b> <b>that</b> way, something similar typically happens for bi-color images: the minimum symbol width is 2, even if only values 0 and 1 are used.|$|E
25|$|A shared {{library or}} shared object is a <b>file</b> <b>that</b> is {{intended}} to be shared by executable files and further shared object files. Modules used by a program are loaded from individual shared objects into memory at load time or run time, rather than being copied by a linker when it creates a single monolithic executable file for the program.|$|E

This is used on Apple's iOS, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360 operating systems.|$|E
25|$|Cron {{is driven}} by a crontab (cron table) file, a {{configuration}} <b>file</b> <b>that</b> specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. Users can have their own individual crontab files and often there is a system-wide crontab file (usually in /etc or a subdirectory of /etc) that only system administrators can edit.|$|E
