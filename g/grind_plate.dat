50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} variations on frame design. Originally a skate had four wheels on each skate, with {{a gap between}} the middle wheel where a plastic insert called an H-block was used for grinding. During earlier times, a plastic plate, known as the <b>grind</b> <b>plate</b> was attached to the frame {{on the outside of the}} two middle wheels instead of an H-block. This allowed normal recreational skates to be converted into aggressive skates, and it was how most aggressive skates were built at the time. On aggressive skates with H-blocks, the <b>grind</b> <b>plate</b> could be used to increase the life of the H-block. But as frame manufacturers began making removable H-blocks, the <b>grind</b> <b>plate</b> fell out of favor. As the sport evolved, skate companies started manufacturing wheels that were intentionally hard and undersized, in order to facilitate grinding. The undersized wheels are called anti-rockers, and replace the two middle wheels.|$|E

50|$|Soap {{shoes were}} {{essentially}} derived from rollerblades and aggressive skating. Chris Morris, {{a resident of}} California who worked at RollerBlade in Torrance for over sixteen years, worked to customize a simple shoe that had a <b>grind</b> <b>plate</b> embedded in the sole. The shoe was an average Nike, fitted for sliding. Concept 21 (a recently founded design firm) was called upon to design a sample so that the product could be finalized. They then formed Artemis Innovations, {{which would be the}} company the brand would be sold under for four years. In 2001, Mr. Morris lost control of the Soap license through legal problems. Activity within the company slowed down, and eventually, the remaining executives sold Soap.|$|E
40|$|The semibonded {{abrasive}} machining {{technique is}} expected to get high surface integrity and processing efficiency attributed to the „trap ‟ effect which can reduce or even eliminate the surface damage induced by the larger particles. The goal {{of the work is}} to validate the „trap ‟ effect by the experiments of semibonded and loose abrasive machining under the conditions of adding and not adding the larger particles. Free surface damage monocrystal silicon wafers after polishing are adopted as workpieces, and 1000 # SiC as abrasive particles while 180 # SiC as the larger particles. The cast iron plate is used as <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> in the loose abrasive machining and different bond concentration semibonded abrasive <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> SSB- 1 and SSB- 2 are used as <b>grinding</b> <b>plates</b> in semibonded abrasive machining.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} was to {{understand}} the capabilities of a dairy based meat alternative. This was done in three phases: 1) the production of a dairy protein gel as a base for a dairy based meat alternative, 2) texturization of the dairy protein gel base to produce a nugget like texture, and 3) a consumer test to determine the acceptability of the dairy based nugget compared to meat and meat alternatives on the market. For phase I, a dairy protein gel base was tested to understand the textural attributes. Milk to whey percentages and level of acidification were examined to determine their effects on instrumental textural attributes of the protein gel. The milk to whey percentages and level of acidification that were tested were 5 / 95, 10 / 90, and 15 / 85, and pH 5. 70 - 5. 60, 5. 15 - 5. 05, and 4. 6 - 4. 5; respectively. The texture was objectively measured using a texture analyzer. The results showed that there was an increase in the hardness, gumminess and chewiness which was associated with an increase of the milk to whey ratio. Also a firmer dairy protein gel was produced using a low pH. A milk to whey percentage of 15 / 85 and a pH of 4. 6 - 4. 5 produced the highest overall instrumental textural attributes, specifically. For phase II, the dairy protein gel composed of a milk to whey ratio of 15 / 85 and pH of 4. 6 was evaluated in the formulation of a dairy based nugget. The grinding of the dairy protein gel was used to determine if different size grinding plates and the presence of a gum can influence the textural attributes of the dairy protein gel. The dairy protein gel base was evaluated by a trained sensory panel to compare to the results of the objective texture analyzer. The dairy protein gel was processed using a meat grinder with a grind size of 3 mm, 6 mm and a blend of 4 parts 6 mm grinded and 1 part 3 mm. The increase in the grind size produced an increased instrumental hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness and gumminess. The usage of gum in the dairy protein gel system produced a higher instrumental adhesiveness. The sensory results showed that an increase in the grind size increased the sensory attributes; hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness and adhesiveness. The use of gum in the system had no influence on the sensory textural attributes. Both the texture analyzer and trained sensory testing showed a similar trend for the texture attributes. No correlation between the texture analyzer and sensory was found. This was a surprise because literature indicates there are significant correlations between instrumental textural attributes and sensory texture attributes. The lack of correlation may be explained by the variability of the panelists (P-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) for each sample. For phase III, an acceptability test was performed on untrained consumers of chicken nuggets to determine if the dairy based meat alternative was acceptable compared to meat nuggets and meat alternatives on the market. Texture, flavor, and appearance were evaluated by a consumer panel. The consumers evaluated the dairy based meat alternative and concluded that the appearance, texture and flavor needed improvement. From this research, it was concluded that a dairy based meat alternative can be created to imitate meat and meat alternative textures. By understanding the processing conditions to produce the dairy protein gel base and grinding of the product, an acceptable meat alternative can be produced. Dairy based meat alternative texture attributes were produced from a milk to whey percentage of 15 / 85 and a pH of 4. 6, and a large <b>grind</b> <b>plate</b> of 6 mm with the use of methylcellulose...|$|E

30|$|Both {{grinding}} stone and <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> {{are made of}} dark grey sandstone, and, more importantly, there are black residues on the surfaces.

The <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> (Fig.  1 c, coded as 12 SCM 15 : 9) is a flat rectangle with a smooth black surface and was broken in the middle when excavated. The residues were only found on the grinding surfaces of both the grinding stone and the plate, and they were labelled as sample I and sample II, respectively. Those residues {{are considered to be}} writing ink and the stone artefacts are regarded as a set of proto-inkstone. In addition, the tomb M 15 does not show any sign of burning, suggesting that the black residue samples were not from the burial environment.|$|R
30|$|The total {{ion current}} chromatograms of PS 1 and PS 2 showed similar results, {{indicating}} that the sampling method by rinsing have the same extraction efficiency with the destructive sampling method, {{and the effect of}} different sampling techniques can be neglected in this study. Detailed information is provided in Additional file 3 : Figure S 3 and Additional file 4 : Figure S 4. Apart from various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, borneol, which is a common additive used in Chinese ink, was also detected in the modern inkstick (Additional file 5 : Figure S 5). The results further proved that extracting by acetone rinsing can provide the overall information about the relevant organic substances in ink samples. Therefore, the ancient residues on the grinding stone and the <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> were sampled by scraping and rinsing respectively, and the extracts were analysed {{in the same way as}} the modern samples.

30|$|In this paper, {{the black}} {{residues}} on a <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>grinding</b> stone unearthed in a Han tomb at the Changle Cemetery in Zhongwei (Ningxia, China) were characterised through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, {{in order to}} verify whether they were writing inks, as well as indicating the presence/absence of animal glues. It is noteworthy that the black residues on the grinding stone are loose flakes; however, only {{a thin layer of}} black residue is attached to the smooth surface of the <b>grinding</b> <b>plate,</b> which is not allowed to run through the frequently-used destructive sampling protocols in order to avoid generating surface scratches. Thus, a micro-destructive sampling approach was designed and then gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was adopted to distinguish the type of Chinese ink, and to investigate the additives which might be added to the ink samples. These samples provide a rare opportunity to determine the composition of early ink and reveal the function of the excavated stone implements. Furthermore, the co-evolution relationship between inkstone shapes and ink manufacture would be discussed.|$|R
30|$|The inkstone is a {{specific}} writing implement in China that was popularized since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A rectangular/round <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> accompanied with a grinding stone is considered {{as a kind of}} proto-inkstone. However, little scientific investigation has been performed to support this hypothesis. In this paper, a micro-destructive approach, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS), were employed to analyse the black residues on a <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> and a <b>grinding</b> stone excavated from the Changle Cemetery (202 BC–AD 8) in northwestern China. The FTIR and Raman analyses indicated that the residues were ancient ink. GC–MS analysis further identified that the residues were pine-soot ink, based on the relative abundances of the main polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as the detection of conifer biomarkers. The trace of animal glue was not detected in the residues; thus, the ink was possibly formed as small pellets and the small grinding stone was necessary to assist during the ink-grinding process. This study confirms that this set of stone implements is indeed an early type of inkstone, and offers some insight into the co-evolution relationship between ink production and inkstone shapes.|$|R
30|$|As mentioned, proto-inkstones in the Western Han Dynasty were {{distinct}} from the later mature inkstones in morphology. They often consisted of two parts: a <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> and a small grinding stone (with ink pellets ground between them). In fact, the Chinese character for inkstone first appeared in ancient literatures shuowen and shiming written in the Eastern Han Dynasty and was never used before. The wide use of proto-inkstone in the Han Dynasty might stimulate {{the invention of the}} Chinese character for inkstone.|$|R

Attrition mill 1 was in use 4 weeks prior to this study while the attrition mill 2 had newly installed <b>grinding</b> <b>plate.</b> The wet-ground pepper and cowpea were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The iron contents of wet- ground foods (pepper and cowpea) from both attrition mills were significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than iron content of ground food using other methods of grinding. A 30 - 40 folds increases in the iron content of ground food samples were detected using attrition mills. Ground pepper from attrition mill 1 showed higher iron contents (4300 ± 474. 35 mg) than pepper ground in attrition mill 2 (3199 ± 281. 68 mg). These values are higher than recommended dietary allowances for iron intake. The increased iron content in ground pepper and cowpea observed {{in the present study}} confirmed the high risk of iron overloading using attrition milling.

40|$|The {{process of}} milling corn into flour in many rural {{communities}} of East Africa {{has remained a}} traditional mortar and pestle process for centuries. Milling machines have failed in these communities largely due to poor performance, as well as high cost, {{and as a result}} the incredibly labor intensive process continues. This study seeks to design and manufacture a prototype mill that will address the needs of the communities in question. Initial testing on existing milling equipment generated a quantitative understanding of the strengths and shortfalls of the available machines, and informed the design of a new mill. Once the design specifications were determined, a two stage, "twinmill" incorporating a stock low cost mill performing an initial coarse grind and a second identical mill that used modified <b>grinding</b> <b>plates</b> to produce finer flour was built. As expected, the two stage solution outperformed the existing machines by a significant margin: the acceptable flour yields rose from the 30 - 40 percent range, to consistently in the mid 60 s.

Experimental results indicate each plate with different concentration of bond can obtain fine surface roughness. When the load or the rotating velocity increases, there is little effect on the surface roughness, but the material removal rate increases correspondingly.

30|$|The inkstone is used {{to grind}} solid ink {{products}} with water into liquid ink, which is necessary in Chinese calligraphy and brush painting [1]. The inkstick, ink brush, paper and inkstone are called Four Treasures of the Study and have important cultural values in Chinese history. The inkstone developed from primitive grinding tools since approximately 6000 – 7000  years ago [2]. A set of stone artefacts, including a <b>grinding</b> <b>plate</b> and a <b>grinding</b> stone, were found in a tomb in Yunmeng County, Hubei Province, dated back to the third century BC, and {{is regarded as the}} earliest excavated inkstone due to the associated ink pellets [3]. Ink and inkstone were gradually popularized during the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 8) with the development of the social economy and culture. There are two important types of Chinese artificial ink, pine-soot ink and oil-soot ink, mainly made from the soot of burnt pine woods and oils respectively [4, 5]. According to historical records, the production of pine-soot ink sprouted in the Qin Dynasty (221 – 207 BC), matured in the East Han Dynasty (AD 25 – 220), greatly improved in Wei-Jin period (AD 220 – 420) and then peaked in the Tang and Song Dynasties (AD 618 – 1279). Following this, the oil-soot ink surpassed pine-soot ink [5]. However, the manufacturing technology in the early stage is not clear {{due to the lack of}} scientific analysis.|$|R
30|$|The {{shape of}} inkstones has varied and changed over time. Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 shows the {{development}} of inkstones since the Western Han Dynasty. A round or rectangular stone plate accompanied with a small grinding stone has been {{supposed to be in}} the early development stage of inkstones, which we call as the proto-inkstone. This inkstone was designed in this way, because the contemporary inks were mainly formed in small pellets, which could not be ground directly against an inkstone without the help of another smaller grinding stone [5, 6]. These <b>grinding</b> <b>plates</b> with a <b>grinding</b> stone are often found in the Han tombs, as hypothetical proto-inkstones. The current studies on these inkstones are restricted to their forms, textures, classifications and manufacture skills, but their functions are mainly interpreted in terms of their morphology, as well as the characteristics of the associated funeral objects [7, 8]. However, the morphological method is inadequate to determine the usage of these stone artefacts, and sometimes they have also been thought as grain-processing tools [9, 10]. In addition, there are various names for these proto-inkstones in different excavation reports, such as “grinding slab”, “grinding plate”, “inkslab”, “flat inkstone”, and sometimes even simply “grinding tools”. Visible residues were occasionally found on these inkstones, which would provide direct chemical evidence to support their functional interpretation; however, relevant organic residue analysis has never been reported up to our knowledge.|$|R
