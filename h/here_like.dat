5|$|The {{large group}} of non-citizens have been {{identified}} as a majority Muslims and there is some Christian Filipinos women who converted to Islam to marry Muslim Filipinos <b>here.</b> <b>Like</b> in Kota Kinabalu, the first wave of these immigrants arrived in the late 15th century during the Spanish colonisation, while the others arriving in the early 1970s because of the troubles in southern Philippines. They consist of migrant workers with many of them being naturalised as Malaysian citizens, however there are still many who live without proper documentation as illegal immigrants in the town with their own illegal settlement.|$|E
5|$|Is the land's epitome, or you {{may call}} it the lesser isle of Great Britain. It is more than this, the whole world's map, which you may here discern in its perfectest motion, justling and turning. It is a heap of stones and men, with a vast {{confusion}} of languages; and were the steeple not sanctified, nothing liker Babel. The noise in it is like that of bees, a strange humming or buzz mixed of walking tongues and feet: {{it is a kind}} of still roar or loud whisper... It is the great exchange of all discourse, and no business whatsoever but is here stirring and a-foot... It is the general mint of all famous lies, which are <b>here</b> <b>like</b> the legends of popery, first coined and stamped in the church.|$|E

25|$|In 1839, {{the philosopher}} Hermann Ulrici {{wrote that the}} play and its {{depiction}} of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life {{is nothing but a}} dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave <b>here,</b> <b>like</b> ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of parody about class differences.|$|E
500|$|Animosity {{between the}} British and the Boers {{intensified}} {{in the run-up}} to the Second Boer War fought from 1899 to 1902, and continued thereafter. One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: [...] "The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better. We do hate them down <b>here</b> <b>like</b> poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew." ...|$|E

500|$|Kimball's {{first years}} as an apostle were {{dominated}} by World War II. Kimball often encouraged American church members to purchase war bonds to support the war effort, which they would {{then be able to}} cash out after the war and use the accumulated interest to send the returned soldiers on their LDS missions. Kimball lamented the global destruction of World War II and once wrote in his journal, [...] "How outraged the Lord must feel to see His children fighting down <b>here</b> <b>like</b> wild beasts." [...] As the keynote speaker at BYU's 1944 baccalaureate service, Kimball publicly criticized members of Allied nations for concentrating on [...] "the tyranny and shackles of [...] nations {{and at the same time}} [...] in bondage individually to sin." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN stated [...] "'Home' was a super busy episode, {{but also}} one that didn't feel rushed. Two big lords of the realm fell while a new Iron Island {{character}} was introduced and a character we all worried about got brought back to life by an unsure-but-well-meaning priestess. Story flowed <b>here</b> <b>like</b> wine in a very satisfying chapter filled with death and resurrection." [...] Fowler gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10. Reviewing for The A.V. Club, {{from the perspective of}} book readers, Myles McNutt gave the episode an A-. McNutt also wrote about the showrunners going back to yet to be used story lines from the books, and transposing them into later seasons, such as the Kingsmoot plot, noting [...] "It's a great example of the show's ability to adapt the books in a non-linear fashion, here wholesale moving a storyline where it serves a clearer purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|Marti Webb {{covered the}} song on her album Won't Change Places (1981) and also {{included}} it in 1995 on the album, Music and Songs from Evita. AllMusic's Joe Francis complimented the recording. Singer Sinéad O'Connor recorded [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] on her album Am I Not Your Girl (1992). Her version received mixed response, with Joy Press from Spin who described the rendition as [...] "a melodramatic, sweeping 'Je ne regrette rien'—style apologia. O’Connor had a calling. Obsessed with purity and truth, she pitched herself somewhere between Christ and the Virgin Mary, as an asexual visionary whose suffering was Inextricably Intertwined {{with the pain}} of Ireland and of the world." [...] Released as a CD maxi single, the song reached number 31 in Belgium Flanders and number 44 in Netherlands. A punk rock version was recorded by alternative band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes in 1999 for their second studio album, Are a Drag. Angus Cargill, author of Hang the DJ: An alternative book of music lists {{was shocked by the}} complete revamp of the song as punk rock, saying that [...] "there's a dark appeal in <b>here,</b> <b>like</b> the thought of taking a cattle prod to your grandma's".|$|E

500|$|Ivan Kreilkamp of Spin {{gave the}} album an {{eight out of}} ten. The review said that the album is [...] "as {{sprawling}} and generous-spirited as Superunknown, but... is a looser and live-er-sounding affair, not seeking {{the same level of}} aural precision". Alternative Press gave the album a three out of five. The review said that Soundgarden are [...] "now fully capable of penning some damned spiffy pop songs", and added that [...] "they sound more human <b>here,</b> <b>like</b> they're playing in your living room". Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Down on the Upside three out of five stars, observing that the album has [...] "some quality frenzy", but criticizing it for [...] "lack defining episodes of catharsis". Fricke said, [...] "Soundgarden seem to be digging in their heels rather than kicking up dirt, relying too much on drone-y impressionism and clever (as opposed to cleaving) guitar motifs." [...] Neil Strauss of The New York Times called the album the [...] "rawer, looser follow-up to Superunknown." [...] He added, [...] "Generally, identifying with animals in song lyrics is a sign of low self-esteem, and Soundgarden is no exception. For all the virility and macho power that rock singers have tried to wring from the , Soundgarden remains more interested in {{the fact that it is}} the only animal cursed to spend its days slithering on the ground." ...|$|E

They announced their {{addition to the}} roster with an impromptu performance of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] from the Dylan album. In support of the album release, Secor states:"Fifty {{years is a long}} time for a place like Nashville, Tennessee. Time rolls on slowly around <b>here</b> <b>like</b> flotsam and jetsam in the muddy Cumberland River. But certain things have accelerated the pace of our city.

2500|$|As Étienne Souriau explained, {{in order}} to accept Pascal's argument, the bettor needs {{to be certain that}} God seriously intends to honour the bet; he says that the Wager assumes that God also accepts the bet, which is not proved; Pascal's bettor is <b>here</b> <b>like</b> the fool who seeing a leaf {{floating}} on a river's waters and quivering at some point, for a few seconds, between the two sides of a stone, says: [...] "I bet a million with Rothschild that it takes finally the left path."

The coordinators request that they finish by telling what they would do with any money they won on Jeopardy! ...|$|E
2500|$|Tilburg-west {{was mostly}} built after WWII, and has 29,611 inhabitants. The {{district}} with its neighbourhoods consists mostly of small brick houses and apartment buildings, except for Zorgvlied, which contains more expensive, free-standing houses. The Westermarkt {{is the largest}} shopping center out of the inner city. Many higher educational buildings are standing <b>here,</b> <b>like</b> Tilburg University and Avans Hogeschool. Another place of many schools is along the Reitse Hoevenstraat with multiple secondary schools such as: Jozefmavo and Theresialyceum. The district is connected by train with the Tilburg Universiteit railway station, Previously known as [...] "Tilburg West station" [...] and {{has one of the}} two hospitals in Tilburg (...)

2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting <b>here</b> <b>like</b> some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
