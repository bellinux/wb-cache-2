40|$|Acetone {{alters the}} {{ultraviolet}} absorption characteristics of warfarin (3 -(a-acetonyl-benzyl) - 4 -hydroxycoumarin) {{and increases the}} intensity of fluorescent emission. Fluorescence of warfarin in acetone is markedly decreased by acidification. These phenomena {{provide the basis for}} a rapid, simple assay for plasma warfarin. THE DETERMINATION of warfarin (3 - (-acetonylbenzyl) - 4 -hydroxy-coumarin) concentration in plasma by the spectrophotometric method of O’Reilly et at. (1) requires several time-consuming extraction pro-cedures. This paper describes a simple, rapid fluoroinetric assay for this determination. Methods As in all fluorometric procedures, glassware, reagents, and speci-mens must be kept free of fluorescent contamination. Glassware must be cleaned with an <b>inorganic</b> <b>detergent</b> and rinsed with distilled water. Paraflim should be used to seal tubes for mixing procedures. Ten milli-liters of venous blood was collected into tubes containing 0. 1 ml. sodium citrate (38 gm. / 100 ml. water), or 20 mg. ethylenediaminetetra#{ 228 }cetic acid (EDTA), or 14 mg. sodium oxalate. The latter two anticoagulants are added as solutions and then the solutions are dried. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 mm. and either analyzed within several hours or stored at _ 200 for subsequent analysis. Plasma (0. 2 ml.) was well mixed with 4 ml. reagent-grade acetonet (Fisher Scientific Company) and centrifuged at 1500 g for 3 mm.; 3 ml. of the supernatant was transferred to a 10 X 75 glass tube (disposable) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes and}} origin of foams in lakes have been rarely object of studies, {{although}} this phenomenon may cause problems to touristic or fisheries activities and imply a possible risk to human health. The formation of foams in the aquatic environment {{is due to}} the accumulation of surfaceactive compounds (surfactants) at the air-water interface joined with the mechanic action of a forcing (such as wind or waves) able to inject gas bubbles in the upper water layer. Surfactants can be either of natural or synthetic origin. Fulvic or humic acids, lipidic, proteic or colloidal substances are examples of natural surfactants that can promote foam formation, while man-made foams are generally due to the release of phosphates from agriculture and/or to the presence of organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>detergents.</b> A comprehensive analysis of three foam episodes in Lake Maggiore (2007, 2008 and 2010) has been undertaken to identify their origin, causes and to unravel most likely factors triggering foam formation. At this scope, a long term (2000 - 2013) analysis of phytoplankton biovolumes and meteorological and hydrological anomalies has been performed together with the chemical characterization of foams. Foam resulted of endogenous origin, related to phytoplankton biomass degradation. The long term analysis highlighted atypical warm temperatures and residual lake stratification in winter in two of the years of foam events, coupled with exceptional Bacillariophyceae blooms in spring. Tabellaria flocculosa mostly contributed in terms of biomass in 2007 and 2008, but not in 2010, and overall total algal biomass seemed a better predictor of the risk of foam formation. Foam events occurred from July to December, driven by atypically high windy conditions, and congruently with the time needed to degrade biomass into surfactant compounds. A co-occurrence of different factors resulted essential to generate foams, and climate changes likely contributed to enhance their occurrence in Lake Maggiore...|$|R
40|$|A flow {{injection}} photometric {{system was}} developed for the determination of orthophosphate and total <b>inorganic</b> phosphates in <b>detergents.</b> While orthophosphate was directly determined {{in the presence of}} other phosphates by utilizing the kinetic discrimination of flow injection analysis, total inorganic phosphates was analyzed after on-line hydrolysis of polyphosphates in 2. 5 mol l(- 1) sulfuric acid for 50 s under 145 degrees C. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to mask the interference of non-ionic surfactants. The detection limits and the sampling rates were 2. 5 mg l(- 1) P 2 O 5 and 40 h(- 1) for total inorganic phosphates, and 1. 0 mg l(- 1) P 2 O 5 and 80 h(- 1) for orthophosphate determination. The proposed method was applied to analyze orthophosphate and total inorganic phosphates in washing powders. The experimental results are in good agreement with those obtained by the Chinese national standard methods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Increase {{in demand}} for milk and their {{products}} many dairies of different sizes have come up in different places. The dairy industry involves processing raw milk into products such as consumer milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, condensed milk, dried milk (milk powder), and ice cream, using processes such as chilling, pasteurization, and homogenization. The typical by-products of milk are buttermilk, whey, and their derivatives. The effluents are generated from milk processing through milk spillage, drippings, washing of cans, tankers bottles, utensil, and equipment’s and floors. The dairy industry generate on an average 2. 5 - 3. 0 litres of wastewater per litre of milk processed. Generally this wastewater contains large quantities of fat, casein, lactose, and <b>inorganic</b> salts, besides <b>detergents,</b> sanitizers etc. used for washing. These all contribute largely towards their high biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and oil and grease {{much higher than the}} permissible limits. Among the biological treatments trickling filter and activated sludge process involve more economy high power requirement, more chemical consumption and large area requirement. Use of a dairy wastewater for irrigation after primary treatment in an aerated lagoon may also be good for the disposal of dairy wastes...|$|R
