Noble's recorded shows are mostly dominated by Noble with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> of audience participation.

And he would find his house in possession of--of--those devils! No! No! she must not die yet, at least not until she had warned the Fort. She seized the oars again with frenzied strength; the boat had stopped under the unwonted strain, staggered, tried to rise in an uplifted sea, took part of it over her bow, struck down Mrs. Bunker under half a ton of blue water that wrested the oars from her paralyzed hands like playthings, swept them over the gunwale, and left her lying senseless {{in the bottom of the}} boat.|$|E

40|$|Today the methodologies of the {{contemporary}} ethnographer and the photodocumentist run parallel. Neither seek only to explain or describe the phenomenon under investigation, rather they seek to understand that phenomenon though empathy and compassion. 'Picturing Human Rights" coincided with the 60 th anniversary of the United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights. In doing so it sought to present a snap shot of the lived experience of human practice across the minority and majority world. The understanding developed and discoveries made from this publication revolve around the notions of inequality, injustice and betrayal and that {{the rhetoric of the}} declaration remains largely unachieved. But rather than simply state these notions, this publication seeks to allow the viewer to project into and live the lives of those rendered voiceless through these poverty and being disenfranchised for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moment.</b> The new knowledge lies in this lived experience. In doing so, this edition of the APJ presents journalism and documentary practice not only as legitimate modes of social inquiry but modes of storytelling that allow an audience to know through empathy and compassion. That is, rigorous documentary practice (combination of investigative journalism, ethnography and aesthetic) conflates the distance between the viewer and the viewed allowing the former to become stakeholders in the lives of those whose stories are told. In doing so, pity is replaced with compassion through a form of sharing sharing lived experiences. Arts, Education & Law Group, Queensland College of ArtNo Full Tex...|$|R

6000|$|May 1, '81.--Seems {{as if all}} {{the ways}} and means of American travel to-day had been settled, not only with {{reference}} to speed and directness, but for the comfort of women, children, invalids, and old fellows like me. I went on by a through train that runs daily from Washington to the Yankee metropolis without change. You get in a sleeping-car soon after dark in Philadelphia, and after ruminating an hour or two, have your bed made up if you like, draw the curtains, and go to sleep in it--fly on through Jersey to New York--hear in your half-slumbers a dull jolting and bumping sound or two--are unconsciously toted from Jersey City by a midnight steamer around the Battery and under the big bridge to the track of the New Haven road--resume your flight eastward, and early the next morning you wake up in Boston. All of which was my experience. I {{wanted to go to the}} Revere house. A tall unknown gentleman, (a fellow-passenger on his way to Newport he told me, I had <b>just</b> chatted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> before with him,) assisted me out through the depot crowd, procured a hack, put me in it with my traveling bag, saying smilingly and quietly, [...] "Now I want you to let this be my ride," [...] paid the driver, and before I could remonstrate bow'd himself off.|$|R
40|$|At {{first hour}} at the morning or to join your friends after a meal, {{there is no doubt}} that {{drinking}} a coffee is quite a pleasure. Now the market offers several opportunities that allow the people to meet in someplace and drink a delicious coffee. The difference in this coffee shop is that this service is only by drive-thru, so it is a quite different story. For many people this is a solution to save some time in order to be able to have a nice breakfast or a nutrition dinner. You can just stop by “Mi Tacita” and buy whatever you might need. It has always been, and will always be, about quality. We’re passionate about ethically sourcing the finest coffee beans, roasting them with great care, and improving the lives of people who grow them. We care deeply about all of this; our work is never done. We’re called partners, because it’s not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> job, it’s our passion. Together, we embrace diversity to create a place where each of us can be ourselves. We always treat each other with respect and dignity. And we hold each other to that standard. When we are fully engaged, we connect with, laugh with, and uplift the lives of our customers— even if <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Sure, it starts with the promise of a perfectly made beverage, but our work goes far beyond that. It’s really about human connection...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of cinema in Peru {{tells a story}} that reflects the precarious {{nature of the relationship}} between government and cultural producers. Throughout its first century, Peruvian cinema enjoyed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> brief <b>moments</b> of apparently emerging stability, dashed each time by legislative action and/or socio-political unrest. In the 1990 s, an increasingly neo-liberal economic climate and restrictions resulting from the remnants of harsh political violence of the 1980 s gave rise to even more challenging circumstances for filmmakers in Peru. Indeed, John King’s observation that ‘local production remained intermittent’ (2000 : 281) during that time was something of an understatement. None of this was helped by the abrupt repealing in the early 1990 s of a cinema law established in 1972 that included incentives, quotas and subsidies designed to develop an infrastructure for national cinema production. This chapter explores the impact of these legislative actions on film in Peru, with a focus on the period between 1992 and 2016 when the situation for filmmakers has been particularly challenging and with <b>a</b> new government <b>just</b> elected bringing fresh uncertainty. It reflects on the various responses to the changes in state support, in particular on the attempts by producers to patch together mosaics of funding sources that rely less and less on the state. It asks whether we should still perceive of film-making in Peru as a situation of ‘crisis’ given the relative boom in production and exhibition of home-grown cinema in recent years, and what form that crisis now takes...|$|R
