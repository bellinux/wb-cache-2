Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A computer model was developed to simulate the transient operation of a hypothetical endothermic <b>fuel</b> <b>cooling</b> system. The model simulated the performance of a cross-flow, shell and tube heat exchanger. This model was applied to a representative high Mach number vehicle mission for which heat load and fuel rate profiles were known. The effects of various design and operating variables on the heat sink capacity, fuel composition, and fuel temperatures throughout the mission were determined using the model. Results for representative operating conditions showed that, for transient operation, the heat sink, fuel temperature, and conversion fraction will be much lower than the thermodynamic analysis predicts. Heat sink capacity may not be adequate in regions of high heat loads and low fuel flow rates.

40|$|The goal of <b>cooling</b> <b>installation</b> {{design is}} to provide {{adequate}} cooling air flow to the engine with a minimum drag penalty. To achieve this goal, attention {{must be given to}} certain aerodynamic factors involved in the design problem. In the present paper, the factors which influence the aerodynamic design of horizontally-opposed engine <b>cooling</b> <b>installations</b> are discussed with particular reference to the performance of the aircraft in terms of the dynamic pressure generated for the power output of the engine, the gains or losses through the propeller, proper inlet design, altitude effects on the orifice characteristics of the engine, and exit area sizing. Results of a flight research program showed that the inlet design has a significant influence on cooling effectiveness and drag; the inlet should be designed for low velocity ratios and should avoid small radii of curvature in its geometry. The influence of the propeller on the inlet appears to cause the stagnation point on the lip to move toward the inside...|$|R

40|$|Two {{case studies}} {{completed}} {{under the direction}} of Jacobs Engineering are presented and discussed. In the first case study, the economics of the installation of an oil cooler are examined. A vapor recovery unit (VRU) for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facility in Grieve, WY, will be installed to capture the vapors from an oil tank. With the installation of the VRU, a question arose: would an oil cooler proposed to be installed before the oil tank be necessary? A simulation and economic analysis of the process suggests that oil <b>cooler</b> <b>installation</b> is still economically favorable. When the low pressure (LP) separator is operated at the typical temperature of 140 °F, nine additional barrels of oil per day (BOPD) are recovered through the use of an oil cooler. The net present worth (NPW) of oil <b>cooler</b> <b>installation</b> is calculated to be 248, 000. In the second case study, an overfill protection line was proposed to be installed for a gas flotation unit on an offshore oil rig. It was postulated {{that there might be a}} risk of hydrocarbon diffusion through the stagnant liquid in the line, presenting a hazard to equipment and personnel. Calculations were performed to approximate the rate of gas flux through the line. As the physical situation is difficult to model without precise information, alternative preventative methods are presented. ...|$|R
