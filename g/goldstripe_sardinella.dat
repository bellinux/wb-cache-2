50|$|Sardinella jussieu (Mauritian {{sardinella}} or <b>goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella)</b> is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the genus Sardinella.|$|E
50|$|The <b>goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella,</b> Sardinella gibbosa, is {{a species}} of fish of the family Clupeidae. It is native to shallow {{tropical}} waters of the western Indo-Pacific, living at depths down to 70 m, and being associated with coral reefs. It grows up to 17 cm in length and forms large schools.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} found as an {{external}} parasite on the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), a shark in the genus Squalus, the common skate (Raja batis), the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) and the barndoor skate (Dipturus laevis). Large numbers have also {{been found in the}} stomach of a Greenland shark, though whether living as a parasite or as a commensal is unclear. It was also found {{for the first time on}} the <b>goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella gibbosa) off the coast of Egypt in 2007.|$|E
40|$|Indonesian waters have {{abundance}} of natural resources; {{the potential of}} small pelagic fish in Natuna Sea and South China Sea have not been optimized yet explores. Unfortunately, it was caused by lacking in the data of environmental conditions that have been changed and the information of appropriate fishing ground. Hence, dynamical oceanographic information and weather condition is necessary to optimize small pelagic fish exploitation. Research location in Natuna Sea and its surrounding with geographical position is 08 °N– 03 °S; 103 °– 111 °E. The oceanographic condition representative by monthly SST, Chl-a, SSH that derived from satellite data and Dipole Mode Index for 2002 - 2007 from FRCGC website. Monthly wind data is variable for weather condition. Small pelagic fish abundance representative by annual fish production (2002 - 2005) and monthly Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) of <b>Goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella,</b> Bigeye scad and Indian scad (2006). It was data collected from Directorate General of Capture Fisheries (Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries) and daily fishing operation (2007) used to calculate match-up ratio that was collected from Pemangkat fishing port in West Kalimantan. Research process consists of image processing, descriptive correlation analysis and GIS analysis to predict fishing ground map and match-up ratio calculation. Result {{of this research is}} the annual fish catch production of Bigeye scad and Indian scad (2002 - 2005) is tend to increase and the monthly CPUE of both species is high during SE Monsoon (May-Sep) that is condition contrarily in NW Monsoon (Nov-Apr). Meanwhile, the annual fish catch production of <b>Goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella</b> production is tend to decrease from 2002 - 2005, it has CPUE is high in early SE Monsoon (May). During the SE Monsoon (May-Sep) when DM Index is positive (+) the Indian scad and Bigeye scad production is high, for <b>Goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella</b> the fish production is high when DM Index is positive (+) in May. The accuracy of prediction map of small pelagic fishing ground in Natuna Sea is about 0. 61, 0. 76 and 0. 81 for <b>Goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella,</b> Indian scad and Bigeye scad, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Effect of Exploitation Rate on Reproductive Performance in <b>Goldstripe</b> <b>Sardinella</b> (Sardinellagibbosa) in West Java Coastal Waters. The {{research}} {{objective was to}} explore the effect ofexploitation rate on reproductive performance of <b>goldstripe</b> <b>sardinella</b> (Sardinella gibbosa). Three sites located in West Java coasts were selected representing coastal areas adjacent tothe Indian Ocean (Palabuhan Ratu), Java Sea (Blanakan), and Sunda Strait (Labuan), for fishcollection during May-July 2009. Fish samples were collected and the length was measuredprior to sex determination, observation on gonad morphology as well as gonad maturitydetermination, examination on fecundity and eggs diameter, and protein content analysis. Estimation on exploitation rate (E) was calculated based on length data performance fromwhich the result was correlated with reproductive parameters including the length at firstmaturity, fecundity, eggs distribution and diameter, and protein content analysis. By sitesbasis, variation in E was consistently shown only by eggs protein content in which the lowerthe E estimation the higher the protein contents. However, in response to E, there wereinconsistencies shown by the length at first maturity, fecundity, and eggs diameter. Suchinconsistencies {{are thought to be}} associated with population structure of matured female, andvariability in the habitat conditions which determines the magnitude of fish stock...|$|E
40|$|The Indian oil Sardine, Sardinella longiceps and <b>Goldstripe</b> <b>Sardinella,</b> Sardinella gibbosa {{are the two}} commercially important, small pelagic fishes from Indian waters {{belonging}} to the family Clupeidae. Characterization of the complete mitogenome is very helpful in resolving taxonomic ambiguities and hence we characterized the complete mitogenome of S. longiceps and S. gibbosa from Indian waters. The assembled mitogenomes of S. longiceps and S. gibbosa are 16, 613 and 16658 bp circles respectively, contained the 37 mitochondrial structural genes (2 rRNA, 22 tRNA, 13 protein-coding genes) with the gene order identical to that of typical vertebrates. In the phylogenetic tree, S. longiceps and S. gibbosa clustered with species {{belonging to}} the family Clupeidae. This study is the first report of the complete mitogenome of two commercially important clupeids from Indian waters which form the baseline for further studies on molecular systematics, population genetics, historic demography, adaptive variation and conservation of these species...|$|E
