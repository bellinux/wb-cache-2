40|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} are {{mediated by the}} structural complexity of habitats, but disentangling the many facets of structure that contribute to this mediation remains elusive. In a world replete with altered landscapes and biological invasions, determining how structure mediates the interactions between predators and novel prey will contribute {{to our understanding of}} invasions and predator-prey dynamics in general. Here, using simplified experimental arenas, we manipulate predator-free space, whilst <b>holding</b> <b>surface</b> area and volume constant, to quantify the effects on predator-prey interactions between two resident gammarid predators and an invasive prey, the Ponto-Caspian corophiid Chelicorophium curvispinum. Systematically increasing predator-free space alters the functional responses (the relationship between prey density and consumption rate) of the amphipod predators by reducing attack rates and lengthening handling times. Crucially, functional response shape also changes subtly from destabilizing Type II towards stabilizing Type III, such that small increases in predator-free space to result in significant reductions in prey consumption at low prey densities. Habitats with superficially similar structural complexity can have considerably divergent consequences for prey population stability in general and, particularly, for invasive prey establishing at low densities in novel habitats. © 2014 The Authors...|$|E

Each former has a negative or positive shape corresponding to a fiber preform section (10) to be produced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Textile {{reinforcing fiber}} structures (6) are laid on formers (1) and held in position using a binder. Each former has a negative or positive shape corresponding to a fiber preform section (10) to be produced. Preform sections are removed from their respective former, assembled and compacted to form a preform of the final product shape. A composite molded product is then created by impregnating the preform with a resin matrix. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is made for the process equipment which includes a rotating former with a cylindrical or ring shaped <b>holding</b> <b>surface</b> (4) for forming the initial textile structure. USE - For manufacturing a fiber reinforced plastic component with a hoop shape, in particular an aircraft window frame. ADVANTAGE - Preforms are created directly on a former with the final product shape, thus eliminating any intermediate formers and the consequent risk of damage to, or accidental realignment of the fiber arrangement...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a system of}} machine vision and {{singulation}} was developed to separate paddy from rice and determine paddy husking and rice breakage percentages. The machine vision system consists of three main components including an imaging chamber, a digital camera, a computer equipped with image processing software. The singulation device consists of a kernel <b>holding</b> <b>surface,</b> a motor with vacuum fan, and a dimmer. For separation of paddy from rice (in the image), {{it was necessary to}} set a threshold. Therefore, some images of paddy and rice were sampled and the RGB values of the images were extracted using MATLAB software. Then mean and standard deviation of the data were determined. An Image processing algorithm was developed using MATLAB to determine paddy/rice separation and rice breakage and paddy husking percentages, using blue to red ratio. Tests showed that, a threshold of 0. 75 is suitable for separating paddy from rice kernels. Results from the evaluation of the image processing algorithm showed that the accuracies obtained with the algorithm were 98. 36 % and 91. 81 % for paddy husking and rice breakage percentage, respectively. Analysis also showed that a suction of 45 mmHg to 50 mmHg yielding 81. 3 % separation efficiency is appropriate for operation of the kernel singulation system...|$|E
40|$|The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite’s L-band (1. 4 GHz) {{measurements}} {{have been}} used to retrieve snow thickness over thick sea ice in a previous study. Here we consider brightness temperature simulations for 2. 5 – 4. 5 m thick Arctic multi-year ice and compare the results of the relatively simple emission model (M 2013) used previously for the retrieval with simulations from a more complex model (T 2011) that combines a sea-ice version of the Microwave Emission Model for Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) with a thermodynamic model. We find that L-band brightness temperature is mainly determined by ice temperature. In the M 2013 model, ice temperature in turn is mainly determined by surface temperature and snow thickness, and this dependence has been used previously to explain the potential for a snow thickness retrieval. Our comparisons suggest that the M 2013 retrieval model may benefit from a more sophisticated thermodynamic calculation of the ice temperature or from using independent temperature data (e. g. from 6 GHz channels). In both models, horizontally polarized brightness temperatures increase with snow thickness while <b>holding</b> <b>surface</b> temperature, ice thickness and snow density near constant. The increase in the T 2011 model is steeper than in M 2013, suggesting a higher sensitivity to snow thickness than found earlier...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the grip {{difficulty}} of a curved climbing hold, an experimental hold was designed and instrumented with two force transducers. The hold&# 039;s surface was restricted to steeper gradients by adding wooden panels to the wall. The more the centre of pressure on a curved <b>hold</b> <b>surface</b> moves off the wall, the steeper the surface gradient becomes and {{the more difficult it}} is to grip the <b>hold.</b> As the <b>surface</b> gradient steepens, the coefficient of friction increases, whereas contact time and forces decrease. At flatter gradients, the hand exerts a pulling force to the hold whereas at steeper gradients, the hand pushes against the hold. The latter action is only possible if the body moves dynamically in horizontal direction, by accelerating backwards. The transition from pulling to pushing occurs in the more experienced climber at a centre of pressure position of approximately 0. 045 mm off the wall (34 °slope), and in the less experienced climber earlier at approximately 30 mm off the wall (22 °slope) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} small, shallow seasonally, or interannually, {{waterlogged}} depressions (dambos) {{in the upper}} Zambezi Valley in western Zambia hold shallow peat deposits and are bounded on their western margin by sandy lunette dunes. Using luminescence dating of sands, fossil pollen analyses and the macrocharcoal record from cored peat, the long-term stability of these landforms and the vegetation they now support is investigated at a site east of the upper Zambezi. Although the upper lunette dune sediments accumulated between 14 Â± 2 and 6 Â± 1 ka, the onset of peat accumulation and preservation within the dambo did not occur until 2800 cal a BP, suggesting that only from this point onwards were conditions stable and wet enough year-round to allow the formation and preservation of peat during this time. Results from {{this study indicate that}} the long-term behaviour of the dambo conforms to a cut-and-fill dynamic, where under more arid conditions the dambo becomes a dry pan, providing a sediment source for the adjacent lunette dune.
