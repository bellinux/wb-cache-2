50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow <b>induced</b> <b>pressure,</b> which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E

A novel way of determining the static pressures at the inlet and outlet of microchannels is also presented that takes account of the pressure losses due to flow contraction and expansion.

40|$|Beam <b>induced</b> <b>pressure</b> rise was an {{intensity}} limit at CERN ISR {{during the early}} 1970 's. The beam gas ionization created pressure rise caused more gas ionization, resulting in pressure run-away at high beam intensity. Extensive baking, chamber treatment, and perhaps more importantly, a lot of added pumps helped raise the intensity threshold. Due to the large charge exchange cross sections low energy heavy ion machines such as the AGS Booster, CERN LEAR, and GSI SIS require very high vacuum to obtain good beam lifetime. Nevertheless, the beam loss/gas ionization created pressure rise increases with beam intensity, limiting the maximum attainable intensity. Pressure rise can also be created by electron stimulated desorption if an electron cloud has been formed by the beam. For most machines, electron cloud induced beam instability and/or beam emittance growth limit the beam intensity before pressure rise does. A special case is the RHIC, where electron clouds occur only in part of the warm sections (the total warm section is less than 1 / 4 of the ring). The beam intensity can be increased without inducing beam instability and emittance growth until the pressure rise impacts operation. The beam <b>induced</b> <b>pressure</b> rise is of concern, therefore, for several machines in operation. These include the AGS Booster, the GSI SIS, and the RHIC heavy ion and proton operations.
