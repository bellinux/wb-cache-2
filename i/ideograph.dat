25|$|Variation Selectors is a Unicode block {{containing}} 16 Variation Selector format characters. They {{are used}} to specify a specific glyph variant for a Unicode character, such as the Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Taiwanese form of a particular CJK <b>ideograph.</b>|$|E
25|$|So {{rather than}} treat {{the issue as}} a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but {{also in terms of}} underlying meaning {{as in the case of}} a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han <b>ideograph.</b> Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese users seem to {{have fewer}} {{objections}} to Han unification, largely because Unicode {{did not attempt to}} unify Simplified Chinese characters with Traditional Chinese characters. (Simplified Chinese characters are an invention of the People's Republic of China and they are used among Chinese speakers in the PRC, Singapore, and Malaysia. Traditional Chinese characters are used in Hong Kong and Taiwan (Big5) and they are, with some differences, more familiar to Korean and Japanese users.) Unicode is seen as neutral with regards to this politically charged issue, and has encoded Simplified and Traditional Chinese glyphs separately (e.g. the <b>ideograph</b> for [...] "discard" [...] is 丟 U+4E1F for Traditional Chinese Big5 #A5E1 and 丢 U+4E22 for Simplified Chinese GB #2210). It is also noted that Traditional and Simplified characters should be encoded separately according to Unicode Han Unification rules, because they are distinguished in pre-existing PRC character sets. Furthermore, as with other variants, Traditional to Simplified characters is not a one-to-one relationship.|$|E

In the meeting, the members reviewed the document IRGN 999 first, and then discussed the working procedure. The followings are the conclusion: 1. There was a very closed relationship between old Hanzi and modern <b>ideographs.</b> Basically, old Hanzi were the ancient types of modern <b>ideographs.</b> But there were some differences between them. The basic handing units of old Hanzi were lines and that of modern <b>ideographs</b> were strokes. Modern <b>ideographs</b> somehow were symbols without pictographic(象形特征) which appeared in old Hanzi. In addition, there were not one-one corresponding relationships between old Hanzi and modern <b>ideographs.</b> Based on the reasons above, old Hanzi are independent scripts which should be encoded separately from CJK <b>Ideographs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Japanese {{government}} has been working for years on comprehensive reformation of public administration, utilizing information technologies. It is recognized {{that one of the}} barriers is so-called gaiji issue. In some areas in government operations, there are some needs on handling huge amount of rare <b>ideographs,</b> which are primarily parts of proper nouns such as human names or place names. Those <b>ideographs</b> not encoded in the coded character set standard are called gaiji. Many gaiji are more or less variants of other <b>ideographs.</b> Recently, a government funded group was formed and worked on the gaiji issue. Japan national body has a channel with the group. The group researched three major administration systems and is compiling gaiji collected from those systems. The systems the group got input from are: jumin kihon daicho (住 民 基 本 台 帳) network, koseki (戸 籍) system, and new toki (登 記) system. They are all some sort of low-mandated government-operated registries. Based on their preliminary reports, Japan national body submitted several <b>ideographs</b> to IRG, and we will some more in a future. However, there are another set of gaiji, that is, a set of <b>ideographs</b> that are glyph variants of already encoded unified <b>ideographs,</b> although the government's operating rules mandate distinction. Japan national body hereby proposes encoding of those <b>ideographs</b> as compatibility <b>ideographs</b> in ISO/IEC 10646.
