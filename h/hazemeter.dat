Although {{there has been some}} degree of success using this measurement method for films it has proven unreliable due to variability caused by changes in the film thickness (internal refraction variations) and the background colour on which the film sample is placed.

The attenuation of ultraviolet radiation by air near {{the ground was}} measured {{as a function of}} wavelength under a wide variety of meteorological conditions. These measurements were made over the tops of buildings at the California Institute of Technology on 125 nights between March 1949 and March 1950. Attenuation coefficients in km[ [...] . ] have been plotted against wavelengths in Angstroms for 78 representative nights. The primary data were obtained from four independent experiments, two which yielded coefficients as a continuous function of wavelength from 2300 A to 4600 A, and two which monitored coefficients at 2537 A and at 5500 A. The first method employed photographic spectrophotometry to compare the light transmitted through two paths differing in length by 680 meters. The second method was similar but utilized other apparatus and a path difference of 340 meters. The third method involved mercury lamps and cadmium photocells, and the fourth method consisted of visual observations with a Loofah <b>hazemeter.</b> Except for the Herzberg 02 bands in the neighborhood of 2500 A, the attenuation coefficient was found to vary smoothly (though differently) with wavelength on all nights analyzed, including many when smog was present in noticeable concentrations. Attenuation data for unpolluted air were successfully fitted by a simple empirical formula involving wavelength and visibility range as parameters...|$|E

40|$|The Highveld {{region of}} South Africa {{contributes}} substantially to the aerosol loading over southern Africa {{because of its}} importance as an industrial, mining and farming base. Aerosols affect climate by absorbing or reflecting incoming solar radiation, and by affecting cloud microphysics, cloud albedo and precipitation. The physical and optical properties of industrial/urban aerosols over the Highveld region of South Africa were analysed during a 32 -day winter sampling period (21 May to 21 June) in 2002; a 32 -day summer sampling period (21 October to 21 November) in 2002, and a second 32 -day winter sampling period (19 May to 19 June) in 2003. Synoptic circulation systems were examined in {{as far as they}} affect the horizontal transport of aerosols over the Highveld region. Measurements of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from the ground {{to the top of the}} atmosphere and aerosol size distribution characteristics over the Highveld region were taken using hand-held <b>hazemeters</b> and a CIMEL sun photometer. The AOT observed over the region during the winter 2002 and 2003 sampling periods and during the summer 2002 sampling period indicated high turbidity. In the 2002 winter sampling period, the AOT 530 nm ranged between 0. 05 to 0. 7 with an average of 0. 14. In the 2002 summer sampling period, the AOT 530 nm ranged between 0. 05 to 0. 6, with an average of 0. 24. In the 2003 winter sampling period, the AOT 500 nm ranged between 0. 06 to 0. 6, with an average of 0. 21. The Ångström exponent value had a wide range, 0. 8 to 2. 4 in the 2002 winter and summer sampling periods and also in the 2003 winter sampling period, indicating that a range of particle sizes was present over the Highveld region. The Ångström exponent values obtained were derived from the influences of Aeolian dust, coarse-mode industrial particles and, to a small extent, fine-mode biomassburning aerosols. Case studies, based on trajectory analysis and meteorology of the sampling area, were made of the aerosols emanating from the township sites during each of the three sampling periods to observe the build-up and dispersion of aerosols at that time...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} variations in background aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol type are investigated over various ecosystems in China based upon three years' worth of meteorological data and {{data collected by}} the Chinese Sun <b>Hazemeter</b> Network. In most parts of China, AODs are at a maximum in spring or summer and at a minimum in autumn or winter. Minimum values (0. 10 ~ 0. 20) of annual mean AOD at 500 nm {{are found in the}} Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which is located in the remote northeast corner of China, the northern forest ecosystems and Hainan Island. Annual mean AOD ranges from 0. 25 to 0. 30 over desert and oasis areas as well as the desertification grasslands in northern China; the annual mean AOD over the Loess Plateau is moderately high at 0. 36. Regions where the highest density of agricultural and industrial activities are located and where anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and soil aerosol emissions are consistently high throughout the whole year (e. g. the central-eastern, southern and eastern coastal regions of China) experience annual mean AODs ranging from 0. 50 ~ 0. 80. Remarkable seasonal changes in the main types of aerosol over northern China (characterized by the Angstrom exponent, α) are seen. Due to biomass and fossil fuel burning from extensive agricultural practices in northern rural areas, concentrations of smoke and soot aerosols rise dramatically during autumn and winter (high α), while the main types of aerosol during spring and summer are dust and soil aerosols (low α). Over southeast Asia, biomass burning during the spring leads to increases in smoke and soot emissions. Over the Tibetan Plateau and Hainan Island where the atmosphere is pristine, the main types of aerosol are dust and sea salt, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols affect climate by scattering/absorbing {{radiation}} and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or ice nuclei (IN). One {{of the least}} understood but most significant aspects of climate change is the aerosol effect on cloud and precipitation. A hypothesis has recently been proposed that, {{in addition to reducing}} cloud effective radius and suppressing precipitation, aerosols may also modify the thermodynamic structure of deep convective clouds and lead to enhanced precipitation when complex thermodynamic processes are involved. Taking advantage of the long-term and extensive ground-based observations at the US Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, we thoroughly tested such a hypothesis and provide direct evidence of it. Moreover, the hypothesis is also supported by analysis of satellite-based observations over tropical regions from multiple sensors in the A-Train satellites constellation. Extensive analyses of the long-term ground-based and large-scale data reveal significant increases in rain rate or frequency and cloud top heights with increasing aerosol loading for mix-phase deep convective clouds, decreases rain frequency for low liquid clouds, but little impact on cloud height for liquid clouds. Rigorous tests are conducted to investigate any potential artifacts and influences of meteorological conditions. Large-scale circulation patterns and monsoon systems can be changed by scattering and absorption of solar radiation by aerosols. By means of model simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model (NCAR/CCM 3), we found that the increase of aerosol loading in China contributes to circulation changes, leading to more frequent occurrence of fog events in winter as observed from meteorological records. The increase in atmospheric aerosols over China heats the atmosphere and generates a cyclonic circulation anomaly over eastern-central China. This circulation anomaly leads to a reduction in the influx of dry and cold air over that area during winter. Weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon system may also contribute to these changes. All these changes favor the formation and maintenance of fog over this region. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products used in the above studies are validated using ground-based measurements from the Chinese Sun <b>Hazemeter</b> Network (CSHNET). Overall, substantial improvement was found in the current version of aerosol products relative to the previous one. At individual sites, the improvement varies with surface and atmospheric conditions...|$|E
