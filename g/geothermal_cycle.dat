Some of the components contained in the NCG, however, such as H 2 S, H 2 and CH 4, have an acceptable lower heating value (LHV) and can be considered a source of energy.

40|$|The Cornia 2 hybrid geothermal/biomass {{power plant}} of Enel Green Power {{represents}} an innovative technology integrating renewable and geothermal energy. The plant {{is located in}} the Larderello geothermal area in Tuscany and uses biomass to superheat the geothermal steam entering the power station from a temperature of 150 - 160 to 370 - 380 Celsius degrees, thus increasing the efficiency of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>cycle</b> and the net electric power output from 12 to 16 MW.  The super-heater boiler is based on reciprocating grate technology and is fed with two kinds of biomass: local virgin biomass wood-chips and low-quality agricultural residues. A numerical model of the biomass combustion on the moving grate is developed through the coupling of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM). In particular the eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) [1] is employed to describe the granular behaviour of the two kinds of biomass particles. The peculiar feature of XDEM is that it encompasses chemical and thermodynamic particle properties (temperature profile, species distribution, porosity, diffusivity, etc.) in addition to kinematic (position, velocity and orientation) ones, thus allowing taking into account evaporation, pyrolysis and char oxidation. The CFD model is handled with OpenFOAM®-Extend and solves mass, momentum, species transport end energy equations in the gaseous phase. Hence, the CFD solution provides boundary conditions to the particles within the XDEM treatment whereas particles constitute sources/sinks of mass, momentum, chemical species and energy in the gas phase CFD equations. The results highlight the unsteady behaviour of the biomass combustion on the grate, showing the presence of gas streaks coming out from the bed. The approach is very useful as it provides a full characterisation of both gaseous and particle phases without the need of any a priori hypothesis on the biomass conversion. Hence it may be used to estimate the amount of unburnt biomass and thus to plan strategies to optimize biomass combustion, thus further increasing the net efficiency of the plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{change in}} climate as a {{consequence}} of anthropogenic activities is a subject ofmajor concerns. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} greenhouse gas emissions inthe atmosphere, the utilization of renewable, fossil-free power generationapplications becomes inevitable. Geothermal and solar energy play a major rolein covering the increased demand for renewable energy sources of today’s andfuture’s society. A special focus hereby lies on the Concentrating Solar Powertechnologies and different geothermal concepts. The costs for producingelectricity through Concentrating Solar Power and therefore Parabolic Trough Collectorsas well as geothermal conversion technologies are still comparatively high. Inorder to minimize these expenses and maximize the cycle’s efficiency, thepossible synergies of a hybridization of these two technologies becomeapparent. This thesis therefore investigates the thermodynamic and economicbenefits and drawbacks of this combination from a global perspective. For that,a Parabolic Trough Collector system is combined with the geothermal conversionconcepts of Direct Steam, Single and Double Flash, Organic Rankine as well asKalina Cycles. The solar integrations under investigation are Superheat,Preheat and Superheat & Reheat of the geothermal fluid. The thermodynamicanalysis focuses on the thermal and utilization efficiencies, as well as therequired Parabolic Trough Collector area. The results indicate that in the caseof the Superheat and Superheat & Reheat setup, the thermal efficiency canbe improved for all geothermal concepts in comparison to their correspondinggeothermal stand-alone case. The Preheat cases, with the major contributionfrom solar energy, are not able to improve the cycle’s thermal efficiencyrelative to the reference setup. From an exergy perspective the findings varysignificantly depending on the applied boundary conditions. Still, almost allcases were able to improve the cycle’s performance compared to the referencecase. For the economic evaluation, the capital investment costs and thelevelized costs of electricity are studied. The capital costs increasesignificantly when adding solar energy to the <b>geothermal</b> <b>cycle.</b> The levelizedelectricity costs could not be lowered for any hybridization case compared tothe reference only-geothermal configurations. The prices vary between 20. 04  €/MWh and 373. 42  €/MWh. When conducting a sensitivity analysison the solar system price and the annual mean irradiance, the Kalina Superheatand Superheat & Reheat, as well as the Organic Rankine Preheathybridizations become cost competitive relative to the reference cases. Concluding, it is important to remark, that even if the hybridization of the ParabolicTrough and the different geothermal concepts makes sense from a thermodynamicperspective, the decisive levelized costs of electricity could not be improved. It is, however, possible that these costs can be further reduced under speciallocal conditions, making the addition of Parabolic Trough solar heat tospecific geothermal concepts favorable...|$|E

Integrating the geothermal resources into a conventional fuel fired Rankine cycle power plant, through the so called “geothermal aided power generation” (GAPG) concept. In so called GAPG technology, geothermal fluid is used to replace parts of extraction steam in regenerative Rankine cycle power plant to preheat feedwater of power plant.

The results indicate that the GAPG technology has higher thermodynamic first law efficiency than the geothermal alone power plant and the efficiency of the GAPG technology is no longer limited by the temperature of geothermal fluid, but rather by the maximum temperature of the Rankine cycle power plant. It is also found that utilization of the existing infrastructure of conventional fossil fired power plants can demonstrate the economic advantages of the GAPG technology as the lower COE than the geothermal alone power plant. Chapter one of this thesis defines the concept, aims and scope of this study. Chapter two details the previous research in the field of this study. The functions and structure of modelling for GAPG technology are described in chapter three. Chapter four presents the operational method and the modelling validation. Two case studies are carried out by modelling, with the technical and economic performance of GAPG technology presented in chapters five and six. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of a new method for improving energetic and exergetic efficiencies of single flash cycle. The thermodynamic process of the new method consists of extracting a fraction of hot wellhead geothermal brine for the purpose of superheating saturated steam entering the turbine. Computer programming scripts were developed and optimized based on mathematical proposed models for the different components of the systems. The operating parameters such as separator temperature, geofluid wellhead enthalpy and geothermal source temperature are varied to investigate their effects on both net power output and turbine exhaust quality of the systems. Also, full exergy assessment was performed for the new design. The results of separator temperature optimization revealed that specific net power output of the new design can be boosted up to 8 % and turbine exhaust quality can be diminished up to 50 % as compared to common single flash cycle. In addition, for wells with higher discharge enthalpy, superheating process improve specific net power output even up to 10 %. Finally, it was observed that the overall system exergy efficiency was approximately raised 3 %.   Article History : Received January 5 th 2016; Received in revised form June 25 th 2016; Accepted July 3 rd 2016; Available online How to Cite This Article : Nazari, N. and Porkhial, S.

40|$|Geothermal {{power plants}} are {{designed}} for optimal utilization of geothermal resource. However, geothermal fields typically undergo significant changes in resource characteristics such as pressure, temperature and steam quality over their life span. With appropriate reservoir modelling {{it is possible to}} predict the future resource characteristics of a geothermal field to a reasonable degree of accuracy. We propose a new adaptive design approach that would allow geothermal power plants {{to take into account the}} change of resource characteristics that occur over a 30 - 40 years time horizon based on the results of reservoir modelling. Currently, it is difficult and expensive to modify or renovate an existing plant due to space constraints, piping arrangements, transportation of machinery etc. The adaptive design approach would allow cost effective modifications in operation and equipment to adjust to changes in resource characteristics in the future. A simple model for a typical combined <b>cycle</b> <b>geothermal</b> power plant is considered as a test case for the adaptive design approach. Simulation is carried out using changes in both wellhead specific enthalpy and mass flow rate. There are four case studies presented in this paper that analysed various possible options of the hypothetical power plant depending on the changes in resource characteristics. Taking into account the results of the simulation, alternative plant designs are presented and improvements in performance are discussed. Although, the initial investment cost might go up as a consequence of adaptive design, over the life span of the plant the total benefit may be greater...|$|R
