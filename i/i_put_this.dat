(Writer/editor) Ken Rolston left shortly thereafter for unrelated reasons. In Ken’s wake, developers Doug Kaufman and Paul Murphy in turn briefly supervised the PARANOIA line. After they too departed, editorial control fell to—how do <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> tactfully?—people with different views of the PARANOIA line.|$|E

In May 2010, Daley {{held a press conference}} to address gun control and a pending possible adverse decision in McDonald v. Chicago. After Mick Dumke, a reporter for the Chicago Reader, questioned the effectiveness of the city's handgun ban, Daley picked up a rifle with a bayonet from a display table of confiscated weapons and told him, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> up your butt, you'll find out how effective it is. Let me put a round up your, you know." [...] The remark was voted [...] "the stoopidest thing that Mayor Richard Daley the Younger has ever said" [...] in an online poll by the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|By September 2013, Sia was {{recording}} vocal tracks at {{her home}} studio {{with the hope of}} releasing a new album the following spring. Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal. The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> out {{to get out of my}} publishing deal. I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists. But my publishing deal was as an artist so I had to put one more album out. I didn't want to get famous so I kept all the songs I wanted and had a lot of fun making it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sigsworth {{created a}} demo backing track that was [...] "{{finished}} enough to impress, {{but not so}} finished as to restrict Madonna's freedom to write {{over the top of}} it." [...] According to him, [...] "'What It Feels Like For a Girl' was done very quickly. 'I sent her a backing track, and she wrote a top line to it, we put it together and four days later we had a record. And what was kind of good for me was that we decided on day one that we liked all the noises I'd already used on the demo, and it was more a matter of repositioning them in the arrangement around M's top line. So the whole job, apart from recording the voice, was moving things around in Pro Tools", he claimed. He remarked that he sent her two sketches and that she chose the more unusual one. [...] "And at the start of it, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> sample from a movie of the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. I just knew that M would fall in love with that, and she did", he declared.|$|E

[He stands {{silent for a moment}} and then cries, lifting his hand above his head.] Give me wine out of thy pitchers; oh, God, how splendid is my cup of drunkenness. We must become blind, and deaf, and dizzy. We must get rid of everything that is not measureless eternal life. We must put out hope as <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>this</b> candle. [Puts out a candle.] And memory as <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>this</b> candle. [As before.] And thought, the waster of Life, as <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>this</b> candle. [As before.] And at last we must put out the light of the Sun and of the Moon, and all the light of the World and the World itself. [He now puts out the last candle, the chapel is very dark. The only light is the faint light of morning coming through the window.] We must destroy the World; we must destroy everything that has Law and Number, for where there is nothing, there is God.|$|R

60|$|This was uttered {{with great}} animation, {{and in a}} way to show that my sister was very much in earnest.
