5|$|From the 19th century, deputies {{were hired}} in larger areas {{to assist the}} sheriffs. Following the <b>democratization</b> <b>in</b> 1814, the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had the primary {{responsibility}} for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large {{increase in the number}} of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E

This study contributes to the latest academic “neorealist-liberal debate” and constructivist theories, by emphasizing a crucial acknowledgement. With {{the exception of the}} case of the European Union, which boasts the only peaceful <b>democratization</b> process <b>in</b> the post-war era, in East and Southeast Asia there is strong evidence that the orthodoxy of democratization processes is going to take place. This means that in this vast area, democratization processes will be long-lasting social constructions mixed with strong ethnic consciousness, and therefore, not so peaceful but rather violent processes.   </p...|$|R

On the contrary, {{the danger is that}} U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis. Cole is also on the Editorial Board of Pakistaniaat.|$|E
25|$|Although legally {{allowed to}} leave, {{economic}} and social issues have kept many people in situations that are defined as slavery.

25|$|Dink {{was one of}} Turkey's most {{prominent}} Armenian voices and, despite threats on his life, he refused to remain silent. He always said his aim was to improve the difficult relationship between Turks and Armenians. Active in various democratic platforms and civil society organizations, Hrant Dink emphasized the need for <b>democratization</b> <b>in</b> Turkey {{and focused on the}} issues of free speech, minority rights, civic rights and issues pertaining to the Armenian community in Turkey. He was a very important peace activist. In his public speeches, which were often intensely emotional, he never refrained from using the word genocide when talking about the Armenian Genocide, a term fiercely rejected by Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{presented}} an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the United States and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on basic human rights and <b>democratization.</b> <b>In</b> the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty {{was not to be}} violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as third world governments.|$|E

However, only one historian, namely Zemskov, was admitted to these archives, and later the archives were again “closed”, according to Leonid Lopatnikov.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{promotion}} of free market economics also spurred new calls for <b>democratization</b> <b>in</b> the MENA region. The first democracy aid {{programs in the}} Arab world, including {{the creation of a}} modest $3 million Middle East Democracy Fund, were introduced by the George H.W. Bush administration as a means of encouraging economic liberalization via political liberalization, though the projects were primarily focused on improving management and efficiency in government institutions, as opposed to addressing contentious issues such as human rights abuses, government structures preserving authoritarian power, and laws and practices suppressive of democracy. While the Clinton administration broke with the Reagan and Bush administrations in its willingness to work with civil society organizations and promote democratic transition beyond formerly Soviet countries, democracy promotion still remained a relatively low priority and Arab regimes were largely able to resist increased pressure from foreign-funded international NGOs in the 1990s. Nonetheless, the United States spent $250 million on democracy programs in the region from 1991 to 2001, and political reform appeared as a goal in State Department and USAID literature, even if it did not figure prominently in high-level diplomatic discussions.|$|E

500|$|Malouma, officially Malouma Meidah, {{first became}} {{politically}} active {{as a member}} of the opposition party in 1992, speaking out against dictatorships and in favor of <b>democratization.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, in what was widely considered the first freely held and fair election in the country, she was elected to the Senate of Mauritania, as one of the six women senators in a legislature of 56 members. She was the first person from the musician iggawen caste to serve in politics. Shortly after she was elected, a coup d'état took place in Mauritania in 2008 and deposed the first democratically elected head of state, Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. Because she had written songs criticizing the coup, Malouma was arrested and over a thousand cassettes and CDs of her recordings were seized. After the coup, the leader, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, allowed elections to proceed with only minor delays. He was elected president in July 2009 and the Senate elections in which one-third of the members faced re-election also were held. The parliamentary opposition group, called [...] "Ech-Choura", of which Malouma was a member and served as the First Secretary, constituted 12 members of the 56-member Senate after the 2009 election. She also served on the Parliamentary Group for the Environment and as 2nd Secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Armed Forces.|$|E

40|$|The project {{addresses}} {{the role of}} civil society organizations (CSOs) <b>in</b> <b>democratization</b> processes, bridging social science approaches to social movements and democracy. The project starts by revisiting the 'transitology' approach to democratization and the political process approach to social movements, before moving towards more innovative approaches in both areas. From the theoretical point of view, a main innovation will be in addressing both structural preconditions as well as actors' strategies, looking {{at the intersection of}} structure and agency. In an historical and comparative perspective, I aim to develop a description and an understanding of the conditions and effects of the participation of civil society organizations in the various stages of democratization processes. Different parts of the research will address different sub-questions linked to the broad question of CSOs' participation <b>in</b> <b>democratization</b> processes: a) under which (external and internal) conditions and through which mechanisms do CSOs support democratization processes? b) Under which conditions and through which mechanisms do they play an important role <b>in</b> <b>democratization</b> processes? c) Under which conditions and through which mechanisms are they successful <b>in</b> triggering <b>democratization</b> processes? d) And, finally, what is the legacy of the participation of civil society during transitions to democracy on the quality of democracy during consolidation? The main empirical focus will be on recent <b>democratization</b> processes <b>in</b> EU member and associated states. The comparative research design will, however, also include selected comparisons with oppositional social movements in authoritarian regimes as well as <b>democratization</b> processes <b>in</b> other historical times and geopolitical regions. From an empirical point of view, a main innovation will lie in the development of mixed method strategies, combining large N and small N analyses, and qualitative comparative analysis with in-depth, structured narratives.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{presented}} how new technologies influence democratization of diplomacy. Primarily, the advantages of <b>democratization</b> of diplomacy <b>in</b> the conditions of new technologies are explained.

On the other hand, negative effects of <b>democratization</b> of diplomacy <b>in</b> the conditions of new technologies are analyzed. The new technology as potential source of propaganda and vulgarization is described. Finally, although there are disadvantages of <b>democratization</b> of diplomacy <b>in</b> the conditions of new technologies, it is concluded the advantages surpass the disadvantages. The new technologies raise the democratization of diplomacy for a general well-fair and {{have a tendency to}} reduce hard power and to strengthen soft power...|$|R
