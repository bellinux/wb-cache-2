5|$|Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) grow as a <b>drupe</b> that is {{attached}} to the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree. Native to northeastern Brazil, the cashew was introduced to India and East Africa in the sixteenth century, where they remain a major commercial crop. The nut must be roasted to remove the caustic shell oil before being consumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded <b>drupe.</b> A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
40|$|Background: Because {{of damage}} caused by {{mechanical}} harvesting, the <b>drupes</b> for table olive production are traditionally hand harvested. Until now, no data have been available on the microbiological and chemical features of mechanically harvested <b>drupes</b> during fermentation. Results: <b>Drupes</b> mechanically harvested and inoculated with Lactobacillus pentosus OM 13 were characterized by the lowest concentrations of potential spoilage microorganisms. On the other hand, <b>drupes</b> mechanically harvested and subjected to spontaneous fermentation showed the highest concentration of Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonads during transformation. The lowest decrease of pH (4. 20) was registered for the trials inoculated with the starter culture. Differences in terms of volatile organic compounds were estimated among trials. Multivariate analysis showed that the olives processed from the <b>drupes</b> mechanically harvested and inoculated with starter were closely related to control production (<b>drupes</b> manually harvested) in terms of microbiological and pH values. Sensory analysis evidenced negative evaluations only for the uninoculated trials. Conclusion: <b>Drupes</b> mechanically harvested and subjected to a driven fermentation with Lactobacillus pentosus OM 13 determined the production of table olives with appreciable organoleptic features. Thus mechanical harvesting performed using a trunk shaker equipped with an inverse umbrella {{and the addition of}} starter lactic acid bacteria represents a valuable alternative to manual harvesting for table olive production at the industrial level...|$|R

5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a <b>drupe,</b> is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The <b>drupe</b> is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

5000|$|Once {{the flowers}} of the {{northern}} dewberry are fertilized, <b>drupes</b> soon grow and replace each flower. [...] The <b>drupes</b> are a dark-purplish color and range from ½ inch to one inch in diameter. [...] Once the fruit has fully ripened it has a tart-sweet flavor.|$|R
25|$|Green pepper, like black, is {{made from}} the unripe <b>drupes.</b> Dried green peppercorns are treated {{in a way that}} retains the green colour, such as {{treatment}} with sulphur dioxide, canning or freeze-drying. Pickled peppercorns, also green, are unripe <b>drupes</b> preserved in brine or vinegar. Fresh, unpreserved green pepper <b>drupes,</b> largely unknown in the West, are used in some Asian cuisines, particularly Thai cuisine. Their flavour has been described as spicy and fresh, with a bright aroma. They decay quickly if not dried or preserved.|$|R

25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{endocarp}} distinguishes a berry from a <b>drupe,</b> which has a hardened or stony endocarp (see also below).

25|$|Black pepper is {{produced}} from the still-green, unripe <b>drupes</b> of the pepper plant. The <b>drupes</b> are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean {{them and to}} prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper, speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying. The <b>drupes</b> dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by hand and then sun-dried without the boiling process.|$|R

The strawberry is also an aggregate-accessory fruit, only one in which the seeds are contained in achenes. In all these examples, the fruit develops from a single flower with numerous pistils.|$|E
25|$|Palms have large, {{evergreen}} {{leaves that}} are either palmately ('fan-leaved') or pinnately ('feather-leaved') compound and spirally arranged {{at the top of}} the stem. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side at maturity. The inflorescence is a spadix or spike surrounded by one or more bracts or spathes that become woody at maturity. The flowers are generally small and white, radially symmetric, and can be either uni- or bisexual. The sepals and petals usually number three each, and may be distinct or joined at the base. The stamens generally number six, with filaments that may be separate, attached to each other, or attached to the pistil at the base. The fruit is usually a single-seeded <b>drupe</b> (sometimes berry-like) but some genera (e.g. Salacca) may contain two or more seeds in each fruit.|$|E

2500|$|In 1751, Carl Linnaeus wrote Philosophia Botanica, {{considered}} to be the first textbook of descriptive systematic botany. He used eight different terms for fruits, one of which was [...] or berry, distinguished from other types of fruit such as [...] (<b>drupe)</b> and [...] (pome). A [...] was defined as [...] "", meaning [...] "unvalved solid pericarp, containing otherwise naked seeds". The adjective [...] "" [...] here has the sense of [...] "solid with tissue softer than the outside; stuffed". A berry or [...] was distinguished from a <b>drupe</b> and a pome, both of which also had an unvalved solid pericarp; a <b>drupe</b> also contained a nut (...) and a pome a capsule (...) , rather than the berry's naked seeds. Linnaeus' use of [...] and [...] was thus significantly different from that of Caesalpinus. Botanists continue to differ on how fruit should be classified.|$|E
2500|$|Drupes are fleshy fruits {{produced}} from a (usually) single-seeded ovary {{with a hard}} woody layer (called the endocarp) surrounding the seed. Familiar examples include the stonefruits of Prunus genus (peaches, plums and cherries), olives, coconut and bayberry. Persea species. Some definitions make {{the mere presence of}} an internally differentiated endocarp the defining feature of a drupe; others qualify the nature of the endocarp required in a <b>drupe,</b> e.g. defining berries to have endocarp less than 2mm thick. The term [...] "drupaceous" [...] is used of fruits that have the general structure and texture of a <b>drupe,</b> without necessarily meeting the full definition. Other drupe-like fruits with a single seed that lack the stony endocarp include sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides, Elaeagnaceae), which is an achene, surrounded by a swollen hypanthium that provides the fleshy layer. Fruits of Coffea species are described as either drupes or berries.|$|E
