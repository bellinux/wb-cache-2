5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the storm finished, the Allied fleet {{returned}} to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae. The following day, (the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae. The same day, the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium, at Aphetae. According to Herodotus, 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines, and were captured. Although clearly storm damaged, the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3:1. As a result, the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely. The Euboeans, {{not wanting to be}} abandoned to the Persians, bribed Themistocles to try to ensure that the Allied fleet remained. Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his strategy in the first place, it is likely this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Themistocles wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals, Eurybiades and Adeimantus to remain at Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

Therefore, the test may lead to dissatisfaction in the administration of justice on the part of members of the public, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the doctrine of apparent bias was intended to avoid.|$|E
25|$|In 1244 and 1245 the Cistercian general chapter had {{determined}} that a monastery of nuns could {{be incorporated into the}} Cistercian Order only if the competent bishop and the competent cathedral chapter exempted the community's temporalities and spiritualities from their control. However, such a wide-ranging exemption from their sovereignty <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Bremen's cathedral chapter and the prince-archbishop did not want, as is described below.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the Byzantine strategy at this battle, ambushing a raiding army on its return journey when it would be slowed by plunder and captives, <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is prescribed in much earlier Byzantine military treatises, such as the Tactica of Leo VI (886–912). This points to a retention by Byzantine commanders of knowledge of the successful military strategies of the past.|$|E

25|$|In general, meaning shift {{happens when}} there is a lexical {{implication}} of the society speaking the language so the social situation and the thoughts of the speakers of the languages obliged them to change the meaning of some words so their language could be adapted to their situation and that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened in Tunisia. In fact, the borrowing of rhetoric and semantic structures from other contact languages like French helped the meaning shift in Tunisian.|$|E
25|$|Expert {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, {{was referring to the}} radar altimeter (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative {{to the level of the}} runway). Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened.|$|E
25|$|Transponder – In practice, {{the signal}} {{inputs and outputs}} will not be {{electrical}} but optical instead (typically at 1550nm). This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> a transponder is. A transponder {{can be made up}} of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550nm optical signal to/from an electrical signal, and the second transceiver converting the electrical signal to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don't use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E

25|$|The Australians began day two {{looking to}} go past England's total, {{and build a}} big lead, and that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they did. Geoff Marsh fell off just 14 balls for a disappointing 3, but Mark Taylor and David Boon added 145 for the second wicket, {{although}} it was hard work and slow-going. Taylor was caught LBW for 62 in a rare lapse of concentration in an otherwise well made innings, and Boon was dismissed 42 runs later, out for 94. Australia batted on throughout the second day but their progress was slow but steady.|$|E
25|$|This {{percolation}} {{of architectural}} style was {{not confined to}} private houses, but to civic architecture too: an illustrious architect added to civic pride; and when an architect was too expensive for the civic coffers, {{for a fraction of}} the price he would judge a competition between local architects, for the privilege of designing a town hall or church. This <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened in Aylesbury. John Vanbrugh judged two sets of plans for the County Hall (now Aylesbury Crown Court). Thus for ever Vanbrugh's name was remembered in association with the building, the local architect almost forgotten, and civic pride maintained.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at {{a conference}} {{organised}} by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added: The book {{is second only to}} the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E

25|$|A UCIL {{employee}} {{triggered the}} plant's alarm system at 12:50a.m. as {{the concentration of}} gas {{in and around the}} plant became difficult to tolerate. Activation of the system triggered two siren alarms: one that sounded inside the UCIL plant, and a second directed outward to the public and the city of Bhopal. The two siren systems had been decoupled from one another in 1982, so {{that it was possible to}} leave the factory warning siren on while turning off the public one, and this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was done: the public siren briefly sounded at 12:50a.m. and was quickly turned off, as per company procedure meant to avoid alarming the public around the factory over tiny leaks. Workers, meanwhile, evacuated the UCIL plant, travelling upwind.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, the Skjöldunga saga retells {{the story}} of Eadgils {{fighting}} his uncle Onela, but in this version Onela is no longer Eadgils' uncle, but a Norwegian king of Oppland. This change is {{generally considered to be}} a late confusion between the core province of the Swedes, Uppland, and its Norwegian namesake Oppland. Whereas, Beowulf leaves the Danish court with the suspicion that Hroðulf (Rolfo Krage, Hrólfr Kraki) might claim the Danish throne for himself at the death of Hroðgar (Roas, Hróarr), it <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he does in Scandinavian tradition. A notable difference is that, in Beowulf, Eadgils receives the help of the Geatish king Beowulf against Onela, whereas it is the Danish king Hroðulf who provides help in Scandinavian tradition.|$|E
25|$|Vallée also {{proposes that}} a {{secondary}} {{aspect of the}} UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that {{it is highly unlikely}} that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the manipulators want us to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate. Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.|$|E
