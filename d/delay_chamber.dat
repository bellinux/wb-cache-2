The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether delayed myoblast implantation, at day 4 or 7, improves myoblast survival compared with implantation at day 0 in an in vivo arterio-venous loop (AB loop) chamber model. In adult inbred Sprague-Dawley rats, an AB loop was inserted into a plastic chamber (day 0). In Group I, day 0, two million DiI-labeled (neonatal inbred) myoblasts were implanted around the AB loop. In Groups II and III, day 0, the AB loop was created and inserted into a novel delayed cell seeding chamber, and 4 (Group II) or 7 days (Group III) later the <b>delay</b> <b>chamber</b> was seeded with 2 million DiI-labeled myoblasts. Constructs were harvested 7 -day postmyoblast implantation, for morphometric determination of DiI= DAPI-positive myoblasts=mm 2, and percent vascular volume on Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (endothelial cell marker) –labeled tissue sections. Control (nonmyoblast seeded) and experimental (myoblast seeded) constructs demonstrated similar capillary and tissue growth patterns. DiI=DAPI-labeled myoblasts=mm 2 appeared in similar numbers in constructs implanted at days 0 and 4, but increased markedly in day- 7 implanted constructs. The percent vascular volume increased significantly (p¼ 0. 03) over time. A positive correlation existed between myoblast survival and construct vascularity (p¼ 0. 017). In conclusion, delaying myoblast implantation to 7 -day postconstruct assembly, when new capillary growth is well established, significantly correlates with increased myoblast survival and indicates that cell seeding in regenerative procedures should always occur into an established vascular bed...|$|E

There were many special effects, like tape loops, tape <b>delays,</b> reverb <b>chambers</b> and echo effects. Through intensive tape editing, Macero concocted many totally new musical structures that were later imitated by the band in live concerts. Macero, who has a classical education and was most likely inspired by '50s and '60s French musique concrète experiments, used tape editing as a form of arranging and composition."Pharaoh's Dance" [...] contains 19 edits - its famous stop-start opening is entirely constructed in the studio, using repeat loops of certain sections. Later on in the track there are several micro-edits: for example, a one-second-long fragment that first appears at 8:39 is repeated five times between 8:54 and 8:59. The title track contains 15 edits, again with several short tape loops of, in this case, five seconds (at 3:01, 3:07 and 3:12). Therefore, Bitches Brew not only became a controversial classic of musical innovation, it also became renowned for its pioneering use of studio technology.|$|R

50|$|The Minimi uses a gas-actuated {{long-stroke}} piston system. The barrel {{is locked}} with a rotary bolt, equipped with two massive locking lugs, forced into battery by a helical camming guide in the bolt carrier. Upon firing, the piston {{is forced to}} the rear by expanding propellant gases bled through a port in the barrel near the muzzle end. The piston rod acts against the bolt carrier, which begins its rearward motion guided on two rails welded to the receiver walls, while the bolt itself remains locked. This sequence provides a slight <b>delay</b> that ensures <b>chamber</b> pressure has dropped to a safe level {{by the time a}} cam in the bolt carrier rotates and unlocks the bolt, increasing extraction reliability as the empty cartridge casing has had the time to cool down and contract, exerting less friction against the chamber walls.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of reacting Diesel jets, including {{elements of the}} structure {{that are likely to}} strongly depend on chemical kinetics such as ignition and pollutant distribution, is investigated by employing an interactive flamelet model. The ignition delay and ignition location are computed for a range of ambient conditions and compared with measurements. Consistent with the measurements, the computed results reveal a two-stage ignition behavior. Ignition is predicted to occur in a rich mixture at an equivalence ratio of about 3. 0, downstream of the maximum liquid-phase penetration. While qualitative trends are reproduced well, quantitative differences exist in the predictions of ignition delay. These differences are attributed to possible inaccuracies in computed strain rates and to differences between the surrogate fuel employed, n-heptane, and Diesel fuel. ^ NO is modeled using a sub-mechanism from GRI-Meth 3. 0 and soot is modeled using an empirical, a semi-empirical and a kinetic model. Qualitative comparisons of NO and soot distributions are made with the qualitative measurements of Dec and co-workers (1997). As expected, the maximum NO concentration is found in the maximum temperature region of the jet. The semi-empirical and kinetic soot models predict maximum soot in the head vortex region of the transient jet {{in the early stages of}} its development. The empirical model is inadequate for predicting the soot distribution. When modeling soot, its treatment as a particle with negligible diffusivity compared to the gas results in improved predictions relative to treating it as another gas species. Radiant heat transfer has a negligible effect on the transient quantitative and qualitative results during the injection period of Diesel sprays. ^ The implication of the unity Lewis number assumption employed in the flamelet model is evaluated. When compared to predictions obtained using a detailed multicomponent transport model, the unity Lewis number assumption results in longer ignition <b>delays</b> at higher <b>chamber</b> pressures and lower chamber temperatures and shorter ignition <b>delays</b> at lower <b>chamber</b> pressures. ...|$|R

50|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the case}} expands {{to seal the}} sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring <b>delayed</b> firearm, the <b>chamber</b> is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp. model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard. The SIG SG 510 rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder. The Seecamp pistol has a ring near the rear end of the chamber.|$|R

Seeds were classified according to four early developmental stages: I - mature seeds; II - seeds with elongation along the embryonic axis; III - beginning of root protrusion; IV - advanced germination stage, with seedling shoots. After categorization, physical and physiological quality was assessed. In freshly collected seeds, only category I was observed. At 270 days, approximately 40 % of seeds were in category III in laboratory conditions, while the maintenance in a cold <b>chamber</b> <b>delayed</b> germinative metabolism.

During six months, demonstrations and boycotts targeted French commercial interests at local and national levels. While the diplomatic settlement of the Laoxikai incident was suffering from many <b>delays,</b> the Tianjin <b>Chamber</b> of commerce led a massive general strike in the French Concession. Local elites thus provided a decisive contribution in both leadership and funding support. Besides, local press played a crucial part in launching a press campaign, which covered the diplomatic negociations and relayed protest actions. Among Tianjin newspapers, the Yishibao was particularly active. In addition to publishing daily reports, expressive caricatures were used to expose ideological standpoints and discussions emerging from urban public opinion. Through the analysis of these caricatures, this paper aims to examine nationalist conceptions and expectations in the 1910 s, soon after {{the overthrow of the}} Imperial regime and the establishment of the Republican government. These visual materials reflect major shifts in the formulation of patriotic discourses regarding territorial sovereignty and citizenship. Not only did press vocabulary and illustrations denounce territorial encroachments from imperialist powers, but they also disclosed conflicting political views. For instance, press slogans urged for the central State to take a stronger role, while advocating a greater level of local autonomy. Although such aspirations could not be achieved, they represented a significant step towards an activist framework for other protest movements and ideological debates, especially during the May Fourth Movement. On the occasion of the 100 th anniversary of the Laoxikai incident, this paper undertakes to further clarify the nationalist implications of this event, which remains largely neglected in research studies...|$|R

The polyunsaturated fuels HSO produced {{ignition delay}}s which were 0. 6 to 12. 4 %, 18. 7 to 32. 1 % and 10. 8 to 26. 8 % longer than RSO, rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and mineral diesel (MD) fuel respectively whilst CSO produced ignition delays which were 0 to 9. 8 %, 18. 4 to 29. 1 % and 11. 8 to 24. 8 % longer than RSO, RME and MD fuel respectively. Ignition delays increased with a 5 o Crank Angle (CA) advance in fuel injection timing by 2. 7 to 19. 2 %, 0. 9 to 11. 1 % and 0. 12 to 17. 0 % for RSO, CSO and HSO respectively. A reduction in ignition delay was noted for RSO, CSO and HSO by 5 to 7. 1 %, 1. 4 to 9. 5 % and 7. 9 to 13. 5 % except above 3100 rpm at 5 oCA retarded fuel injection timing. Maximum power outputs of HSO (4. 12 kW), and CSO(4. 38 kW) were lower when compared with MD fuel (4. 43 kW) however maximum power outputs for RSO (4. 47 kW) and RME (4. 63 kW) were both higher when compared with MD fuel (4. 43 kW) at standard fuel injection timing. After 28 days HSO, CSO, RME and WCOME increased in acid value from 8. 1 to 178. 4 % and peroxide value varied from - 63. 64 % to 321. 85 %. Ignition <b>delay,</b> combustion <b>chamber</b> peak pressure signal and rate of pressure rise were unaffected by storage of the oils. Advancing fuel injection timing by 5 oCA in a 1. 5 L Tempest (BMC) engine had no significant effect on the power, torque and BMEP for RME, NOx and smoke emissions increased by 10. 7 to 41. 5 % and by 24. 5 to 74. 3 % respectively and CO reduced by 14. 4 to 21. 6 % at BMEP BMEP> 250 kPa. HSO and CSO gave 4. 9 % and 5. 6 % higher maximum power than RSO, 12. 6 % and 13. 3 % more than RME and WCOME and 17. 4 % and 18. 1 % more than MD fuel respectively in a 1. 8 L NA IDI Ford Courier. HSO used 2. 6 to 15. 9 % and 1. 8 to 11. 2 % more fuel than RME and WCOME respectively whilst CSO used 2. 1 to 16. 3 % and 2. 1 to 12 % more fuel than RME and WCOME respectively except above 3700 rpm. HSO and CSO used 9. 1 to 42. 6 % and 0 to 43. 1 % more fuel than MD fuel for all engine speeds. Mean NOx increased by 11. 4 to 40. 2 % for HSO and 15. 7 to 35. 1 % for CSO above 1800 rpm compared with RME. NOx was higher by 11. 9 to 34. 6 % for HSO and by 16. 2 to 29. 7 % higher for CSO for all engine speeds than WCOME. Both HSO and CSO increased NOx by 6. 9 to 55. 1 % and 5. 1 to 56. 9 % compared with MD fuel above 1800 rpm. RME and WCOME gave 2. 2 to 26. 7 % and 1. 8 to 25 % greater NOx respectively than MD fuel above 3750 rpm. After 492 kWh use, RME gave carbon deposits on cylinder head, valves, piston crown and fuel injector in a 2 kW DI diesel generator and the top piston ring was seized. Carbon build up on the inlet valve and port was between 1. 2 x 10 - 3 and 3. 8 x 10 - 3 mm/kWh. An exponential rise in lubricating oil consumption and fuel consumption after 288 kWh indicated the start of engine wear out. Neoprene and reinforced polyurethane are not suitable materials for RME fuel lines.
