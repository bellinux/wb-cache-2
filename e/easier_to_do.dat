5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.|$|E

25|$|Inhibitory control, often {{conceptualized}} {{as an executive}} function, {{is the ability to}} inhibit or hold back a prepotent response. It is theorized that impulsive behavior reflects a deficit in this ability to inhibit a response; impulsive people may find it more difficult to inhibit action whereas non-impulsive people may find it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. There is evidence that, in normal adults, commonly used behavioral measures of inhibitory control correlate with standard self-report measures of impulsivity.|$|E
25|$|Carvings {{in stone}} adorned the exteriors and interiors, {{particularly}} the tympanum above the main entrance, which often featured a Christ in Majesty or in Judgement, {{and the large}} wooden crucifix was a German innovation right {{at the start of}} the period. The capitals of columns were also often elaborately carved with figurative scenes. The ensemble of large and well-preserved churches at Cologne, then the largest city north of the Alps, and Segovia in Spain, are among the best places today to appreciate the impact of the new larger churches on a city landscape, but many individual buildings exist, from Durham, Ely and Tournai Cathedrals to large numbers of individual churches, especially in Southern France and Italy. In more prosperous areas, many Romanesque churches survive covered up by a Baroque makeover, much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with these than a Gothic church.|$|E

500|$|As Soviet foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko {{noted in}} his memoirs that working with Nikita Khrushchev was not always an easy task. As Gromyko tells it, [...] "Khrushchev would {{constantly}} throw new ideas back and forth." [...] His ideas were not always supported, but, as Gromyko noted, Khrushchev had {{a positive impact on}} Soviet foreign policy. Leonid Brezhnev, according to Gromyko, was a man much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business with because he compensated for his lack of skills by discussing subjects openly within the Politburo. While he was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business with in some areas, Brezhnev's slowness and lack of knowledge in certain fields made him hard to discuss foreign policy with. However, Gromyko noted that his disease should be taken in consideration. Mikhail Gorbachev's [...] "new thinking" [...] led to friendlier foreign relations with the Western countries, but his domestic policies destabilised the country, and in 1991 the Soviet Union dissolved. In 1991, before the country's dissolution, the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of External Relations. The ministry was succeeded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in 1992 after Russia declared itself the legal successor to the USSR.|$|E

500|$|Canadian {{animator}} and {{creator of}} The Ren & Stimpy Show, John Kricfalusi, guest animated the couch gag for the episode. This {{was the second}} time The Simpsons had chosen a guest director for its opening sequence, following the previous season's episode [...] "MoneyBART", which was guest directed by British graffiti artist and political activist Banksy. Previously, Kricfalusi had criticized The Simpsons staff in the show's early years by saying that [...] "the show succeeded despite the writing" [...] and similarly derogatory comments. The producers responded with the fourth season episode [...] "The Front" [...] (1993), in which The Ren & Stimpy Show is nominated for a cartoon award. During the award ceremony, the clip from the nominated episode is merely a black screen with the text [...] "Clip not done yet", a comment on the slow production time of the show. The show was mentioned again in the season six episode [...] "Another Simpsons Clip Show" [...] (1994), when Lisa claims that Ren & Stimpy recycles animation to make new episodes, while referencing Itchy & Scratchy's habit of doing the same. Despite this, Kricfalusi changed his tone in an interview with Aaron Simpson in 2007 and claimed that The Simpsons made it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more edgy work: [...] "Well it started with Bakshi‚Äôs [...] and Pee Wee Herman. Those were kid shows, but with layers of perversion in them. Then The Simpsons came along and did edgy material in prime time cartoons." ...|$|E

2500|$|In any case, {{he decided}} to {{continue}} playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle ‚Äì [...] "melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger" [...] ‚Äì and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. [...] Secondly, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings to make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970‚Äì71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles [...] "helped with his technique" [...] {{because he had to}} use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on [...] "Children of the Grave", [...] "Lord of this World", and [...] "Into the Void", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a [...] "bigger, heavier sound", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.|$|E
