Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E

You remember all that you have read about him, of his terrors and the Inquisition; and everything becomes clear to your mind's eye with a sudden light; for the first time you understand it all; the Escorial is Philip II.... He is still there alive and terrible, with the image of his dreadful God... . Even now, after so long a time, on rainy days, when I am feeling sad, I think of the Escorial, and then look at the walls of my room and congratulate myself....

5000|$|Since {{the use of}} a {{linguistic}} expression is only possible if the speaker who uses it understands its meaning, one of the central problems for analytic philosophers has always been the question of meaning. What is it? Where <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>from?</b> How is it communicated? And, among these questions, what is the smallest unit of meaning, the smallest fragment of language with which it is possible to communicate something? At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Gottlob Frege and his followers abandoned the view, common at the time, that a word gets its meaning in isolation, independently from {{all the rest of the}} words in a language. Frege, as an alternative, formulated his famous context principle, according to which it is only within the context of an entire sentence that a word acquires its meaning. In the 1950s, the agreement that seemed to have been reached regarding the primacy of sentences in semantic questions began to unravel with the collapse of the movement of logical positivism and the powerful influence exercised by the philosophical investigations of the later Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein wrote in the Philosophical Investigations, in fact, that [...] "comprehending a proposition means comprehending a language." [...] About the same time or shortly after, W.V.O. Quine wrote that [...] "the unit of measure of empirical meaning is all of science in its globality"; and Donald Davidson, in 1967, put it even more sharply by saying that [...] "a sentence (and therefore a word) has meaning only in the context of a (whole) language." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{final act}} {{begins in the}} large room where the first act took place. It is six o'clock. Franz and Father enter simultaneously. Franz descends the steps slowly as they begin to speak. Franz says that they are both criminals, and {{that he does not}} accept Father's ability to judge him, but {{nonetheless}} forces him to swear that he will not. He also admits to being a torturer, that he beat the two prisoners to death in trying to make them talk. Franz describes how the powerlessness he felt as the rabbi was beaten to death led him to take full hold of his power later on. He admits [...] "I pretended that I was locking myself up so that I shouldn't witness Germany's agony. It's a lie. I wanted my country to die, and I shut myself up so that I shouldn't be a witness to its resurrection." [...] He releases his father from his oath and says that, without there being a God, any man is a person's natural judge. Father admits that he does not accept Franz, but continues: [...] Father: I have no contempt for you. Franz (sarcastically): Really? After what I've told you? Father: You've told me nothing Franz (stunned): What do you mean? Father: I've known about your Smolensk business for three years. pp. 166-167 [...] Father reveals that two men of Franz's unit had been taken prisoner by the Russians and survived. They came to see him in 1956, and told Father about the [...] "butcher of Smolensk". It was from then on that Father had wanted to see Franz, whom he pitied. When they begin to talk about the suffering Franz has created for everyone, Franz climbs back up the stairs and threatens to return to his room. His father tells him that he can no longer hide from Germany's fate. He claims that Germany's loss in the war led to its coming back as a world power, and that those, like Franz, who [...] "loved their country enough to sacrifice their military honor for victory" [...] merely [...] "risked prolonging the massacre and hindering its reconstruction." [...] Father apologizes for trying to mold Franz's life according to his own, admitting that he condemned him to impotence and crime. He tells Franz to [...] "Tell your Court of Crabs that I alone am guilty - of everything." [...] Upon hearing this, Franz again descends the stairs, smiling and saying [...] Franz: That's what I wanted to hear you say. Well, I accept. Father: What? Franz: What you expect of me. (Pause.) On one condition: that it is both of us, and at once. Father (taken aback): At once? Franz: Yes. Father (huskily): Do you mean today? Franz: I mean this very moment. (Pause.) Isn't that what you wanted? Father (coughs): Not.. so soon. Franz: Why not? Father: I have just found you again. Franz: You have found no one. Not even yourself. (He is calm and straightforward for the first time, but completely despairing.) I shall only have been one of your images. The others have remained in your head. As luck would have it, {{this is the one that}} became incarnate. In Smolensk one night it had.. what? A moment of independence. So you are guilty of everything except that. (Pause.) I lived for thirteen years with a loaded revolver in my drawer. Do you know why I didn't kill myself? I said to myself: [...] "What's done is done." [...] p. 173 [...] The two discuss taking Leni's Porsche on the Elbe Embankment, a road which leads to the [...] "Teufelsbrücke" [...] over the Elbe, something they used to do when Franz was young. Father goes to get the car as Franz gives Leni and Johanna his farewells. Leni asks which car and road they are taking, and Franz gives Leni his tape recorder along with his [...] "best recording" [...] - [...] "the case for the defense". Franz exits, and Leni, who realizes their intent, tells Johanna [...] "seven minutes my Porsche will be in the water... because the Teufelsbrücke is seven minutes from here." [...] Leni says that she will seclude herself in Franz's room, and that she will see only their servant, Hilda. When the seventh minute is reached, she presses the button of the tape recorder, then ascends the stairs and enters the room as it begins to play. [...] Voice of Franz (from the tape recorder): Centuries of the future, here is my century, solitary and deformed - the accused. My client is tearing himself open with his own hands. What you take for white lymph is blood. There are no red corpuscles, for the accused is dying of hunger. But I will tell you the secret of these multiple incisions. The century might have been a good one had not man been watched from time immemorial by the cruel enemy who had sworn to destroy him, that hairless, evil, flesh-eating beast - man himself. One and one make one - there's our mystery. The beast was hiding, and suddenly we surprised his look deep in the eyes of our neighbors. So we struck. Legitimate self-defense. I surprised the beast.

My client was the first to know shame. he knows he is naked. Beautiful children, you who are born of us, our pain has brought you forth. This century is a woman in labor. Will you condemn your mother? Eh? Answer! (Pause.) The thirtieth century no longer replies. Perhaps there will be no more centuries after ours. Perhaps a bomb will blow out all the lights. Everything will be dead - eyes, judges, time. Night. Oh, tribunal of the night - you who were, who will be, and who are - I have been! I have been! I, Franz von Gerlach, here in this room, have taken the century upon my shoulders and have said: [...] "I will answer for it. This day and forever." [...] What do you say?
