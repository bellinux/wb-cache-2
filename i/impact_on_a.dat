5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> person's personal wardrobe.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{may include}} beetles and sciomyzid fly larvae, {{many of which}} {{specialize}} in feeding upon snails. Other potential predators may include the northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata), northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), and Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), which are common in the talus and on the ledges, as well as various small mammals or passerine birds such as robins and pigeons, which are often seen {{in or near the}} habitat.

25|$|Storage of wine is an {{important}} consideration for wine that is being kept for long-term aging. While most wine is consumed within 24 hours of purchase, fine wines are often set aside for long-term storage. Wine {{is one of the}} few commodities that can improve in flavour and value with age, but it can also rapidly deteriorate if kept in inadequate conditions. The three factors that have the most direct <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wine's condition are light, humidity, and temperature. Historically, the storage of wine was handled by wine merchants. Since the mid-20th century, however, consumers have been increasingly storing their own wine in home-based wine cellars.|$|E

25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} transformation {{continued to increase}} in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting {{in a series of}} new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.|$|E
25|$|Literature {{movements}} did {{not disappear}} {{even when they}} were under censorship by the colonial government-general. In the early 1930s, a famous debate on Taiwanese rural language unfolded formally. This event had numerous lasting effects on Taiwanese literature, language and racial consciousness. In 1930, Taiwanese-Japanese resident Huang Shihui started the debate on rural literature in Tokyo. He advocated that Taiwanese literature should be about Taiwan, have <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wide audience, and use Taiwanese Hokkien. In 1931, Koeh Chhiu-seng, a resident of Taihoku (Taipei), prominently supported Huang's viewpoint. Koeh started the Taiwanese Rural Language Debate, which advocated literature published in Taiwanese. This was immediately supported by Loa Ho who is considered as the father of Taiwanese literature. After this, dispute as to whether the literature of Taiwan should use Taiwanese or Chinese, and whether the subject matter should concern Taiwan, became the focus of the New Taiwan Literature Movement. However, because of the upcoming war and the pervasive Japanese cultural education, these debates could not develop any further. They finally lost traction under the Japanization policy set by the government.|$|E
25|$|As the war {{finally ended}} in 1721, Sweden had lost an {{estimated}} 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the Finnish part of Sweden. This {{made a huge}} <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> population that before the war had barely reached 2 million. The total population did not grow during the 21 years of the war; it was even reduced, according to some sources, as the massive losses outnumbered overall births. For example, the province of Östergötland was supposed to support 2,200 croft soldiers, making up one infantry and one cavalry regiment. Losses had to be replaced, and during {{the first years of}} the war, another 2,400 men were conscripted. After the Battle of Poltava in 1709, both regiments had to be completely reraised. At the end of the war, a total of 10,400 soldiers had been conscripted from the province that was meant to support only a fifth, or 2,200. Another regiment, Hälsinge regemente, had to be completely raised three times during the war. The lack of soldiers became so critical that in the period 17141715, the army had to return to the old method of conscripting men by force.|$|E

25|$|For instance, with {{relation}} {{to social security}} and general family law, same-sex couples were not previously recognised as a couple for social security or family assistance purposes. A person who had a same-sex de facto partner {{was treated as a}} single person. The reforms ensured that same-sex couples were (for the first time under Australian law) recognised as a couple akin to opposite-sex partners. Consequently, a same-sex couple receives the same rate of social security and family assistance payments as an opposite-sex couple. Generally speaking a couple in a de facto relationship is treated equally to a married couple in legal proceedings, though a few small differences exist in family law disputes, including property settlements and entitlements to spousal maintenance. A partner in a de facto relationship may also be required to prove the existence of a relationship before a court in order to access benefits, a process which is automatic for married couples and consequently can have a discriminatory impact on same-sex couples, who cannot yet marry in Australia. De facto relationships also have different time eligibility requirements than marriages when it comes to laws dealing with Centrelink, migration, family law matters and assisted reproduction. The greater burden of proof can <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> person's ability to arrange their partner's funeral, and the rights of a de facto partner may be poorly understood by government departments. Despite large equality of rights, Australia does not have a national registered partnership, civil union or same-sex relationship scheme.|$|E
