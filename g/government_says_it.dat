5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the <b>government</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

5000|$|Quebec's lack of {{participation}} affects nominations and designations for rivers shared with other provinces. In 1998, the New Brunswick {{portion of the}} Restigouche River was designated (as [...] "Upper Restigouche"), while the Quebec portion was not.

2500|$|In the 1960s neoabolitionist historians emerged, led by John Hope Franklin, Kenneth Stampp, Leon Litwack, and Eric Foner. Influenced by the Civil Rights Movement, they {{rejected}} the Dunning school {{and found a}} great deal to praise in Radical Reconstruction. Foner, the primary advocate of this view, argued that it was never truly completed, and that a [...] "Second Reconstruction" [...] was needed in the late 20th century to complete the goal of full equality for African Americans. The neo-abolitionists followed the revisionists in minimizing the corruption and waste created by Republican state <b>governments,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> was no worse than Boss Tweed's ring in New York City.|$|R

50|$|China's economy {{more than}} doubled in size in the past decade, turning the country into the world's top user of {{commodities}} such as copper, soy and rice.

50|$|In contrast, the 11 September {{attacks against}} the United States in 2001 precipitated a {{reaction}} against ultra-conservative Islamic sentiment; fifteen of the nineteen hijackers in the September 11 attacks came from Saudi Arabia.

[...] Iran also expressed concerns after the incident, though not to the same level of their strong protests after a 1987 incident that led to the death of 400 Shia pilgrims, presumably because Iran was not a victim of the incident. Turkey also issued a brief complaint after the incident. Calls for an international investigation were rejected by the Saudis.|$|R

50|$|The Fajr-3 is {{currently}} Iran's most advanced ballistic missile. It is a domestically-developed liquid fuel missile with an unknown range. What makes it Iran's most advanced rocket {{is that the}} Iranian <b>government</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> has multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRV) capabilities. Its MIRV capability may give it the ability of avoiding anti-missile surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). The missile was last launched during Holy Prophet wargames, which was the IRGC's largest naval war games ever. The Fajr-3 and the Fajr-3 artillery rocket are different systems.|$|E

50|$|A {{discretionary}} policy is supported {{because it allows}} policymakers to respond quickly to events.

This makes policy non-credible and ultimately ineffective.|$|R
