40|$|Case StudyTorsional {{instability}} during starting of an {{induction motor}} has caused excessive torque oscillation and eventual failure of gearbox pinion teeth of a cooling tower <b>fan</b> <b>train.</b> A torsional instability appeared {{due to a}} steep slope of the induction motor starting torque curve, combined with a torsionally soft driveshaft and a large moment of inertia of the driven fan. In this paper, mechanisms of torsional instability occurrence during startup of an induction motor in a cooling tower <b>fan</b> <b>train</b> are discussed, as well as details of the investigation outcomes of troubleshooting activities, including field measurements. The methods of modeling and analysis are also described. To examine the mechanism of torsional instability occurrence, in addition to transient torsional analysis, the concept of torsional stability analysis is introduced. Practical engineering guidelines to avoid this type of problem, such as a motor selection guideline, are also addressed...|$|R

50|$|Sour {{cherries}} require similar cultivation {{conditions to}} pears, that is, they prefer a rich, well-drained, moist soil, although they demand more nitrogen and water than sweet cherries. Trees will do badly if waterlogged, but have greater tolerance of poor drainage than sweet varieties. As with sweet cherries, Morellos are traditionally cultivated by budding onto strong growing rootstocks, which produce trees {{too large for}} most gardens, although newer dwarfing rootstocks such as Colt and Gisella are now available. During spring, flowers should be protected, and trees weeded, mulched and sprayed with natural seaweed solution. This is also the time when any required pruning should be carried out (note that cherries should not be pruned during the dormant winter months). Morello cherry trees fruit on younger wood than sweet varieties, and thus can be pruned harder. They are usually grown as standards, but can be <b>fan</b> <b>trained,</b> cropping well even on cold walls, or grown as low bushes.|$|R
