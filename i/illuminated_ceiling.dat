500|$|Dutch {{design studio}} Buro Vormkrijgers created a Pong-themed clock as a fun project within their offices. After the studio decided to {{manufacture}} it for retail, Atari took legal action in February 2006. The two companies eventually {{reached an agreement}} in which Buro Vormkrijgers could produce a limited number under license. In 1999, French artist Pierre Huyghe created an installation entitled [...] "Atari Light", in which two people use handheld gaming devices to play Pong on an <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León in 2007. The game {{was included in the}} London Barbican Art Gallery's 2002 Game On exhibition meant to showcase the various aspects of video game history, development, and culture.|$|E
2500|$|Lakeside Hall was {{converted}} into a new ballroom which could seat 4,000 people. Service space between the Great Hall and Lakeside Hall {{was converted}} into a new lobby, with staircase access to the surface above. The contemporarily-styled lobby had an <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling</b> the mimicked a skylight. The steel columns in the space were plastered, and one bare concrete wall covered with a new decoration of sculpted glass block and stone. A corner kiosk in the lobby doubled as a registration desk and a bar. A new monumental staircase, echoing {{the look of the}} staircase in Public Auditorium, was built to connect the lobby with the new banquet hall. Rather than the traditional plush look, the ballroom space was designed with an industrial feel that helped unite it visually with the Great Hall. Industrial ceiling lights, covered in Teflon fabric and perforated metal wall sconces helped to light the space. The walls remained raw concrete. To help eliminate the underground feel of the space, the north wall with its three-door railroad loading dock was removed, and a new glass curtain wall installed. [...] To improve the view of Lake Erie beyond, a retaining wall outside the facility was lowered. Service space in Lakeside Hall was {{converted into a}} large catering kitchen to serve the ballroom.|$|E
5000|$|Mitchelson {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "A divorce lawyer is a {{chameleon}} with a law book." [...] In his Century City office he had a chair owned by Rudolph Valentino and an <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling</b> of Botticelli's Venus which matched his belt buckle.|$|E

50|$|Architect César Pelli, in {{designing}} the center's 2,300 seat Mead Theatre, included a fiber-optically <b>illuminated</b> domed <b>ceiling</b> depicting the Dayton sky as it appeared {{on the eve of}} the Wright Brothers’ first flight - December 16, 1903. The Winter Garden houses exotic palm trees and a café with a large glass and steel wall that looks out onto downtown Dayton.|$|R
50|$|The <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{was once}} {{popular in the}} 1960s and 1970s but fell out of favor after the 1980s. This uses {{diffuser}} panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights, and is considered general lighting. Other forms include neon, which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else, but to actually be an artwork in itself. This would probably fall under accent lighting, though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is divided vertically into three sections, which increase in brightness {{from the bottom}} upwards. The lowermost portion of the benches for the church visitors is kept relatively dark and in the design symbolizes {{the suffering of the}} world. The second section, located above, is kept white and blue, and reserved for the emperor. The uppermost portion of the indirect and hidden <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling</b> painting is dedicated to God and eternity.|$|E
50|$|The venue was {{originally}} part of Mecca Leisure Group's New Entertainments Centre {{and was an}} ABC Cinema. Opening in 1966, it included a dozen licensed bars, an ice rink, bowling lanes, the Craywood Club casino, a night club, a grand cinema and the 1900-capacity Locarno ballroom with an <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Only the ice-rink and the cinema survived, the rest being demolished in 1998 and subsequently the site given over to student accommodation. The cinema closed in 1996 and was converted into a nightclub in 2000, originally called Rock. Soon after, it became the Bristol Academy.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} is dimly lit through domestic scaled casement windows with diamond patterned glazing bars and green glass. The only natural light that falls from above, <b>illuminating</b> the <b>ceiling</b> space, {{is through the}} stained glass windows behind the altar. The altar and altar screen positioned against the rear wall of the chancel are on a raised floor behind an ornamental timber rail. Rooms in the transepts contain disused rainwater tanks.|$|R
50|$|Light {{shelves are}} an {{effective}} way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure, this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window. Usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave. The light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to <b>illuminate</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> This reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows, reducing the need for general illumination.|$|R
50|$|On October 19, 2010, the Société des bingos du Québec (SBQ) inaugurated a Kinzo hall at 8780 Boulevard Saint-Laurent in Montreal. Kinzo is {{a unique}} game concept, similar to bingo but in which {{multimedia}} sound and light shows on wall screens and <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling</b> fixtures add to the excitement. The SBQ launched the Kinzo pilot project after figures demonstrated that bingo was losing steam in Québec, {{as a way of}} improving the finances non-profit organizations that rely on bingo for funding. Additionally, the SBQ has created a regional investment fund to develop the bingo industry.|$|E

50|$|It {{was painted}} red. It was a cavernous, domed space {{and had no}} balconies, which contributed to its vastness. The dome and pillars were {{decorated}} with maquernas, a honeycombed pendentive ornament, which resembled stalactites. When <b>illuminated,</b> the <b>ceiling's</b> lightbulbs formed patterns of celestial constellations, and the vaulted ceiling took on another concept, the night sky. In the lobby and elsewhere, Poelzig made use of colored lightbulbs to create striking visual backdrops. Separate entrances were provided for the expensive and the cheap seats. The theatre also included a restaurant for the wealthy audience members, a cafeteria for the poorer audience members, and a bar. The performers and technicians enjoyed their own bar, a barber shop, ample dressing room space, and the modern stage equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the building features a [...] "palatial" [...] staircase. and reflects the western obsession with exotic lands and cultures that was fashionable in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The interior is decorated with filigreed walls and <b>ceilings,</b> <b>illuminated</b> with indirect, recessed lighting from within and behind the walls. The rich decor is enhanced {{by the addition of}} authentic Louis XV and XVI furnishings and a collection of other works of art.|$|R
40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} that variations in ceiling height can prime concepts that, in turn, affect how consumers process information. We theorized that when reasonably salient, a high versus low ceiling can prime {{the concepts of}} freedom versus confinement, respectively. These concepts, in turn, can prompt consumers ’ use of predominately relational versus item-specific processing. Three studies found support for this theorizing. On a variety of measures, ceiling height–induced relational or item-specific processing was indicated by people’s reliance on integrated and abstract versus discrete and concrete ideation. Hence, this research sheds light on when and how ceiling height can affect consumers ’ responses. There appears to be widespread belief that ceiling height can {{affect the quality of}} indoor consumption experiences. Fischl and Gärling (2004) found that ceiling height ranked among the top three architectural details that influenced consumers ’ psychological well-being. Much anecdotal evidence also supports this view. A home development company that uses design ideas inspired by the guru of transcendental meditation maintains that homes with higher ceilings induce clearer and improved thinking, more energy, and better health among residents (Bivins 1997). Airplane manufacturers seem to concur that higher ceilings can enhance consumers ’ consumption experience, even if the increased height is only illusory. Such manufacturers use numerous techniques to engender the illusion of increased vertical space or volume in plane interiors, including repositioning overhead baggage bins, installing gently arched <b>illuminated</b> <b>ceiling</b> panels, and affixing wavy mirrors on the bulkheads beneath overhead storage bins (Lunsford and Michael...|$|E
50|$|Distinguishing the {{interior}} is a lavish use of stained glass and timber, including English oak and walnut, Tasmanian blackwood and Queensland greasenut. Leadlighting in the ceiling above the stair hall and around the front door is of particular note, as are the timber dado panelling, fireplace surrounds and overmantels in the principal rooms, particularly those in the dining room. A skylight has been installed in the roof over the stair hall to <b>illuminate</b> the glass <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dive {{sites around}} Coron include many {{different}} reef dive sites and [...] "Günter´s Cave", {{also known as}} Cathedral Cave because during a certain time of the day, the sun throws {{a beam of light}} {{through a hole in the}} cave <b>ceiling,</b> <b>illuminating</b> the inside. It is possible to surface in the cave, as the hole in the cave-ceiling allows fresh air to enter.The cave is named after Günther Bernert, who was part of the first dive group to explore the cave, after hearing from local fishermen about its existence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{automatic}} {{illumination system}} using 3 -DOF robotic lamps and a laser scanner is proposed in this paper. The 3 -DOF robotic lamp, {{which is designed}} with a spherical parallel mechanism, has a tilting motion to track a person and zoom-in and zoom-out motions to control the light intensity. The positions of people are detected by a laser scanner, and the Kalman filter and a data association algorithm are applied in order to track the positions of people accurately. We demonstrate experimentally that three robotic lamps mounted on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>illuminate</b> three people in- dependently and control {{the intensity of the}} light according to the distance between a person and the robotic lamp.

50|$|The Flora Theater in {{the central}} Penna San Giovanni is a Baroque structure; the wood facade was {{decorated}} by Liozzi with floral motifs and {{was the site of}} an international conference on frescoes featuring his work. A series of wooden hexagon columns painted in a faux marble pattern, support the steel reinforced core while two rows of wooden balustrades decorate the frames and are topped with floral garlands. The center of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>illuminates</b> an intricate pattern of cornices and moldings. Liozzi's signature fresco adorns the wooden ceiling, opening to a blue sky in which stands the goddess Flora. For years the theater was abandoned and almost lost to modernization. In 1985 it was designated as a historic national treasure and renovated to its original luster.|$|R
25|$|In the 1994 refit {{almost all}} of the {{remaining}} original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of QE2s designers and use the line's traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the Art Deco inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from Queen Mary. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional Edwardian pub. Some original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. Unfortunately the Queen's Room's indirect lighting from above was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by <b>illuminating</b> the lowered <b>ceiling</b> and leaving shadows in the ceiling's slot; and the furniture and carpet which replaced Michael Inchbald's designs were incongruous next to the flared columns and slotted ceiling.|$|R
40|$|Albino {{rats and}} mice are {{sensitive}} to light and the recommended illumination of animal rooms (75 - 125 ft-candles) is known to cause retinal damage. When a room is <b>illuminated</b> by <b>ceiling</b> lights, animals in the cages of the top row and, to some extent, in the side columns of cage racks will be exposed to higher light intensity {{than those in the}} other cages of the rack. In 2 -yr chemical carcinogenicity studies of the National Toxicology Program (previously the Carcinogenicity Bioassay Program of the National Cancer Institute), Fischer 344 rats were group-housed in hanging drawer-type clear polycarbonate cages. During the course of the chronic studies, a number of rats developed opacity of the eye. Ocular examination indicated chronic uveitis, deep interstitial keratitis, cataract formation leading to panophthalmitis, and in severe cases, phthisis bulbi. Histologic examination showed cataract and retinal degeneration. Incidences of these lesions were highest (> 55 %) in the rats of the top rows and lowest in those of the bottom rows (< 10 Yo) of cages with no relation to chemical treatment, indicating an association with light intensity. The incidence of these eye lesions was markedly decreased (< 15 %) by decreasing the light intensity of the animal room to 4 0 ft-candles at 5 ft from the floor and rotating the cages in each column of a rack from top to bottom when cages or racks were changed...|$|R
50|$|Like the Art Nouveau {{period before}} it, Art Deco was an {{exceptional}} period for fine glass and other decorative objects, {{designed to fit}} their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of François Coty, {{but he did not}} begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and <b>illuminated</b> glass <b>ceilings</b> for the ocean liners SS Ile de France in 1927 and the SS Normandie in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frontispiece}} (surmounted by a {{cross over}} a plinth) is divided by reinforced spaces, with narrow {{windows on the}} lateral spaces, while an arched portico dominates the central space. [...] Above this doorway are three niches with the images of Nossa Senhora da Assunção, São Bernardo and São Bento, surmounted by three narrow windows and a coat-of-arms. [...] These upper sections of the principal facade were remodeled in the 17th century, with the windows and images of the saints added in this period. [...] The dependencies of the convent were also altered, but these were lost by 1533. [...] The only remnant of this period is a fragment of double capital, decorated in a vegetal form with crochet. The lateral facades include cornices, with two doors on the southern facade {{and one on the}} northern facade. The southern apse chapel dominates the opposite facade to the entrance, with a supported chancel with windows and cornice similar to those along the nave.
