40|$|As {{we learned}} in chapter 1, HFC {{networks}} have evolved from traditionally broadcasting only multichannel analog video signals to a two-way mixture of analog and digital signals carrying both digital video and high-speed data. This chapter provides the basic technical background of cable TV systems carrying analog and digital video signals. Section 2. 1 will explain {{the most commonly used}} analog video modulation formats, while Section 2. 2 will discuss the different digital video and audio signal standards. The primary cable TV frequency plans that are used in the U. S. are reviewed in Section 2. 3. In Section 2. 4, the basic characteristics of multichannel coaxial systems are reviewed in terms of the properties of their components such as coaxial cables, taps, and RF amplifiers. The different degradation mechanisms over multichannel coaxial cable plants such as second- and third-order nonlinear distortions, multipath micro-reflections or echoes, group delay, and AM <b>hum</b> <b>modulation</b> are reviewed in Section 2. 5. The last section will discuss the sources of upstream noise, including ingress noise, and their impact on the return-path transmission over cable TV networks. 2. 1 Analog Modulated Video Signal Format...|$|E
40|$|The cable {{television}} (CATV) industry has grown significantly {{since its inception}} in the late 1940 ’s. Originally, a CATV network was comprised of several homes that were connected to community antennae via a network of coaxial cables. The only signal processing done was by an analogue amplifier, and transmission only occurred in one direction (i. e. from the antennae/head-end to the subscribers). However, as CATV grew in popularity, demand for services such as pay-per-view television increased, which lead to supporting transmission in the upstream direction (i. e. from subscriber to the head-end). This greatly increased the signal processing to include frequency diplexers. CATV service providers began to expand the bandwidth of their networks in the late 90 ’s by switching from analogue to digital technology. In an effort to regulate the manufacturing of new digital equipment and ensure interoperability of products from different manufacturers, several cable service providers formed a non-for-profit consortium to develop a data-over-cable service interface specification (DOCSIS). The consortium, which is named CableLabs, released the first DOCSIS standard in 1997. The DOCSIS standard has been upgraded over the years to keep up with increased consumer demand for large bandwidths and faster transmission speeds, particularly in the upstream direction. The latest version of the DOCSIS standard, DOCSIS 3. 1, utilizes orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) technology to provide upstream transmission speeds of up to 1 Gbps. As cable service providers begin the process of upgrading their upstream receivers to comply with the new DOCSIS 3. 1 standard, they require a means of testing the various functions that an upstream receiver may employ. It is convenient for service providers to employ cable modem (CM) plus channel emulator to perform these tests in-house during the product development stage. Constructing the emulator in digital technology is an attractive option for testing. This thesis approaches digital emulation by developing a digital model of the CMs and upstream channel in a DOCSIS 3. 1 network. The first step in building the emulator is to simulate its operations in MATLAB, specifically upstream transmission over the network. The MATLAB model is capable of simulating transmission from multiple CMs, each of which transmits using a specific “transmission mode. ” The three transmission modes described in the DOCSIS 3. 1 standard are included in the model. These modes are “traffic mode,” which is used during regular data transmission; “fine ranging mode,” which is used to perform fine timing and power offset corrections; and “probing” mode, which is presumably used for estimating the frequency response of the channel, but also is used to further correct the timing and power offsets. The MATLAB model is also capable of simulating the channel impairments a signal may encounter when traversing the upstream channel. Impairments that are specific to individual CMs include integer and fractional timing offsets, micro-reflections, carrier phase offset (CPO), fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO), and network gain/attenuation. Impairments common to all CMs include carrier <b>hum</b> <b>modulation,</b> AM/FM ingress noise, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). It is the hope that the MATLAB scripts that make up the simulation be translated to Verilog HDL to implement the emulator on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in the near future. In the event that an FPGA implementation is pursued, research was conducted into designing efficient fractional delay filters (FDFs), which are essential in the simulation of micro-reflections. After performing an FPGA implementation cost analysis between various FDF designs, it was determined that a Kaiser-windowed sinc function FDF with roll-off parameter β = 3. 88 was the most cost-efficient choice, requiring at total of 24 multipliers when implemented using an optimized structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: By {{means of}} fMRI measurements, {{the present study}} {{identifies}} brain regions in left and right peri-sylvian areas that subserve grammatical or prosodic processing. Normal volunteers heard 1) normal sentences; 2) so-called syntactic sentences comprising syntactic, but no lexical-semantic information; and 3) manipulated speech signals comprising only prosodic information, i. e., speech melody. For all conditions, significant blood oxygenation signals were recorded from the supratemporal plane bilaterally. Left hemisphere areas that surround Heschl gyrus responded more strongly during the two sentence conditions than to speech melody. This finding suggests that the anterior and posterior portions of the superior temporal region (STR) support lexical-semantic and syntactic aspects of sentence processing. In contrast, the right superior temporal region, in especially the planum temporale, responded more strongly to speech melody. Significant brain activation in the fronto-opercular cortices was observed when participants heard pseudo sentences and was strongest during the speech melody condition. In contrast, the fronto-opercular area is not prominently involved in listening to normal sentences. Thus, the functional activation in fronto-opercular regions increases as the grammatical information available in the sentence decreases. Generally, brain responses to speech melody were stronger in right than left hemisphere sites, suggesting aparticular role of right cortical areas in the processing of slow prosodic <b>modulations.</b> <b>Hum...</b>|$|R
