40|$|Background: Free colon and jejunal flaps {{have been}} {{described}} as reliable and safe conduits for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction. Compared with free co-lon flaps, free jejunum flaps have a smaller diameter and intrinsic peristaltic movement, both of which are considered possible causes of dysphagia. In this investigation, the authors evaluated motility differences in free jejunum and colon flaps using radionuclide <b>esophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy.</b> Methods: Patients who received free jejunum flaps (n 12) or free colon (n 1) or ileocolon flaps (n 13) for reconstruction after pharyngoesophagectomy for cancer were included.

It also is a quantitative and qualitative method; gives information unavailable by other means {{and can be used}} as a screening test. The objective of this retrospective study was to analyze dynamic <b>esophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> in patients with esophageal dysmotility employing systematically the following parameters: total transit time, curve pattern and residual activity, stomach entry form, time for initial entry in stomach, presence of chaotic movements and curve variation factor and compare the results with a control group. Population studied was 55 controls and 611 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion or confirmed diagnosis of primary or secondary esophageal motor dysfunction. Results of commom parameters were in accordance with literature. Conclusion: the parameters used could clearly discriminate patients in a very simple way that can be used anywhere.

40|$|Objectives: Esophageal {{complications}} {{are common}} in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The relationship between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) symptoms and dysmotility was examined in endoscopically confirmed patients suspected of having reflux esophagitis. Methods: A total of 32 patients with limited and diffuse type SSc (lSSc, dSSc) were examined based on a structured questionnaire score (QS) of GER symptoms, retention fraction of <b>esophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> at 90 s (R 90) and gastric emptying time. Results: The QS was significantly higher in the reflux esophagitis group than in the non-esophagitis group (5. 4 ± 3. 5, 1. 4 ± 2. 9, P = 0. 003). When the non-esophagitis group was further divided into lSSc and dSSc groups, R 90 was higher in the reflux esophagitis group (31 ± 18 %) and the non-esophagitis group with dSSc (34 ± 32 %) than in the non-esophagitis group with lSSc (8 ± 3 %, P = 0. 02). Both high R 90 ≥ 15 % and QS ≥ 4 indicated reflux esophagitis. Conversely, both normal R 90 and QS indicated no reflux esophagitis. Conclusion: A combination of <b>esophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> and structured questionnaire demonstrated different aspects of esophageal dysfunction, namely dysmotility and GER.

40|$|Disorders of {{the upper}} {{digestive}} tract have a high impact on modern society, {{in terms of both}} direct and indirect health care costs and of social burden. The most common presenting symptom is either dysphagia or dyspepsia. Discriminating specific diagnoses within this wide group of diseases requires sound clinical judgment and application of procedures to distinguish organic from nonorganic disease and to further characterize the functional or motility disturbance of nonorganic diseases. Non-radionuclide-based diagnostic techniques include both noninvasive tests (upper gastrointestinal barium series, ultrasonography, and breath test for gastric emptying) and invasive procedures (fiberoptic endoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, pharyngeal manometry, stationary esophageal manometry, 24 -h pH monitoring, esophageal biliary reflux monitoring, multichannel intraluminal impedance, and electrogastrography). Some of these techniques are not well tolerated by patients or not widely available. Radionuclide transit/emptying scintigraphy provides a means of characterizing exquisite functional abnormalities with a set of low-cost procedures that are easy to perform and widely available, entail a low radiation burden, closely reflect the physiology of the tract under evaluation, are well tolerated and require minimum cooperation by patients, and provide quantitative data for better intersubject comparison and for monitoring response to therapy. Despite the relatively low degree of standardization both in the scintigraphic technique per se and in image processing, these methods have shown excellent diagnostic performance in several function or motility disorders {{of the upper}} digestive tract. Dynamic scintigraphy with a radioactive liquid or semisolid bolus provides important information on both the oropharyngeal and the esophageal phases of swallowing, thus representing a useful complement or even a valid alternative to conventional invasive tests (such as stationary esophageal manometry) for evaluating abnormalities of oropharyngoesophageal transit. Clinical applications of <b>esophageal</b> transit <b>scintigraphy</b> include disorders such as nutcracker esophagus, esophageal spasm, noncardiac chest pain of presumed esophageal origin, achalasia, esophageal involvement of scleroderma, and gastroesophageal reflux and monitoring of response to therapy (either medical or surgical treatment of disease-for example, organic disease such as <b>esophageal</b> cancer). <b>Scintigraphy</b> with a radiolabeled test meal represents the gold standard for evaluating gastric emptying, whereas more recent radionuclide methods include dynamic antral scintigraphy and gastric SPECT for assessing gastric accommodation. Clinical applications of gastric-emptying scintigraphy include, among others, evaluation of patients with dyspepsia and evaluation of gastric function in various systemic diseases affecting gastric emptying. The present review includes the proposal of clinical algorithms for evaluating patients with the main disorders of the upper digestive tract. These algorithms, originally derived from available literature, have been developed {{on the basis of a}} vast clinical experience in conjunction with the specialists more deeply involved in the care of patients with such disorders (medical and surgical gastroenterologists and nuclear medicine physicians). The role of radionuclide gastroesophageal motor studies is clearly identified in the various steps of patients' management, from the initial diagnostic approach to functional characterization to postoperative follow-up or monitoring of medical therapy...|$|R

We used X 2 or Fischer test for investigating the dependencebetween two nominal variables and Pearson and Spearman coefficient for two continuous variables. Results: Ultrasonography determined that female sex is correlated with a more severe GER (r=- 0. 4;p= 0. 02). There was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of GER estimated duringscintigraphy and during ultrasonography (r= 0. 755; p< 0. 001).

In {{the majority of the}} patients, the cardia was not mobilized, and the myotomy was extended in length for about 10 cm (8 cm on the esophagus and 2 cm on the stomach). There was no operative mortality. Two patients (0. 9 %) required reoperation due to bleeding from the myotomy site in one and leakage from the gastrotomy site in the other. One hundred ninety-three patients entered the follow-up study and were followed up from 12 to 144 months (median, 64. 5 months). Five patients died during the follow-up of unrelated diseases, and in one patient, an esophageal cancer infiltrating the trachea was discovered 26 months after the operation. Clinical results were excellent or good in 93. 8 % of the patients, and fair in 2. 6 %. Disabling dysphagia recurred in seven patients (3. 6 %), six of whom required pneumatic dilation for relief and one patient who underwent reoperation because of a paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Postoperative roentgenographic studies showed a significant reduction in the mean value of the maximal esophageal diameter. Esophageal manometry showed a significant reduction of lower esophageal sphincter pressure and length over preoperative values.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Estudar a associação entre alterações capilaroscópicas e lesões em órgãos-alvo na esclerose sistêmica (ES). MÉTODOS: Noventa e um pacientes com ES foram avaliados através de entrevista, exame físico, capilaroscopia periungueal (CPU), sorologia, provas de função pulmonar, cintilografia de trânsito esofágico, ecocardiografia com Doppler e tomografia computadorizada de alta resolução pulmonar (TCAR). A deleção capilar na CPU foi avaliada usando o escore de deleção {{vascular}} de Lee; consideraram-se alterações severas na CPU um escore médio de deleção > 1 ou número médio de megacapilares por dedo > 1 para fins de análise. Hipertensão arterial pulmonar (HAP) foi definida como pressão sistólica na artéria pulmonar > 40 mmHg. RESULTADOS: Pacientes com alterações capilaroscópicas severas apresentaram maior prevalência de áreas de opacidades em vidro-fosco (OVF) (P= 0, 016), redução da capacidade difusional pulmonar (P= 0, 026) e disfunção esofágica (P= 0, 001). HAP ocorreu somente em pacientes com alterações severas na CPU (P= 0, 114). Naqueles com duração de doença OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the}} association of capillaroscopic alterations with end-organ damage in systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: Ninety-one SSc patients were studied through interview, physical examination, nailfold capillary microscopy (NCM), serology, pulmonary function tests, <b>esophageal</b> transit <b>scintigraphy,</b> Doppler echocardiography and pulmonary highresolution computed tomography (HRCT). Capillary loss on NCM was evaluated using the avascular score (AS); patients with mean AS = 1 or mean number of megacapillaries per finger = 1 were considered to have severe capillaroscopic alterations for analytical purposes. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was defined as systolic pulmonary arterial pressure = 40 mmHg. RESULTS: Patients with severe NCM alterations had greater prevalence of ground-glass opacities (GGO) areas (P= 0. 016), reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity (P= 0. 026) and esophageal dysfunction (P= 0. 001). PAH was present only in patients with severe NCM abnormalities (P= 0. 114). In those with disease duration = 5 years, GGO were present in 14 of 19 patients with severe NCM alterations, but were absent in all patients (n= 8) with no or mild NCM alterations (P< 0. 001).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to discriminate patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) from healthy subjects by <b>esophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> with a semisolid meal. Methods: We studied 32 patients with primary RP, 18 with SSc and 13 healthy subjects. Dysphagia, acid rÃ©gurgitationand heartburn were scored. After an overnight fast, all subjects underwent <b>esophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> using a semisolid orally ingested bolus (10 ml apple puree) labeled with 99 mTc-sulfurcolloid. Esophageal transit and emptying time and integral value were evaluated with the subjects in the upright (sitting) and supine positions. Transit time was defined as the time from the entry of 50 % of radioactivity into the upper esophagus until the clearance of 50 % of the bolus from the whole esophagus. Emptying time was defined as the time from the entry of 50 % of radioactivity into the upper esophagus, until the clearance of 100 % of the bolus from the whole esophagus. Integral value was defined as the total counts under the time-activity curve normalized to the maximum. Results: Esophageal transit and emptying time and integral value, evaluated in both positions, were significantly higher in patients with SSc than in healthy subjects and than in patients with RP. Moreover, patients with RP had all three parameters, assessed in supine position, significantly longer compared to healthy subjects. Clinical scores regarding dysphagia, acid rÃ©gurgitationand heartburn were not significantly different between patients with RP and SSc.

40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} {{is a rare}} {{connective tissue}} disease, distinctive features of which are fibrosis and microangiopathy. The esophagus {{is one of the}} most commonly involved internal organs. Most patients experience dysphagia, difficulties in swallowing and gastro-esophageal reflux. However, in up to one third of cases, the initial onset of esophageal disease may be clinically silent. There are several diagnostic modalities available for assessing both morphological and functional abnormalities of the esophagus. If structural abnormalities are suspected, endoscopy is the method of choice. Functional evaluation is best achieved with manometry. Both endoscopy and manometry are invasive techniques, with low patient acceptance.

A total of 57 patients were analysed within a median follow-up of 8. 2 years. No premedication was used, dilatation was performed up to the pain treshold, while introduction and positioning of a dilatator was done in combination of endoscopic and radiological control. Dilatation effect was estimated by both Kim Symptom Scoring and objective parameters: body weight rise and radiological scintigraphic findings. Results. Excellent and good results were obtained in 50 (88 %) of the patients, while in 7 (12 %) of the patients surgery was performed.

METHODS: From February 1979 to October 2000, 176 patients with achalasia underwent modified Heller's myotomy, including esophageal myotomy alone in 146 patients, myotomy in combination with Gallone or Dor antireflux procedure in 22 and 8 patients, respectively. Clinical score, pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), esophageal clearance rate and gastroesophageal reflux were determined before and 1 to 22 years after surgery. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 14 years, 84. 5 % of patients had a good or excellent relief of symptoms, and clinical scores as well as resting pressures of the esophageal body and LES were reduced compared with preoperative values (P< 0. 001). However, {{there was no significant}} difference in DeMeester score between pre- and postoperative patients (P= 0. 51). Esophageal transit was improved in postoperative patients, but still slower than that in normal controls. The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in patients who underwent esophageal myotomy alone was 63. 6 % compared to 27. 3 % in those who underwent myotomy and antireflux procedure (P= 0. 087). Three (1. 7 %) patients were complicated with esophageal cancer after surgery. CONCLUSION: Esophageal myotomy for achalasia can reduce the resting pressures of the esophageal body and LES and improve esophageal transit and dysphagia. Myotomy in combination with antireflux procedure can prevent gastroesophageal reflux to a certain extent, but further randomized studies should be carried out to demonstrate its efficacy.
