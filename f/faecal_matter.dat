25|$|Since 5β-coprostanol {{is formed}} from {{cholesterol}} in the vertebrate gut, {{the ratio of}} the product over reactant can be used to indicate the degree of <b>faecal</b> <b>matter</b> in samples. Raw untreated sewage typically has a 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol ratio of ~10 which decreases through a sewage treatment plant (STP) such that in the discharged liquid wastewaters the ratio is ~2. Undiluted STP wastewaters may be identified by this high ratio. As the <b>faecal</b> <b>matter</b> is dispersed in the environment, the ratio will decrease as more (non-faecal) cholesterol from animals is encountered. Grimalt & Albaiges have suggested that samples with a 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol greater than 0.2 may be considered as contaminated by faecal material.|$|E
50|$|The first {{intermediate}} hosts include freshwater snails of {{the genus}} Bithynia. The only known host is Bithynia siamensis (that include all its three subspecies). Snails are infected by the free-swimming larvae called miracidia in water bodies where <b>faecal</b> <b>matters</b> of infected mammals are deposited. Inside the snail tissue, the miracidia grow into sposocysts, that contains spore-like daughter cells. The daughter cells called rediae that multiply an develop into numerous larvae called cercariae. Each cercaria has a large head and a long tail. The cercariae escape from the snail and enter the water body again as free-swimming larvae. Their tails act as a propeller for swimming and actively search for a fish host.|$|R

The Internal Drainage Basin runs southward from the border with Kenya to central Tanzania (Fig.  1).

Bowell et al. (1997) reported high nitrate concentration region reaching 180  mg/l which positively correlated significantly with coliform counts of the groundwater samples collected from Manyara and Arusha. Such high nitrate concentration associated with positive correlation with coliform counts reflects contamination originating from human and animal <b>faecal</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|R

Using the microbiological analysis we tried to establish the effectiveness of total coliforms, faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli in detecting pollution of surface waters. We found that E. coli levels steadily increased downstream from Šabac (location 1; 2100 MPN per 100 mL) to Belgrade (location 3; 10000 MPN per 100 mL). To prevent bacterial contamination, it is necessary to reduce the discharge of wastewater with <b>faecal</b> <b>matters</b> near highly populated towns. Heavy metal levels in sediments correlated with those in the river water. Fluctuations attributed mainly to anthropogenic sources were not high.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between average daily gain and the number of Lawsonia intracellularis bacteria in faeces of growing pigs with different levels of diarrhoea. Methods A longitudinal field study (n [*]=[*] 150 pigs) was performed in a Danish herd from day 29 to 47 post weaning. Every third day all pigs were weighed, subjected to a clinical examination and faecal samples were obtained. Faecal samples were subjected to dry matter determination and absolute quantification by PCR for L. intracellularis and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2). Association between average daily gain, <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> content, numbers of L. intracellularis bacteria and PCV 2 genome copies in faeces was investigated in a multilevel mixed-effects linear model.

40|$|The {{dry matter}} content of 245 faecal samples of 81 species of captive wild {{ruminants}} was investigated. Samples were taken from 10 different zoos from temperate climate during the winter months. All animals had ad libitum access to drinking water. Species were classified as frugivores (FR, n = 5), browsers (BR, n = 16), intermediate feeders (IM, n = 35), and grazers (GR, n = 25). While no difference was observed in the average <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> content between the feeding types, the range of {{dry matter content}}s increased continually from FR, BR, IM to GR, ie both the driest and the wettest faeces {{of this study were}} produced by grazing ruminants. As {{it has been shown that}} <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> content is a function of the length of the colon descendens of a ruminant species, these results can be interpreted as an indication of a relatively limited variation in anatomical design in this respect in the evolutionary older FR and BR, and a relatively larger variation in anatomical design - and probably niche adaptation - in IM and GR. This corresponds to the greater range of habitat niches that IM and GR manage to occupy. Due to this increased variation in the anatomical design of the lower hindgut, GR are regarded as "morphophysiologically progressive ruminants", in contrast to BR which are regarded as "morphophysiologically conservative ruminants"...|$|R
40|$|Giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) are {{specialized}} insectivores {{and consume}} mainly ants and termites in the wild. In captivity, giant anteaters are either fed a complete diet, {{or a combination}} of a domestic carnivore diet with leaf eater pellets, or a traditional gruel-type diet. Soft faeces are a frequently encountered problem with this type of feeding. In the present study, we analysed diet and faeces composition, calculated digestibility and measured mean retention time on various diets in eight giant anteaters (total of n = 64 experiments). The results suggest that the digestive physiology of giant anteaters {{is similar to that of}} domestic dogs and cats in terms of nutrient digestibility and digesta retention. When testing correlations between <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> content and other variables, no relationship with dietary crude fibre content or mean digesta retention time could be detected. However, acid insoluble ash intake was significantly and positively correlated with <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> content. The amount of acid insoluble ash excreted with the faeces was higher than that ingested with the diet offered, indicating that the giant anteaters ingested soil from their enclosure of up to 93 g per day. This finding is consistent with observation of faeces of wild giant anteaters that contain soil or sand most likely due to indiscriminate feeding. It also corresponds to reports that indigestible materials such as peat, soil, chitin or cellulose contribute to a firmer faecal consistency in various carnivore species. Therefore, offering giant anteaters the opportunity to voluntarily ingest soil from their enclosure might be beneficial...|$|R

Objectives To investigate the effect of a management change from pasture with no controlled exercise to stabling with light exercise on aspects of gastrointestinal function related to large colon impaction. The hypothesis was that drinking water intake, faecal output, faecal water content and large intestinal motility would be altered by a transition from a pastured to a stabled regime. Study design Within-subject management intervention trial involving changes in feeding and exercise using noninvasive techniques. Methods Seven normal horses were evaluated in a within-subjects study design. Horses were monitored while at pasture 24 [*]h/day, and for 14 days following a transition to a stabling regime with light controlled exercise. Drinking water intake, faecal output and <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> were measured. Motility of the caecum, sternal flexure and left colon (contractions/min) were measured twice daily by transcutaneous ultrasound.

The diets contained six levels of the enzyme at 0, 2000 units, 4000 units, 6000 units, 8000 units and 10, 000 units/kg diet making diet /treatments (1 - 6). The zero level served as the control. The diets were fed to fingerlings of Nile tilapia (6. 23 ? 0. 1) at 5 % of their body weight, twice daily, for 63 days. At {{the end of the}} experiment, fish carcass (whole body) and the <b>faecal</b> <b>matters</b> were analyzed for mineral composition. Results showed no significant differences in the growth and nutrient utilization of the fish fed all the diets. All the fish fed diets that contained phytase had better (P> 0. 05) growth and nutrient utilization indices than the fish fed diet without phytase. Similarly, the apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) for protein and gross energy (GE) of fish fed diets with phytase were higher (P> 0. 05) than the ADC for protein and ADC for GE of the fish fed diet without phytase. The fish fed diet with 8000 units of phytase/ kg diet had the best mean weight gain, specific growth rate, food conversion ratio, ADC for protein, lipid and GE compared with the fish fed every other diet. The mineral composition (Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Zn, Mn) in all the fish fed the different diets were similar (P> 0. 05),. though some of the group of fish fed diets that contained phytase had marginally higher mineral concentration than in the fish fed diet without phytase.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the retch wire screen as a potential tool for collecting feces from water, by comparing its apparent digestibility estimates {{with that of the}} conventional stripping method. The retch wire screen is designed as a wire mesh for collecting or trapping feces that is removed from the tank along with the outlet water. The slots between the wire screens allow the passage of the outlet water while the trapped feces are collected from the wire screens for analysis. Three different diets with fishmeal, soybean meal and rapeseed meal were produced by extrusion. The diets were fed once a day to triplicate groups of rainbow trout with an average weight of 120 grams, reared in 14 oC freshwater. The experiment lasted for 22 days. Feces were obtained by careful stripping from the distal abdomen and collected from the wire screen 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes past feeding. <b>Faecal</b> dry <b>matter,</b> organic matter, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) were analysed in diets and freeze dried feces samples, and apparent digestibilities (AD) were calculated. AD estimates of organic matter, nitrogen and sulphur obtained by collecting feces on the wire mesh collector were higher than AD estimates obtained by the stripping method, except for some values obtained for AD of carbon. This shows that leaching of nutrients from the feces was immediate. Compared to this initial leaching of nutrients, the leaching loss caused by prolonged collection times from 15 to 240 minutes was small. The percentage difference observed in AD estimate between stripping and feces collected with the retch wire screen were lower than values reported in previous methods of feces collection from water media. The relative ranking of the apparent digestibility among the 3 diets in the ANOVA analysis showed the same statistical ranking, and this may facilitate use of the tool, eventually by the employment of a correction factor. There were significant differences observed in the <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> among the diets for both methods of faecal collection. Soybean meal showed the lowest <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> among the diets. AD of nitrogen was significantly higher for the soybean meal diet than for the fishmeal diet when feces were obtained by stripping. Soybean meal also gave the highest estimates of nitrogen AD for feces collection at all the time intervals while rapeseed meal recorded the lowest Nitrogen AD. Rapeseed meal also showed the poorest digestibility in both methods of faecal collection for organic matter, carbon and sulphur. Sulphur AD obtained with the rapeseed meal diet by the stripping method was particularly low (54. 7 %), compared to the fishmeal and soybean meal diets that had 72. 4 and 70. 1 % respectively. The likely reason for this was attributed to low digestibility of sulphur containing amino acids in the rapeseed, possibly due to antinutrient factors...|$|R

Imidocarb {{is an effective}} treatment of piroplasmosis, but adverse clinical signs, including colic and diarrhoea, from cholinesterase inhibition are associated with its use. Atropine is advocated {{for the treatment of}} cholinesterase inhibiting compounds. Atropine is known to have a prolonged inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility. Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic drug that has similar effects to atropine on gastrointestinal motility, but with decreased penetration of blood-brain and blood-aqueous barrier. This study was performed to assess the adverse clinical effects of a therapeutic dose of imidocarb, the effect of this dose on gastrointestinal motility, and on cholinesterase activity. The ability of atropine or glycopyrrolate to ameliorate imidocarb’s adverse clinical signs, and the effect of the combination of atropine and imidocarb or glycopyrrolate and imidocarb on gastrointestinal motility was evaluated. A blinded crossover trial was performed in 8 horses. All horses were administered saline (CON), imidocarb 2. 4 mg/kg im and saline iv (IMI), imidocarb 2. 4 mg/kg im and atropine 0. 02 mg/kg iv (IMATROP) and imidocarb 2. 4 mg/kg im and glycopyrrolate 2. 5 µg/kg iv (IMGLYCO), with a one week wash-out period between treatments. Butrylcholinesterase activity was measured in the CON and IMI group. Clinical signs, gastrointestinal motility and faecal production were assessed. Gastrointestinal motility was measured by abdominal auscultation and frequency of contractions in the duodenum, caecum and right dorsal colon visualized with transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound. Total faecal production, <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter,</b> wet <b>matter,</b> <b>faecal</b> water percentage, frequency of defaecation and time to first defaecation was assessed. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea were observed in the IMI group. Borborygmi and frequency of intestinal contractions were not different in the IMI group compared to CON. Percentage water content, faecal production, <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> and frequency of defaecation were significantly increased in the IMI group. Butrylcholinesterase activity was not significantly decreased in the IMI group compared to CON. In the IMATROP group colic signs were observed, heart rate was significantly elevated and mydriasis was evident. Borborygmi and frequency of contractions in the right dorsal colon was significantly reduced in the IMATROP group. In the IMGLYCO group the incidence and severity of colic induced by imidocarb was reduced. Heart rate was significantly increased and borborygmi significantly decreased compared to CON. The effect of IMGLYCO on heart rate and borborygmi was significantly less than the effect of IMATROP. In the IMGLYCO group the frequency of ultrasound visualised intestinal contractions and faecal variables were not different from CON. Therapeutic doses of imidocarb are associated with clinical signs of muscarinic stimulation including colic and diarrhoea, and enhanced faecal production. Clinical signs of cholinesterase inhibition can be present without significant depression in plasma cholinesterase activity. Atropine prevents diarrhoea and normalises faecal water percentage but is not effective in decreasing incidence of abdominal pain, and causes a prolonged inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, which might make this drug undesirable to use as a pre-treatment to imidocarb in clinically affected horses. Glycopyrrolate only partially reduces gastrointestinal motility and decreases adverse signs and thus its use as a pre-treatment to imidocarb is preferred.

Inorganic nitrogen in freshwaters occurs in three different forms, namely ammonia, nitrates and nitrites. Agricultural as well as horticultural land practices in the immediate catchment has a direct effect on the nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water body whose loading may lead to nutrient enrichment and the deterioration of the water quality (Harding et al. 1999; Cuffney et al. 2000). Higher concentration of these nitrogenous forms is attributed to the use of fertilizers in and around the lakes and the addition of <b>faecal</b> <b>matters</b> and other effluents from human habitation. Higher quantities of ammoniacal nitrogen were recorded during the winter which is an outcome of ammonification and slow rate of nitrification process.

On the basis of annual mean levels of ammoniacal nitrogen, site VI ranked the highest, followed by sites III, I, V, IV and II in decreasing order. Site VI lying on the Wular periphery catchment has the maximum agricultural (r[*]=[*] 0.580) as well as horticultural land (r[*]=[*] 0.919), depicting collinear relationship of ammoniacal nitrogen with the aforesaid parameters (Harding et al. 1999; Cuffney et al. 2000). The concentration and rate of supply of nitrate nitrogen are intimately connected with the land use practices of the surrounding watershed (Horne and Goldman 1994). Higher values of the plant nutrient may be attributed to the agricultural run-off bringing with it NO 3 -rich fertilizers. Phosphorous, like nitrogen, is an important factor which plays a pivotal role in determining the productivity of water bodies. As far as the catchment characteristics of the study sites are concerned, it seems that agricultural land and horticultural land besides built up are the major contributors for the increasing values of nitrogen and phosphorus, thereby signalling positive correlation among the study sites in Wular Lake. Vollenweider (1972) has pointed that phosphorus, being a limiting factor, plays a key role in the eutrophication of the water bodies. The low orthophosphate-phosphorous content in waters is due to the formation of an insoluble calcium-phosphate complex. Such a phenomenon functions as scavenger of some inorganic nutrients and also acts as a removal agent of dissolved organic matter by absorption (Wetzel and Otsuki 1974). Phosphorous enters freshwater from atmospheric precipitation, groundwater and surface run-off from a highly fertilized catchment area. The seasonal dynamics showed that the concentration of phosphorous in Wular Lake was less in summer which is attributed to uptake by the plants during the main growing season. This is in agreement with the previous findings of Cole (1975), Kaul et al. (1978) and Pandit (1980, 1999, 2002).|$|R

In all three isomalt treatments slightly less than 0. 40 of the isomalt consumed was digested in the small intestine when the calculations were based on ileal sugar passage. However, when basing the calculations on energy contents of ileal chyme, only approximately 0. 10 was digested in the small intestine. The bacterial fermentation of the isomalt flowing into the large intestine was indicated by a decreased faecal energy digestibility and a slight reduction in <b>faecal</b> dry <b>matter</b> and nitrogen digestibility. The retention of the minerals sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus was not influenced to any measurable extent when isomalt was fed.
