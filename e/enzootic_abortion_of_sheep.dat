40|$|The {{immunobiology}} <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> ewes (EAE) is incompletely understood. The causative {{agent is}} Chlamydia psittaci, which infects many ruminant species and has zoonotic potential.

It has been postulated that the organism persists in the host entering at a latent phase, possibly mediated by host cytokine production. The effects of cytokines on chlamydial multiplication vary between host species, between different cell types within those species and also vary between chlamydial species and strains. The multiplication of the EAE strain of C. psittaci in ovine ST- 6 cells can be restricted by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not with comparable concentrations of IFN-alpha. Altering the nutrient composition of the cultures by addition of tryptophan partially reverses the antichlamydial effects of the IFN-gamma. This offers a potential mechanism by which C. psittaci can persist in <b>sheep.</b> The implications <b>of</b> these observations for the pathogenesis of EAE are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chlamydia psittaci is a {{major cause}} <b>of</b> ovine <b>abortion</b> in the fourth to fifth months of gestation. During the lambing seasons of 1986, 1987, and 1988, fetuses from 52 cases <b>of</b> ovine <b>abortion,</b> stillbirth, or {{perinatal}} death were submitted to the laboratory for necropsy examination. Placenta or fetal tissues from 34 cases were cultured on mouse L cells for C. psittaci. Chlamydia psittaci was identified by immunofluorescence on cultures in 20 of these cases. The major gross lesion consistently associated with Chlamydial abortion was placentitis with multifocal cotyledonary necrosis and accumulation of red-brown exudate in the intercotyledonary placenta Chlamydiae appeared as spherical organisms, less than 1 µm in diameter, in the cytoplasm of tropho-blasts in impression smears of cotyledons. H istologically, placentitis was sometimes accompanied by pneumonia or encephalitis in the fetus. Chlamydia psittaci was considered the cause for fetal death when Chlamydial isolation was associated with placentitis or inflammation of other fetal tissues and when other abortifacient agents were not detected. <b>Enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> ewes (EAE) was first described in Scotland in 1936, 9 but it was 1950 before Stamp identified Chlamydia psittaci as the etiologic agent?

In the present study, a recently developed test, based on a recombinant fragment of the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 (rOMP 90 - 4 indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [iELISA]) and one based on the variable segment 2 (VS 2) region of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) (MOMP VS 2 iELISA) were compared using sera from C. abortus-infected ewes at different stages throughout pregnancy. The rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody much earlier in pregnancy than the MOMP iELISA, which, like the complement fixation test, detected antibody only at the time <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> or lambing. No anti-MOMP antibody response could be detected in three of seven experimentally infected ewes. Furthermore, the rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody in an animal that seroconverted during the course of the study, which the MOMP iELISA failed to detect. Overall, the results show that the rOMP 90 - 4 iELISA is considerably more sensitive than the MOMP VS 2 iELISA for identifying animals infected with C. abortus. Earlier detection of infection will allow appropriate control measures to be taken to reduce environmental contamination, thus limiting the spread of infection, financial losses, and the possible risks of zoonotic transmission to humans...|$|R

In the present study, a series of overlapping recombinant antigens representing the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 of C. abortus was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a panel of 143 serum samples from sheep experimentally infected with C. abortus, from <b>sheep</b> clinically free <b>of</b> OEA, and from specific-pathogen-free lambs experimentally infected with different subtypes of C. pecorum. The results were compared to those obtained by CFT and another recently described test, an indirect ELISA (iELISA) with the recombinant OMP 91 B (rOMP 91 B) fragment (rOMP 91 B iELISA) (D. Longbottom, E. Psarrou, M. Livingstone, and E. Vretou, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 195 : 157 - 161, 2001). The rOMP 90 - 3 and rOMP 90 - 4 ELISAs were identified as being more sensitive and specific than CFT.

However, the ELISA with the rOMP 90 - 4 fragment appeared to be more sensitive than the one with rOMP 90 - 3, as it identified more of the OEA-positive samples. The ELISA with the rOMP 90 - 4 fragment was also able to identify apparently healthy animals that were infected with an enteric strain of C. abortus in flocks that were probably infected with both enteric C. abortus and C. pecorum strains. The identification of animals infected with enteric C. abortus is extremely important in controlling the spread of OEA. Overall, the new rOMP 90 - 4 ELISA was found to be a more sensitive and specific test than CFT for differentiating animals infected with C. abortus from those infected with C. pecorum...|$|R
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in <b>sheep</b> are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|R
40|$|Pregnant ewes were {{challenged}} with Chlamydia abortus at 91 - 98 days of gestation and euthanised at 14, 21 and 28 days post-challenge. IFNγ mRNA labelling {{appeared to}} be co-localised with Chlamydial lipopolysaccharide within trophoblast cells in discrete areas lining the primary villi in the limbus and hilar zone of the placentomes from challenged sheep on days 21 and 28 post-infection. The presence of IFNγ was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. No labelling was seen in tissues from the non-infected ewes. The presence of IFNγ in trophoblast cells from infected ewes may indicate an attempt to restrict the replication of the organism and be an important trigger for the inflammatory responses that develop on the fetal side of the placenta in <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Campylobacter {{species are}} a {{significant}} cause <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>abortion</b> in most sheep-raising countries. In New Zealand, Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus {{is the leading cause}} <b>of</b> diagnosed <b>sheep</b> <b>abortion</b> and the species C. jejuni and C. coli have also been implicated. To date, strain typing information <b>of</b> C. jejuni <b>sheep</b> <b>abortion</b> isolates is limited. The objective {{of the present study was}} to genotype C. jejuni isolates cultured from sheep abortions submitted to diagnostic laboratories in New Zealand during the 2000 breeding season, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In this study, C. jejuni isolates were cultured from approximately 10 % of farms from which Campylobacter species were isolated from sheep abortions in the year 2000. This equated to 25 C. jejuni isolates from 21 farms. These isolates were obtained from the veterinary diagnostic laboratories and strain typed using the molecular typing technique PFGE. Ten distinct PFGE types were identified amongst the isolates. No particular PFGE type was found most frequently amongst these C. jejuni sheep abortion isolates. However, indistinguishable or similar C. jejuni PFGE types were identified from different aborted foetuses from the same flock, consistent with the role of C. jejuni as an infectious cause <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in <b>sheep.</b> These strain types were similar or indistinguishable from C. jejuni sheep abortion isolates obtained in 1999 in a smaller study (Mannering, S.

40|$|The serum {{levels of}} calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc and iron and of nitric oxide, retinol, and β-carotene were {{determined}} in Sakiz ewes that had experienced an abortion and in healthy controls. Ten healthy and 25 aborted Sakiz sheep {{were selected from}} Afyon zone in western Turkey. Their ages ranged between 2 and 4  years weighing between 40 and 60  kg {{at the time of}} experiment. All <b>of</b> the <b>abortions</b> occurred in October. The concentrations of retinol, β-carotene, phosphorus, and zinc were significantly lower and those of calcium and nitric oxide were increased in aborted ewes relative to healthy controls. The serum levels of iron, copper, and magnesium were not significantly different among the two groups. In conclusion, abortion is an important problem in commercially important species of ruminants in many regions in the tropics including of western Turkey. Deficiencies of retinol, β-carotene, phosphorus and zinc, and the increase of calcium and nitric oxide concentration may {{play an important role in}} the etiology <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in ewes.

50|$|By the 1940s {{over half}} a million doses of vaccine and {{treatment}} products were produced and distributed by Moredun. Research gained momentum and further funding was secured {{to find out the}} causes of many different diseases such as: scrapie, pine, milk fever, Johne’s disease and a range of respiratory and reproductive disorders. Vaccines, diagnostics and treatment strategies followed. Today, many of the veterinary medicines and vaccines that are routinely used on farms have been researched, developed or tested at Moredun. This research is vital - 17% of the value <b>of</b> the UK <b>sheep</b> industry is lost each year due to infectious diseases. Subclinical infections of gut parasites are estimated to cost the UK sheep industry over £84 million a year in lost production. <b>Enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> in ewes is thought to cost the UK sheep industry £15 million a year and Johne’s disease costs the UK cattle industry £13 million a year. Ninety years on, and still governed by farmers, Moredun’s mission to improve animal health and welfare remains strong and Moredun continues to apply cutting edge science and technology to help protect both livestock and people, today and tomorrow.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Toluidine blue {{staining}} {{was used}} to detect Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells from clinical specimens. This method was more sensitive than iodine staining for detecting C trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells and also more sensitive than Giemsa staining for detecting chlamydial inclusions in HeLa- 229 cells. While its sensitivity for detection of chlamydial inclusions in McCoy cells is {{equal to that of}} Giemsa staining, toluidine blue staining is easier and faster to perform. Different staining methods have been used to detect chlamydial inclusions in cell cultures. Giemsa stain-ing followed by dark ground microscopy has been the most commonly used technique. The glycogen matrix of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions can be detected using various stains-for example, iodine' carmine, 2 and periodic acid Schiff. 3 Iodine staining combined with bright field microscopy is probably the simplest of all staining techniques for detecting C trachomatis inclusions, but compared with Giemsa and carmine it is less sensitive. 4 Periodic acid Schiff stain is useful in that inclusions are detectable by both bright and dark field microscopy, but the actual staining technique is quite complex, as is that for carmine. 5 Methylene blue stain combined with dark field microscopy is said to be useful for the diagnosis of infection caused by the <b>enzootic</b> ovine <b>abortion</b> strain <b>of</b> C psittaci. 6 But it offers no advantage over Giemsa or iodine stains for the detection of C trachomatis inclusions. : Immunofluorescent staining 7 seems to be both fast and sensitive but it requires the use of expensive reagents. Recently, a methyl green-neutral red stain-ing technique {{has been found to be}} highly sensitive for detecting C psittaci inclusions combined with bright field microscopy. 8 It is as sensitive as Giemsa staining combined with dark field microscopy for detecting C trachomatis inclusions. We report a simple, fast technique for detecting C trachomatis inclusions using toluidine blue, effective with both bright and dark field microscopy. We have compared its sensitivity with that of Giemsa an...|$|R
