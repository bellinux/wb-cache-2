40|$|Chromatin {{dynamics}} play {{an essential}} role in regulating DNA transaction processes, but it is unclear whether transcription-associated chromatin modifications control the mRNA ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs) pipeline from synthesis to nuclear exit. Here, we identify the yeast ISW 1 chromatin remodeling complex as an unanticipated mRNP nuclear <b>export</b> <b>surveillance</b> factor that retains export-incompetent transcripts near their transcription site. This tethering activity of ISW 1 requires chromatin binding and is independent of nucleosome sliding activity or changes in RNA polymerase II processivity. Combination of in vivo UV-crosslinking and genome-wide RNA immunoprecipitation assays show that Isw 1 and its cofactors interact directly with premature mRNPs. Our results highlight that the concerted action of Isw 1 and the nuclear exosome ensures accurate surveillance mechanism that proofreads the efficiency of mRNA biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The exon {{junction}} complex (EJC) that is deposited onto spliced mRNAs upstream of exon–exon junctions plays {{important roles}} in multiple post-splicing gene expression events, such as mRNA <b>export,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> localization, and translation. However, a direct role for the human EJC in pre-mRNA splicing has not been fully understood. Using HeLa cells, we depleted one of the EJC core components, Y 14, and the resulting transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) and confirmed by RT–PCR. We found that Y 14 is required for efficient and faithful splicing {{of a group of}} transcripts that is enriched in short intron-containing genes involved in mitotic cell-cycle progression. Tethering of EJC core components (Y 14, eIF 4 AIII or MAGOH) to a model reporter pre-mRNA harboring a short intron showed that these core components are prerequisites for the splicing activation. Taken together, we conclude that the EJC core assembled on pre-mRNA is critical for efficient and faithful splicing of a specific subset of short introns in mitotic cell cycle-related genes...|$|E
40|$|Serine/arginine-rich (SR) {{proteins}} {{are required}} for messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, <b>export,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and translation. We show that in Chironomus tentans, nascent transcripts associate with multiple types of SR proteins in specific combinations. Alternative splicing factor (ASF) /SF 2, SC 35, 9 G 8, and hrp 45 /SRp 55 are all present in Balbiani ring (BR) pre-messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) preferentially when introns appear in the pre-mRNA and when cotranscriptional splicing takes place. However, hrp 45 /SRp 55 is distributed differently in the pre-mRNPs along the gene compared with ASF/SF 2, SC 35, and 9 G 8, suggesting functional differences. All four SR proteins {{are associated with the}} BR mRNPs during export to the cytoplasm. Interference with SC 35 indicates that SC 35 is important for the coordination of splicing, transcription, and 3 ′ end processing and also for nucleocytoplasmic export. ASF/SF 2 is associated with polyribosomes, whereas SC 35, 9 G 8, and hrp 45 /SRp 55 cosediment with monoribosomes. Thus, individual endogenous pre-mRNPs/mRNPs bind multiple types of SR proteins during transcription, and these SR proteins accompany the mRNA and play different roles during the gene expression pathway in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Background: At {{the end of}} 2011, a new orthobunyavirus, {{tentatively}} named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), {{was discovered}} in Germany. This virus has since been associated with clinical signs of decreased milk production, watery diarrhoea and fever in dairy cows, and subsequently also with congenital malformations in calves, lambs and goat kids. In affected countries, initial surveillance for the infection was based on examination of malformed progeny. These suspicions were followed up by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on brain tissue. For epidemiological purposes, a serological assay was, however, needed. Results: A virus neutralisation test (VNT) was developed and optimized, and subsequently evaluated. This VNT has a specificity of > 99 % and the sensitivity is likely also very close to 100 %. The assay is highly repeatable and reproducible. The final assay {{was used to test}} for antibodies in cows, ewes and does from herds known to be infected or suspected to be so. Targets for sampling in these herds were the mothers of malformed offspring. In herds with an RT-PCR confirmed SBV infection, more than 94 % (190 out of 201) of the ewes and 99 % (145 out of 146) of the cows were seropositive. In herds with suspicion of SBV infection based on birth of malformed offspring only (no or negative RT-PCR), more than 90 % (231 out of 255) of the ewes and 95 % (795 out of 834) of the cows were seropositive. In goats, on the other hand, only a low number of seropositives was found: overall 36. 4 %, being 16 out of 44 goats tested. Conclusions: Given the characteristics of this VNT, it can be used at a relative high throughput for testing of animals for <b>export,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> screening and research purposes, but can also be used as a confirmation test for commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA's) and for (relative) quantification of antibodies. Suspicions of SBV infections that were confirmed by RT-PCR were almost always confirmed by serology in cows. Due to individual registration and identification of cows and calves, affected offspring could almost always {{be traced back to the}} mother. Ewes on the other hand were not always the mothers of affected lambs, but were in many cases herd mates with unaffected lambs. This indicated a high within-herd seroprevalence of antibodies against SBV...|$|E

40|$|Australia is {{an island}} nation and a primary {{producer}} of agricultural and horticultural products. There is a large diversity of plant biosecurity threats which could adversely impact on Australia's production and <b>exports.</b> <b>Surveillance</b> has traditionally been used to monitor pests and optimise production. Increasingly surveillance is being used for early detection of exotic incursions, demonstration of eradication of incursions and pest freedom from exotic or endemic pests. These newer uses of surveillance utilise general and specific surveillance: surveillance data is maintained in electronic databases. Specific surveillance is a targeted surveillance search used by industry or state regulators for a specific pest to support pest freedom or other trade standards. The plant biosecurity surveillance cycle shows the flow of surveillance operations. In this paper, this cycle is demonstrated by case studies including pre border and the northern Australian at-border surveillance for the Australian-Asian interface. Within Australia, the multiple plant pest surveillance program was established in most capital cities where there are high flows of population and produce. As an industry example, the cotton industry surveillance program, particularly for cotton leaf curl, demonstrates how plant biosecurity surveillance operates within an industry.

40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} nucleolus {{is involved}} in ribosome biogenesis and {{a wide range of}} other RNA metabolism and cellular functions. An important step in the functional analysis of the nucleolus is to determine the complement of proteins of this nuclear compartment. Here, we describe the first proteomic analysis of plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) nucleoli, in which we have identified 217 proteins. This allows a direct comparison of the proteomes of an important nuclear structure between two widely divergent species: human and Arabidopsis. The comparison identified many common proteins, plant-specific proteins, proteins of unknown function found in both proteomes, and proteins that were nucleolar in plants but nonnucleolar in human. Seventy-two proteins were expressed as GFP fusions and 87 % showed nucleolar or nucleolarassociated localization. In a striking and unexpected finding, we have identified six components of the postsplicing exon-junction complex (EJC) involved in mRNA export and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) /mRNA surveillance. This association was confirmed by GFP-fusion protein localization. These results raise the possibility that in plants, nucleoli may have additional functions in mRNA <b>export</b> or <b>surveillance...</b>|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, RNA {{processing}} {{events in}} the nucleus influence the fate of transcripts in the cytoplasm. The multi-protein exon junction complex (EJC) associates with mRNAs concomitant with splicing in the nucleus and plays important roles in <b>export,</b> translation, <b>surveillance</b> and localization of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. In mammalian cells, the ribosome associated protein PYM (HsPYM) binds the Y 14 -Mago heterodimer moiety of the EJC core, and disassembles EJCs, presumably during the pioneer round of translation. However, {{the significance of the}} association of the EJC with mRNAs in a physiological context has not been tested and the function of PYM in vivo remains unknown. Here we address PYM function in Drosophila, where the EJC core proteins are genetically required for oskar mRNA localization during oogenesis. We provide evidence that the EJC binds oskar mRNA in vivo. Using an in vivo transgenic approach, we show that elevated amounts of the Drosophila PYM (DmPYM) N-terminus during oogenesis cause dissociation of EJCs from oskar RNA, resulting in its mislocalization and consequent female sterility. We find that, in contrast to HsPYM, DmPYM does not interact with the small ribosomal subunit and dismantles EJCs in a translation-independent manner upon over-expression. Biochemical analysis shows that formation of the PYM-Y 14 -Mago ternary complex is modulated by the PYM C-terminus revealing that DmPYM function is regulated in vivo. Furthermore, we find that whereas under normal conditions DmPYM is dispensable, its loss of function is lethal to flies with reduced y 14 or mago gene dosage. Our analysis demonstrates that the amount of DmPY...|$|R
