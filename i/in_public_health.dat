5|$|Pharmacists {{involved}} in CPAs may participate in clinical {{services that are}} outside of the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists. Notably, pharmacists {{do not need to}} participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as {{the first line of defense}} in disaster scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Guildhall, {{designed}} {{to serve the}} post-plague city {{with a population of}} around 6,000, was hopelessly inadequate as the administrative centre of a major modern city. As an interim solution the row of buildings dividing the upper and main markets had mostly been taken into public ownership and converted into civic offices, and in January 1914 the 1860 fish market had also been enlarged and converted into offices. The Liberal welfare reforms of the early 20thcentury and the Local Government Act 1929 had greatly increased the role of local government <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and welfare, and by the 1930s Norwich council was suffering from a severe lack of office space.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} some {{issues related to the}} corruption and performance of services <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> Reform of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> is a complex and lengthy process, which involves different types of institutions and individuals.

This model contains equations regarding the quality of reform <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> system, the role played by different factors in increasing of the transparency of decisions <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> system, estimations of the influence of some factors from the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> system <b>in</b> increasing the health education of the population, factors related to corruption and nonacademic behavior <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> system contributing to the implementation of the reform process in the system and improvement {{of the quality of the}} medical act.
