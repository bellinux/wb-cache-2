5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land <b>grants</b> {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these <b>grants</b> were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land <b>grants</b> that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth <b>grants</b> pay a fee to New York to have their <b>grants</b> validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in the <b>Grants</b> had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
