40|$|Digital aerial cameras, {{among them}} the UltraCam D, the new large-format digital aerial camera of Vexcel Imaging, are ready to replace the aerial film camera. This is reason enough to {{highlight}} the improvements in radiometric and geometric quality that such a camera provides. Is it the ability to resolve dark shadows, is it the ability to simultaneously register panchromatic, true color and false color infrared {{or is it the}} ability to increase the <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> at no extra costs for film, development and scanning, we are convinced, that with such digital cameras, a novel strategy of source image acquisition can be considered. Aerial photogrammetry has long used a convention of 60 % <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> and 20 % sidelap, in order to provide for stereo compilation and the generation of products such as digital terrain models (DTM) and orthophotos. We argue that digital cameras can be used to challenge standard photogrammetric conventions: no longer is film grain an issue, high radiometric resolution at a 12 bit level and no longer is the number of images the predominant driver in defining a photogrammetric project. Increased redundancy and higher overlaps provide a key to optimized levels of accuracy, automation and robustness in a production environment. The design of the UltraCamD with its parallel architecture permits a very high framing rate, thus affording flexibility to select a <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> of up to 90 %. Further, the role of parallel architecture in sensor design, together with efficient data transfer and storage options, is discussed. If this change in the strategy of image acquisition take place, an enhancement of automation and robustness in the photogrammetric production can be expected. 1...|$|E
40|$|Large Format Camera (LFC) was {{developed}} by NASA to produce high resolution stereo photographs from space with maximum photogrammetric fidelity. The camera has a 30. 5 cm focal length lens and an f/ 6. 0 aperture. The optics are corrected to permit operation with black and white (b/w), natural color (col) and color infrared (cir) film. Interchangeable minus-haze and minus-blue filters are located near the aperture stop, and an antivignetting filter is provided on the front element of the lens. The field-of-view of the LFC along track is 73. 7 degrees (ratio 1. 5 x H) and across track is 41. 1 degrees (ratio 0. 75 x H). The frame format of the LFC is 23 x 46 cm with the long dimension {{in the direction of}} flight. The camera can be operated to produce 10, 60, 70, or 80 percent <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> for stereoscopic coverage. With 80 percent <b>forward</b> <b>overlap,</b> the stereo model base height ratio is 0. 3 for successive frames and 1. 2 if every fourth frame is used. The LFC magazine has a capacity of 2400 frames. Two horizon-looking stellar cameras, one directed 45 degrees forward and the other 45 degrees aft were used to photograph the star field in synchronism with exposures of the LFC. Post flight mensuration and calculation of the stellar photographs will provide altitude information for the LFC...|$|E
40|$|In photogrammetry, radial {{displacement}} {{occurs when the}} point being imaged is not at the elevation of the mean datum. It is standard practice in photogrammetric mapping to provide 60 % <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> and 30 % sidelap between adjacent photographs. Such overlap is often required as the aircraft is subject to altitude variations, tip, and tilt as the flight proceeds. Differential GPS is used to minimize 3 -D positional variations and provide precise indexing of the photographic exposures. This paper reports on the application of differential GPS to scientifically map the “uplight” emanating from the Ames, IA area, which serves to provide preliminary photogrammetry for Iowa State University engineering students working on Aerial Integrated Platform (AIP) senior projects.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a large format digital mapping camera into an established mapping company provides many advantages in the photogrammetric workflow. During the last summer, AEROmetrex welcomed {{the opportunity to work}} with the Vexcel Ultracam D, and produced in excess of 10, 000 production images. The imagery has been captured at a variety of scales, terrain types and land cover types. The advantages of using a digital mapping camera are wide and varied and allows for true integration of digital photogrammetry and remote sensing mapping. This paper discusses the production implementation issues such as: Image sharpness and definition, no film grain and no artefacts introduced by film processing and scanning providing better automatic matching in aero triangulation and DTM generation. These factors also allow a more precise ability to manually measure and define objects as well as providing better looking, cleaner and more natural looking images for the client. 4 -multispectral bands and greater dynamic range expand the available photogrammetric products available to clients. The cost effective ability to produce a large amount of <b>forward</b> <b>overlapping</b> images enable the process of multi-ray matching, for increased accuracy and redundancy in DTM generation...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{photogrammetry}} exploits {{stereoscopic image}} measurements {{to reconstruct the}} shape of objects. This technology is well-known and understood for over a century. Since {{the age of the}} stereo comparator human operators have been able to recognize the depth of a scene with remarkable accuracy. In principle, this has not changed during the time that image processing has been introduced into the photogrammetric production chain. Only a certain degree of automation has been derived, when matching and image correlation has replaced the human eyes. Nevertheless, we need to confess that shape from stereo is not very robust and that a time-consuming and therefore expensive control and verification process is needed after the automated reconstruction process. To overcome such problems, we argue that a process based on multiple image overlap is the appropriate solution. In the age of digital aerial cameras such multiple overlaps can be commanded without extra costs for additional images. A <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> of at least 80 % supports a robust and highly redundant measurement. Automation and verification starts to become an easy job, and based on the level of redundancy, we can expect a much more reliable means of automated production. In urban areas we have an additional benefit in the reduction or elimination of occlusions. In this paper we present several examples of multiple image matching, based on images taken with the new large format digital aeria...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{introduction}} of large format digital frame cameras at the ISPRS 2000 conference, these systems have matured {{and are now}} widely used in production, by and by replacing film cameras. The advantages of these digital cameras range from an additional near infrared channel, higher bit depth, absence of grain in the image, higher <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> without additional cost, to a completely digital workflow. At the same time large format digital frame cameras have been advertised as having the same, wellknown geometric characteristics as their predecessors, making their data familiar and easy to work with in an existing production environment. While this of course is true, both data producer and end user or customers are learning the implications for the final product or delivery {{as well as for the}} planning, acquisition and production stages. The paper looks at these aspects during planning, acquisition, and production within the context of generating final products such as orthoimagery and also digital elevation model data. The analysis is developed from the perspective of a private sector production company, and is based on two years of experience in a production environment with tens of thousands of images taken with the UltraCamD and UltraCamX complemented by almost 60 years of experience with film imagery.

40|$|The race {{to replace}} the aerial film camera started in July 2000 with the product {{announcements}} of the ADS- 40 by LH-Systems (now Leica Geosystems) and of the DMC by Z/I Imaging. Recently, the UltraCam-D was introduced. This is a 90 Mpixel large format aerial camera by Vexcel Imaging to add an innovative offering {{with a focus on}} a on-on-one replacement of aerial film cameras. This is achieved by the continued use of an unchanged work flow, very much as if the digital image had not been obtained from a digital camera but by scanning a film image, yet with dramatic economic advantages {{as well as with the}} added benefit of a smooth all-digital operation. While this “unchanged workflow ” is an initial value of the new system, it nonetheless offers numerous opportunities for improving the current state-of-affairs of photogrammetry, as much so that one could speak about a “paradigm shift”. The most important opportunity is the ability to dramatically increase the <b>forward</b> <b>overlaps</b> in photogrammetric surveys without any added cost, and producing a much higher level of automation in photogrammetric data analysis. Photogrammetric software will have to be adjusted to go from current stereo, thus “ 2 -ray photogrammetry ” towards multi-eye, thus “ multi-ray ” solutions...|$|R

This paper describes how the reverse rotation effects on the spiral unidirectional {{dry gas seal}} performance and pressure distribution inside the gas film, also an investigation of using a different herringbone shape grooves configurations has been done using ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5 CFD simulation. The influence of decreasing rotational speed to the static condition and rotate in the reverse direction on internal flow and gas seal performance is examined from 10800 to - 10380 rpm. The {{results indicate that the}} internal pressure distribution inside the gas seal in reverse rotation is decreased and the open force consequently decreased by 4 %. The modification on the same seal is done to enhance its performance at reverse rotation condition. The herringbone spiral grooves is used with different configuration, the new configurations are examined in the forward and reverse rotation direction. The analysis for the pressure distribution is done and its effect on the seal performance is examined. Seal performance is compared with standard one for all geometrical and operating conditions. At high forward rotational speed 10380 rpm, the pressure {{at the end of the}} spiral groove is about 11. 4 % higher than the inlet pressure at the seal outer diameter, while at reverse rotation, the pressure is not increased in radial direction.

Two stages are described, namely (1) automatic segmentation using a Mean Shift algorithm; (2) wall-to-wall mapping of the stands using Semi-Global Matching (SGM) in combination with a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The study was conducted in a coniferous boreal forest area in northern Sweden. 365 sample plots (8 m radius) were measured in the field where HGV (dm) ranged between 49. 0 - 246. 0 dm (mean 139. 3 dm), DGV 67. 0 - 400. 0 mm (mean 196. 8 mm), VOL 7. 0 - 665. 0 m 3 /ha (mean 151. 1 m 3 /ha) and BA 20. 0 - 635. 0 dm 2 /ha (mean 204. 9 dm 2 /ha).

40|$|Addressing {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} variability of crops for agricultural management requires intensive and periodical information gathering from the crop fields. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is a quick and affordable method for information collecting; it provides spectral and spatial information when required with the added value of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) that reconstruct the crop structure in 3 D using “structure from motion” techniques. In the full process from UAV flights to image analysis, DSM generation is one bottle-neck due to its high processing time. Despite its importance, the optimization of the required <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> for saving time in DSM generation {{has not yet been}} studied. UAV images were acquired at 50 and 100 m flight altitudes over two olive orchards with the aim of generating DSMs representing the tree crowns. Several DSMs created with different forward laps (in intervals of 5 – 6 % from 58 to 97 %) were evaluated {{in order to determine the}} optimal generation time according to the accuracy of tree crown measurements computed from each DSM. Based on our results, flying at 100 m altitude and with a 95 % forward lap reported the best configuration. From the analysis derived from this configuration, tree volume was estimated with 95 % accuracy. In addition, computing time was 85 % lower in comparison to the maximum overlap studied (97 %). It allowed computing the 3 D features of 600 trees in a 3 -ha parcel in a highly accurate and quick (a few hours after the UAV flights) manner by using a standard computer.

As the project is countrywide, it keeps the project within the same parameters in urban and rural areas as well. Due to economic reasons it can´t be produced as a true ortophoto because it requires large side and <b>forward</b> <b>overlaps</b> of the aerial photographs and a preparation of the digital surface model instead of the digital terrain model.

40|$|Scalable shared-memory multi{{processor}}s {{are often}} slowed down by long-latency memory accesses.

With data forwarding, when a processor produces a datum, in addition to updating its cache, it sends a copy of the datum to the caches of the processors that the compiler identified as consumers of it. As a result, when the consumer processors access the datum, they find it in their caches. This paper addresses two main issues. First, it presents a framework for a compiler algorithm for forwarding. Second, using address traces, it evaluates the performance impact of different levels of support for forwarding. Our simulations of a 32 -processor machine show that a slightlyoptimistic support for forwarding speeds up five applications by, on average, 50 % for large caches and 30 % for small caches.

40|$|In 2014 the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC) {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} digital oblique imagery in its portfolio {{in response to}} the growing demand for this product. The reason can be attributed to its useful applications {{in a wide variety of}} fields and, most recently, to an increasing interest in 3 d modeling. The selection phase for a digital oblique camera led to the purchase of the Leica RCD 30 Oblique system, an 80 MPixel multispectral medium-format camera which consists of one Nadir camera and four oblique viewing cameras acquiring images at an off-Nadir angle of 35 º. The system also has a multi-directional motion compensation on-board system to deliver the highest image quality. The emergence of airborne oblique cameras has run in parallel to the inclusion of computer vision algorithms into the traditional photogrammetric workflows. Such algorithms rely on having multiple views of the same area of interest and take advantage of the image redundancy for automatic feature extraction. The multiview capability is highly fostered by the use of oblique systems which capture simultaneously different points of view for each camera shot. Different companies and NMAs have started pilot projects to assess the capabilities of the 3 D mesh that can be obtained using correlation techniques. Beyond a software prototyping phase, and taking into account the currently immature state of several components of the oblique imagery workflow, the ICGC has focused on deploying a real production environment with special interest on matching the performance and quality of the existing production lines based on classical Nadir images. This paper introduces different test scenarios and layouts to analyze the impact of different variables on the geometric and radiometric performance. Different variables such as flight altitude, side and <b>forward</b> <b>overlap</b> and ground control point measurements and location have been considered for the evaluation of aerial triangulation and stereo plotting. Furthermore, two different flight configurations have been designed to measure the quality of the absolute radiometric calibration and the resolving power of the system. To quantify the effective resolution power of RCD 30 Oblique images, a tool based on the computation of the Line Spread Function has been developed. The tool processes a region of interest that contains a single contour in order to extract a numerical measure of edge smoothness for a same flight session. The ICGC is highly devoted to derive information from satellite and airborne multispectral remote sensing imagery. A seamless Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) retrieved from Digital Metric Camera (DMC) reflectance imagery is one of the products of ICGC’s portfolio. As an evolution of this well-defined product, this paper presents an evaluation of the absolute radiometric calibration of the RCD 30 Oblique sensor.

The melting temperature of the heterozygote is distinguishable {{from that of the}} homozygote by its upward or downward shift of a melting temperature (Tm) peak, or by the presence of a second Tm peak. When a second Tm is present, calculation of the mutant to wildtype ratio is possible (data not shown, to be published elsewhere). However, my colleagues and I have encountered a difficulty in simultaneous CADMA analyses of several targets using multiple DNA samples in a single thermocycler.|$|R
40|$|X {{chromosome}} inactivation (XCI) is {{initiated by}} {{expression of the}} noncoding Xist RNA in the female embryo. Tsix, the antisense noncoding partner of Xist, serves as its regulator during both imprinted and random XCI. Here, we show that Tsix in part acts through a 34 mer repeat, DXPas 34. DXPas 34 contains bidirectional promoter activity, producing <b>overlapping</b> <b>forward</b> and reverse transcripts. We generate three new Tsix alleles in mouse embryonic stem cells and show that, while the Tsix promoter is unexpectedly dispensable, DXPas 34 plays dual positive-negative functions. At the onset of XCI, DXPas 34 stimulates Tsix expression through its enhancer activity. Once XCI is established, DXPas 34 becomes repressive and stably silences Tsix. Germline transmission of the DXPas 34 mutation demonstrates its necessity for both random and imprinted XCI in mice. Intriguingly, sequence analysis suggests that DXPas 34 could potentially have descended from an ancient retrotransposon. We hypothesize that DXPas 34 was acquired by Tsix to regulate antisense function...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{conduct the}} novel {{exercise}} of analyzing {{the relationship between}} overall wealth inequality and caste divisions in India using nationally representative surveys on household wealth conducted during 1991 – 92 and 2002 – 03. According to our findings, the groups in India that are generally considered disadvantaged (known as Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes) have, as one would expect, substantially lower wealth than the "forward" caste groups, while the Other Backward Classes and non-Hindus occupy positions in the middle. Using the ANOGI decomposition technique, we estimate that between-caste inequality accounted for about 13 percent of overall wealth inequality in 2002 – 03, {{in part due to}} the considerable heterogeneity within the broadly defined caste groups. The stratification parameters indicate that the <b>forward</b> caste Hindus <b>overlap</b> little with the other caste groups, while the latter have significantly higher degrees of overlap with one another and with the overall population. Using this method, we are also able to comment on the emergence and strengthening of a "creamy layer," or relatively well-off group, among the disadvantaged castes, especially the Scheduled Tribes. ...|$|R
5000|$|Turner played 7-a-side soccer as a midfielder for New South Wales {{starting}} in 2009, {{and for the}} Australian national 7-a-side team, the ParaRoos, in 2012. By November 2013, he had 16 caps, and was named Pararoo Football Player of the Year at the 2013 FFA Australian Football Awards night on 13 November 2013. The {{head coach of the}} ParaRoos, Paul Brown, said that [...] "James has pace to burn and he gets <b>forward</b> on the <b>overlap</b> to worry defenders in their third. He {{has the potential to be}} one of the best players that Australia has ever produced if he stays on the path that he is at present". Unfortunately for the ParaRoos, ranked tenth in the world, in July 2014, the Australian Sports Commission cut funding for the 7-a-side soccer program on the grounds that the team was unlikely to make the 2016 Summer Paralympics. After a public outcry, the team was revived with a new funding model in 2015. Despite the fund raising efforts, the ParaRoos failed to qualify for Rio.|$|R
40|$|Rapidly {{developing}} technology Unmanned Aerial Vehicle based photogrammetry {{is used in}} {{an increasing number of}} applications. They are employed in volume calculations, terrain mapping or generating 3 D models of buildings. Conducting a successful mission with desired accuracy requires knowledge of influence of various flight settings. The main purpose of this thesis is to assess accuracy that can be acquired with low-cost, commercially available UAV. It is influenced by flight parameters, such as height, <b>forward</b> and side <b>overlap</b> of images and speed of the aircraft. Additionally, various configurations of number and distribution of Ground Control Points are tested. The acquired accuracy is discussed with time and effort spent on the mission. The final result is always a compromise between economy and quality. The second objective of the thesis is to compare 3 D point cloud datasets acquired from laser scanning and UAV photogrammetry. The most optimal parameters of flight are used to perform a mission. Data is processed in two Structure from Motion software packages and compared to reference dataset. Results show that to some extent UAV-borne measurements can compete with Terrestrial Laser Scanning...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the configuration and technical specifications of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a red–green–blue (RGB) sensor for the acquisition of images needed {{for the production of}} orthomosaics to be used in archaeological applications. Several flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 m above ground level; two <b>forward</b> and side <b>overlap</b> settings (80 %– 50 % and 70 %– 40 %); and the use, or lack thereof, of ground control points. These settings were chosen to analyze their influence on the spatial quality of orthomosaicked images processed by Inpho UASMaster (Trimble, CA, USA). Changes in illumination over the study area, its impact on flight duration, and how it relates to these settings is also considered. The combined effect of these parameters on spatial quality is presented as well, defining a ratio between ground sample distance of UAV images and expected root mean square of a UAV orthomosaick. The results indicate that a balance between all the proposed parameters is useful for optimizing mission planning and image processing, altitude above ground level (AGL) being main parameter because of its influence on root mean square error (RMSE) ...|$|R
40|$|Schottky barrier (SB) Ge channel MOSFETs {{suffer from}} high drain-body leakage at the {{required}} elevated substrate doping concentrations to suppress source-drain leakage. Here {{we show that}} electrodeposited Ni-Ge and NiGe/Ge Schottky diodes on highly doped Ge show low off current, which might make them suitable for SB p-MOSFETs. The Schottky diodes showed rectification of up to 5 orders in magnitude. At low <b>forward</b> biases the <b>overlap</b> of the <b>forward</b> current density curves for the as deposited Ni/n-Ge and NiGe/n-Ge Schottky diodes indicates Fermi-level pinning in the Ge band gap. The SB height for electrons remains virtually constant at 0. 52 eV (indicating a hole barrier height of 0. 14 eV) under various annealing temperatures. The series resistance decreases with increasing annealing temperature in agreement with four point probe measurements indicating the lower specific resistance of NiGe as compared to Ni, which is crucial for high drive current in SB p-MOSFETs. We show by numerical simulation that by incorporating such high quality Schottky diodes in the source/drain of a Ge channel PMOS, highly doped substrate {{could be used to}} minimize the subthreshold source to drain leakage current...|$|R
