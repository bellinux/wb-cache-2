50|$|An {{engine control}} unit (ECU), also {{commonly}} called an <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> (ECM), {{is a type of}} electronic control unit that controls a series of actuators on an internal combustion engine to ensure optimal engine performance. It does this by reading values from a multitude of sensors within the engine bay, interpreting the data using multidimensional performance maps (called lookup tables), and adjusting the engine actuators accordingly. Before ECUs, air-fuel mixture, ignition timing, and idle speed were mechanically set and dynamically controlled by mechanical and pneumatic means.|$|E

Synchronization involves matching voltage, frequency and phase before connecting the generator to the system. Failure to synchronize before connection could cause a high short circuit current or wear and tear on the generator or its switchgear.

The auto-synchronizer will read the voltage, frequency and phase parameters from the generator and busbar voltages, while regulating the speed through the engine governor or ECM (<b>Engine</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module).</b>|$|E

Telematics {{combines}} {{communications and}} information technology to provide location, mapping, traffic, weather, entertainment and internet connectivity to motor vehicles. Similar to the recent developments in smart phones, the advancement in cellular infrastructure and cutting edge electronics has made {{the concept of a}} connected car a reality. The requirements for such systems however, are increasingly complex and costly. Manufacturers can no longer be dependent on proprietary designs to drive market differentiation and deliver successful products. Mission critical systems in motor vehicles require a well-established, tested and proven framework in order to ensure safety and reliability [3]. The advent of many open source software and hardware solutions on the market has enabled the possibility of leveraging off of proven robust solutions that can be applied to automotive designs. One such solution is the choice of real time operating systems. Companies can use Linux distributions optimized for real time performance in order to reach timing requirements for a particular solution. In addition, cross-platform frameworks like GStreamer, VideoLAN, and GPAC exist for audio and multimedia services within a motor vehicle. From a hardware perspective, companies like Gumstix offer reference designs of development boards consisting of all peripherals required to prototype solutions. The specifications of these designs are provided so that customized hardware can be designed with any additional interfacing to external peripherals such as the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus and <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>modules</b> added.

[...] The EDR functions are different for different engine manufacturers, but most recognize engine events such as sudden stops, low oil pressure, or coolant loss. Detroit Diesel, Caterpillar Inc., Mercedes-Benz, Mack Trucks, and Cummins engines are among those that may contain this function. When a fault-related event occurs, the data is written to memory. When an event triggered by a reduction in wheel speed is sensed, the data that is written to memory can include almost two minutes of data about vehicle speed, brake application, clutch application, and cruise control status. The data can be downloaded later using the computer software and cables for the specific engine involved. These software tools often allow monitoring of the driver hours of service, fuel economy, idle time, average travel speeds, and other information related to the maintenance and operation of the vehicle.|$|R
