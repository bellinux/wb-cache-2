40|$|Falls are a {{major public}} health concern and main causes of {{accidental}} death in the senior U. S. population. Timely and accurate detection permits immediate assistance after a fall and, thereby, reduces complications of fall risk. Radar technology provides an effective means for this purpose because it is non-invasive, insensitive to lighting conditions as well as obstructions, and has less privacy concerns. In this paper, we develop an effective fall detection scheme for the application in continuous-wave radar systems. The proposed scheme exploits time-frequency characteristics of the radar Doppler signatures, and the motion events are classified using the joint statistics of three different features, including the <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency,</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> ratio, {{and the length of}} event period. Sparse Bayesian classifier based on the relevance vector machine is used to perform the classification. Laboratory experiments are performed to collect radar data corresponding to different motion patterns to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In this research we digitalized sub-hourly precipitation recorded at the stations of Vercelli (since 1927), Bra (since 1933), Lombriasco (since 1939) and Pallanza (since 1950) in order to investigate historical change in extreme short precipitations. These stations are located in the northwest of Italy. Besides seasonal and yearly maximum of precipitation we adopted two indices of extreme rainfall: the number of events above an extreme threshold (<b>extreme</b> <b>frequency),</b> and the average intensity of rainfall from extreme events (extreme intensity). The results showed a statistically significant increase of the <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> index and spring maximum precipitation for Bra and Lombriasco. The extreme intensity index presented by the means of events above 95 th percentile is decreasing for Bra regarding hourly precipitation and increasing for Lombriasco regarding 20 min extreme events. In Pallanza, we noticed only a positive trend of the <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> and extreme intensity indices of events with duration of 30 min. For the analyses presented in this paper, a peak-over-threshold approach was chosen. Investigation presented showed that extreme events have risen in the last 20 yr only for short duration.

40|$|Hourly {{rainfall}} data {{between the}} years 1975 and 2010 across the Peninsular Malaysia were analyzed for trends in hourly extreme rainfall events. The {{analyses were conducted}} on rainfall occurrences during the northeast monsoon (November–February) known as NEM, the southwest monsoon (May–August) known as SWM, and the two inter-monsoon seasons, i. e., March–April (MA) and September–October (SO). Several extreme rainfall indices were calculated at the station level. The extreme rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia showed an increasing trend between the years 1975 and 2010. The trend analysis was conducted using linear regression; no serial correlation was detected from the Durbin-Watson test. Ordinary kriging {{was used to determine}} the spatial patterns of trends in seasonal extremes. The total amount of rainfall received during NEM is higher compared to rainfall received during inter-monsoon seasons. However, intense rainfall is observed during the inter-monsoon season with higher hourly total amount of rainfall. The eastern part of peninsular was most affected by stratiform rains, while convective rain contributes more precipitation to areas {{in the western part of}} the peninsular. From the distribution of spatial pattern of trend, the <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> index (Freq > 20) gives significant contribution to the positive extreme rainfall trend during the monsoon seasons. Meanwhile, both <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> and extreme intensity (24 -Hr Max, Freq > 95 th, Tot > 95 th, Tot > 99 th, and Hr Max) indices give significant contribution to the positive extreme rainfall trend during the inter-monsoon seasons. Most of the significant extreme indices showed the positive sign of trends. However, a negative trend of extreme rainfall was found in the northwest coast due to the existence of Titiwangsa Range. The extreme intensity, <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency,</b> and extreme cumulative indices showed increasing trends during the NEM and MA while extreme intensity and <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> had similar trends during the SWM and SO throughout Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, the hourly extreme rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia showed an increasing trend between the year 1975 and 2010 with notable increasing trends in short temporal rainfall during inter-monsoon season. The result also proves that convective rain during this period contributes higher intensity rains which can only be captured using short duration rainfall serie...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} found strikingly {{different}} allele frequencies between continents. This has been mainly interpreted as being due to local adaptation. However, demographic factors can generate similar patterns. Namely, allelic surfing during a population range expansion may increase the frequency of alleles in newly colonised areas. In this study, we examined 772 STRs, 210 diallelic indels, and 2834 SNPs typed in 53 human populations worldwide under the HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel to determine to which extent allele frequency differs among four regions (Africa, Eurasia, East Asia, and America). We find that large allele frequency differences between continents are surprisingly common, and that Africa and America show {{the largest number of}} loci with <b>extreme</b> <b>frequency</b> differences. Moreover, more STR alleles have increased rather than decreased in frequency outside Africa, as expected under allelic surfing. Finally, there is no relationship between the extent of allele frequency differences and proximity to genes, as would be expected under selection. We therefore conclude that most of the observed large allele frequency differences between continents result from demography rather than from positive selection...|$|E

The nonclassicality of the retrieved light is confirmed by using photon counting method, where the classical inequality which is only satisfied for classical light fields is introduced. Since the PDC photons can be utilized for producing the single photon state conditionally, storage and retrieval procedures are also performed for the conditional single photons.

In any concrete setup sufficiently many atoms have to be confined and pumped within a finite cavity mode volume. Using a magic wavelength lattice minimizes light shifts and allows for almost uniform coupling to the cavity mode. Never- theless, the atoms are subject to dipole-dipole interaction and collective spontaneous decay which compromises the ultimate frequency stability. In the high density limit the Dicke superradiant linewidth enhancement will broaden the laser line and nearest neighbor couplings will induce shifts and fluctuations of the laser frequency. We estimate the magnitude and scaling of these effects by direct numerical simulations of few atom systems for different geometries and densities. For Strontium in a regularly filled magic wavelength configuration atomic interactions induce small laser frequency shifts only and collective spontaneous emission weakly broadens the laser. These interactions generally enhance the laser sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations but for optimally chosen operating conditions can lead to an improved synchronization of the atomic dipoles...|$|E
