25|$|Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women and Dones <b>en</b> <b>un</b> paisatge) is {{an early}} Cubist {{painting}} by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger. The work was exhibited at the first Cubist manifestation, in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, Paris. At this exhibition the Cubist movement was effectively launched before the general public by five artists: Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay and Léger. This was the first exhibition during which artists, writers, critics and {{the public at large}} encountered and spoke about Cubism. The result of the group show is a succès de scandale.|$|E
25|$|In Spain, Lope de Vega wrote a {{continuation}} of the epic (La hermosura de Angélica, 1602) as did Luis Barahona de Soto (Las lágrimas de Angélica, 1586). Góngora wrote a famous poem describing the idyllic honeymoon of Angelica and Medoro (<b>En</b> <b>un</b> pastoral albergue). Orlando Furioso is mentioned among the romances in Don Quixote. Among the interpolated stories within Don Quixote is a retelling of a tale from canto 43 regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife. Additionally, various literary critics have noted the poem's likely influence on Garcilaso de la Vega's second eclogue.|$|E
25|$|Relgis {{returned}} to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes <b>En</b> <b>un</b> lugar de los Andes ("Some Place in the Andes") and Locura ("Madness"), both translated by Pablo R. Troise. They {{were followed by}} two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: Corazones y motores ("Hearts and Engines", 1963), Últimos poemas ("The Last Poems", 1967). His complete Obras ("Works") were published over the next decades, while the essay ¿Qué es el humanitarismo? Principios y acción ("What Is Humanitarianism? Principles and Action") went through several successive editions and featured a prologue by Albert Einstein. Another one of Relgis' Spanish-language volumes, Testigo de mi tiempo ("A Witness of My Time"), with more essays on Judaism, came in 1961. His leading eugenics and sexology treatise, Historia sexual de la Humanidad ("The Sexual History of Humanity"), was also published in 1961 (Libro-Mex Editores, Mexico City), and, in 1965, his biography of Nicolai saw print in Buenos Aires.|$|E

500|$|... "Quiero" [...] is an R [...] "groove" [...] track which {{incorporates}} strings on its crescendo, a saxophone solo, {{and brass}} instruments. [...] "Tú, Sólo Tú" [...] is a disco-influenced mid-tempo [...] "groove" [...] song. [...] "Dímelo <b>en</b> <b>un</b> Beso" [...] is a pop ballad which also incorporates disco music. [...] "O Tú o Ninguna" [...] is a bolero composed by Calderón, while [...] "No Me Fío" [...] {{is reminiscent of}} a 1980s power ballad. [...] "Te Propongo Esta Noche", the album's only dance number, begins as a [...] "smooth" [...] R track until it changes to percussion-driven club music halfway through the song. The album closes with the title track which features [...] "dramatic orchestral sweeps" [...] on the tune. The song caused a controversy when Mexican composer Marcos Lifshitz accused Calderón and Miguel of plagiarizing his composition [...] "Siento nuestro aliento" [...] which he wrote in 1997. A court {{ruled in favor of}} Lifshitz and ordered Miguel and his record label to pay 40 percent of the song's royalties as compensation.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions, Secada confirmed that Gloria helped translate his English-language recordings into Spanish. He {{said that she}} told him to record songs that he would be comfortable with singing throughout his career as a singer. She later told Secada and Emilio to not [...] "translate everything literally" [...] but to [...] "keep the same theme of the song in play." [...] Secada wrote in his autobiography that he was [...] "grateful" [...] that he and Gloria grew up in Miami, Florida and spoke two languages. Secada said that recording in Spanish was [...] "instinctively more passionate" [...] when compared to his recordings in English, he also explained that it gave him [...] "a different connection to the music as well." [...] However, Chris Morris of Billboard, said that Secada lacked the emotional range that was present in his English-language debut album. Two of the songs [...] "Angel" [...] and the title track were originally on the English-language album as Spanish tracks. Four of the songs, including [...] "Como <b>En</b> <b>Un</b> Sueño", [...] "Tu Amor Es Mi Libertad", [...] "Cree En Nuestro Amor", and [...] "Sentir", were translated into Spanish from Secada's debut album.|$|E
500|$|Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra {{gave the}} album two-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars and was underwhelmed with the {{production}} for sounding like his previous recordings. He recognized that Miguel was capable of handling love songs because of his [...] "rich, deep voice" [...] highlighting [...] "Tu Mirada", [...] "Soy Yo", and [...] "O Tú o Ninguna" [...] as examples. However, Guerra felt that Miguel [...] "runs into trouble" [...] on the dance tracks as he did on his prior albums. He chided [...] "Sol, Arena y Mar" [...] for its [...] "tepid mix of blaring horns and uninspired lyrics" [...] and said the other uptempo songs [...] "don't fare any better"; he criticized the over usage of horns on every fast-paced track as [...] "dated" [...] and [...] "repetitive". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote a more positive review of the album. He complimented [...] "Te Propongo Esta Noche" [...] and lauded the ballads such as [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] and [...] "Ese Momento" [...] as [...] "sensual and solemn". Tarradell closed his review by calling Amartes Es un Placer an [...] "enjoyable balance between high-brow ballads and hardwood workouts". Miami Herald editor Leila Cobo was disappointed with the record. She noted that while Miguel's vocals are still [...] "dazzling", the production sounds [...] "dated". She found [...] "Tú, Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "Dímelo <b>en</b> <b>un</b> Beso" [...] to be [...] "discoish duds that lack the oomph to get you on the dance floor". Cobo also commented the tracks suffer {{from a lack of}} [...] "strong hooks or melodies" [...] despite Miguel having the ability to [...] "elevate pretty much any style". Even so, Cobo praised [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] for its [...] "few memorable lyrics" [...] and [...] "No Me Fío" [...] for its arrangements.|$|E
