50|$|A {{social web}} academy is usually {{structured}} as a blended learning system. Under certain circumstances, however, competence development {{can also be}} achieved in learning systems which are mainly or purely Internet-based. For example, if learning partners from different countries and cultures collaborate in an <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> course, the exchange with the partner is in itself a practical challenge resulting in competence building through the handling of an intercultural encounter. A blended learning system systematically utilises online communities to aid this self-organised acquisition of competence, and this requires learning objectives to be clearly defined and progress to be measured using appropriate tools.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{internationalization}} {{of higher}} education {{raises the question of}} how well institutions prepare their students to integrate into and benefit from cultural diversity on any university campus. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess an <b>intercultural</b> peer-to-peer <b>training</b> at Jacobs University Bremen, Germany, that aims to facilitate the integration of incoming students into the multicultural environment of this international university. The individual experience of eight undergraduate students was explored using qualitative in-depth interviews. The results suggest that motivation to participate and satisfaction with the training were highest among students with some intercultural experience compared to students with extensive or little intercultural experience. All students supported the overall training format and the peer-trainer scheme. It seems that the training has adequately addressed the issues related to the general social life on the multicultural campus. However, it should focus more specifically on the learning model used and learning-related expectations at Jacobs University Bremen. In conclusion, the current study provides the first qualitative evaluation of an <b>intercultural</b> peer-to-peer <b>training</b> that could be utilized at other educational institutions in Germany and beyond as a method of linking culture-related issues to academic and social life of new students. </p...|$|R

40|$|In <b>intercultural</b> communication, the <b>training</b> of <b>intercultural</b> {{competence}} {{is seen as}} one of the primary solutions to problems and misunderstandings arising in intercultural situations. Intercultural {{competence is}} based on the assumption that specific cultural based factors have a continuous influence on the communication. In this article it is argued for that this assumption can be a problematic one. Based on an analysis of authentic talk-in-interaction between two interlocutors from different nations it is shown that interlocutors continuously negotiate about membership categories like e. g. cultural origin and its local relevance for the talk. This means that cultural origin is not a continuous, but a dynamic entity. This leads to the suggestion that in <b>intercultural</b> communication the <b>training</b> of interactive strategies should be an alternative or a necessary addition to traditional <b>training</b> aims like <b>intercultural</b> competence...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} {{cultural}} conflicts {{have affected the}} efficiency of the employees’ performance at a lot of international hotel workplaces and it is believed that employees from different cultural backgrounds will have to improve their communication skills. An <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programme is needed in order to prepare multicultural employees for surprises that could arise in complex cultural situations without being frustrated, stressed, and puzzled. The {{purpose of this study is}} to design an effective <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programme especially for hotel operations, to enhance the quality of international service, retain the current customers and attract more international customers. The new training programme is designed to help employees feel comfortable in problematic cultural situations and gain the necessary problem solving skills. There are some cross-cultural or <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programmes available on the market and some of the international hotel chains also have their own <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programmes, but most of them are only designed to compare some major national cultures or targeted on coaching specific cultures or countries. It is thought that those programmes are not good enough to help hotel employees cope with cultural problems and conflicts. Therefore, a new <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programme will be developed to meet the actual needs. The new <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programme will be developed by synthesising some other researchers’ relative studies and combining with Harzing’s Cross-cultural Training Model and Hofstede’s Ten Synthetic Culture Model. The case study and semi-structured interviews are suggested to be used for training needs assessment, and lectures, case study, film and computer-based training are recommended as the coaching methods. There will be questionnaires and observations to evaluate the effectiveness of this training programme. One of the challenges for this study is that there are not enough systematic cross-cultural or <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> programmes available currently and this study has to rely on some limited literature. However, this study is designed to identify the major cultural differences and effectively help trainees understand cultural problems and conflicts, and be prepared for surprises in foreign cultural situations...|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{increasing}} popularity, much <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> is {{not developed}} {{with the same}} level of rigour as training in other areas. Further, research on <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> has brought inconsistent results about the effectiveness of such training. This PhD thesis develops a rigorous model of <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> and applies it to the preparation of British students going on work/study placements in France and Germany. It investigates the reasons for inconsistent training success by looking at the cognitive learning processes in <b>intercultural</b> <b>training,</b> relating them to training goals, and by examining the short- and long-term transfer of <b>intercultural</b> <b>training</b> into real-life encounters with people from other cultures. Two cognitive trainings based on critical incidents were designed for online delivery. The training content relied on cultural practice dimensions from the GWBE study (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman & Gupta, 2004). Of the two trainings, the 'singlemode training' aimed to develop declarative knowledge, which is necessary to analyse and understand other cultures. The 'concurrent training' aimed to develop declarative and procedural knowledge, which is needed to develop skills for dealing with difficult situations in a culturally appropriate way. Participants (N- 48) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two training conditions. Declarative learning appeared as a process of steady knowledge increase, while procedural learning involved cognitive re-categorisation rather than knowledge increase. In a negotiation role play with host-country nationals directly after the online training, participants of the concurrent training exhibited a more initiative negotiation style than participants of the single-mode training. Comparing cultural adjustment and performance of training participants during their time abroad with an untrained control group, participants of the concurrent training showed the qualitatively best development in adjustment and performance. Besides <b>intercultural</b> <b>training,</b> multicultural personality traits were assessed and proved to be a powerful predictor of adjustment and, indirectly, of performance abroad...|$|E
