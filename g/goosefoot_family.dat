Spinach Spinach is a cool season crop and belongs to the <b>goosefoot</b> <b>family</b> (Chenopodiaceae), along with Swiss chard and beets. Spinach is low in calories. It is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and minerals, especially iron. After washing the leaves, cook them in a covered pan using only the water clinging to the leaves. After cooking, add salt and butter, vinegar, or mustard for added flavor. Spinach may be prepared in a souffle, creamed soup, or used raw in salads. Swiss Chard Swiss chard is a type of beet that is grown for its large leaf stalks and leaves. It produces no enlarged fleshy roots. It is low in calories and minerals and a good source of vitamins A and C. Chard leaves are best prepared like spinach or beet greens - cooking with only the water that clings to them following washing. A bit of garlic or nutmeg and butter enhances the flavor of chard leaves. Chard stems have a delicate flavor much like asparagus and are prepared in a similar way. Stems should be stripped of leaves, cut into conveniently sized pieces, and gently steamed in salted water until tender. Cooked and chilled stems are very good with salad dressing or mayonnaise. Leaves and stems may also be cooked together...|$|E
40|$|The {{sugar beet}} is a {{herbaceous}} dicotyledon plant {{belonging to the}} Chenopodiaceae (<b>goosefoot)</b> <b>family.</b> The sugar beet has been cultivated {{for thousands of years}} {{in one form or another}} as a sweets source. It came from what is known as the Mediterranean center of origin. Its potential as a source of sugar was not discovered until 1747. A German chemist, Andreus Marggraf, discovered the sugar in the beet was the same as the sugar in sugar cane. The first factory was built in 1799 - 1801 in Silesia. However it failed because the sugar content was too low. In effort to eliminate France's dependency on foreign sources, Napoleon directed a sugar beet to be developed. French agriculturists, Louis Vilmorin, selected beets by progeny test methods and raised the sugar from 7. 5 % to 16 or 17 %. By 1814, small factories were operating in France, Belgian Germany, and Austria. By 1880 sugar beets had practically as high a sugar percentage as today. The first attempt to produce sugar beets in the United States came in 1832 in Massachusetts, an effort that was not successful. Some forty years later, production of sugar beet was successfully started in California. Since the earliest days of successful production, growers have been dependent on processing companies, with respect to selling their crops. Usually a grower will not seed sugar beets until a binding contract with a processing company or cooperative has been negotiated. The sugar beet is a biennial plant. It normally completes its vegetative cycle in two years. The first year it develops a large succulent root in which much reserve food is stored, thus, it is farmed as an annual.

40|$|In {{the model}} experiment, an {{assessment}} of the role of plants in the reclamation of the bed of combustion waste from coal-based power plants fertilised with compost and sewage sludge. The bed of combustion waste was stored in cylindrical containers with a diameter of 80 cm (0. 5 m 2 of surface) and the height of 100 cm. The first stage of the experiment was carried out in 2006 – 2007. Then the bed was fertilised with four types of compost and sewage sludge, and then seeded with four species of grasses and white mustard. The second stage was undertaken in 2011 – 2013. In 2011, mixture of four species of grasses and white mustard was seeded on the same bed. It was assumed that the continuation of research in the second stage, whose results of are presented in this paper, will show a broader spectrum of vegetation changes, what will accurately track the process of biological reclamation of the bed of combustion waste. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of reclamation in the experiment, based on the percentage estimates of the coverage of species and crop yields. During the three-year (second stage) experiment 78 species of self-seeding plants belonging to 19 taxa in the rank of families and 11 syntaxonomic groups were recorded. The most numerous were the families: aster family, grass family, papilionaceous family, <b>goosefoot</b> <b>family</b> and cabbage family. Among the syntaxonomic groups the dominating species belonged to the class Stellarietea mediae, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Artemisietea vulgaris. Among the forms of life hemicryptophyte and therophytes were the most represented. Highest total yields of plants were found in model containers with Complex compost and Radiowo compost and the model of sewage sludge. Based on the estimated models in each degree of coverage of species and crop yield, the highest reclamation efficiency was demonstrated in the models of reclamation of composts Complex and Radiowo, as well as in the model of sewage sludge.

As praias do Golfo são dominadas por barreiras de areia formadas em frente à Lagoa do Vistula e à planície deltaica do Vistula pelo lado sudeste-sul, e em frente a Lagoa de Puck a noroeste, tal como acontece na Peninsula de Hel. Paredões costeiros ocorrem, por sua vez, na costa oeste do Golfo. Assentamentos neolíticos ao redor da costa do Golfo de Gdansk estão localizados principalmente no sopé do talude e no Delta do Vistula, sendo estritamente relacionados com a elevação do nível do mar e as decorrentes variações da linha de costa ao longo do Holoceno Tardio. Análises do polen do sedimento obtido nos corers do Delta do Vistula, Lagoa do Vistula e Lagoa Puck permitiram distinguir 4 fases antropogênicas para a área do Golfo de Gdansk. Foi visto que os primeiros indicadores da economia baseada em criação de animais domésticos nas vizinhanças do Golfo apareceram no Período Atlântico. Foram encontrados grãos de polen das plantas relacionadas com esse tipo de atividade humana familia Amaranthaceae (Chenopodiacea), "motherwort" (Artemisia), "sorrel" (Rumex) aparecendo também os primeiros grãos de polen de Plantago lanceolata. O assentamento neolítico da cultura Rzucewo, situado na costa oeste da Lagoa de Puck, é um dos que tem sido melhor investigados. As análises de polen indicam um incremento da atividade humana no início do Período Sub-boreal. Os traços preservados da fauna mostram que a caça da foca e a economia pesqueira eram as atividades preferidas. A datação radiocarbônica dos artefatos arqueológicos indicam que o começo do assentamento deve ter ocorrido há c. a. de 2400 AC (KROL, 1997). A altura das turfas e das conchas de moluscos marinhos, além de suas idades determinadas por radiocarbono, mostram que durante o Periodo Sub-boreal Inferior o nível da água aumentou entre 1, 0 e 2, 5 m em relação ao nível atual. A data do inicio do assentamento dos caçadores de foca correlaciona-se bem com o período em que as praias da Lagoa de Puck se aproximaram de sua condição quase atual. O desenvolvimento do assentamento Neolítico nas costas da Baía de Puck, assim como no Delta do Vistula, onde a caça às focas e pesca ocorreram embora a atividade principal fosse relacionada ao processamento do âmbar, mostram uma clara relação com o aumento do nível do mar. Esses assentamentos podem ser relacionados não só com a migração humana, efetuada no sentidodo do interior para a praia, mas muito provavelmente foi o resultado de uma retração causada pelas mudanças da linha de costa. A ocorrência das terceira e quarta fases do assentamento, durante o período Subatlântico foram relacionadas ao baixo posicionamento do nível do mar. Na área do delta do Vistula as condições de assentamento dependeram principalmente dos estágios de desenvolvimento do Delta.

We invite you to read the book and to download it in PDF format at www. projektyarcheologiczne. pl or www. fundacjalunula. pl. *** Mozów, site 23 is located in the Lubuskie Province, about 3 km west of Sulechów. It is situated on the slope of a small hill, between a railway line (Sulechów-Czerwieńsk) and county road 278. Archaeological excavations were carried out at this site in 2009 in connection with the planned construction of expressway S 3. The research was conducted by the Foundation of the University of Łódź under the direction of dr Seweryn Rzepecki. The excavations covered a total area of 186. 35 ares divided into five major sectors (hectares) within which 233 features were registered. Cultural attribution was determined for 109 features containing mostly potsherds. Archaeological sources recorded during the research included the material dating to the Stone Age (unspecified chronology), the Neolithic (including the Linear Pottery and the Funnel Beaker cultures), the Jastorf culture and the Roman Influence period (mixed elements of the Wielbark and Pomeranian cultures), as well as the older phases of the Early Middle Ages and the Post Medieval period. The publication presents the results of research on the archaeological material dating to the Early Medieval period. They are discussed against a wider background of Mozów-Sulechów microregion including several large settlements and less recognised settlement points. Apart from description and analysis of archaeological sources (mainly pottery and remains of building structures at Mozów, site 23), the monograph focuses on issues related to the reconstruction of the natural environment. The studies on the most abundant archaeological material – pottery, as well as thermoluminescence and radiocarbon dating analyses were carried out {{within the framework of the}} project Interdisciplinary research on the early medieval pottery workshop (7 - 10 c.) in the borderland of Lower Silesia - Great Poland - Lusatia financed by the National Science Centre (agreement no.  UMO- 2012 / 05 /N/HS 3 / 01425). In the publication the emphasis is placed on the reconstruction of the natural environment. The detailed geomorphological and palynological analyses, as well as the examination of quality and suitability of soils for plant cultivation have revealed that geological structure and varied lithology of the Quaternary formations characteristic of the area adjacent to Mozów, site 23 can be regarded as advantages in terms of agriculture. Large sandy surfaces covered by light soils are easy to work even with simple farming tools, enabling manual (hoe-based) cultivation of land, as well as agriculture using draft animals (with ards and more durable ploughs). It can be assumed that drought or excessively wet periods did not pose larger threat for the crops. The immediate surroundings of the site offered access to various environments, including moist soils located in alluvial-filled depressions or at the edges of wetlands, as well as dry ones, occurring at elevations of the fluvioglacial plain and on dunes. On the other hand, glacial till present on the surface of the area north of the site posed a substantial obstacle for cultivation. The area surrounding the site was characterised by a variety of soils. In the organically enriched alluvial deposits, or along the edges of wetlands developed alluvial and semi-hydrogenic or hydrogenic soils (i. a. peat and muck soils). Given the continued high levels of moisture some of these soils were probably unsuitable for ploughing; instead they may have been used in horticulture, or after appropriate adjustments, as meadows and pastures. On the moraine plateau predominated autogenic soils (brown earths and podzols). However, due to their heavy structure and skeletal character the cultivation required using strong draft animals and iron farming tools of reinforced construction. Potential sources of water supply included small lakes located on the plateau north of the site, a watercourse at the foot of the slope, and probably also springs occurring in cuts of sandy soil series in the lower part of the slope or in small denudation valleys. It is noteworthy that springs, unlike running or standing water, do not freeze during cold winters because the temperature of groundwater is generally similar to the average annual air temperature in the area. Thus, springs could be a stable water supply available throughout the year, e. g. for watering livestock. In the distance of several kilometres from the site no larger lakes occurred, which, however, did not create a barrier to colonization of the area. A significant factor influencing prehistoric occupation at Mozów site may have been the proximity of the Odra valley, which - as a communication route - enabled contact with other communities or migration. The investigated area was characterized by a great diversity of vegetation. Wetlands were occupied by riparian forests, and in some places by alder forests or small grass communities. The slopes and the moraine plateau were covered by beech forests with admixture of other tree species, while dry sandy hills were grown by coniferous forests. Woodlands provided building and fuel material, and after some adaptation (burning the forest floor and undergrowth) they were used as areas of less intensive grazing, hunting and gathering. Nutritional needs of the community were met in a variety of ways, combining the use of products derived from crops and livestock, wild plants and possibly wild animals. Excavations carried out at Mozów, site 23 and at other settlements dating to the seventh and eighth centuries have not yielded many faunal remains. Few finds of animal bones, mostly cattle and small ruminants, only confirm the results of pollen analysis indicating the presence of open plant communities which were used as pastures. In the sediments of the discussed layer dating to the beginnings of the Middle Ages disappear heather Calluna vulgaris and common bracken Pteridiumaqilinum, which are the species characteristic mostly of forest communities and peat lands. In addition, after a long absence returns the occurrence of sorrel pollen grains Rumex, typeacetosa/acetosella, the plant associated with grazing. Slightly later appears plantain Plantagolanceolata, which is the indicator of a similar value. Furthermore, the sediments dating to the beginning of the early medieval phase contained rye pollen grains Secale and a single pollen of other grains cerealia, as well as nitrophilous ruderal plants of the <b>goosefoot</b> <b>family</b> Chenopodiaceae. The period after the probable time of functioning of Mozów settlement is characterised by the occurrence of stronger indicators of anthropogenic impact, including mugwort Artemisia, nettle Urtica, or weeds of cereal crops - cornflower Centaureacyanus. Their presence is probably related to younger settlement dated from the ninth to the tenth century, represented by numerous remains recovered in the area of Sulechów and the village of Kije (where two strongholds dated to the same period existed at that time), or at Zawady, site 1. The occurrence of pollen grains and weeds is the direct evidence of human activity. Although few in number, they point towards people’s presence and penetration of surrounding areas. The transformations described above, as well as the changes in the proportion of particular ecosystems indicate the initial phase of anthropogenic impact on the environment, the process which continues uninterrupted until today. The settlement discovered at Mozów, site 23 is one of the most comprehensively excavated remains of occupation from the older phases of the Early Middle Ages in the Middle Odra region. In the studied period also two other settlements functioned in Mozów-Sulechów microregion: Sulechów, site 14, which was similar in size to Mozów, site 23, and a slightly smaller one, known as Sulechów, site 10. A relatively high density of occupation indicates that the second half of the seventh century at the latest was already the period of stable settlement structures of a permanent character in the region. Further development of this and other similar settlement clusters in the area enabled probably the emergence in the second half of the ninth century of many heavily fortified strongholds which served the role of central points for small tribal communities. The study of the early medieval site at Mozów has provided new data on possible ways of the organization of space within the settlement in the older phases of the Early Middle Ages. Spatial structure of the site, reconstructed on the basis of recovered relics, was strongly influenced by local topography, which has analogies in other nearby well recognized settlements, e. g. Sulechów, site 10 or Jordanowo, site 7. The discovered remnants of buildings are typical of the northern zone of development of Slavic (so called Sukow) culture. They included predominantly bath-shaped features, which were probably the remains of sunken parts of larger ground-level buildings. The excavations did not reveal the relics that would provide more detailed information on the methods of building construction. We can only assume that some of dwellings were erected with the use of lightweight wattle or post-based structures. The most numerous artefacts recovered during excavations were potsherds. In terms of style they refer mostly to Suków-Dziedzice group, and in single cases to undecorated pottery of Feldberg type (Kędrzyno variety). The major trait that allows to associate a small number of finds from Mozów with undecorated Kędrzyno vessels is a characteristic way of rim treatment which involves its thickening and distinguishing from the wall by means of an encircling undercut. Potsherds with rims of this shape were recovered from features: B 4, B 34, B 92 and B 129. They co-occurred with both decorated and undecorated vessels of Suków-Dziecice type. According to Edward Dąbrowski, who first drew attention to this characteristic trait of vessels occurring within a limited area of northern part of present day Lubuskie Province, the origins of such rim forms should be sought among some vessels of Dobrodzień group (grupa dobrodzieńska) dating to the Late Roman Influence period. The settlement microregion of Sulechów-Mozów is defined as the southern boundary of the area characterised by more frequent occurrence of vessels with the aforementioned rims. Apart from Mozów, analogous forms were discovered at Kalsk, site 1 and Sulechów, site 25. In all the above cases they were represented by undecorated vessels made without the use of a potter’s wheel. The present study has revealed that the vessels with undercut rims do not form a homogenous technological-stylistic-chronological group. The older items, dating from the sixth to the seventh century were made without the use of a potter’s wheel; they were characterised by undercuts executed in a careless manner and simple forms of rims with mostly semi-oval or flattened tops. Younger vessels of this group, which are dated predominantly to the eighth century are already the forms finished on a potter’s wheel, usually thin-walled, with a clearly marked groove (undercut) placed immediately below the rim. The rims are often strongly profiled, well elaborated and some of them give impression of having been made with a template. In the area of Sulechów the forms with undercut rims disappear during the eighth century. Instead, already in the beginning of that century emerge undecorated vessels ended with edges modelled from the inside, which resemble distinctly the younger examples of rims with indentation for a lid. A few forms of this kind were recovered also at Mozów, site 23, e. g. in features: B 26, B 92, B 200, however, they occurred more often in the assemblages dating only from the second half of the eighth century (e. g. at Gościkowo, site 5), and especially from the ninth century (e. g. at the settlement of Sulechów, site 28, where they are linked with the influences from the area of Lower Silesia). According to Paweł Pawlak vessels of this type, which are known also from Myszęcin, site 19 (dating from the half of the eighth to the ninth century), represent transitional forms between Sukow and Feldberg style, or are the signs of foreign cultural influences in the local pottery production. In the eighth and ninth centuries, when the use of a potter’s wheel in the production of vessels becomes widespread, the characteristic forms of rims include those modelled from the inside with deep encircling grooves (in some cases even triple ones). It seems that such a rim shape was not an unintended consequence of fast rotation of a potter’s wheel, but rather the result of a purposeful fashioning made perhaps with a comb or other toothed tool. This trait is characteristic of numerous vessels from the sites located particularly in the area defining the southern boundary of the prior occurrence of vessels with undercut rims. Such forms were recorded, i. a. at the stronghold of Gostchorze, site 1, at Tarnawa Rzepińska, site 1, in the layer dating to the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth century at Krosno Odrzańskie, site 1, among pottery assemblages of the stronghold at Kije, site 1, at Smolno Wielkie, site 1, at the settlement dating to the eighth century at Kalsk, site 4, among pottery finds from the probable stronghold at Górzykowo, site 1, and in the layers from the second phase of the stronghold at Połupin, site 2 dating (according to the recent study) to the first half of the eighth century at the earliest. Rims with similar profiles were found also at the settlement of Letnica, site 13, where occurred also forms decorated with elaborate comb patterns. It should be noted that rims shaped in this way were not recorded in pottery assemblages from the site at Mozów. Establishing the chronology of vessels recovered from the site at Mozów, and, accordingly, the dating of the settlement, is not an easy task. The difficulties arise from the fact that pottery from the older phases of the Early Middle Ages lacks sufficiently sensitive chronological characteristics. Until the end of the eighth century the vessel assemblages found in the Middle Odra region consisted predominantly of undecorated forms, which until approximately half of the eighth century were produced mostly without the use of a potter’s wheel. For this reason it is difficult to determine a precise chronological framework of the vessels older than the ninth century only on the basis of formal-stylistic analysis. In the case of ceramic material from Mozów, given the small percentage of decorated forms and those made with a potter’s wheel (about 2...|$|E
