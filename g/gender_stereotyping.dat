25|$|The Nigerian society (both {{historical}} and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural {{practices that are}} potently hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices. As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> becomes institutionalized within the family unit. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> plays a big role in {{influencing}} women’s academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in the context of parental upbringing. This paper is based on {{qualitative}} research and analysis of eleven semi- structured interviews with parents who bring up at least two children of different sex. I focus on the relation between identified <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in upbringing and parenting style. I also focus on <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes of fathers and mothers within individual families. On the basis of the interviews analysis I conclude that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in upbringing and overall optics of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> are present in all families, regardless of parenting style. I am finding that differences among families with diverse parenting styles are primarily in the degree of awareness of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes and the degree of active transmission of these attitudes to their children...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} expressing what is {{masculine}} promotes {{attitudes and behaviors}} that can discourage men from seeking help, contributing to numerous health issues in males. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore how personally endorsed <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> vs. <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes impacted help-seeking behavior. In the current study, female and male adults completed challenging puzzle tasks, recalled previous health help-seeking behavior, and completed sex-typed measures. Females utilized personally endorsed <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> more during the puzzle tasks, while males utilized both personally endorsed <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as well as <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes. When males recalled health-related events, however, personally endorsed feminine stereotypes predicted previous instances of help-seeking, suggesting a possible difference in the utilization of pathways during recalled vs. observable help-seeking behaviors. Findings demonstrated that personal and attitudinal pathways of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> play distinct roles for males and females in predicting help-seeking behavior...|$|R
40|$|Although {{parents may}} {{represent}} influential sources of children’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> to date no study has directly investigated {{the relations between}} parents’ and children’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> regarding academic abilities. Aiming at filling this gap, {{in the present study}} parents’ and their young children’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about math and language were assessed using both explicit and implicit measures for each member of the family. Sixty-eight Italian 6 -year-olds, their mothers, and their fathers (a) performed an Implicit Association Test designed to assess implicit <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about math and language, and (b) completed a measure of the relevant explicit stereotypes. Fathers’, but not mothers’, implicit stereotypes predicted children’s implicit and explicit stereotypes. Conversely, no predictive role emerged for parents’ explicit <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about math and language. Results are discussed also in relation to the role of fathers as targets of interventions to prevent academic <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> within the family...|$|R
25|$|Children {{learn about}} {{different}} gender categories by observing {{various forms of}} media. They often look for gender roles, with whom they can relate to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child’s understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in children’s literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children’s literature, male characters {{appear to be more}} central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.|$|E
2500|$|Socially, sexual {{differences}} {{have been used}} to justify different roles for men and women, in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference. However, there are also some psychological differences in regard to how problems are dealt with and emotional perceptions and reactions that may relate to hormones and the successful characteristics of each gender during longstanding roles in past primitive lifestyles.

2500|$|Ilana Teitelbaum of The Huffington Post {{responded in}} an article called [...] "Dear New York Times: A Game of Thrones Is Not Just for Boys", {{claiming}} that Bellafante's piece was not only rife with inaccuracies, but also patronizing to female readers. Teitelbaum defended the many sex scenes in the TV series because the books as a source sprawl with them. She encouraged discussion of the Ice and Fire books and the fantasy genre from a feminist perspective, but rejected Bellafante's point that only men are interested in fantasy, considering Bellafante's characterization of fantasy as [...] "boy fiction" [...] as a promotion of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> offensive to the genre {{as well as to}} women. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic noted the need to differentiate between depicting misogyny and endorsing misogyny, as the series is set {{in a world in which}} sex is the primary means by which women can assert their power. Meslow states that although the TV series may sometimes toe the line between Skinimax-style exploitation and genuine plot advancement, the sexual scenes also invite the viewers to sympathize with the series' women.|$|E

The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone Ann Hopkins's promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the mixed-motive framework as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.

40|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> are {{undergoing}} dynamic {{change in the}} 21 st Century, with development towards egalitarian values. Gender identity has become a social rights focus due to a rising number of gender non-conformists. Whilst previous research has suggested a relationship between <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> deviance and higher socioeconomic status, little research has explored gender identity deviance and socioeconomic status. This study’s hypotheses were that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> adherence would decrease with increased socioeconomic status, and that gender identity deviance would positively correlate with higher socioeconomic status due to decreased social stigma concerning gender non-conformity. 18 participants, aged 15 - 16, from a Dorset school were measured on socioeconomic status, <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> adherence and <b>gender</b> identity adherence through questionnaires and interviews. Correlational analysis confirmed a significant, one-tailed relationship between high socioeconomic status and low <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> adherence, supporting the first hypothesis. Correspondence analysis displayed that gender non-conformity was more prevalent amongst higher socioeconomic status participants; a trend which supported the second hypothesis. These findings encourage further research into confirming definitive relationships between the factors and exploring causational relationships between <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> <b>gender</b> identity and socioeconomic status, to determine how prejudice and environmental resources may impact adolescent self-expression and attitudes towards non-conforming gender minorities...|$|R
