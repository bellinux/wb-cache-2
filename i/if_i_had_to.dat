As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do any episode over again, it would be that one."

[...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas.

Farmer entered the game after Sean Woods fouled out with 1:54 left, and with Kentucky leading by two with just over a minute left, LSU coach Dale Brown instructed his team to foul Farmer on each Kentucky possession to conserve the game clock and regain possession of the ball. [...] "We felt Farmer did not have much experience, and he was playing a little tight," [...] Brown said after the game.

His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to.</b> For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker thing is the exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pick a favorite, that would be it." [...] Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: [...] "I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film The Limits of Control".|$|E

[...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as [...] "an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono called the show [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life". The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$171.7million and 3.9million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert.

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story.
