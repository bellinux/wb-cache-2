To figure out damage, the character's Meat Stat + Armor Value (if any) is subtracted from the weapon's Anguish Value. Once that number is determined the character finds the number on a Damage Multiplier Chart and rolls a d6 to determine {{the intensity of the}} multiplier of the weapon's <b>Damage</b> <b>Number.</b> The weapon's <b>Damage</b> <b>Number</b> is then multiplied that many times (from x1 to x5) and added to the character's current Wound Level.|$|E

40|$|One of main {{problems}} in increasing soybean production is the attack of pests such as soybean pod borer (Etiella zinckenella Treitschke). The objectives {{of this research}} was to determine the variance components and heritability of various characters associated with resistance to soybean pod borer. A field experiment was established by randomized complete block design where six cultivars of soybean including Gema, Grobogan, Kaba, Willis, lines KM 19 and KM 25 are planted in plots of 2. 5 m in length and 2 m in wide. The experiment was conducted at the Center for Integrated Seed production at Pasir Pengaraian, Riau Province. The parameters observed were number of larva per plant, percentage of damage pods per plant, percentage of damage seeds per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, yield per m 2, weight of 100 seeds dry and additional observations. The data were analyzed by using analysis of variance and then the components of genetic and phenotypic variance and heritability were calculated. The results showed that all parameters were relatively narrow genetic variation. Phenotypic variation was narrow for number of larva per plant, percentage of attacked pods and weight of 100 seed dry, and considered wide for the percentage of seeds <b>damage,</b> <b>number</b> of filled pods, number of seeds per plant, and yield per m 2. Broad sense heritability values were high for percentage of attacked pods, the percentage of seeds <b>damage,</b> <b>number</b> of filled pods, number of seeds per plant, weight of 100 seed, and very low for number of larvae per plant and yield per m 2.

40|$|We {{examined}} the feeding behavior of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) on ears of corn (Zea mavs) artificially infested with corn earworms (Helicoverpa zea). In 30 -minute aviary tests, redwings and starlings directed 39 to 79 % more feeding responses to ears of corn with worms than to ears without worms but they damaged the same proportion of ears {{with and without}} worms. In 3 -hour aviary tests and a field evaluation, birds damaged more ears with worms than without worms. In spite of more feeding responses directed to ears with worms, the overall <b>damage</b> (<b>number</b> of kernels eaten by birds) was similar in both groups of ears in aviary tests. Our findings indicate that earworms can influence feeding behavior by redwings and starlings on ears of corn. The results generally {{support the hypothesis that}} by reducing insect populations in cornfields, one can make the fields less attractive to birds. Also, because redwings and starlings actively sought earworms in corn ears, these abundant birds have the potential for reducing populations of these insect pests in cornfields...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the transition metals overload in Abu-Qir Bay in Egypt, as compared to a less polluted area (reference area) through some biomarkers of oxidative stress. Catalase enzyme activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and DNA <b>damage</b> (<b>number</b> of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites) were the tested biomarkers. The levels of iron and copper in Mugil cephalus liver tissues were significantly higher in samples from the polluted area as compared to the reference area: Fe: 407 ± 38 vs. 216 ± 21 μg/g wet wt; p= 0. 008, Cu: 54 ± 6 vs. 17. 7 ± 4 μg/g wet wt; p= 0. 0001. This could account for the observed increase in MDA concentration (15. 7 ± 5. 7 vs. 2. 5 ± 0. 5 U/g; p= 0. 035), and the elevated number of AP sites (13. 9 ± 2. 6 vs. 0. 37 ± 0. 2 AP site/ 1 × 105 bp; p= 0. 0001). Similarly, the activity of catalase enzyme responsible for the cellular defense was significantly high (58. 3 ± 12. 2 vs. 28. 4 ± 4. 0 U/mg; p= 0. 032).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since {{thin-walled}} {{composite structures}} {{are widely used}} in structural engineer-ing, damage in such structures {{is an important issue}} of research. Matrix cracking is a principal cause of failure in composites. In the present study, a composite matrix cracking model is implemented in a thin-walled hollow circular cantilever beam using an effective stiffness approach. Such structures are used to model connecting shafts and helicopter tail boom, for example, because of their high stiffness-to-weight ratios and excellent crashworthiness characteristics. The effect of variation in crack density on the fundamental frequency, for various combinations of m= 90 ns composite is studied. Using these change in frequencies due to matrix cracking, a genetic fuzzy system for crack density and crack location detection is generated. The genetic fuzzy system combines the uncertainty representation characteristics of fuzzy logic with the learning ability of genetic algorithm. It is observed that the success rate of the genetic fuzzy system in the presence of noise is dependent on crack density (level of <b>damage),</b> <b>number</b> of 90 plies, angle of constraining layer (), and noise level. It is found that the genetic fuzzy system shows excellent damage detection and isolation performance, and is robust to presence of noise in data.

40|$|Developing maize with durable {{resistance}} to maize stem borers could {{be enhanced by}} identifying genotypes with different mechanisms of resistance and pyramiding the resistances into high yielding genotypes. This study was carried out on 120 CIMMYT tropical maize inbred lines to identify the most important mechanisms of resistance {{that could be used}} to discriminate the germplasm into resistant or susceptible categories. The experiment was laid in an Alpha-lattice design, and replicated three times during the 2011 / 12 seasons. Traits measured were leaf toughness, stem penetrometer resistance, trichome density, stem sugar content, leaf <b>damage,</b> <b>number</b> of stem exit holes and stem cumulative tunnel length. A selection index was computed and categorized the 120 inbred lines into 33 resistant, 29 moderately resistant, 31 moderately susceptible and 27 susceptible. The most resistant lines were those derived from the CIMMYT multiple borer-resistant populations with CKSBL 10039 being most resistant and CML 395 most susceptible with indices of 0. 49 and 1. 84, respectively. Trichome density, leaf toughness and stem sugar content in that order were the most important traits in discriminating the lines into resistance and susceptible categories.
