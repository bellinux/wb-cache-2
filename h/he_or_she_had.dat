5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a specific legal right.|$|E
50|$|However, {{a person}} who makes it {{impossible}} to take possession of another's property has taken actual possession, not constructive possession.

25|$|Traditionally, {{the names}} are given at a child's baptism. Non-Christian, but traditional, Slavic names are usually accepted, but the priest may {{encourage}} parents to pick at least one Christian name. In the past, two Christian names were given to a child so that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> two patron saints instead of just one. At confirmation, people usually adopt yet another (second or third) Christian name, however, it is never used outside church documents.|$|E
25|$|In Ohio, an emancipated slave was {{prohibited}} {{from returning to}} the state in which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been enslaved.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to purchase the phone at cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.|$|E
25|$|As of December 2010, one NMP – Professor Walter Woon Cheong Ming, a law {{lecturer}} at the National University of Singapore – {{had succeeded in}} having a public law enacted based on a private member's bill <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> initiated. The law in question is the Maintenance of Parents Act, which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them. The bill was introduced in Parliament by Woon on 23 May 1994, and eventually passed on 2 November 1995. In that year, the first woman NMP, Dr. Kanwaljit Soin, also introduced a Family Violence Bill {{but it did not}} pass.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E

25|$|The work of {{translating}} {{was typically}} undertaken in this fashion: A member, or members, {{of one of}} the committees would produce a draft of a book, or books, of the Bible (typically from the section in which they were assigned) and submit the draft to the section committee. Occasionally a scholar outside the committee would be invited to participate in this phase of the translation process and was asked to submit a draft of the book or books with which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> renowned experience. This draft was then distributed among the members of the appropriate committee. Members of the committee would then meet and discuss the translation choices made in the draft. The draft that resulted from this meeting of the concerned committee was then sent to the committee of literary advisers, who would revise the draft in co-operation with the translators. When a consensus on the draft was reached, the final draft would be sent on to the Joint Committee, which was head over the four sub-committees.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the disposal of business in the Supreme Court, the President, if he, acting in his discretion, concurs with {{the advice of the}} Prime Minister, may appoint a person qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court to be a Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court for such period or periods as the President thinks fit. A Judicial Commissioner so appointed may, in respect of such class or classes of cases as the Chief Justice may specify, exercise the powers and perform the functions of a Judge of the High Court. Anything done by a Judicial Commissioner when acting in accordance with the terms of his or her appointment shall have the same validity and effect as if done by a Judge of that Court and, in respect thereof, he or she shall have the same powers and enjoy the same immunities as if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been a Judge of that Court. A person may be appointed to be a Judicial Commissioner to hear and determine a specified case only, although this has not yet happened. In recent years, the Judicial Commissioner's post {{has been used as a}} testing ground to see if qualified persons are suited for elevation to the Bench as Judges of the High Court.|$|E

[...] While noting its {{importance to the}} development of the RPG genre, Allgame reviewer Kyle Knight states that [...] "taken on its own merits, it's just not an enjoyable game to play." [...] 1UP.com explained why the series was not immensely popular at first in North America; American console gamers were not used to the idea of RPGs, and they said that it would take a decade for the genre to be [...] "flashy enough to distract from all of those words they made you read". GameCritics' Chi Kong Lui wrote that the game added realism to video games, and added, [...] "If a player perished in Dragon Warrior, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to suffer the dire consequences of losing progress and precious gold. That element of death evoked a sense of instinctive fear and tension for survival." [...] This, he said, allowed players to identify with the main character on a much larger scale.
