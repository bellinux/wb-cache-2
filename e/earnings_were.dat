Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

5|$|With {{increasing}} {{competition from}} trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, passenger volume {{began to decline}} along with less-than-carload freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self-propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 19271928. Carload freight volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> strong enough {{for the company to}} declare dividends in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross revenues by half from 1932 to 1935.|$|E

Though not required to provide U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, the company does distribute similar-style reports to its shareholders annually, and in the 1930s and 40s, its annual <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> reported in the Christian Science Monitor. In 1936, the company reported an net income of $195,077, up nearly $10,000 from its 1935 earnings of $185,320. As the company grew, so did its earnings. In 2001, the company reported sales of $91.4 million, giving it a net profit of $4.6 million. Sales began declining, and by 2007, they were down to $44,800,000.|$|E

In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read these themes {{in the news media}} already, and there is a perception that Hollywood films are biased.|$|E

Vansarita Too set a new track record and Vandy's Betty and Miss Vanity earned AAA speed ratings. Her first foal was Vandy's Betty, {{who went on to}} earn an AAA rating on the race track and became the dam of Mr. Van Deck. Her next foal was Vanetta Dee, who racked up 94 starts with 31 wins, 20 seconds and 16 thirds in six years of racing. Her total <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> $83,325 (approximately $ in current dollars). Vannevar was the next foal, and was AQHA Champion Racing Gelding in 1956 and 1957. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1954 foal was Vandy's Flash, who was the first gelding named World Champion Quarter Running Horse, in 1960. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1955 foal was Vansarita, who was never raced. A number of miscarriages followed, but in 1958 Garrett's Miss Pawhuska produced Miss Vanity, another AAA-rated racehorse. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska slipped, or lost, her next two foals, but produced Vansarita Too in 1961, who also earned an AAA on the race track. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal by Vandy was Vandy's Flash, a stallion, who was never raced but sired 107 foals. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal was not by Vandy, but was by a son of Three Bars named The Ole Man, but the gelding was never raced.|$|E

It finished as the top earning film for the weekend of October 6–8 beating the second placer Remember the Titans by a margin of over $9 million and bringing in more than four times the earnings of Get Carter, the next highest earning film released that same weekend. The film's opening weekend <b>earnings</b> <b>were</b> the highest ever for any film released in the month of October as well as marking the highest opening weekend earnings for a film starring Robert De Niro.

Many studies using current earnings to proxy for permanent earnings averaged earnings over years to deal with the measurement error following Solon (1992).

As potential fathers are taken from HIES in 1985 and HIES is repeated cross-section data, calculating missing father’s average <b>earnings</b> <b>is</b> challenging. In addition, Nybom and Stuhler (2016) provided evidence that changing the age span for sons has more impact on life-cycle bias than changing that of fathers.
