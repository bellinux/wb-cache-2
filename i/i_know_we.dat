His wife Tracy adds, [...] "He’s calm and collected, but he’s fiercely competitive. He’s always thinking about how he can beat you." [...] Former player Joel Cornette says [...] "Everyone sees Brad as a level-headed, calm and cool coach, but he’s about as competitive of a guy as <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> would get into it constantly, whether playing two-on-two or arguing about players’ having better college careers." ...|$|E
500|$|Ashante Infantry of Toronto Star complimented {{the song}} {{containing}} the album's only feature, commenting [...] "but {{good to see}} the business minds didn't overwhelm the young 'un's [...] first recording with guests or gimmicks". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post called the song as a [...] "yearning ballad". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was skeptical of the lyrical content presented in the song, commenting, [...] "unlike teen-pop stars a whole {{two or three years}} older than he is, Mr. Bieber isn’t shy about planting the seeds of corruption". Marc Hirsh of the Boston Globe said that the song combines the Disney route of songs comparing love to a fairytale, and unintentional comedy in the lines [...] "'Ain’t no chaperones[...] [...] Girl, I promise I’ll be gentle/ <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> gotta do it slowly’ in a song literally about prom." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, One Direction's vocal {{range in the}} song span from the note of D4 to A5. Written in the key of D major, the song is set in common time with a fast-paced tempo of 126 beats per minute. The song follows a basic sequence of D–G–D–G–D–A as its chord progression. The chorus of the song is predominantly featured alongside the bridge, is backed by wordless chants, and encompasses the lines: [...] "Let’s go crazy, crazy, crazy till we see the sun/ <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> only met but let’s pretend it’s love / And never, never, never stop for anyone/ Tonight let’s get some, and live while we’re young." [...] Several critics commonly concurred that the song's lyrics interpret a thinly veiled euphemism for sexual intercourse. Kotecha quipped in a September 2012 interview with Sugarscape: \ ...|$|E

500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
500|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{opened on}} October 30, 2003, to mixed to positive reviews from theatre critics. Menzel and Chenoweth received nearly unanimous praise for their performances as Elphaba and Glinda. Both USA Today and Time Magazine gave the Broadway production of Wicked very positive reviews, with Richard Zoglin of Time saying, [...] "If every musical had a brain, a {{heart and the}} courage of Wicked, Broadway really would be a magical place." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today described it as [...] "the most complete, and completely satisfying, new musical I've come across in a long time." [...] Conversely, Ben Brantley in the New York Times loved the production but panned the show itself, calling it a [...] "sermon" [...] that [...] "so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power," [...] with a [...] "generic" [...] score. He noted that Glinda is such a showy role that the audience ends up rooting for her rather than the [...] "surprisingly colorless" [...] Elphaba, who is [...] "nominally" [...] the hero. Despite these mixed reviews, interest in Wicked spread quickly by word-of-mouth, leading to record-breaking success at the box office, as described below. Speaking to The Arizona Republic in 2006, Schwartz commented, [...] "What can I say? Reviews are reviews.... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> divided the critics. We didn't divide the audience, and that's what counts." ...|$|E

So I was surprised to see he got banned. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> didn't cite him so I don't know why the independent commissioner did. It was just a fair ruck from a hard player.

"Heavensent" [...] (December 2001), {{the first}} single from the album, reached the top30 in early 2002 even though [...] "live {{promotion}} for the track was limited" [...] as Ella recovered.
