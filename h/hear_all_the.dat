5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} be heard in answer to charges before an {{unbiased}} tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore (1980). During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in Re Teo Choo Hong (1995) that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{started in}} late 1975 in Bearsville Studios, Woodstock, New York. Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg, the pianist and drummer from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band {{played on the}} album, in {{addition}} to members of Rundgren's group Utopia: Kasim Sulton, Roger Powell and John [...] "Willie" [...] Wilcox. Edgar Winter played the saxophone on [...] "All Revved Up". Rundgren himself played guitar, including the [...] "motorcycle solo" [...] on [...] "Bat Out of Hell". Both Steinman and Rundgren were influenced by Phil Spector and his [...] "wall of sound". According to Meat Loaf, Rundgren put all the arrangements together because although [...] "Jim could <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> instruments" [...] in his head, Steinman hummed rather than orchestrating.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{address was}} {{scheduled}} for October 6, 1917. His opponents in Congress manipulated the schedule so they would follow him and prevent rebuttal. The public, sensing drama, packed the viewing galleries, {{and the majority of}} Senators made sure they were present to <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> speeches. Upon taking the floor, La Follette read in an unemotional detached manner a speech he had prepared defending free speech in wartime. Upon his conclusion there was a spontaneous outburst of applause that had to be gavelled into order. This speech is hailed as [...] "a classic argument for free speech during time of war".|$|E
2500|$|The Rite for Reconciliation of Several Penitents with General Confession and Absolution — {{is similar}} to the second, except that the penitents do not make an actual confession, but only {{manifest}} contrition (general confession). The prayer of absolution is given collectively or [...] "generally" [...] to all those gathered to celebrate the sacrament (general absolution). The penitents are obliged to actually confess each grave sin in their next confession. This form is intended for emergencies and other situations when {{it is not at all}} possible for the priest(s) to <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> individual confessions. This rite has been discouraged for widespread use by the Vatican in many countries recently.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the {{ballistic}} evidence {{connecting the}} {{weapons to the}} murders also {{played a significant role}} in <b>the</b> trial.

Both men appealed but the appellate court upheld the convictions.|$|R

This film adds [...] "rich contextual layers to the case, including a dive into the history of Los Angeles race relations that played such a central role in his acquittal". As James Poniewozik observed in his June 20, 2016, New York Times review: [...] "the director Ezra Edelman pulls back, way back, like a news chopper over a freeway chase. Before you hear about the trial, the documentary says, you need to <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stories—the stories of race, celebrity, sports, America—that it's a part of." [...] The film won a 2017 Academy Award for best Documentary Feature.|$|E
