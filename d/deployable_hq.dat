50|$|Land Command was {{initially}} divided up into eight formations, each one commanded by a Major General, and several smaller units including the training units and training support units in Belize, Brunei, Canada (Suffield for armoured battlegroups and Wainwright for infantry units) and Kenya. Land Command was later divided in 2003, under the LANDmark reorganisation, into two suborganisations, Field Army and Regional Forces, that paralled the Cold War structure of UKLF. Commander Field Army had 2 deployable Divisions (1st Armoured Division, 3rd Mechanised Division), Theatre Troops, Joint Helicopter Command, and Training Support under him, while Commander Regional Forces {{was responsible for}} 3 regenerative Divisions (2nd Division, 4th Division, 5th Division), London District, and UK Support Command Germany. In 2007 {{it was announced that}} a new <b>deployable</b> divisional <b>HQ</b> would be established until at least 2011 as a means of meeting the UK's commitments to provide divisional HQs on a rotational basis to Regional Command (South) in Afghanistan and as the lead nation of Multi-National Division (South-East) in Iraq. This was based in York and formed around the re-established 6th Division.|$|R

40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) is {{the primary}} point of development, direction, and {{coordination}} for all NATO Special Operations-related activities. NSHQ could enhance the effectiveness of NATO Special Operations Forces (SOF) and increase the probability of mission accomplishment when NATO SOF assets are collectively employed in a combined manner by adding an operational command and control capability. This {{would be in the}} form of a Special Operations Component Command (SOCC) "Core. " The SOCC Core is an advanced party of 70 - 150 personnel who provide an organic, rapidly <b>deployable</b> headquarters (<b>HQ)</b> capability for NSHQ. NSHQ does not currently have the ability to provide NATO with a rapidly deployable asset package, which would include a full suite of operational command, control, communication, computers, and intelligence (C 4 I) capabilities equipped with organic SOF and their enablers. The purpose of this thesis is to examine equipment and deployment configurations that will fulfill the mission requirements of the SOCC Core. An analysis of alternatives is conducted to determine which equipment types and configurations achieved the desired robust mission capability at the lowest possible cost. The focus is on the make-up of the four sub-components of the SOCC Core. These sub-components are the Operations Center (OPCEN), All-Source Center (ASC), Support Center (SUPCEN), and the Signals Center (SIGCEN). Possessing a rapidly deployable SOCC Core would be a sound step toward establishing and ensuring interoperability among allied SOF units and commands and would enhance the employment of NATO SOFs.
