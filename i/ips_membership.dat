Within a month the Party’s magazine had a 1,000 paying subscribers. In fear of a Malay language edition and collaboration with the ‘Sarekat Islam’ the colonial authorities stepped up its efforts to ban the IP.|$|R

The IP absorbed {{many members of the}} New Republic Party after its dissolution. In 1989 it merged with the Progressive Federal Party (and others including Malan's NDM) to form the Democratic Party (DP), now known as the Democratic Alliance (DA). The Afrikaner support melted away, and Worrall and Malan left the DP soon after its formation.|$|R

The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv 3) for IPv 4 and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv 2) for IPv 6 add the capability for applications to express source filters on multicast group memberships, which allows receiver applications to determine the set of senders (sources) from which to accept multicast traffic.

40|$|IP {{multicast}} services, especially commercial IP multicast services, are {{not widely}} deployed. One {{of the important}} obstacles to its deployment {{is related to the}} current IP multicast model. The current IP multicast model provides by nature a non-secure, non-controlled way for end systems attached to a network to access multicast traffic. Lack of information about users and access control in this model makes it more vulnerable to different types of attacks and also creates difficulties for a service provider to generate enough revenue. The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used by IPv 4 systems and the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) is used by IPv 6 systems, to report their <b>IP</b> multicast group <b>memberships</b> to any neighboring multicast routers. A new proposal is presented in this thesis to authenticate multicast end users and to control user access to the multicast group communication. The inter-domain security infrastructure AAA framework is incorporated, and the IGMP/MLD messages are extended, to provide user authentication and access control services. The user information in the system can enable a provider to control the distribution of the multicast traffic as well as to collect real time user accounting information...|$|R
