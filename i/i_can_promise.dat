500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the final Cardiff played Ipswich Town in the 2011–12 Football League Championship – it was their last match before the final, which they lost 3–0. Cardiff had a few injury {{concerns}} ahead of the final. Captain Mark Hudson had a calf problem, while midfielder Stephen McPhail had missed Cardiff's last four matches as {{he was suffering from}} Sjögren's syndrome, an immune system disorder. Goalkeeper Heaton was also a doubt with a knock on his ankle, but he was considered likely to start the match. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay acknowledged that Liverpool went into the match as favourites, but he was confident his team could provide a shock: [...] "Obviously we are underdogs but we have a chance in the final, Maybe only a one in 10 chance but that's still a chance if you turn up motivated, fit and organised and I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Farage {{resigned}} as UKIP leader on 4 July 2016 {{with the following}} comment: [...] "During the [...] referendum I said I wanted my country back … now I want my life back" [...] and added that this resignation was final: [...] "I won’t be changing my mind again, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> you", apparently referring to his two previous resignations (in 2009 and 2015).|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{more than}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{consistently}} <b>promise.</b> However, I'll look on {{and see you}} get fair play. If the opposition hit below the belt, I may take a hand in." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last he got {{a chance}} to say, [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>promise</b> that; my mind's been veering round in the other direction. I think I shall tell him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his 2002 {{commencement}} address, {{he described}} his then-current NASA activities as follows: “I am drawing pictures of space vehicles on Mars, but now I'm living inside them, and actually pretending we are ON Mars. I've done that in the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.” He said that “For thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today we are called by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe. Your...attitude...matters. You must believe in discovery and adventure. If you let other people say 'it can't be done,' <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> you, you will be 50 years old like me one day, and we will STILL be sending tin cans around the Earth, round and round going nowhere.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You have {{stricken}} it mortally," [...] I answered, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarcely <b>promise</b> so speedy a funeral. However, {{what more}} I feel," [...] I added, [...] "I will keep to myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} I am only too unworthy of thee, Isabella--but thou must train {{me to be}} that thou wouldst wish; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>promise</b> thee a most willing and {{attentive}} scholar." ...|$|R

60|$|GEORGE. [Trying {{to take it}} lightly.] I'm {{sorry if}} it didn't sound natural. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> you it was sincere.|$|E

6000|$|As soon as Ned {{had left}} the room, sobbing {{in spite of his}} efforts to appear manly, the captain said: [...] "Now, gentlemen, since this must be done, I pray you to do it without loss of time. I will bear it as best <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> you; and as three or four and twenty years at sea makes a man pretty hard and {{accustomed}} to rough usage, I expect I shall stand it as well as another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will I, ma'am?" [...] His {{voice was}} rich with {{gratitude}} and enthusiasm. [...] "Show me to it. I'll dig right in to-morrow. And <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sure <b>promise</b> you one thing, ma'am. You'll never be sorry for lending Hughie Luke {{a hand in}} his trouble--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{note was}} {{expressed}} in these strange words:--"I cannot receive you here; but <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and will, {{come to you}} at your hotel if you will wait for me.

6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} that you told me this," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{nevertheless}} <b>promise</b> you the stage box for Monday night.

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{she said}} with a slight attempt at cheerfulness, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{faithfully}} <b>promise</b> you. <b>I</b> would not jeopardise my husband's life, nor yet his plans, by speaking to him before strangers.

6000|$|She {{looked down}} at him a moment, and then she shook her head. [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> that, father. I am excited already." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't mean outside circumstances," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "But I {{suppose we}} have all got souls and consciences inside of us, and when they don't know what to do, of course we {{are bound to be}} troubled, {{especially}} as they don't know what to tell us, and we don't know whether or not to mind them when they do speak.

6000|$|... "Decidedly!" [...] she answered. [...] "Men {{can always}} shuffle {{out of a}} Leap Year declaration. My man won't be able to escape. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{take your}} cheques, tissue and nerve are my charges.
