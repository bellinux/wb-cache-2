25|$|A commutated DC motor has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} windings {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional electron gas {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> through the sample.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the {{performance}} of the extended shallow water model (ESWM) in evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>flow</b> regime <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents</b> entering the Dez Reservoir was investigated. The continuity equations for fluid and particles and the Navier-Stokes equations govern the entire <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents.</b> The shallow water equations governing the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> the depositing phase <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents</b> are derived from these equations. A case study was conducted on the <b>flow</b> regime <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents</b> entering the Dez Reservoir in Iran from January 2002 to July 2003. Facing a serious sedimentation problem, the dead storage of the Dez Reservoir will be full in the coming 10 years, and the inflowing water in the hydropower conduit system is now becoming turbid. Based on the values of the dimensionless friction number (Nf ≪ 1) and dimensionless entrainment number (NE ≪ 1) <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents,</b> and the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted deposit depths (R 2 = 0. 86) for the <b>flow</b> regime <b>of</b> negligible friction and negligible entrainment (NFNE), the <b>flow</b> regime <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents</b> coming into the Dez Reservoir is considered to be NFNE. The results suggest that the ESWM is an appropriate approach for evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>flow</b> regime <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents</b> in dam reservoirs where the characteristics <b>of</b> turbidity <b>currents,</b> such as the deposit depth, must be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{key problem}} of functional-structural plant {{modelling}} is the partitioning of resources between plant components. One approach to addressing {{this problem is}} based on the simulation of transport between the sources and sinks of a resource. To this end, we exploit an analogy between the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> resources in a plant and the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>currents</b> in an electric circuit, and we present a computationally effective method for solving this circuit. The method lends itself to a straightforward implementation using L-systems, and is thus well suited for simulating the partitioning of resources in spatially-explicit models of growing plants...|$|R

50|$|Like all {{fluorescent}} lamps, low-pressure tanning lamps have a ballast {{to start}} the lamps and limit the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>current.</b> The plasma of excited mercury atoms inside the lamp emits ultraviolet light directly. The lamps are coated on the inside with special phosphors. Unlike high-pressure lamps, the glass that is used in low-pressure lamps filters out all UVC. Once the plasma is fully formed, the plasma strips away the outer electrons from the mercury; when these electrons return to a lower energy level, visible and ultraviolet light is emitted. Some of the short-wave ultraviolet excites the phosphors, which then emits photons in the proper spectrum for tanning.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} (also {{known as}} resistivity, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is an intrinsic property that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> electric <b>current.</b> A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> electric <b>current.</b> Resistivity is commonly {{represented by the}} Greek letter ρ (rho).

50|$|A {{reservoir}} capacitor is a capacitor {{that is used}} to smooth the pulsating DC from an AC rectifier. The {{reservoir capacitor}} releases its stored energy during the part of the AC cycle when the AC source does not supply any power, that is, when the AC source changes its phase resulting in change in 'direction of flow of current'. The change in 'direction of flow of current' of the AC source takes a very small amount of time. In this short gap of time, the continuous <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> gradually moves to the state when it ceases. Using a reservoir capacitor, we fill this gap; since the capacitor releases its stored energy (gets discharged) in that gap of time. This allows the load to be powered at all times without any interruption.|$|E
