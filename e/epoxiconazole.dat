5000|$|Mothproofing {{chemicals}} - Treatment {{of materials}} as a preventive measure before their use, {{as well as}} simply for storage, has a long history. [...] Arsenical compounds were effective in killing larvae but were considered too toxic for human contact even {{in the early twentieth}} century. Triphenyltin chloride was effective at 0.25%. After 1947, chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides of many varieties were found to be effective at the low concentrations practical for preservative treatment. [...] Examples are chlordane at 2% per weight of wool, toxaphene at 0.8%, pentachlorophenol or BHC at 0.5%, DDT at 0.2%, chlordecone and mirex at 0.06%, and dieldrin at 0.05%. Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning. The 1985 United States EPA ban on most uses of Aldrin and Dieldrin exempted moth-proofing in a closed manufacturing process. Triazole, thiazole, and imidazole derivatives have an anti-feeding effect on Tineola bisselliella larvae when wool is treated with these compounds.

40|$|Abstract: The {{conservation}} of fresh kolanuts by farmers in Africa poses a veritable problem occasioning enormous economic loss. Fungicide <b>epoxiconazole</b> {{has been found}} as best way to reduce or avoid mould and mycotoxins secretion. In the aim to evaluate the bio-persistence of its residue in kolanuts, the present study {{has been carried out}} by treatment of kolanuts with <b>epoxiconazole</b> at concentration of 0. 15 g/l. Samples for <b>epoxiconazole</b> residue analysis were collected at 0, 7, 15 and 30 days in order to follow the elimination of the pesticide residue. In parallel, the incidence of the temperature and the nature of kolanuts container on the bio-persistence of <b>epoxiconazole</b> reside has evaluated. As results, a rapid elimination of <b>epoxiconazole</b> has been observed but varied following the nature of kolanuts container. After only 7 days of storage, the fungicide was undetected (LD = 0. 017 mg/kg) with the polyvinyl chloride [PVC] container. The efficiency of traditional container made by leaves of Thaumatococcus daniellii has also been demonstrated with disappearance of the residue at 15 days of storage. The third container made by perforated cardboard retarded the residue elimination until 30 days. Temperatures 26 or 29 °C have not demonstrated their difference in epoxyconazole residue elimination from kolanuts. Taken together, our results suggested the bio-persistence of <b>epoxiconazole</b> residue in kolanuts after the treatment was very low but influenced by the nature of kolanuts container.

Wheat bran was spiked with racemic <b>epoxiconazole</b> at two dose levels of 20 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg (dry weight) to feed T. molitor larvae. The results showed that both the doses of <b>epoxiconazole</b> were taken up by Tenebrio molitor larvae rapidly at the initial stages. There was a significant trend of stereoselective bioaccumulation in the larvae with a preferential accumulation of (-) -epoxiconazole in the 20 mg/kg dose. The stereoselectivity in bioaccumulation in the 2 mg/kg dosage was not obvious compared to the 20 mg/kg group. Results of excretion indicated an active excretion is an important pathway for the larvae to eliminate <b>epoxiconazole</b> which was a passive transport process with non stereoselectivity.

There was also no effect on soil respiration, except for the higher rate quinmerac-treated soil, which evolved 13 % lessC 02 -Cthan the control. The rate of mineralisation of <b>epoxiconazole</b> and quinmerac, and their long-term effect on soil respiration, were measured in three contrasting soils: a sandy loam, a silty clay loam, and a clay soil, using 14 C -labelled active ingredients. The kinetics of the pesticides' mineralisation were quite different, <b>epoxiconazole</b> being hyperbolic, while quinmerac was sigmoidal. The maximum amount of mineralisation of both pesticides occurred in the silty clay loam soil, which had the lowest microbial biomass content. The mineralisation of the pesticides was increased {{by the addition of}} ryegrass, with the greatest effect in the silty clay loam soil, probably because of the large ryegrass C: biomass C ratio. The mineralisation of <b>epoxiconazole</b> was affected by the ryegrass amendment much more than quinmerac. Further additions of the pesticides had no significant effect on soil respiration or pesticide mineralisation. The mineralisation of <b>epoxiconazole</b> and quimnerac was further investigated in the silty clay loam soil, using samples with different crop management histories, and the effects of ryegrass and glucose amendment. Pesticide mineralisation was shown {{to be related to the}} amount of soil microbial biomass, indicating that the difference in mineralisation rate between the three soil types above was not due to differences in their crop management, but innate differences in soil chemistry and microbiology. Ryegrass addition stimulated the mineralisation of <b>epoxiconazole</b> more than quinmerac, while the reverse was true for glucose, indicating that the pesticides were being degraded by two distinct fractions of the microbial biomass. The effects of long-term cumulative field application of the pesticides benomyl, chlorfenvinphos, aldicarb, triadimefon and glyphosate, on soil microbial biomass and mineralisation of soil organic matter were investigated. The addition of aldicarb consistently increased the microbial biomass, due to its beneficial effect on crop growth, but this effect was not reflected in the rate of organic matter mineralisation. However, in general, the continued application of these pesticides for up to 19 years, at slightly higher than the recommended rates, had very little effect on the soil microbial population. The effects of <b>epoxiconazole</b> and triadimefon on soil ergosterol content and microbial biomass C were compared in a sandy loam soil. Both pesticides temporarily reduced soil ergosterol by about 30 %, while biomass C remained largely unaffected. However, when straw was added to the soils, the inhibition of ergosterol was still evident, as was an inhibitory effect on biomass C. The measurement of soil ergosterol was more sensitive to the pesticide effects than biomass C, and could be a useful test in determining changes in fungal populations...|$|E

To evaluate the curative effect, eucalyptus plants were sprayed with an inoculum suspension (2 x 10 (4) urediniospores /mL) {{and with each}} fungicide after 0, 4, 7, or 10 days. For the protective effect, the plants were sprayed with each fungicide and with the inoculum suspension after 0, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days. The number of pustules/leaf, sori/foliar area, and urediniospores/sorus was determined {{on the first two}} apical leaves. The best curative effect was achieved with azoxystrobin, tebuconazole, <b>epoxiconazole</b> + pyraclostrobin, and triadimenol, since the number of sori/foliar area and urediniospores/sorus was reduced when applied up to 7 days after inoculation. Regarding protective effect, azoxystrobin and triadimenol were the most effective fungicides, as no pustules formed on the leaves up to 21 days after spray. Azoxystrobin, tebuconazole, triadmenol and trifloxystrobin were absorbed within 30 min after application and no P. psidii infection was detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of chlorothalonil and paraffinic oil alone and in combinations with the registered fungicides propiconazole, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, <b>epoxiconazole</b> and pyrimethanil was evaluated {{in a field}} experiment over two cropping cycles in 2013 and 2014 in Northern Queensland, Australia, for control of yellow Sigatoka (caused by Mycosphaerella musicola) of banana. The predominantly applied by the banana industry treatment mancozeb with paraffinic oil was included for comparison. The results from the two cropping cycles suggested that all chemicals used with paraffinic oil were as effective or more effective than when applied with chlorothalonil, and chlorothalonil alone. Difenoconazole and <b>epoxiconazole</b> with paraffinic oil followed by propiconazole with paraffinic oil were the most effective treatments. Pyrimethanil and tebuconazole plus chlorothalonil were the least effective treatments. None of the chemical treatments was phytotoxic or reduced yield...|$|E
40|$|In soil, the {{determination}} of total concentration using an exhaustive extraction method is not relevant to evaluate the exposure of an organism to a chemical, because of sorption processes. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the bioavailability of organic contaminants to earthworms, and to their effect on sensitive earthworm species found in cultivated fields, such as Aporrectodea icterica [1]. As ecosystem engineers, earthworms influence soil structure and chemistry and are thus key-organisms for the health of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they can be threatened by contaminants such as the fungicide <b>epoxiconazole,</b> which is persistent in soil and presents a chronic toxicity even towards a resistant earthworm species (Eisenia fetida) at a concentration close to the recommended dose. This study aimed to propose a mild extraction method to evaluate the bioavailability of the fungicide <b>epoxiconazole</b> to the earthworm Aporrectodea icterica [2]. Experiments were conducted in soils presenting various textures and organic carbon contents, spiked with formulated <b>epoxiconazole</b> 7 to 56 days prior to their extraction at one-fold to ten-fold the recommended dose. In parallel, the <b>epoxiconazole</b> concentration was determined in exposed earthworms. All the analysis were performed by UHPLCMS/ MS. The fungicide’s effects were evaluated by measuring weight gain, enzymatic activities and total protein contents. The proposed method to evaluate bioavailability was based on the pesticide entrapment in the cavity of hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin, thus fulfilling the criteria of the ISO 17402 norm [3]. Furthermore, this mild method was demonstrated to be sensitive to soil sorption capacities and to ageing. The mild extraction method was then applied to explore the relationship between total and bioavailable concentrations in soil and in A. icterica, over 7 or 28 days exposure time. This demonstrated the proportionality between <b>epoxiconazole</b> concentration in earthworm and available in soil (up to 96 %, with regression coefficient R 2 0. 98). Sublethal effects on earthworm remained not significant. References 1. C. Pelosi, S. Joimel, D. Makowski, 2013. Chemosphere 90, 895 - 900 2. S. Nélieu, G. Delarue, E. Ollivier, P. Awad, F.

In addition to yield losses, F. culmorum also produces mycotoxins such as the trichothecenes deoxynivalenol and nivalenol. Triazoles are widely used {{around the world to}} control Fusarium spp. but results are not always satisfactory and resistances within the Fusarium genus have been reported. In order to evaluate the triazoles sensitivity of F. culmorum, a collection of 105 strains with different origins, years of isolation, host plants and chemotypes was constituted. The concentrations leading to a 50 % reduction of the optical density (EC 50) of those strains towards tebuconazole and <b>epoxiconazole</b> were evaluated using microtiter plate assays. Significant differences of EC 50 towards tebuconazole (range = 0. 15 to 1. 38 mg/l) and <b>epoxiconazole</b> (range = 0. 26 to 1. 86 mg/l) were observed. Cross-resistance was found between fungicides (ρ= 0. 6), with tebuconazole being more efficient (mean= 0. 32 mg/l) than <b>epoxiconazole</b> (mean= 0. 57 mg/l), although an interaction between the factors ‘strains’ and ‘fungicide’ was noticed. When compared to F. graminearum and F. cerealis, F. culmorum appeared to be the most sensitive species. Interestingly, nivalenol-producing strains of F. culmorum were more resistant to both fungicides compared the deoxynivalenol-producing ones. prix Marasas pour le meilleur poste...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plants {{is difficult because}} of our poor understanding of foliar penetration by pesticides, which governs the amount {{of pesticide}} available for volatilization from the leaf surface. The description of foliar penetration is still incomplete because experimental measurements of this complex process are difficult. In this study, the dynamics of leaf penetration of 14 C-chlorothalonil and 14 C-epoxiconazole applied to wheat leaves were measured in a volatilization chamber, which allowed us to simultaneously measure pesticide volatilization. Fungicide penetration into leaves was characterized using a well-defined sequential extraction procedure distinguishing pesticide fractions residing at different foliar compartments; this enabled us to accurately measure the penetration rate constant into the leaves. The effect of pesticide formulation was also examined by comparing formulated and pure <b>epoxiconazole.</b> We observed a strong effect of formulation on leaf penetration {{in the case of}} a systemic product. Furthermore, the penetration rate constant of formulated <b>epoxiconazole</b> was almost three times that of pure <b>epoxiconazole</b> (0. 47 ± 0. 20 and 0. 17 ± 0. 07, respectively). Our experimental results showed high recovery rates of the radioactivity applied within the range of 90. 5 to 105. 2 %. Moreover, our results confirm that pesticide physicochemical properties are key factors in understanding leaf penetration of pesticide and its volatilization. This study provides important and useful parameters for mechanistic models describing volatilization of fungicides applied to plants, which are scarce in the literatur...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to assess fungicides to combat Sansevieria trifasciata var. Hahnii anthracnose. Twelve fungicides (alone or in mixture) were evaluated on the infection and severity of C. sansevieriae on a detached- leaf system. Fungicides used were azoxystrobin, boscalid + pyraclostrobin, carbendazim + mancozeb, difenoconazole, <b>epoxiconazole</b> + carbendazim, folpet, imazalil, thiophanate-methyl + mancozeb, myclobutanil, and prochloraz. The study was carried out at the Plant Biotechnology Laboratory of the Agricultural Research Center of the University of Costa Rica, during the first semester of 2012. Each chemical treatment was applied by aspersion {{on the day of}} inoculation (0 dai) or three days after it (3 dai). The number and diameter of the lesions were evaluated after seven, eleven and fifteen dai. Fungicide, application moment, fungicide x application moment interaction and fungicide x evaluation moment interaction significantly affected (p< 0, 0001) both evaluated variables. Azoxystrobin, boscalid + pyraclostrobin, carbendazim + mancozeb, <b>epoxiconazole</b> + carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl + mancozeb provided 100 % protection to Sansevieria leaves throughout the evaluation period (15 days) when applied the same day of inoculation (0 dai). After three days of inoculation (3 dai) only <b>epoxiconazole</b> + carbendazim completely inhibited the pathogen establishment (zero incidence) in the three evaluations when applied azoxystrobin and carbendazim + mancozeb, the incidence was 0 % after seven and eleven days for the first treatment and after seven days for the second one. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study investigates if {{acclimatization}} to residual pesticide {{contamination in}} agricultural soils {{is reflected in}} detoxification, antioxidant enzyme activities and energy budget of earthworms. Five fields within a joint agricultural area exhibited different chemical and farming histories from conventional cultivation to organic pasture. Soil multiresidual pesticide analysis revealed up to 9 molecules including atrazine up to 2. 4  ng g(- 1) dry soil. Exposure history of endogeic Aporrectodea caliginosa and Allolobophora chlorotica modified their responses to pesticides. In the field, activities of soluble glutathione-S-transferases (sGST) and catalase increased with soil pesticide contamination in A.  caliginosa. Pesticide stress was reflected in depletion of energy reserves in A.  chlorotica. Acute exposure of pre-adapted and naïve A.  caliginosa to pesticides (fungicide Opus(®), 0. 1  μg active ingredient <b>epoxiconazole</b> g(- 1) dry soil, RoundUp Flash(®), 2. 5  μg active ingredient glyphosate g(- 1) dry soil, and their mixture), revealed that environmental pre-exposure accelerated activation of the detoxification enzyme sGST towards <b>epoxiconazole...</b>|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{pesticide}} fate {{in conservation}} agricultural systems requires a detailed {{understanding of their}} interaction with decomposing surface crop residues (mulch). Adsorption and desorption behavior of glyphosate, s-metolachlor and <b>epoxiconazole</b> was investigated on maize mulch residues decomposed under laboratory and field conditions. Our conceptual approach included characterization of chemical composition and hydrophobicity of mulch residues in order to generate parameters to predict sorption behavior. Adsorption of s-metolachlor and <b>epoxiconazole</b> greatly increased with mulch decomposition, whereas glyphosate adsorption was less affected but its desorption was increased. Mulch characteristics including aromaticity, hydrophobicity and polarity indices were strongly correlated to Koc of the non-ionic pesticides. A predictive model based on compositional data (CoDa) analysis revealed that the sorption capacity of decomposing mulch can be predicted from descriptors such as aromatic and alkyl C corresponding respectively to lignin and NDF biochemical fractions.

40|$|Abstract Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, {{the cause}} of tan spot of wheat was first {{recorded}} in New Zealand in 1979, but only on wheat seed. However, this pathogen has recently been recorded as causing possible yield losses in isolated crops. A small plot trial {{set up in a}} central Canterbury crop of cv. Saracen tested several fungicides alone or in mixtures. Control was not entirely effective since tan spot infection was well established when the first applications were made at GS 33 (third node detectible). Nevertheless, two triazoles (propiconazole and prothioconazole) and three SDHI fungicides (isopyrazam, bixafen plus prothioconazole and fluxapyroxad plus <b>epoxiconazole)</b> all gave similar levels of control either when applied alone or in mixtures. Two triazoles (<b>epoxiconazole</b> and difenoconazole) were less effective alone, while addition of strobilurin (pyraclostrobin) to mixtures gave little extra control. Several treatments showed significant increases in green leaf retention and final grain yield.

Nutka and Zyta was grown during a field experiment established in the Production and Experimental Station in Bałcyny in 2006 – 2007. The experimental factor was chemical crop protection: <b>epoxiconazole,</b> kresoxim-methyl and fenpropimorph applied at growth stages BBCH 33 – 35 as well as dimoxystrobin and <b>epoxiconazole</b> applied at BBCH 51 – 53. In this experiment, microscopic observations and conventional PCR assays were used as complementary methods. The quantification of Fusarium poae DNA by qPCR demonstrated the effectiveness of chemical protection against the analyzed fungal species. Lower monthly precipitation levels and higher daily temperatures intensified grain infections, in particular those caused by F. poae. A significant correlation was determined between the number of F. poae cultures isolated from winter wheat grain and the quantity of pathogenic DNA in grain identified by qPCR. Grain infections caused by F. poae lowered yield and thousand seed weight...|$|E

The present study focuses on understanding {{the role of}} the substrates mainly found in such buffer zones for pesticide adsorption and desorption. Radiolabeled [14 C]isoproturon, [14 C]metazachlor, and [14 C]epoxiconazole were used to measure adsorption and desorption isotherms on wetland sediments and plants and forest soil and litter from two sites in France. Wetland sediments and forest soil exhibited the most important potential for pesticide adsorption. Wetland plants and forest litter also showed high adsorption coefficients and were associated with highly hysteretic desorption, particularly for the moderately mobile isoproturon and metazachlor. Adsorption of the highly hydrophobic <b>epoxiconazole</b> was strong and associated with weak desorption from all substrates. Calculated sorption coefficients were larger than those classically measured on soils. Isoproturon, metazachlor, and <b>epoxiconazole</b> KOC sorption coefficients ranged from 84 to 372, 131 to 255, and 1, 356 to 3, 939 L/kg, respectively. Therefore, specifically collecting buffer zone substrate sorption data is needed for modeling purposes. Results showed that forests and wetlands present potential for pesticide retention.
