5|$|A <b>footpath</b> and National Cycle Network {{cycleway}} run {{alongside the}} Portishead Railway {{and along the}} old towpath.|$|E
5|$|The Cuckoo Line closed {{shortly after}} the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to {{passengers}} on 14June 1965, and the line closed for goods traffic on 26April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line trackbed was converted to the Cuckoo Trail long-distance <b>footpath</b> in 1990. Much of {{the route of the}} Hospital Railway is also now a <b>footpath.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Monarch's Way long {{distance}} <b>footpath</b> crosses the valley.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has three objectives; 1) describe {{the distribution of}} <b>footpaths</b> in the outer suburbs of Ottawa, 2) quantify the impact <b>footpaths</b> have on network connectivity in the outer western suburban neighborhoods of Ottawa, 3) quantify the impact of <b>footpaths</b> on destination-based walkability measures in the outer western suburban neighborhoods of Ottawa. The distribution of <b>footpaths</b> is assessed using a principal component analysis on 86 observations (<b>footpaths)</b> and 11 variables (land usage, transit connection, income, population density). Network connectivity is measured using the link-node ratio, the gamma index, and the alpha index, as well a node betweenness centrality. Walkability is measured in ArcGIS through an origin-destination cost matrix. The {{results show that the}} distribution of <b>footpaths</b> cannot be explained by the selected variables. <b>Footpaths</b> slightly decrease overall network connectivity and re-work node betweenness centrality. <b>Footpaths</b> have no impact on destination-based walkability. And so, <b>footpaths</b> may serve as better pedestrian routes but not necessarily as faster routes through the outer western suburbs of Ottawa...|$|R
50|$|Forres has {{a network}} of <b>footpaths</b> that have been {{established}} and waymarked by the Forres <b>Footpaths</b> Trust in recent years.|$|R
50|$|The brook is {{most easily}} viewed from <b>footpaths</b> {{alongside}} Toddington Road or <b>footpaths</b> running though the nearby Hockwell Ring estate.|$|R
5|$|The short channel splits into Newmill Channel and Reading Sewer {{a little}} further to the north, the first flowing southwards, and the second {{originally}} flowing northwards, when it was the main channel for the River Rother. A public <b>footpath</b> follows the eastern bank of Potman's Heath Channel, and continues along the north {{bank of the river}} to Blackwall Bridge, where it becomes part of the Sussex Border Path, a long-distance <b>footpath</b> that follows the county boundary.|$|E
5|$|Crossing the Back Rivers by {{a series}} of {{low-level}} bridges is the Northern Outfall Sewer which leads to the Abbey Mill Pumping Station, both of which were designed by Joseph Bazalgette in the 1860s. Today, the route of the embankment that encloses the sewer from Bow to Beckton is followed by a public <b>footpath,</b> The Greenway.|$|E
5|$|The 11 {{miles of}} Devon section remains open, despite various threats to its future, {{and is now}} a {{designated}} country park and local nature reserve, and allows navigation. The Somerset section was closed in 1867, and is gradually disappearing from the landscape, although sections are now used as a <b>footpath.</b> It maintains a historical interest and has been subject to some archaeological excavations.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays <b>footpaths</b> {{are mainly}} used for {{recreation}} {{and have been}} frequently linked together, along with bridle paths and newly created <b>footpaths,</b> to create long distance trails. Also organizations have been formed in various countries to protect {{the right to use}} public <b>footpaths,</b> including the Ramblers Association in England. <b>Footpaths</b> are now also found in botanic gardens, arboretums, regional parks, conservation areas, wildlife gardens, and open-air museums. There are also educational trails, themed walks, sculpture trails and historic interpretive trails.|$|R
50|$|Along Szakácsi {{there are}} two long-distance <b>footpaths,</b> the red Cserehát route and Országos Kektúra, the blue route, part of the European network of long-distance <b>footpaths.</b>|$|R
25|$|Public <b>footpaths</b> in {{the village}} are clearly marked by green fingerposts. Dog fouling {{throughout}} the parish, including <b>footpaths,</b> is strictly prohibited with heavy fines for infringement.|$|R
5|$|The Air Ministry {{placed an}} order in 1922 for {{the closure of}} the public <b>footpath</b> that ran through the site, {{providing}} £750 for the maintenance of nearby Green Lane where the path originated. The eventual order, dated 15 October 1924, replaced two previous orders from 1922 and 1923 which had required a replacement route, though no such route was established.|$|E
5|$|The Bosque Municipal (Municipal Forest) was {{donated by}} the Ross family in 1935. The main access to the forest {{is in front of}} Ross Casino, near Paseo el Sol; or by a road near the Colegio Preciosa Sangre. The forest has a <b>footpath</b> {{surrounded}} by palms, pines, and many other varieties of trees.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgewater Way is {{a scheme}} to redevelop the canal {{and make it more}} {{accessible}} to users, particularly cyclists. The 40-mile development, which includes a new towpath, will form part of the National Cycle and <b>Footpath</b> Network as Regional Route number 82.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a good}} {{network of}} <b>footpaths</b> in this area, {{allowing}} you to explore an interesting area with many ditches, wet fields and some damp pasture. At Swanton Court, the mediaeval moat {{can be seen from}} public <b>footpaths.</b> Swanton Mill used to be open to the public, but unfortunately has now closed. It can still be viewed from <b>footpaths</b> passing close-by.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{illuminated}} bus stops {{either side of}} the expressway, which can be accessed through paved, broad <b>footpaths.</b> These <b>footpaths</b> divide the expressway with its service roads on either side.|$|R
50|$|In 1877, {{the family}} closed the <b>footpath's</b> on the Fawe Park estate. There was mass public {{opposition}} to the closure and the protestors won a court case, declaring the <b>footpaths</b> open to the public.|$|R
5|$|The Driffield Navigation, Leven Canal, Market Weighton Canal and Pocklington Canal offer {{glimpses of}} tranquillity. Stamford Bridge {{is the site}} of the famous battle, and the Yorkshire Wolds Way is a long-distance <b>footpath</b> that takes a winding route through the Yorkshire Wolds to Filey.|$|E
5|$|The Middleton Railway, a {{preserved}} heritage steam railway, operates from {{headquarters and}} museum at Moor Road Hunslet to Park Halt. It is operated by volunteers. From Middleton, Park Halt is accessed by a <b>footpath</b> that was originally a waggonway. The railway celebrated its 200th anniversary of steam haulage in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The River Pinn {{runs through}} the site from north to south, passing Hillingdon House and the Battle of Britain Bunker. The land around the river is mainly wooded and {{designated}} as greenbelt, and Hillingdon Golf Course borders {{the south of the}} station. A <b>footpath</b> through the site that had closed in 1988 was reopened in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of <b>footpaths.</b> The large number of <b>footpaths</b> causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer <b>footpaths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Flixton House would {{probably}} have been quite unremarkable in a national context had Ralph Wright in 1826 not closed several <b>footpaths</b> across his estate, <b>footpaths</b> that the public had until then been allowed access to.|$|R
50|$|There {{are public}} <b>footpaths</b> to the Castle from Codnor Market Place, {{where there is}} an {{information}} board in partnership with Derbyshire County Council, as well as public <b>footpaths</b> from the east in the Erewash valley.|$|R
5|$|The Somerset {{section is}} largely dry and is {{gradually}} {{disappearing into the}} landscape, {{as a result of}} roads improvements and ploughing, but a <b>footpath</b> has been established along much of its route, and archaeological excavations of the lift at Nynehead, the only one where there are still substantial remains, were carried out between 1998 and 2003 by the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society.|$|E
5|$|The {{east end}} of the Cleveland Railway, from Loftus to Brotton plus the {{connection}} to the Tees Valley Line west of Saltburn, is still in use as a mineral railway serving Boulby Mine. There are no passenger services. The short connection from the Tees Valley Line to Normanby Jetty survived until 1966 as the Normanby Branch of the Tees Valley Line, serving the Normanby brickworks and Eston railway station. It is now a public <b>footpath,</b> the South Bank Walkway, which links Flatts Lane Country Park to South Bank. The middle section of the line from Normanby to Guisborough is in private ownership or has been built on, though the former railway's embankment can still be clearly seen running alongside the A171 Middlesbrough Road. The section from Guisborough to Slapewath has {{been converted into a}} public <b>footpath,</b> the Guisborough Branch Walkway.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate is}} private {{property}} and is not open to the public, but the Greensand Way long distance walk crosses the parkland east-west {{to the north of}} the house and a public <b>footpath</b> crosses the southern parkland close to the lake on a similar alignment.|$|E
50|$|Mykines Island has no roads: {{access to}} other parts of the island is on foot, using well-used <b>footpaths.</b> Mykines village, similarly, has no streets, and <b>footpaths</b> weave between the buildings. Residents use {{all-terrain}} vehicles to some extent.|$|R
50|$|The European long-distance paths are {{a network}} of long-distance <b>footpaths</b> that {{traverse}} Europe. While most long-distance <b>footpaths</b> in Europe are located in just one country or region, each of these numbered European long-distance paths passes through many different countries.|$|R
50|$|<b>Footpaths</b> {{cross the}} heaths.|$|R
5|$|The {{promontory}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust in December 1953. The Southwest Coast Path was created in 1978, and runs {{along the top of}} Zennor Head as part of its , following the edge of the cliffs closely. Zennor in Darkness, the 1994 McKitterick Prize-winning novel by Helen Dunmore, was partly set around Zennor Head. In 2009 the headland suffered flooding which affected the cliff-top <b>footpath.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{viewable}} from the visitor centre, footpaths {{next to the}} A149 and down the East Bank, the beach and the road running from the beach {{back to the main}} road. It can be accessed by footpaths at three points, each leading to one or more bird hides. Beach Road and the beach itself form part of the Peddars Way long distance <b>footpath.</b>|$|E
5|$|The route took {{a mostly}} direct path from a {{junction}} immediately south of Hellingly Station, past Farm and Park House Sidings, stopping places to load and unload produce and supplies from outbuildings of the hospital. Much of the railway {{has been converted}} to <b>footpath,</b> {{and many of the}} buildings formerly served by the line are now abandoned.|$|E
40|$|This {{drawing of}} Michigan, {{taken from the}} August 1958 issue of Hy-Lighter Magazine, shows the major trails used by Native Americans when {{traveling}} throughout the state. The map was included with an article by Philip P. Mason entitled "Early Indian Trails Traced Highways of the Future From <b>Footpaths</b> to Expressways. "The Native American <b>footpaths</b> in Michigan connected Native American villages throughout the state. Settlers coming to Michigan used the already well-worn paths for travel {{and many of these}} <b>footpaths</b> evolved into modern highways...|$|R
