5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} worth it to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E

25|$|Some {{doubt this}} biographical {{interpretation}} of Nemean 7 {{since it is}} largely based on marginal comments by scholiasts and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave {{different versions of the}} myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma. Nemean 7 in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar's victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts to explain <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> with no agreed success.|$|E

Prior to World War I, Italy had pioneered military aviation in the Italo-Turkish War during 1911–1912. Its army also contained one of the world's foremost theorists about the future of military aviation, Giulio Douhet; Douhet also had a practical side, as he was largely responsible for the development of Italy's Caproni bombers starting in 1913. Italy also had the advantage of a delayed entry into World War I, not starting the fight until 24 May 1915, but took no advantage of <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as aviation was concerned.|$|E
500|$|In Maine, {{the trail}} extends into even harsher environments, and sub-alpine and alpine growth descends to lower elevations. Alpine {{growth in the}} state ranges from around [...] in the Mahoosuc Range to below [...] {{in parts of the}} Hundred-Mile Wilderness, where nearly every area higher than [...] is {{evergreen}} forest. These forests include more species of evergreen, as well. In addition to the white pine, spruce and hemlock prevalent further south, Maine has many cedar trees along the trail. Near the northern terminus, there are even some tamarack (larch), a coniferous, pine-needled deciduous tree, which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare. The hemlocks in Maine are also notable, as the woolly adelgid, which has ravaged populations further south, has not come into the state yet, and may be unable to make <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> north due to the cold climate.|$|E

500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took me many years; I finished <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E

On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> Makeyev declared that the Atsætæ Church was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because [...] "what was preserved in Ossetia is not [...] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage".|$|E
2500|$|Burnt Letters is the {{follow-up}} to Henderson's self-titled debut album, which featured re-recorded covers {{of the selected}} songs he performed as a finalist on The X Factor Australia. During an interview with Renowned for Sound in March 2014, Henderson confirmed that he had already begun work on Burnt Letters, stating: [...] "I'm really proud of everything I've written for <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> I think I've taken some risks {{with some of the}} songs, but everything has a lot of soul and depth." [...] He later told Girl.com.au that the songs he wrote years ago were also being recorded for the album. Henderson worked on Burnt Letters for eight months with several record producers and songwriters, including Louis Schoorl, Jon Hume, Alex Hope and Lindsay Rimes, among others. After writing new songs for the album, Henderson presented them to Sony Music Australia and received good feedback from the label. He said [...] "they were really impressed with the way I could carry a song and tell a story." [...] Despite his music not being typical pop, Henderson revealed that Sony did not interfere with his [...] "songwriting processes or tone" [...] for Burnt Letters, admitting that the album is exactly the way he wanted it.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s La Ola Blanca had split up and Dr. Wagner began feuding with the now tecnico Ángel Blanco, even taking <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as to {{defeating}} Ángel Blanco in an Apuesta match on January 1, 1979, leaving his former team mate bald. Dr. Wagner would briefly hold the Mexican National Light Heavyweight title {{for a third}} time in 1973, holding it for 19 days, winning it from Astro Rey and losing it to Enrique Vera. On March 16, 1980, Dr. Wagner teamed with El Texano to face Robot C-3 and Astro Rey in the finals of a [...] "Losers advance" [...] tournament, forcing Robot C-3 to unmask and the already unmasked Astro Rey to have his hair shaved off. In the early 1980s Dr. Wagner was beginning to show his age, working as a tecnico would still be able to produce good matches teaming with El Solitario or Aníbal against Ángel Blanco. When he turned on El Solitario and Aníbal he got one last run as a main event wrestler as a reunited Ola Blanca faced Solitario and Aníbal. On December 1, 1985, Dr. Wagner and El Solitario finally met in a one on one Luchas de Apuesta in the main event of a show that sold out the 15,000-seat Plaza de Toros Monumental in Monterrey, which was the largest and most profitable show in Monterrey up until that point. In the end El Solitario defeated Dr. Wagner, two falls to one and claimed the white mask as the biggest Apuesta win of El Solitario's career. Following his unmasking Dr. Wagner focused on introducing his son, wrestling as Dr. Wagner, Jr., to the professional ranks.|$|E
