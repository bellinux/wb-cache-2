25|$|While Barbour {{evidenced}} {{no personal}} history of {{an interest in}} Jewish affairs prior to rejoining the Senate in 1940, the plight of victims of Nazi genocide stirred him deeply. In April 1943, {{along with many other}} Congressmen and Senators, Barbour may have attended a performance of We Will Never Die, a pageant written by Ben Hecht and produced by the Bergson Group to commemorate two million European Jews who had already been murdered. In the fall of 1943, he was one {{of a small group of}} senators and congressmen who, together with the vice president, met with 400 rabbis who marched with the Bergson <b>Group</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> in 1943, shortly before Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.

25|$|Lewis' efforts {{convinced}} {{most members}} of Congress and relevant administration officials that the women's groups represented only {{a small minority of}} Southerners. He did so in part by winning the support of other key Southern groups. First he won over his own organization, the United Confederate Veterans, which in March 1901 unanimously passed resolutions asking the government to proceed with creation of the Confederate section. He also won the support of the Ladies Southern Relief Society, an important Confederate women's <b>group</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. Lewis also won over Congress and the administration by undermining the UDC and CSMA's opposition to the reburial plan. Once more working through his own veterans' group, the UCV convinced a number of government officials that the CSMA was too new (just a year old) to accurately represent Southern views. Lewis dampened the outcry by the CSMA and other ladies' memorial associations by convincing them that their importance in the South would be maintained. Lewis realized that these groups continued to thrive in part because they set the dates for and organized Civil War commemorations. Lewis convinced the CSMA and many Southern women's groups that {{they would be able to}} do so at Arlington as well, which would enhance their prestige. These tactics worked: In the late spring of 1901, a delegation from several Confederate veterans' groups visited Secretary of War Elihu Root and convinced him to proceed with the reburials at Arlington.|$|E
