5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, NBN's Perth-based owner, Parry Corporation, spun off NBN Limited {{into a new}} company, NBN Enterprises, and took a 40% stake in the new company, with Security Pacific Capital Corporation buying 60%. Parry sold their stake soon after, holding onto Papua New Guinea {{television}} station NTN, which NBN had helped to set up. <b>Fulcrum</b> Media's move to later purchase the station was a source for confusion, as {{it was revealed that}} many companies, including the NSW State Superannuation Board and Westpac Banking Corporation, held substantial stakes in <b>Fulcrum</b> Media. Parry Corp's new owner CityWest issued a court challenge to re-acquire NBN, but it was revealed that CityWest was held by Hong Kong company Hung Lung Corporation, thereby violating foreign ownership laws. Following ownership changes, NBN Enterprises was sold to Washington H. Soul Pattinson for A$36 million.|$|E
5|$|When Mauser enters, Chuck flashes on his watch, {{identifying}} {{him as a}} <b>Fulcrum</b> agent. Mauser tells Chuck that {{he knows}} that Casey and Sarah are CIA {{and that they are}} protecting an unknown asset. He reveals that Ned is a <b>Fulcrum</b> agent who caused the disturbance so Mauser could infiltrate the Buy More. At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages were led to believe, having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the Intersect are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the Intersect has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E
50|$|When Bryce {{says the}} name of <b>Fulcrum's</b> {{operation}} to steal the Intersect, Chuck has a flash.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fulcrum’s</b> {{target market}} {{primarily}} remains USA, UK, Europe, & Asia Pacific Region but {{it intends to}} foray into other markets including South Africa and Middle East.|$|R
5000|$|The {{playground}} {{horse that}} is used as an entrance to <b>Fulcrum's</b> secret base is {{a reference to the}} opening scene and Sarah Connor's dream in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.|$|R
5|$|As Mauser escorts {{him from}} the Buy More, Chuck urges Devon to disarm Ned. As Chuck is taken in an {{ambulance}} to a <b>Fulcrum</b> facility, Devon, Jeff Barnes (Scott Krinsky), Lester Patel (Vik Sahay), Big Mike (Mark Christopher Lawrence), and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) make a plan. Lester unsuccessfully tries to tackle Ned, but Morgan manages to distract Ned long for Big Mike and Devon to tackle him and end the hostage situation.|$|E
5|$|Time and Chance (2002), a New York Times Bestseller, {{continues}} {{the story of}} Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband, and focuses on the rift between Henry II and Thomas Becket. Time and Chance spans a 15-year period from 1156 to 1171 as Henry II became estranged from his wife (although Eleanor and Henry have eight children during thirteen years), and from his close friend and advisor Thomas Becket. King Henry's decision to elevate Becket to the Archbishop of Canterbury becomes a <b>fulcrum</b> for discord between Henry and Eleanor.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the <b>fulcrum</b> of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
40|$|The {{likelihood}} {{calculation of}} {{a vast number of}} particles forms the computational bottleneck for the particle filter in applications where the observation model is complicated, especially when map or image processing is involved. In this paper, a numerical fitting approach is proposed to speed up the particle filter in which the likelihood of particles is analytically inferred/fitted, explicitly or implicitly, based on that of a small number of so-called <b>fulcrums.</b> It is demonstrated to be of fairly good estimation accuracy when an appropriate fitting function and properly distributed <b>fulcrums</b> are used. The construction of the fitting function and <b>fulcrums</b> are addressed respectively in detail. To avoid intractable multivariate fitting in multi-dimensional models, a nonparametric kernel density estimator such as the nearest neighbor smoother or the uniform kernel average smoother can be employed for implicit likelihood fitting. Simulations based on a benchmark one-dimensional model and multi-dimensional mobile robot localization are provided. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|Roark is {{mentioned}} {{again in the}} finale, where it is revealed that a device called The Key was split between the three main Intersect designers. Roark kept his piece of the device for <b>Fulcrum's</b> uses.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Sarah and Casey {{learn that}} Ned is {{unmarried}} and had earlier called Mauser {{rather than his}} wife, as the hostages were led to believe. They follow the ambulance containing Chuck and Mauser and shoot its tires, sending the vehicle into a Christmas tree lot and allowing Chuck to escape. After a brief fight, Mauser surrenders, confident that <b>Fulcrum</b> will rescue him. To protect Chuck, Sarah executes Mauser. Unknown to Sarah, Chuck watches the entire confrontation in horror from afar. She lies to Chuck and tells him that Mauser has been arrested. At the Buy More, Ellie and Morgan's girlfriend Anna Wu (Julia Ling) praise Lester for his act of bravery. Morgan watches as Lester grabs Anna and kisses her, turning away before Anna pulls away from Lester in disgust. The episode closes with both Morgan and Chuck heartbroken, Morgan believing Anna to be unfaithful, and Chuck believing Sarah to be a murderer.|$|E
5|$|The scene then {{changes to}} Chuck and Sarah's wedding, {{after which they}} receive a wedding present from Hartley. Two weeks later, Chuck returns from his honeymoon to a deserted Castle, where he learns from Decker {{that he has been}} {{manipulated}} his entire spy career, leading to him receiving the Intersect and facing <b>Fulcrum,</b> the Ring, Daniel Shaw, and Volkoff. It is then revealed that Hartley's gift was all of Volkoff Industries' assets, giving Chuck and Sarah almost a billion dollars. Chuck purchases the Buy More from the government's front company, and he, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) set up their own freelance spy operation in Castle to investigate the conspiracy involving Chuck. Morgan then spots a pair of glasses in a box of Chuck's belongings sent from Beckman. Morgan puts them on and accidentally uploads an Intersect.|$|E
5|$|United dropped {{once again}} to the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season. Dinnis was {{replaced}} by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the <b>fulcrum</b> of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in 1989. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 1991–92 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement.|$|E
50|$|NBC.com {{suggests}} that Jill {{is believed to}} have a sizable amount of knowledge on the Intersect computer, as well as <b>Fulcrum's</b> plans for it. Jill's relationships with both Chuck and Bryce made her a dangerous liability to both.|$|R
40|$|The {{likelihood}} {{calculation of}} {{a vast number of}} particles is the computational bottleneck for the particle filter in applications where the observation information is rich. For fast computing the likelihood of particles, a numerical fitting approach is proposed to construct the Likelihood Probability Density Function (Li-PDF) by using a comparably small number of so-called <b>fulcrums.</b> The likelihood of particles is thereby analytically inferred, explicitly or implicitly, based on the Li-PDF instead of directly computed by utilizing the observation, which can significantly reduce the computation and enables real time filtering. The proposed approach guarantees the estimation quality when an appropriate fitting function and properly distributed <b>fulcrums</b> are used. The details for construction of the fitting function and <b>fulcrums</b> are addressed respectively in detail. In particular, to deal with multivariate fitting, the nonparametric kernel density estimator is presented which is flexible and convenient for implicit Li-PDF implementation. Simulation comparison with a variety of existing approaches on a benchmark 1 -dimensional model and multi-dimensional robot localization and visual tracking demonstrate the validity of our approach.

50|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{analgesic}} and/or anti-inflammatory medications, regular breaks while using the small devices, muscle strengthening and stretching, massage, spinal manipulation and mobilsation, posture instruction and spinal <b>fulcrums.</b> Biomechanical analysis suggests {{a combination of}} approaches is best and gives more lasting results.|$|R
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the <b>fulcrum,</b> where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked {{a turning point}} in Bergkamp's career. Wenger, who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp's talent and wanted to use him as a <b>fulcrum</b> of the team's forward play. Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regimen pleased Bergkamp. Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996–97 season, Bergkamp was more influential in the first team, creating 13 assists. Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using his left foot. He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot. Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute. Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of 8 wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.|$|E
25|$|The lever is a movable {{bar that}} pivots on a <b>fulcrum</b> {{attached}} to a fixed point. The lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the <b>fulcrum,</b> or a pivot.|$|E
50|$|His {{recent work}} {{includes}} large outdoor sculptures which behave as weightless objects. The sculpture's internal mechanisms consisted of axles, ball-bearings, universal joints, ball & sockets, <b>fulcrums</b> and massive counterweights, {{give them the}} ability to spin, tilt, rise/fall and glide horizontally and eventually return to equilibrium.|$|R
5000|$|Together {{with friends}} (Leonardo DiCaprio, Alanis Morissette, Jeffrey Sachs, Sergei Solovyov and others), Namin organizes an {{informal}} trip to Cuba, where he creates {{a series of}} photographic works later shown at the State Russian Museum and serving {{as the basis for}} the photo album <b>Fulcrums.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although some of <b>Fulcrum's</b> motives {{have been}} revealed, {{it is unclear}} what their full agenda is. They are known to be in pursuit of the Intersect and have also {{attempted}} to break into Castle, but neither Jill nor Leader identified Chuck as a person of interest beyond what he could tell them about the facility's computer systems and in actually gaining access to it. While they are shown having international contacts such as the Russian seductress Sasha Banachek, there has been no indication of whether their interests are restricted solely to the United States or if they have international objectives as well. It is known that MI6 is also involved with tracking <b>Fulcrum's</b> activities, as they planted agent Cole Barker in the organization.|$|R
25|$|Class 1: <b>Fulcrum</b> in the middle: {{the effort}} is applied {{on one side of}} the <b>fulcrum</b> and the {{resistance}} (or load) on the other side, for example, a seesaw, a crowbar or a pair of scissors. Mechanical advantage may be greater than, less than, or equal to 1.|$|E

25|$|A force {{applied at}} {{a right angle}} to a lever multiplied by its {{distance}} from the lever's <b>fulcrum</b> (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two metres from the <b>fulcrum,</b> for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the <b>fulcrum.</b> The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right hand grip rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled {{from the direction of}} the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.|$|E
5000|$|Chuck and Sarah watch Chevy Chase in {{the film}} Spies Like Us at the {{beginning}} of the episode. Chase portrayed Ted Roark, the leader of <b>Fulcrum's</b> Intersect development project in the final episodes of Season 2. Spies Like Us has been frequently referenced in prior episodes of the series.|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, it is {{believed}} that Air Combat Command (ACC) shares access to MiG-29 <b>Fulcrums</b> and Su-27 aircraft somewhere in Nevada (most likely Groom Lake) flying against Fighter Weapons School instructors, 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron aircrews and F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon [...] "Aggressor" [...] aircraft flying from Nellis AFB.|$|R
50|$|Two levers {{connected}} by a rod so that a force applied to one is transmitted to the second {{is known as a}} four-bar linkage. The levers are called cranks, and the <b>fulcrums</b> are called pivots. The connecting rod is also called the coupler. The fourth bar in this assembly is the ground, or frame, on which the cranks are mounted.|$|R

50|$|Revelations {{about the}} events {{surrounding}} this theft and Bryce's motives are meted out {{over the course of}} the first two seasons. Bryce stole the Intersect to keep it out of <b>Fulcrum's</b> hands, and did so under Stephen Bartowski's guidance. But despite Stephen's wishes to keep Chuck out of it, Bryce sent the Intersect to Chuck because he knew Chuck could handle the Intersect and that Sarah would find Chuck.|$|R
