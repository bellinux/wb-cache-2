50|$|There are two {{different}} fiber yarns that are woven {{together to form a}} <b>hose</b> <b>jacket.</b> The yarns that run lengthwise down the hose are called warp yarns and are usually made from spun polyester or filament nylon. They form the inner and outer surfaces of the jacket and provide abrasion resistance for the hose. The yarns that are wound in a tight spiral around the circumference of the hose are called the filler yarns and are made from filament polyester. They are trapped between the crisscrossing warp yarns and provide strength to resist the internal water pressure. The spun polyester warp yarns are specially prepared by a yarn manufacturer and are shipped to the hose plant. No further preparation is needed.|$|E
50|$|TPU is {{well known}} for its {{applications}} in performance films, wire and cable <b>jacketing,</b> <b>hose</b> and tube, in adhesive and textile coating applications and as an impact modifier of other polymers. TPU pellets are used as Adidas' most recent cushioning technology, known as Boost. Several thousands of TPU pellets are bound together to create a comfortable sole for the shoe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} fully {{solid state}} mobile radios {{were used in}} the CTCSS conversion. They were 99-channel Midland radios. An early 1980s discovery was that users had to carry cards with lists of the channels. The radios had many channels and no alphanumeric display describing to whom one would talk when the display said channel [...] "65", for example. The Midland mobiles used flat, computer-hard-disk-style ribbon cable to connect the control head on the vehicle dashboard with the radio unit drawer. To improve reliability, some units used segments of discarded inch-and-a-half fire <b>hose</b> as a <b>jacket</b> to protect the easily abraded ribbon cable.|$|R
6000|$|The next day, {{the young}} gentleman {{proceeded}} to enroll {{himself in the}} corps of Archers of the Prince of Cleves, and with him came his attached squire, who vowed he never would leave him. As Otto threw aside his own elegant dress, and donned the livery of the House of Cleves, the noble Childe sighed not a little. 'Twas a splendid uniform 'tis true, but still it WAS a livery, {{and one of his}} proud spirit ill bears another's cognizances. [...] "They are the colors of the Princess, however," [...] said he, consoling himself; [...] "and what suffering would I not undergo for HER?" [...] As for Wolfgang, the squire, it may well be supposed that the good-natured, low-born fellow had no such scruples; but he was glad enough to exchange for the pink <b>hose,</b> the yellow <b>jacket,</b> the pea-green cloak, and orange-tawny hat, with which the Duke's steward supplied him, the homely patched doublet of green which he had worn for years past.|$|R
