50|$|The wrench {{functions}} in the same general way as an ordinary beam torque wrench. There are two beams both connected to the head end but only one through which torque is applied. The load carrying beam is straight and runs from head to handle, it deflects when torque is applied. The other beam (indicating beam) runs directly above the deflecting beam for {{about half of the}} length then bends away to the side at an angle from the deflecting beam. The indicating beam retains its orientation and shape during operation, because of this there is relative displacement between the two beams. The deflecting beam torque wrench differs from the ordinary beam torque wrench in how it utilises this relative displacement. Attached to the deflecting beam is a scale and onto that is fitted a wedge which can be slid {{along the length of the}} scale parallel to the flexing beam, this wedge is used to set the desired torque. Directly facing this wedge is the side of the angled indicating beam. From this side protrudes a pin, which acts as a trigger for another pin, the latter pin <b>is</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loaded,</b> and fires out of the end of the indicating beam once the trigger pin contacts the adjustable wedge. This firing makes a loud click and gives a visual indication that the desired torque has been met. The indicator pin can be reset by simply pressing it back into the indicating beam.|$|E

40|$|A 1 / 8 {{scale model}} of the Grumman XTB 3 F- 1 {{airplane}} was tested in the Langley 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel to determine the stability and control characteristics and to provide data for estimating the airplane handling qualities. The report includes longitudinal and lateral stability and control characteristics of the complete model, {{the characteristics of the}} isolated horizontal tail, the effects of various flow conditions through the jet duct, tests with external stores attached to the underside of the wing, ana tests simulating landing and take-off conditions with a ground board. The handling characteristics of the airplane have not been computed but some conclusions were indicated by the data. An improvement in the longitudinal stability was obtained by tilting the thrust line down. It is shown that if the wing flap <b>is</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> so that the flap deflection varies with airspeed, the airplanes will be less stable than with the flap retracted or fully deflected. An increase in size of the vertical tail and of the dorsal fin gave more desirable yawing-moment characteristics than the original vertical tail and dorsal fin. Preventing air flow through the jet duct system or simulating jet operation with unheated air produced only small changes in the model characteristics. The external stores {{on the underside of the}} wing had only small effects on the model characteristics.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{custom-built}} tribometer that mimics the wear of additive manufactured ﬁxtures used in inspection of sheet metal components. Design/methodology/approach - Referring to the inspection of sheet metal parts, the ﬁxture undergoes sliding wear during loading and unloading phases of the quality control operation. A new wear test is proposed to mimic the actual wearing conditions of the ﬁxtures because the standards are deemed insufﬁcient. In the tribometer, a cylindrical Alumide cantilever beam is made to slide back and forth inside a slightly bigger hole cut into a nickel-plated steel sheet. The sheet <b>is</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> such that it applies a force on the specimen. The wear on the beam is measured after every 500 cycles of the beam motion. Findings - Results of some ﬁrst test trials are reported to evaluate the durability of Alumide ﬁxtures fabricated by selective laser sintering. The results are also compared to those obtained for a machined ﬁxture made of an Al-Cu alloy. Practical implications - The proposed wear test estimates the life time of additive manufactured ﬁxtures in terms of numbers of inspected components. The test can be extended to different materials to compare their durability. Originality/value - Today, the fabrication of custom ﬁxtures by means of additive manufacturing technologies is a reality in many manufacturing industries. The advantage of using those production technologies for custom ﬁxtures is well assessed in literature in terms of manufacturing times and costs, whereas little attention was given to the life time and wear behaviour of fabricated ﬁxtures. For its practical implication, the ﬁxture durability is indeed very important for manufacture...|$|E
40|$|THE {{apparatus}} to {{be described}} represents an attempt to develop a simple, cheap halothane vaporizer {{which could be used}} without modifi-cation of existing anaesthetic equipment and which would allow accurate but economical use of halo-thane. An earlier version of this vaporizer has been described (Cole, 1959) and the present model has already been referred to (Cole, 1960). The aim of the present paper is to describe the vaporizer and to record experiences of performance after ex-tensive use by the writer and by a number of other anaesthetists to whom vaporizers have been supplied. The vaporizer (fig. 1) consists of a metal assembly into which is screwed a 100 -ml bottle with a suitable washer intervening. The pro-jecting side tube is the oxygen inlet. Oxygen enters here, passes through ducts drilled in the metal and then through a vertical tube 8. 25 cm long to escape through a jet 1. 5 mm in diameter 2 cm above the bottom of the bottle. A safety valve which <b>is</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> to open at 5 lb. /sq. in., is set in the metal cap and is connected with the oxygen duct so that if the pressure exceeds that figure only oxygen escapes. The oxygen and halothane mixture leaves the apparatus through a metal tube which terminates in a yoke block. Before use the apparatus is filled with halothane to a level just below the inlet pipe (about 22 ml), screwed into the cyclopropane yoke, and connec-ted to a supply of oxygen. It is now possible to pass a halothane and oxygen mixture through the cyclopropane flowmeter. The amounts of oxygen and halothane vapour flowing per minute for different readings of the flowmeter are shown in table I. The readings were made with the halothane maintained at a temperature of 18. 3 *C (65 "F) as this was felt to be the most useful temperature for calibration. In use the concentrated halothane vapour is metered by the cyclopropane flowmeter and i...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} project was recently initiated which requires that water quality samples {{be taken from}} small ponds and lagoons in west-central Illinois. A method for obtaining these pond water samples was desired that could be handled conveniently by one person and would not require a small boat. The pond water sampler described here was developed to satisfy this need. The sampler developed allows one person to obtain a water sample at any desired depth while remaining on the shore. After assembling the device it may be floated to any position on the pond surface, lowered to the desired depth, and a sample taken. It is then retrieved by following the previous steps in reverse order as illustrated in Fig. 1. Water samples have been obtained {{at a distance of}} 40 ft from the pond shore and at a depth of 16 ft below the pond surface. The pond water sampler consists of a telescoping rod, manufactured for window washing units, with a T-handle and fishing rod reels on one end (Fig. 2); and the sampler head (Fig. 3) and float on the other end. Cords run from the operator end of the sampler to the sampler head and float to allow the operator to control the float and sampler head. The sampler head holds the sample bottle and may be triggered to allow sampling to occur when the operator desires. The sampler (Fig. 3) consists of three separate components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The sampler head base is attached to the telescoping rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port which extends into the sample bottle is attached to the sampler head base. Additionally, the base contains an air escape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The stopper plate with stopper <b>is</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. To obtain a sample the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. la). The bottle and sampler head is floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. lb). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. lc). When the desired depth is reached, the sampler head cord is pulled and water is allowed to fill the sample bottle (Fig. ld). Pulling the sampler head cord removes the stopper from the water port thus allowing the bottle to fill with water through the water port and extension. The air is allowed to escape through the small air escape port in the sampler head base and is conducted {{a few feet from the}} sampler head through a flexible tube. This reduces the possibility of escaping air changing the oxygen content of the water which is being sampled. The sampler head and bottle are returned to the surface using the float and float cord (Fig. le), and the apparatus is floated back to the shore (Fig. lf) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint linkage <b>loaded</b> with linear <b>springs</b> or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there <b>are</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> and some <b>are</b> restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length <b>load</b> <b>spring</b> with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Quality of Life Plus {{has been}} {{improving}} {{the lives of}} many wounded servicemen and first responders around the country. Its mission is to foster and generate innovations to aid and {{improve the quality of life}} for those injured in the line of duty. This project is the fifth iteration of designing a prosthetic hand for an active duty Navy SEAL. The first iterations have been myoelectric systems where sensors are attached to the user’s muscles to actuate the prosthetic. However, the most recent has been a purely mechanical system, and was shoulder actuated. The design was more robust, it was lightweight compared to the first iterations, and it is also waterproof. This project is made out of Titanium 6 AL- 4 V, which offers a great strength-to-weight ratio, is robust, reliable and easy to assemble. This project took a different avenue of approach when manufacturing the prosthetic hand. The vast majority of the hand was 3 D-printed using the latest technology of direct metal laser sintering. The material chosen for this device is Ti 6 - 4, where it was printed and donated by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory located in Livermore, CA. Most of the hardware was made out of stainless steel and was purchased from McMaster Carr, and the Sure-Lok was obtained from a previous iteration. The prosthetic hand will include shock cord, non-flexible cable to withstand up to 200 lbs. per finger and a break cable that will interlock the fingers, palm and gantlet sub systems of the prosthetic. The device will also include a silicon sleeve with an embedded plate that will attach to the palm. The sleeve will attach via suction to the users residual and has been proven to work as he currently uses a similar device with a purely aesthetic hand. This prosthetic was designed by analyzing the Raptor Hand created by e-Nable, an organization that helps small children by creating prosthetic hands that can be easily printed and assembled. In order to actuate our prosthetic, the user will need sufficient wrist movement and strength for proper function. Since our client has full mobility of his wrist, this will be the best method. The prosthetic uses a Sure-Lok to allow the user to maintain a grip without applying any excess force. The non-flexible cable will maintain a tension that will allow the user to grip and hold heavy items over a long period of time. Once the Sure-Lok is not active, the flexible cord will spring the fingers back into the initial position. The thumb is not connected to any cables and <b>is</b> <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> to allow the user to manually place the thumb in three different positions. During the initial inspection of the titanium parts received, the team noticed that the support material was still intact and needed to be removed. This will delay the assembly and testing of the titanium prototype. The support material will be removed via Electric Discharge Machining (EDM), which is a controlled process that is used to remove metal by electric spark erosion. The electric spark is used as the cutting tool to erode the work piece to the desired surface finish. Once completed, the hand will be assembled and tested and will be sent to the client’s prosthetist to implement the silicon sleeve. Furthermore, our donor has agreed to reprint the prosthetic to allow any improvements of the design. This will be done towards the end of the summer. Several of our team members will remain in contact with the sponsor and LLNL to oversee the completion of this design...|$|E

The maximum wind load that the ship unloader can withstand which has to be the one at which the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> hydraulic clamp will disable is calculated After carefully studying the already existing clamping system, we found that using an alternative spring concentrically, we can increase the wind load capacity which is the maximum load the clamp can withstand. After carefully analyzing different springs we found that with the use of concentric spring, the clamp can withstand a higher amount of wind load, thus increasing the performance of ship unloader. This <b>is</b> proved by <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> calculations and using Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS software...|$|R
50|$|V is a drive system, R is the {{elasticity}} in the system, and M is {{the load}} that {{is lying on}} the floor and is being pushed horizontally. When the drive system <b>is</b> started, the <b>Spring</b> R <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> and its pushing force against load M increases until the static friction coefficient between load M and the floor is not able to hold the load anymore. The load starts sliding and the friction coefficient decreases from its static value to its dynamic value. At this moment the spring can give more power and accelerates M. During M’s movement, the force of the spring decreases, until it is insufficient to overcome the dynamic friction. From this point, M decelerates to a stop. The drive system however continues, and the <b>spring</b> <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> again etc.|$|R
