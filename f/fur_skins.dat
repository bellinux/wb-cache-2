Using existing processes, it took from two to {{two and a half}} days of hard labor to bring a large hide down to a flexiable state. When House claimed that he could make a machine that could dress four hides or more a day, they were astonished, as they claimed no tool could stand up to those dry hides for even ten minutes. To meet the challenge, House developed a rotary plane with a ring knife that could be fed as it moved, with a set of small emery wheels each side of the knife so that it was sharpened on every revolution. The plane was universally hung and counterbalanced so it weighed nothing in the hand of the operator, though it was driven by power from the engine. On a wager, the first operator finished fifty hides in ten hours.|$|E
2500|$|While {{anchored}} at Clayoquot Sound, the Tonquin crew {{engaged in}} fur trading activities with the natives. Members {{of the neighboring}} Tla-o-qui-aht nation boarded the ship in large numbers to trade. Commercial dealings were negotiated between an experienced elder, Nookamis, and Thorn. Thorn offered an exchange rate found to be unsatisfactory by the elder, who wanted five blankets for every fur skin sold. These discussions continued on throughout the day and Thorn increasingly became frustrated at the indigenous intransigence to accept his terms. The interpreter later informed McDougall that Thorn [...] "got in a passion with Nookamis", taking one of Nookamis' <b>fur</b> <b>skins</b> and hitting him on the face with it. After this outburst, Thorn ordered the ship prepare to depart, with the Tla-o-qui-aht still on board.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1788 the two {{returned}} to the Pacific Northwest to acquire more furs, this time operating separately. Charles Duncan sailed Princess Royal first to Nootka Sound, then to the Queen Charlotte Islands. He then took the ship across Hecate Strait to conduct fur trading among the islands and inlets north of Princess Royal Island, passing through Principe Channel and into Douglas Channel. Although today the name [...] "Princess Royal" [...] applies to a single island, Duncan called the entire archipelago the Princess Royal's Islands. It included what is today called Banks Island, Pitt Island, Gil Island, Campania Island, Gribbell Island, Hawkesbury Island, and the Estevan Group, among others. In late June, 1788, Duncan returned to the Queen Charlotte Islands, then proceeded south. He took Princess Royal into the uncharted waters of Milbanke Sound and spent a few days trading with the Heiltsuk. Near Nootka Sound he encountered John Meares, from whom he learned that Colnett and Prince of Wales had not arrived at Nootka. Therefore, Duncan did not stop at Nootka Sound but instead took Princess Royal south, trading {{in the vicinity of}} Clayoquot Sound and near the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. On 17 August 1788, Duncan left the Northwest, sailing Princess Royal back to the Hawaiian Islands, where Prince of Wales and Princess Royal were reunited. The two then sailed to China, arriving in late November, 1788. There they sold the <b>fur</b> <b>skins</b> acquired in the Pacific Northwest. Prince of Wales returned to England via the Cape of Good Hope while Princess Royal remained in the Pacific for another fur trading season. James Colnett also remained, and was given command of Argonaut for another year of fur trading in the Pacific. Thomas Hudson was given command of Princess Royal.|$|E

50|$|Before the rya rug in Sweden, peasants {{would sleep}} between <b>fur</b> <b>skins,</b> but the skins could become stiff and the fur {{could not be}} washed. The peasants then used wool plucked {{directly}} from the sheep without spinning to simulate fur as close as possible. They used the natural colors of the wool, which were black, white, and grey, to make simple patterns in the high pile. During the weaving, the wool was knotted in. The pile side of the rya had a soft sheen that resembled fur and was placed facing the body just like the <b>fur</b> <b>skins</b> were used previously. The pattern of the flat surface of other side was given less attention, and was the part on which the owner worked in their initials into the striped geometric design. Later, the wool was put into hot water before being used, which shrunk, stiffened, and tightened the wool. Consequently, the rugs were more durable, but were not as soft and glossy as earlier rya rugs.|$|E

50|$|Until the 15th century Pskov didn’t {{have its}} own currency. For the long time Pskovians used Greek, Roman and later European money to trade with other nations. Most of the times trade didn’t require money at all. Pskov merchants widely used barter. Some goods that were in high demand, mostly fur, were often used as money replacement. Some {{expensive}} furs of martens and sables {{cost as much as}} 30 000 Chervonets. Due to varying quality and size of <b>fur</b> <b>skins</b> they could not substitute money. According to Pskov Chronicles in 1409 Pskovians started to use German pfennig in trade with the Hanse. Between themselves they continue to use marten snouts as petty cash. In 1420 Pskov started to mint their own silver coin and from 1424 started to use rubles instead marten snouts.|$|E

5000|$|Near Destruction Island he was {{recruited}} by Thorn {{to act as}} an interpreter. He had a sister married to a Tla-o-qui-aht man, a factor that has been attributed to his later survival on Vancouver Island. While at Clayoquot Sound in June 1811, the Tonquin hosted members of the neighboring Tla-o-qui-aht nation. They boarded the ship in large numbers to trade with commercial dealings negotiated between Thorn and an experienced elder, Nookamis, along with Joseachal translating their proposals. These discussions made Thorn increasingly frustrated at Nookamis' intransigence to accept his terms. Joseachal later informed Duncan McDougall that Thorn took one of Nookamis' <b>fur</b> <b>skins</b> and hit him in the face with it. After this outburst, the Indigenous consulted among themselves and offered to trade their fur stockpiles again. They proposed that in return for a skin, the PFC officers sell 3 blankets and a knife. McDougall recounted that [...] "A brisk trade was carried on [...] all the Indians setting round on the decks of the Ship were supplied with a knife a piece." [...] Violence immediately erupted as the warriors led by Wickaninnish attacked the crew on board, and killed {{all but one of the}} men. The only known survivor of the crew was Joseachal, who arrived back at Fort Astoria through assistance of prominent Lower Chinookan noble Comcomly.|$|E
