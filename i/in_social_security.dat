In a two-period model with uncertainty about life-expectancy, it is shown that for a given annuity price tax incentives for life annuities increases consumption expenditures in old-age, while the opposite occurs by a cut <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> benefits and by an increase of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> tax. The main result is that a tax incentive for life annuities and a cut <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> benefits alleviate adverse selection in the private annuity market, while an increase <b>in</b> the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> tax exacerbates adverse selection. annuity market; uncertain lifetime; adverse selection; tax incentives; <b>social</b> <b>security...</b>|$|R

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{claim that}} it gives a low rate of return, {{compared}} to what is obtained through private retirement accounts. For example, critics point out that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed {{to opt out of}} the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month <b>in</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month <b>in</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a GAO report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|E

A few antirecession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers, were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made <b>in</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation. Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in school milk and school lunch distribution.

In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation. From 1991 to 2000, receipts increased by 90% in current dollars, or 60% in 2005 dollars. An analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculated that the average annual growth rate of real income-tax receipts per working-age person eventually rose over the two decades from 0.2% (1981–90) to 3.1% (1990–2001).|$|E

25|$|Along with earning salaries, {{senators}} receive {{retirement and}} health benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully vested {{after five years}} of service. Senators are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).

Under FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary <b>in</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> taxes. The amount of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a senator's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.|$|E

The name was at its most popular point in 1955, when it was ranked the 53rd most popular masculine baby name. Currently, the name was ranked 749th for the year 2009. Randall currently is, and historically has been more popular in the United States than the various other forms of the name. For example, since 1995, Randal has not been among the top 1,000 names recorded in for baby boys. This name first ranked within the top 1,000 boys names in 1938, and it stayed among the top 1,000 names until 1994; the name was at its most popular point in 1958, when it was ranked 189th. According to data released by the Social Security Administration, the forms Randell, Randel, and Randle have never been nearly as popular (see 'popularity graphs' below). In 1990, the United States Census Bureau undertook a study of the 1990 United States Census, and released a sample of data concerning the most popular names. According to this sample of 6.3 million people (who had 5,494 unique first names), Randal was ranked as the 477th most popular masculine name, and Randall was ranked 139th most popular.

In the government's first budget, sickness benefits were increased by 9.3%, pensions for war widows by 25%, pensions for the war wounded by 16%, and retirement pensions by 5%. Numerically, pensions went up by 6.4% (1970), 5.5% (1971), 9.5% (1972), 11.4% (1973), and 11.2% (1974). Adjusted {{for changes in the}} annual price index, pensions went up in real terms by 3.1% (1970), 0.3% (1971), 3.9% (1972), 4.4% (1973), and 4.2% (1974). Between 1972 and 1974, the purchasing power of pensioners went up by 19%. In 1970, war pensions were increased by 16%. War victim’s pensions went up by 5.5% in January 1971, and by 6.3% in January 1972. By 1972, war pensions for orphans and parents had gone up by around 40%, and for widows by around 50%. Between 1970 and 1972, the “Landabgaberente” (land transfer pension) went up by 55%. Between 1969 and 1974, the average real standard rate of income support rose (in 1991 prices) from around 300 DM to around 400 DM. Between 1970 and 1974, unemployment benefits rose from around 300 euros to around 400 euros per month, and unemployment assistance from just under 200 euros per month to just under 400 euros per month. In 2001 prices, the average standard social assistance benefit level rose from around 200 euros per month in 1969 to over 250 euros per month in 1974. During most of Brandt’s years as chancellor, the majority of benefits increased as a percentage of average net earnings.|$|E
40|$|A key {{question}} for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> reform is whether workers currently perceive the link {{on the margin}} between the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> taxes they pay and the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits they will receive. We develop a methodology for estimating the incentive effects of the marginal <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits that accrue with additional earnings on three measures of labor supply: hours, labor earnings, and retirement. We show how three sources of discontinuities <b>in</b> the marginal <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefit formula can be exploited to identify these incentive effects. We find that the retirement hazard rate starts to increase sharply when the current year’s earnings crowd out a prior year’s earnings <b>in</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefit formula. This result is consistent with individuals responding to incentives implicit <b>in</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefit formula, but further analysis {{is needed to determine}} whether the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> rules cause this result...|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements <b>in</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.|$|E
