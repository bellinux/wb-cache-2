There are some issues that lead to conflicts between accountancy and fiscality regarding the true image of the financial position of the entity and they are met when using different depreciation systems, when constituting the risk and expenses provisions, when establishing and registering the adjustments of depreciation and value losses, that, as it is well known, only in few cases they are fiscaly educible, when determining the taxable profit and, implicitly the profit taxation. The accountant depreciation is different from the <b>fiscal</b> <b>depreciation.</b> It doesn’t reflect, in all cases, the effective loss of value of the tangible assets, but only the allocation of its cost for a period of time.

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to {{elaborate}} a model relating Tobbin's q corrected for taxes to the rate of capital accumulation in order to evaluate the impact of fiscal incentives on corporate investment expenditure in Switzerland. The estimation of the model on the basis of post-war data reveals that taxation has so far played only a minor role in the investment process in Switzerland. Moreover, the simulation of the model under various hypotheses of fiscal reform shows that while the traditional instruments, namely the manipulation of corporate tax rates and <b>fiscal</b> <b>depreciation</b> schemes tend to have a relatively small impact, the use of the investment tax credit, not yet implemented in Switzerland, can be a rather efficient means of influencing business investment. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{options available}} to tax mineral extraction projects particularly in developing countries. A desirable government share of the economic rent generated from mineral extraction can be achieved through different tax and non-tax instruments. This gives some room to design a fiscal regime that will be attractive to investors while providing the government with {{a fair share of}} the economic rent. However, achieving this will require a careful assessment of the appropriate distribution of risk and reward between the investor and the government. Moreover, there is growing pressure on countries to provide increasingly lenient fiscal terms so as to remain competitive as global investment destinations.

The hybrid tax is {{a modified version of the}} cash-flow tax on real and financial transactions combined. The modification involves replacing expensing of fixed assets with normal depreciation allowances, but the undepreciated value of fixed assets is carried forward with interest at the opportunity cost of equity capital.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that a fixed {{exchange}} rate regime induces more fiscal discipline, but Tornell and Velasco (1995, 1998) argue the opposite. Using a dynamic model with fragmented fiscal policymaking, this paper evaluates the two arguments in a single framework and shows that (1) future punishment against fiscal laxity exists under both fixed and flexible regimes; (2) fiscal authorities have a greater incentive to spend more today under fixed rates than under flexible rates; (3) {{in the presence of}} both factors above, fixed rates will induce more fiscal discipline only if the future punishment is sufficiently stronger than under flexible rates; and (4) neither fixed nor flexible rates could resolve the structural distortions caused by fragmented policymaking, and fiscal centralization needs to be undertaken to strengthen fiscal discipline.

The correct calculation of depreciation is necessary for obtaining full and objective information on reproduction process in the organization. With more detailed consideration of a question of charge of depreciation in developed with - temporary conditions, {{it is necessary to}} consider development of depreciation in the context of development of national schools of accounting. In this article, historical aspects of development of depreciation are investigated. The retrospective of concept and methods of charge of depreciation is represented, beginning from the XIV century worldwide. Various points of view on methods of charge of depreciation of such scientists, as V. Armuzzi, Zh. G. Kursel-Senel, Ya. V. Sokolov, Zh. B. Dyumarshe, D. S. Lewis, O. Shmalenbakh, A. P. Rudanovsky, A. K. Roshchakhovsky, etc. are considered. It is specified that the concept of depreciation was known to accountants of early Christian Rome. Gradually there was a change of approach to interpretation of the concept "depreciation". Within the French school allocated concept of broad and narrow depreciation, two options of a covering of depreciation expenses were offered, research of influence of <b>fiscal</b> policy on <b>depreciation</b> was conducted. The German school connected charge of depreciation with depreciation of property and need of formation of a sinking fund. Within maneuvers of Anglo-American school considered that depreciation has to be charged at the expense of profit in the sum only approximately equal to wear. Within domestic scientific thought, two main schools adhering to various opinions were allocated. For elaboration of uniform approach during the Soviet period in accounting there were accounts "Sinking fund", "Depreciation of fixed assets" that allowed to track a special-purpose character of use of a sinking fund.
