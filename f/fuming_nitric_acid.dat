5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or <b>fuming</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid.</b> Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper will}} {{introduce}} a simple new method on {{the synthesis of}} both hafnium and zirconium nitrate precursors. The intermediate product, dinitrogen pentoxide produced from the water extraction from <b>fume</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> via phosphorus pentoxide, was condensed by liquid nitrogen trap into a flask equipped with hafnium or zirconium tetrachloride. To give the high yield, the mixture of <b>fume</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> and phosphorus pentoxide was heated to a certain temperature, from which large quantity of dinitrogen pentoxide had been generated. In the following step, hafnium or zirconium tetrachloride was refluxed over dinitrogen pentoxide at 30 to 35 oC for half-hour. The product was purified by sublimation. High yield, above 95 %, was obtained. The cost for the hafnium nitrate precursor synthesis was estimated. The precursor was not stable at room temperature, and should be stored in refrigerator in sealed vials. No chlorine was detected from both EDS and chemical analysis. The volatility was evaluated by thermal gravity analysis. For high k thin film applications, the precursors were evaluated through the hafnium oxide thin film deposition via ALD process. High quality hafnium oxide thin films were obtained. The hafnium oxide thin film property consistence using different batches of our synthesized hafnium nitrate precursor was also verified. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the films were smooth, uniform, amorphous as deposited and monoclinic after post annealing. For as-deposited hafnium oxide thin films, XPS studies showed the films were rich in oxygen and contained nitrogen residues,- 2 -which could be eliminated from forming gas post-annealing process. On the electrical property measurement, the 57 Å hafnium oxide thin film showed a dielectric constant of k ~ 10. 5 and a capacitive equivalent thickness of approximately 21 Å...|$|R

25|$|Dilute {{nitric acid}} may be {{concentrated}} by distillation up to 68% acid, {{which is a}} maximum boiling azeotrope containing 32% water. In the laboratory, further concentration involves distillation with either sulfuric acid or magnesium nitrate which act as dehydrating agents. Such distillations must be done with all-glass apparatus at reduced pressure, to prevent decomposition of the acid. Industrially, highly concentrated nitric acid is produced by dissolving additional nitrogen dioxide in 68% nitric acid in an absorption tower. Dissolved nitrogen oxides are either stripped {{in the case of}} white <b>fuming</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> or remain in solution to form red <b>fuming</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid.</b> More recently, electrochemical means have been developed to produce anhydrous acid from concentrated nitric acid feedstock.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, many routes have been {{proposed}} to synthesize ammonium dinitramide (ADN). However, most of them lie in routes in which reactants are too expensive for large-scale production. In this sense, the use of ordinary reactants {{is of paramount importance}} in this case. The aim in this synthesis consists on nitrating a starting reactant in a reaction known as nitration. Both the nitrating agent and the starting reactant should preferably be ordinary, narrowing the possibility of having realistic options for them. The most ordinary nitrating agent consists of a mixture of sulfuric and <b>fuming</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acids.</b> Therefore, the breakthrough must come from the suitable choice of the starting reactant. However, so far, the only viable reaction relies on the use of sulfamate salts. Even though the process with this kind of salt has been largely commercially developed, only few information are available in the literature to properly address issues emerged from it. In this study, an attempt is made to enlighten some effects on the product caused by modifications in the route conditions. Characterization of the resulting products was confirmed by FT-IR in the region of MIR and NIR. The characteristic bands employed to identify ADN in the region of middle infrared were: 3129 and 1384 cm- 1 (NH 4 +); 1537, 1344, 1209, and 1177 cm- 1 (NO 2); 1032, 954 cm- 1 (N 3); 828, 762 and 732 cm- 1 (NO 2). The near infrared analysis pointed out few bands at 5185 and 4672 cm- 1 in NH combination bands region. The resulting middle infrared spectrum was compared to the reference found in the literature for this product. The results show excellent agreement with the expected product...|$|R

25|$|White <b>fuming</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> pure {{nitric acid}} or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay.

Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. It boils at 83°C. It is usually stored in a glass shatterproof amber bottle with twice the volume of head space to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to release pressure.|$|E

For instance, when you spend a guinea upon an engraving, what have you done? You have paid a man for a certain number of hours to sit at a dirty table, in a dirty room, inhaling the <b>fumes</b> of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> stooping over a steel plate, on which, by the help of a magnifying glass, he is, one by one, laboriously cutting out certain notches and scratches, of which the effect is to be the copy of another man's work.

On the other hand, whenever you buy a small water-color drawing, you have employed a man happily and healthily, working in a clean room (if he likes), or more probably still, out in the pure country and fresh air, thinking about something, and learning something every moment; not straining his eyesight, nor breaking his back, but working in ease and happiness. Therefore if you can like a modest water-color better than an elaborate engraving, do. There may indeed be engravings which are worth the suffering it costs to produce them; but at all events, engravings of public dinners and laying of foundation-stones, and such things, might be dispensed with.
