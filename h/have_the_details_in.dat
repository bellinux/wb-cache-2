Taken with more recent in vivo data concerning the parametrisation of the various synaptic and cellular currents involved, Destexhe is able to build a complete picture of the oscillations {{in the context of a}} microscopic network of thalamocortical (TC) projection, reticular (RE) and corticothalamic (CT) projection cells, along with local inhibitory interneurons in cortex (IN). In this model, SWDs are initiated and terminated by slow timescale currents in TC cells. In between SWDs, all cells are at rest. The rest state of one or two TC cells slowly becomes unstable, however. The initial burst firing of this one cell then recruits the rest of the network, leading to a SWD in the population as a whole. Whilst this model provides excellent insight into <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> of <b>the</b> oscillation, its description of SWD initiation and termination and of inter-ictal dynamics is certainly not applicable to the case of absence seizures occurring during the waking state.|$|R

40|$|Several precast {{concrete}} {{systems have been}} in use in New Zealand {{in the construction of}} moment resisting frames designed for earthquake resistance, despite the lack of code design guidelines. The two design codes for buildings, NZS 4203 (1984) and NZS 3101 (1982), deal only with the design of monolithic concrete construction. The use of {{precast concrete}} in moment resisting frames in New Zealand assumes that this method of construction behaves the same as monolithic reinforced concrete structures. A test programme was devised to provided experimental evidence on the seismic behaviour of the most commonly used precast concrete arrangements. Six full-scale subassemblages were quasi-statically tested under reverse load conditions with increasing displacements to failure. Four tests were conducted in H-shaped specimens connected at the beam midspan. The remaining two specimens were cruciform-shaped and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> connection <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> critical region at the beam-column joint.

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} to review some of the work done on stable matching, and on stable {{marriage}} problems in particular. Variants of the stable marriage problem will be considered, and the similarities and differences from a mathematical point of view will be highlighted. The correlation between preference and stability is a main theme, {{and the way in which}} diluted or incomplete preferences affect stability is explored. Since these problems have a wide range of practical applications, it is of interest to develop useful algorithms for the derivation of solutions. Time-complexity is a key factor in designing computable algorithms, making work load a strong consideration for practical purposes. Average and worst-case complexity are discussed. The number of different solutions that are possible for a given problem instance is surprising, and counter-intuitive. This leads naturally to a study of the solution sets and the lattice structure of solutions that emerges for any stable marriage problem. Many theorems derive from the lattice structure of stable solutions and it is shown that this can lead to the design of more efficient algorithms. The research on this topic is well established, and many theorems have been proved and published, although some published proofs <b>have</b> omitted <b>the</b> <b>detail.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> author selects some key theorems, providing detailed proofs or alternate proofs, showing the mathematical richness of this field of study.

Signaling through the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor, stress-induced glucocorticoid hormones induce apoptosis via mechanisms requiring altered gene expression.

However, few studies <b>have</b> examined <b>the</b> role of non-coding miRNAs in this essential physiological process. Previously, using hybridization-based gene expression analysis and deep sequencing of small RNAs, we described the prevalent post-transcriptional repression of annotated miRNAs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes.

40|$|Familial hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (FHC) is an inherited disorder affecting roughly one in 500 people. Its hallmark is abnormal thickening of the ventricular wall, leading to serious complications that include heart failure and sudden cardiac death.

Nearly all of the genetic lesions associated with FHC occur in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, indicating that defects in cardiac muscle contraction underlie <b>the</b> condition. <b>Detailed</b> biophysical data are increasingly available for computational analyses {{that could be used}} to predict heart phenotypes based on genotype.

In this paper, three specific types of infant-directed (ID) facial expressions were identified in videotapes of 10 English- and 10 Chinese-speaking mothers interacting with infants aged 4 – 7 months. Four measures were taken to examine the form and meaning of these ID facial expressions. In Measure one, 32 undergraduates easily differentiated the three identified facial expression types. In Measure two, the muscle movement of each type were described through Ekman and Friesen’s facial action coding system (FACS). In Measure three, 35 mothers and 40 undergraduates provided different emotional descriptions and communicative messages for each type. In Measure four, rank correlations were conducted to identify the FACS units most indicative of each facial expression type. These four measures confirmed the appearance of three expression types in both Chinese and English mothers, the involvement of unique muscle movements in these expression types in comparison to adult-directed expressions which have been described, and the expression of distinct and consistent emotional messages.

40|$|Although {{voltage clamp}} {{methods have been}} applied {{experimentally}} to cardiac tissue for over a decade, this field of study has failed to achieve general acceptance because of limitations of the experimental approach and difficulty in interpret-ing the results. Yet this technique is valuable within its limitations, and to dismiss {{it would be to}} lose a valuable tool. In perspective, most tech-niques in biological investigations have equivalent limitations. In this brief review we attempt to summarize the rationale behind the approach, the nature and tractability of limitations in the ap-proach, and the results that we believe can be drawn safely from experimental studies to date. It is our hope that this review will serve to place the field in better perspective for <b>the</b> "nonclamper" than <b>have</b> <b>the</b> more <b>detailed</b> reviews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and that it will simultaneously indicate the future growth and trends in this field as we see them.

Normally, a locally generated action po-tential propagates throughout the heart, generat-ing the familiar electrocardiogram. This electrical event at the cell membrane triggers the contraction by some unknown process, generally called excita-tion-contraction coupling. The great importance of these properties of heart muscle in the understand-ing of normal cardiac function has made them a major area for electrophysiological study.

60|$|I <b>have</b> given <b>the</b> {{foregoing}} <b>details</b> <b>in</b> {{order to}} shew, {{in the first}} place, that when the sexes of butterflies differ, the male {{as a general rule}} is the more beautiful, and departs more from the usual type of colouring of the group to which the species belongs. Hence in most groups the females of the several species resemble each other much more closely than do the males. In some cases, however, to which I shall hereafter allude, the females are coloured more splendidly than the males. In the second place, these details have been given to bring clearly before the mind that within the same genus, the two sexes frequently present every gradation from no difference in colour, to so great a difference that it was long before the two were placed by entomologists in the same genus. In the third place, we have seen that when the sexes nearly resemble each other, this appears due either to <b>the</b> male <b>having</b> transferred his colours to the female, or to <b>the</b> male <b>having</b> retained, or perhaps recovered, the primordial colours of the group. It also deserves notice that in those groups in which the sexes differ, the females usually somewhat resemble the males, so that when the males are beautiful to an extraordinary degree, the females almost invariably exhibit some degree of beauty. From the many cases of gradation in the amount of difference between the sexes, and from the prevalence of the same general type of coloration throughout the whole of the same group, we may conclude that <b>the</b> causes <b>have</b> generally been <b>the</b> same which <b>have</b> determined <b>the</b> brilliant colouring of the males alone of some species, and of both sexes of other species.|$|R
