5|$|Before {{the mid-19th}} century, all houses and marketplaces in Antananarivo, and {{throughout}} Madagascar, were constructed of woods, grasses, reeds and other plant-based materials viewed as appropriate for structures {{used by the}} living. Only family tombs were built from stone, an <b>inert</b> <b>material</b> viewed as appropriate to use for the dead. British missionaries introduced brick-making to the island in the 1820s, and French industrialist Jean Laborde used stone and brick to build his factories {{over the next few}} decades. It was not until the royal edict on construction materials was lifted in the 1860s that stone was used to encase the royal palace. Many aristocrats, inspired by the royal palace and the two-story, brick houses with wrapped verandas and divided interior spaces built by British missionaries, copied the British model for their own large homes in the haute ville. The model, known as trano gasy ("Malagasy house"), rapidly spread throughout the central highlands of Madagascar, where it remains the predominant house construction style.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, <b>inert</b> <b>material).</b> The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirement}} of <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> {{for the building}} industry may be determined according {{to a number of}} approaches, also because it is strictly interlinked to several compartments of the economic system, and undoubtedly represents one of the main final outlets for quarry materials. The demand for these materials therefore will be directly affected by the trend in the construction sector. In particular not considering public works, the explicit requirement for <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> may be grouped under the following typologies: 1. 	residential buildings 2. 	productive buildings Among the Italian regions we quote Lombardy, which with Art. 5 of the Regional Act no. 14 dated 08 August 1998 (New provisions governing the mining of quarry minerals) introduced the variables to be taken into consideration in evaluating the requirement for <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> in the Province, and established a yearly regional average {{requirement of}} gravel sands of 4 cub m per inhabitant. This figure, however, is overdimensioned as it is linked mainly to the structure of the city. It gets reduced, and the more compact the city the greater the reduction approaching 4 cub m per inhabitant for more diffused city configurations. From a comparison of the per capita annual volumes of <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> for building calculated for the Provinces of Milan and Mantua, the following emerges. The small difference in favour of the Province of Mantua is due mainly to the shape of the city. The more compact shape of the city of Milan, and in particular the fact that the residential spaces are contracted lead to a lower per capita consumption of <b>inert</b> <b>materials.</b> In the city of Mantua the fact that the city configuration is less compact in terms of per capita space leads to a greater use of <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> per inhabitant. Excluded from this reasoning are the portions of territory outside the respective cities, for which no significant difference was found, and an average consumption of 1. 4 - 1. 5 cub m per inhabitant can be confirmed. There is a relation therefore between the shape {{of the city and the}} consumption of <b>inert</b> <b>materials.</b> The materials forecast calculation affords greater environmental protection and sustainability, both in the quarrying and in the building activity. ...|$|R

This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a uniform coating of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press very gently to ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E

50|$|The {{surface is}} treated {{primarily}} by snow removal. Roads are also treated by spreading various materials on the surface. These materials generally {{fall into two}} categories: chemical and inert. Chemical (including salt) distribution induces freezing-point depression, causing ice and snow to melt at a lower temperature. Chemical treatment can be applied as a preventive measure and/or after snowfall. <b>Inert</b> <b>materials</b> (i.e. sand, brash, slag) make the surface irregular to improve traction.

40|$|Building {{activity}} is currently demanding remarkable amounts of <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> (such as gravel and sand) {{that are usually}} provided by alluvial sediments. The EU directives and Italian Legislation are encouraging the re-use of construction and demolition waste provided by continuous urban redevelopment. The re-utilisation of building waste {{is a relatively new}} issue for Italy: unfortunately the employment of recycled <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> is still limited to general bulk and drainage fills, while a more complete re-evaluation is generally hampered by the lack of suitable recycling plants. In this paper, chemical–mineralogical characterization of recycled <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> was carried out after preliminary crushing and grain-size sorting. XRF and XRD analysis of the different grain-size classes allowed us to recognise particular granulometric classes that can be re-utilised as first-order material in the building activity. Specifically, the presented chemical–mineralogical appraisal indicates that the recycled grain-size fraction 0. 6 – 0. 125 mm could be directly re-employed in the preparation of new mortar and concrete, while finer fractions could be considered as components for industrial processing in the preparation of cements and bricks/tiles...|$|R

40|$|Stored {{products}} include materials, {{which may}} be dried, rendering them storable for future use as food, industrial raw materials, medicines, or as planting materials. These include cereals, pulses, dried seeds and root crops. Insect infestation is {{a major contributor to}} quality deterioration of stored products kept in warm and humid climates. Considerable physical and nutritional loss sustained are due to infestation of stored food products by weevils, bruchids and other insects. Apart from the detrimental economic impact, these losses pose a major threat to food security. Traditional methods of applying spices, medicinal plants and their extractives, and <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> with pest control potential as storage protectants, have increasingly been explored and exploited in the developing world as alternatives for the control of pests of stored products. In addition to insects, several other organisms attack stored products. These include microorganisms (mainly fungi and bacteria, which cause infection and deterioration), mites, rodents and birds. Plants and plant products can affect insects and other storage pests in various ways by exhibiting pest control activities as toxicants, attractants, repellents, antifeedants and growth regulators; they are also effective as antimicrobials and antifungals. Several kinds of materials are used as a means of stored food protection, including chemical fumigation, treatment with synthetic pesticides, and <b>inert</b> <b>materials.</b> This paper will review research relevant to the application of botanical pesticides, particularly those derived from spices and medicinal plants, and also <b>inert</b> <b>materials,</b> which are traditionally applied to control stored food pests in Thailand...|$|R
