The till surface, which is often fluted, consists ofsix different till sheets. It lies present glacial margin and the bulky terminal moraine ridges. These till sheets correspond to six re-advance stages during the general retreat which followed Little Ice Age ad- vance which formed the bulky terminal moraine ridges. Field observations and till fabric analysis suggest that the minor moraine ridges of Yala Glacier seem to be formed annually, by <b>ice</b> <b>push.</b> On the assumption that their annual character was maintained for a long time, and that the time span needed for each re-advance was proportional to the height of terminal moraine of each till sheet, the dating of Little fee Age moraines was attempted.

40|$|Ice jam floods on the Hay River are {{an annual}} {{concern for the}} people of the Town of Hay River, NWT. Dynamic ice runs from {{upstream}} push into the East and West Channels of the delta and often cause local flooding. A key question faced each year is into which channel will the majority of the <b>ice</b> <b>push</b> and how high will the associated water levels rise. In this study we are attempting to investigate the possibility of addressing these questions through modeling. The CRISSP 2 D model was selected for this application because of its unique capabilities for two dimensional modeling of ice processes and hydraulics. A detailed bathymetry survey was conducted in the delta. Also, to calibrate and validate the model, river freeze-up and breakup processes were observed and measured. The model was found to produce reasonably realistic depictions of the developing ice cover during freeze-up in terms of the sequence of channel filing and extents of juxtaposed versus thermal ice. The ability of the model to simulate breakup ice jams could not be easily assessed because of the limitations on the maximum allowable number of nodes and elements. This forces the user to settle for impractical discretizations and/or domain dimensions. Nevertheless, preliminary indications are that if this limitation could be overcome, the model shows good potential...|$|E
40|$|In the {{southern}} end of Chile and South America (55 to 56 S.) there are forms wich allow to formulate the following by pothesis: In {{the southern}} end, the action and movement field of the ice field during the last glaciation must be reconstructed as it follows: The mountain range Peninsula Hardy (Hoste Island) Wollaston Islands, wich is proposed to appeal Cape Horn (Hoste Island) Wollaston Islands, wich is proposed to appeal Cape Horn Cordillera in the paleogeographic sense, was the break up center of the ice field toward the North as well as the South. Consequently, Nassau Bay acted as glacigenic piedmont during an alaskian type glaciation. The morainic system of the southern coast of Navarino and Lennox islands is related to the genesis of the Windhond Bay lobe in an area of piedmont lakes, showing the push of the ice mantle from the South on the platform wich-paleogeographically can be called Nassau- Windhond glacigenic piedmont. This hypothesis is different to that of KRANCK and CALDENIUS, whose theory assumes that the <b>ice</b> <b>push</b> was from the N W (Darwin Range). The new hypothesis is proved with the use of morphological stratigraphical, sedimentological and geochronological methods. The results show that during the Dryas (Gotiglacial and Finiglacial) the ice advanced fragging eroded materials from the Cape Horn mountains range. This involucres new criteria to establish the age of the glacigenic and coastal forms in the area, with reference to Upper Wurm's stadia...|$|E

Today the two rivers are {{separated}} by the terminal moraine of an ice front that spread up the Pilchuck valley and impounded the Sultan River, creating a lake.

40|$|Herschel Island (Qiqiktaruk in Inuvialuktun) in the {{southern}} Canadian Beaufort Sea was formed as an <b>ice</b> <b>push</b> moraine by the advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum in the late Wisconsinan. In {{the vicinity of the}} island the Herschel Basin was formed contemporarily by that process. Nevertheless we are still lacking evidence for the basin generation and its evolution after creation and the ice sheet retreat. To gain new information about the depositional history and the conditions during and after generation of the basin, I studied seismic two-dimensional profiles from parametric echosounding that were recorded in the basin during expeditions in 2006 and 2013. A big part of the work of this thesis was constituted of the processing and enhancement of these profiles using the programs OpendTect and SeiSee to guarantee high quality datasets. The interpretation of those data together with older geohphysical and borehole logs improved our knowledge of the basin history. The structures and facies that were discovered by this analysis were formed in different states of the basin evolution and provide sufficient new data to reconstruct its generation and development as a depositional centre afterwards. The interpretation supports the hypothesis that the basin was formed as the Laurentide Ice Sheet advanced to its maximum extent, was exposed to the atmosphere after its retreat and became part of the Beaufort Sea after flooding subsequently. Additionally to its interpretation, the echosounding data was used to enhance the existing bathymetric data for the basin as the former maps were not convenient enough for future tasks...|$|E

40|$|High geomorphic and climatic {{variability}} in Arctic coastlines makes evaluating future coastal erosion {{in a changing}} climate a challenge. Predictions must, among other things, incorporate modifications to sediment supply and accommodation space, changes in the permafrost regime, climate variability including rising air and sea temperatures, stronger winds, less sea ice, and increased precipitation. This thesis explores processes and climate variables associated with coastal development throughout the Holocene and within modern times. In so doing, it illustrates how research builds upon itself and can be extended into applied science sectors concerning coastal protection and mitigation strategies. In response {{to the need for}} more detailed surface maps in coastal regions on Svalbard, a combination of geomorphological field observations, differential GPS measurements, and aerial image analysis were used to produce detailed Quaternary maps for two field sites in Central Spitsbergen, Skansbukta and Fredheim. These provide the basis for further study, as mapping in itself is not sufficient for future projections relevant to mitigation strategies and cultural heritage protection. One site of significant value to the cultural memories of Svalbard was chosen for further investigations. The development of Fredheim’s unconsolidated coast has been reviewed in relation to climatic changes during the Holocene, sediment supply and accommodation space, and geomorphic processes such as: beach aggradation, unconsolidated sediment coastal erosion, bedrock erosion, <b>ice</b> <b>push</b> and melt out, and longshore drift. The relation between coastal processes and {{climatic variability}} are reviewed using relative and absolute chronology through spatial analysis and radiocarbon dating. Results from this study are compared to published data from other locations in Central Spitsbergen. Incorporation of rates and age restraints has produced a shoreline displacement curve providing relative time constraints on uplift and thereby understanding of climatic influences on coastal processes in the past. Present day coastal processes are used as a key to past shoreline development and when the past processes are seen from the context of the present, it is possible to outline possible future changes that may threaten the cultural heritage. To further assess the modern processes and current state of the coastline at Fredheim, the new Digital Shoreline Analysis System tool (DSAS) was used to quantify coastal erosion rates. Three other sites with unconsolidated coastlines, showing variations in geomorphology, sedimentology, and exposure to environmental forces, are also reviewed to illustrate disparities in erosional response. Results reveal that even within a single site, such as the 290 m long coastal section at Fredheim, large variations in erosion rate occur. This implies that spatial differences are significant in coastal development and need to be assessed in combination with temporal variability for future assessments and cultural heritage mitigation. The spatial and temporal analysis of Holocene coastal development and modern erosion rates are applied to erosion protection within the field of engineering in the final chapter of this thesis. Having examined the mechanisms behind coastal erosion, in relation to sediment type and bedrock stability, it is suggested that a wooden barricade using posts drilled into the permafrost be built at Fredheim to protect the coast from further erosion. Such a barricade has previously been used on Svalbard and has shown to be extremely resistant to erosion and sea ice impacts and will also prevent sediments from washing away due to fluvial activity through relict channels...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe Anson {{quadrangle}} {{is located}} in west-central Maine in a region which offers complex problems in structural geology, petrology, and stratigraphy. The geomorphology is also considered in this study. The formations which make up the stratigraphy of the quadrangle include the following (from oldest to youngest) : The Perry Mountain, Parmachenee, Madrid, Kennebec, and Anson formations. The Perry Mountain formation, which outcrops only in the extreme northwest corner of the quadrangle, is composed of well bedded quartzites intercalated with sandy biotite-muscovite schists and staurolite schists. The Parmachenee formation consists of thinly bedded gray phyllites, impure biotite quartzites and black limestones. The formation contains notable amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite. The Madrid formation is composed predominantly of calcareous quartzite with lime-silicate minerals in the middle grade metamorphic zones. The formation contains only minor amounts of argillaceous rocks, and calcareous beds, and sulfides are absent or inconspicuous. The quartzites grade upward into the Dyer Hill member which is composed of chloritoid-bearing black slates. The Kennebec formation is composed of thinly bedded black sulfide-rich limestones, phyllites, and quartzites. The Anson formation consists of brown-mottled grits and arenaceous phyllites. The brown spots are caused by the oxidation of siderite. The position and formational status of the Kennebec and Anson formations are still in doubt. The Anson formation correlates {{on the basis of}} similar lithology with the Vassalboro formation in the Vassalboro quadrangle, which is Clinton in age. The edge of two intrusive bodies project into the quadrangle the Black Hill pluton and the Sandy River pluton. Only one phase is present, quartz monzonite, which varies in texture from medium to coarse grain. The rocks near the Black Hill pluton show distinct contact metamorphic affects, including the presence of andalusite. The low-grade regionally metamorphosed rocks are restricted to the south and southeast portions of the quadrangle, while the mille-grade metamorphic zone is found in the north and northwest area. There is no well-defined garnet isograd. The relationship of the siderite to the sulfides is decreased in detail. Siderite formed at an oxidation potential higher than that needed for pyrite. The sideritic rocks formed near the shore of the marine basin where more oxygen was available. The pyrrhotite in this region was considered to have been formed from pyrite under metamorphic conditions. An alternate explanation is suggested: namely that initial sulfide from which the pyrrhotite formed may have been FeS rather than FeS 2. This would involve a subtraction of iron from the primitive FeS to form the pyrrhotite. The rocks containing the sulfides were formed in a strongly reducing environment, probably a barred basin with restricted circulation. The major fold structures trend northeast-southwest. The axial planes of the isoclinal folds are slightly overturned and dip to the northwest. The absence of noses of folds and the consistently steep dip of the beds may also be explained in terms of pleated folding. No large scale faulting has been observed in the quadrangle, although minor longitudinal faulting is not uncommon. Glaciation modified the pre-existing topography slightly by deposition and erosion. Glacial striations trend between S 20 °E and S 30 °E. Post-glacial geomorphic features, which include alluvial terraces, falls, <b>ice</b> <b>push,</b> discordant junctions, and sand dunes, are all described and their origins are discussed. The marine limit in the quadrangle is considered to be at least at the 400 foot elevation as evidenced by marine fossils found just south of the Anson quadrangle...|$|E

50|$|Automatic icemakers for {{the home}} were first offered by the Servel company around 1953. They are usually found inside the freezer {{compartment}} of a refrigerator. They produce crescent-shaped ice cubes from a metal mold. An electromechanical or electronic timer first opens a solenoid valve for a few seconds, allowing the mold to fill with water from the domestic cold water supply. The timer then closes the valve and lets the ice freeze for about 30 minutes. Then, the timer turns on a low-power electric heating element inside the mold for several seconds, to melt the ice cubes slightly so they will not stick to the mold. Finally, the timer runs a rotating arm that scoops the ice cubes out of the mold and into a bin, and the cycle repeats.
