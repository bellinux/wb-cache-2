The Timahoe pocket deposit was initially mistaken for a buried palaeoriver due to its linearity, therefore other claimed palaeorivers in the region may also be pocket deposits.

40|$|Abstract. Extreme {{learning}} machine (ELM), a relatively novel {{machine learning algorithm}} for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs), has been shown competitive performance in simple structure and superior training speed. To improve the effectiveness of ELM for <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> noisy datasets, <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> structure of ELM, short for DS-ELM, is proposed in this paper. DS-ELM contains three level networks (actually contains three nets) : the first level network is trained by auto-associative neural network (AANN) aim to filter out noise as well as reduce dimension when necessary; the second level network is another AANN net aim to fix the input weights and bias of ELM; and the last level network is ELM. Experiments on four noisy datasets are carried out to examine the new proposed DS-ELM algorithm.

40|$|Cleaning of {{particulate}} soils is {{an important}} issue in food and pharmaceutical production. Understanding the adherence of these soils is a fundamental requirement for improving surfaces cleanability. The combination of particles and macromolecules substances appears in many processes. Adsorbed compounds from these mixtures may influence interactions at interfaces and thus fouling and cleaning. This thesis <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> understanding of the physico-chemical mechanisms affecting soiling and cleanability of open substrates in the presence of biomacromolecules (dextran, bovine serum albumin – BSA, beta-lactoglobulin – β-LGB). Model substrates were chosen according to their hydrophobicity. The influence of macromolecules was examined by introducing them in the quartz suspension taken as a model of hard hydrophilic soil used for soiling, or by conditioning the substrate prior to soiling. The substrates were pretreated with ethanol (-Eth.), piranha or UV-Ozone (-UVO); soiled by spraying the quartz suspensions, then dried, before cleaning assessment. The removal of the soiling particles was evaluated after exposure to water in a radial flow chamber (RFC). Auxiliary characterizations were surface tension and contact angle measurements, surface analysis of the substrate by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The interpretation of XPS data allowed the complexity due to the ubiquitous presence of organic contaminants to be coped with, and the surface composition to be expressed in terms of both the amount of adlayer and the mass concentration of adlayer constituents. The contact of substrates with proteins led to their adsorption, which dominated the composition of the organic layer with respect to contaminants initially present, and was not markedly desorbed upon rinsing. Dextran was easily removed in presence of water, independently on the substrate nature. Surface hydrophobicity was shown to influence the morphology of the aggregates resulting from drying. The rounder aggregates formed on polystyrene when soiling was performed with suspension in pure water are more sensitive to wall shear stress than flatter ones formed on more hydrophilic substrate. This {{is the result of the}} competing processes of droplet rolling and coalescing, on the one hand, and droplet spreading, on the other hand. It affects the shape and compactness of the adhering aggregates, the efficiency of shear forces upon cleaning and finally, the adherence of soiling particles. The presence of proteins (either native or denatured) at the interface improved strongly the cleanability of more hydrophilic substrate (glass, StSteel-UVO). This is attributed to the lower surface tension. The dependence of cleanability on capillary forces, and in particular on the liquid surface tension, is predominant as compared with its dependence on the size and shape of the soiling aggregates, which influence the efficiency of shear forces exerted by the flowing water upon cleaning. The cleanability of less hydrophilic substrate (stainless steel only pre-cleaned with ethanol) did not change markedly in the presence of proteins; this may be due to a more complex interaction between surface tension and contact angle, on one hand, and a more complex interaction between proteins and contaminants, on the other hand. The presence of dextran did not affect the cleanability, as neither the liquid surface tension nor the contact angle was appreciably affected...|$|R
40|$|CdTe and CdZnTe are {{promising}} materials for room temperature semiconductor X-ray and gamma ray detectors. The accumulation {{of a space}} charge at deep energy levels due to a band bending at contacts with Schottky barriers and due to trapped photogenerated charge may result in time dependent change of charge collection efficiency in CdTe and CdZnTe detectors known as polarization effect. This thesis is mainly focused on a study of electric field profiles in detectors under dark and high photon flux conditions simulating detector operation using crossed polarizers technique exploiting the electro-optic (Pockels) effect. It also <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> study of <b>deep</b> levels responsible for the polarization and influence of contact metals on charge accumulation. Several experimental results are supported by theoretical simulations. The measurements were performed on three sets of samples equipped with different contact metals (Au, In) cut from three different n-type CdTe and CdZnTe materials. Energy levels were detected using methods based on the Pockels effect and discharge current measurements. Detailed study of internal electric field profiles has revealed a fundamental influence of near midgap energy levels related to crystal defects and contact metals on the polarization in semiconductor detectors under high radiation [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In an open {{computing}} environment, {{such as the}} World Wide Web or {{an enterprise}} Intranet, various information systems are expected {{to work together to}} support information exchange, processing, and integration. However, information systems are usually built by different people, at different times, to fulfil different requirements and goals. Consequently, {{in the absence of an}} architectural framework for information integration geared toward semantic integration, there are widely varying viewpoints and assumptions regarding what is essentially the same subject. Therefore, communication among the components supporting various applications is not possible without at least some translation. This problem, however, is much more than a simple agreement on tags or mappings between roughly equivalent sets of tags in related standards. Industry-wide initiatives and academic studies have shown that complex representation issues can arise. To <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> these issues, <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> understanding and appropriate treatment of semantic integration is needed. Ontology is an important and widely accepted approach for semantic integration. However, usually there are no explicit ontologies with information systems. Rather, the associated semantics are implied within the supporting information model. It reflects a specific view of the conceptualization that is implicitly defining an ontological view. This research proposes to adopt ontological views to facilitate semantic integration for information systems in open environments. It proposes a theoretical foundation of ontological views, practical assumptions, and related solutions for research issues. The proposed solutions mainly focus on three aspects: the architecture of a semantic integration enabled environment, ontological view modeling and representation, and semantic equivalence relationship discovery. The solutions are applied to the collaborative intelligence project for the collaborative promotion / advertisement domain. Various quality aspects of the solutions are evaluated and future directions of the research are discussed...|$|R
