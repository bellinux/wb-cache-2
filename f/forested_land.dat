The analysis of the communes around studied urban centres allows for the assessment of the local governments’ spatial development policy with reference to <b>forest</b> <b>lands.</b> The paper shows how local authorities prevent these lands from disappearing and how closely this task is related to the usage of the spatial information instruments such as land use plans (spatial development plans).

To characterize these changes, the individuals and organizations who purchased <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> from Minnesota's county land departments were surveyed using a mail questionnaire. The sale of county <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> {{did not appear to}} produce noticeable changes in timber harvesting or the level of investment in forest management.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{economics}} of conversion and fragmentation of <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> The forestry economics literature has generally focussed on the management of a single stand for timber and nontimber forest benefits with little attention being paid to <b>forest</b> level <b>land</b> use decisions, and in particular forest stand interactions. As noted by Bowes and Krutilla (1989), the focus on a single stand may be a considerable weakness of the multiple-use <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use models given that the provision of nontimber forest benefits, such as biodiversity storage, watershed protection and micro-climatic maintenance, often depend on the setting of a single stand within a larger forest area. If this is the case, then decisions about <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use and allocation need {{to take account of}} the interaction between the stand and the total stock of <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> The nature of the relationship between stand and total stock of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> is of central importance. In this paper, we define three cases that reflect a range of typical stand-stock relationships that may arise: those being constant, diminishing and increasing marginal returns to the scale of the total forest stock. We explore the <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use decision {{from the perspective of a}} social planner. Taking stand-total forest stock interactions effects into account has important implications for the choice of framework for the economic analysis as well as for the <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation decision. This paper shows that it is not just the level of forest conversion that may be affected by taking stand-stock interactions into account, but also the spatial distribution of the remaining patches of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> for the provision of non-timber forest benefits. The insights from this paper are particularly applicable to those tropical forest regions facing high rates of forest conversion and fragmentation. Policy implications, such as the establishment of minimum viable forest stocks, buffer zones and corridors, are discusse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although forest {{devolution}} {{has become}} a major trend in forest governance in developing countries over the last two decades, there is increasing concern about the legitimacy of this well-intentioned policy. Examination of Vietnam’s <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation policy helps assess this concern. After the collapse of Vietnam’s state forestry in the late 1980 s, the Vietnamese government allocated <b>forest</b> <b>lands</b> to individuals, households and organizations for more effective forest protection and rehabilitation. Despite this expectation, the policy has been challenged by increasing conflicts between forestry agencies and local people over lands. This paper uses a case study in Tay Ninh province, South Vietnam, to examine the legitimacy of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation, with particular focus on local support for the policy. Initial research findings reveal that, because of some gaps in the policy strategy to gain legitimacy, calculations on short-term incomes have overwhelmed other determinants of local support for <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation.
