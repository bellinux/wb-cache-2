40|$|AbstractA {{total of}} 27 large scale direct shear tests have been {{conducted}} to investigate the shear strength and dilatancy of well graded sand-gravel mixtures. This paper focuses on the differences in behavior between three soils: sandy gravel with a specified gradation as the base soil, and two other ones with equivalent scalped or parallel <b>gradations.</b> Direct shear <b>tests</b> were conducted on three considered soils. Maximum grain size is 25. 4 mm in base soil, and is limited to 12. 5 mm for equivalent scalped and parallel gradations. Test results are considered in terms of frictional and dilatancy contributions to the shear strength {{as a function of}} relative density and applied surcharge pressure. According to the results, the <b>gradation</b> of <b>tested</b> soils affects their shear strength by a change in maximum friction angle, which can be related to both dilatancy at failure and the constant volume friction angle. Scalped gradation is found as a better approximate gradation compared to the parallel one for determination of peak shear strength for coarse grained soils. Finally, empirical equations are developed to relate the shear strength characteristics of the base gradation to scalped and parallel ones...|$|R

Main components of ballasted rail track structure could be subdivided as track superstructure and track substructure. The loading from the train will be distributed from the superstructure to substructure. The main structural component of substructure is considered as track ballast which is generally crushed hard stones. Railway authorities specify gradation specifications for selection of ballast for rail tracks. Sri Lanka railways also specified a gradation limits in the selection of ballast for rail tracks. Current standard is closely resembled to the Indian rail track ballast specifications. Commonly, the ballast used in Sri Lanka is crushed gneiss rocks which are in abundance. It is well understood that granular materials derive its strength by resistance to shearing. However, there is no examination conducted to evaluate the performance of rail track ballast used in Sri Lanka considering the shear behaviour. The objective of this preliminary study is to investigate the shear strength characteristics of ballast gradation used in Sri Lanka and compare with selected other ballast gradation specifications. Parallel gradation technique was used to model the sample as it is difficult to handle large size ballast in the conventional direct shear box. Direct shear tests were conducted under three normal pressures of 15 kPa, 45 kPa and 90 kPa on different ballast gradations including current Sri Lankan specification.

In addition, the contractor's cylinder strengths and gradations were analyzed for statistical stability and process capability. This research supports the following conclusions: (1) The mold type used to cast the concrete cylinders had an effect on the compressive strength of the concrete. The 4. 5 -in. by 9 -in. (11. 43 -cm by 22. 86 -cm) cylinders had lower strength at a 95 % confidence interval than the 4 -in. by 8 -in. (10. 16 -cm by 20. 32 -cm) and 6 -in. by 12 -in. (15. 24 -cm by 30. 48 -cm) cylinders. (2) The low vibration consolidation effort had the lowest strength of the three consolidation efforts. In particular, an interaction occurred between the low vibration effort and the 4. 5 -in. by 9 -in. (11. 43 -cm by 22. 86 -cm) mold. This interaction produced very low compressive strengths when compared with the other consolidation efforts.

It is therefore appropriate specify the design binder content (DBC) for porous asphalt rather than the optimum binder content. The design binder content incorporates an upper and a lower limit. The lower limit of the DBC can be dictated by requirements to resist disintegration while the upper limit is specified to limit binder drainage yet maintaining a porous structure that would promote permeability. This paper {{presents the results of}} a laboratory investigation to determine design binder content for porous asphalt. Three <b>gradations</b> were <b>tested</b> each made up of 10, 14 and 20 mm maximum aggregate size.

40|$|Although {{extensively}} used as {{core material}} in dams {{in many parts}} of the world, internal instability and suffusion potential of glacial till is still a relatively unexplored field. Statistically, dams with cores of glacial till have higher frequency of internal erosion incidents than dams with other types of core soils. Such potential overrepresentation may stem back to the erodibility of the glacial till itself. One mechanism that may be influential is suffusion due to internal instability. The literature offers several methods to evaluate a soils vulnerability to this mechanism, however, in terms of glacial till soils; the validity of assessment criteria is unclear. An offset in applicability may, at best, provide too conservative guidance, but at worst, it may be misleading, confusing or erroneous.

A design criterion for these walls was originally {{established by the}} Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and has been modified on a state by state basis. Recently, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has recorded several wall failures mostly due to excessive settlement and lateral wall deformation and wanted to evaluate the current state design guidelines for regionally available backfill materials. Prior to numerical modeling simulations, material parameters of regionally available backfill needed to be evaluated. As the state guidelines require 85 -percent of the wall backfill material to be above the No. 4 sieve, large scale triaxial testing was an option to evaluate strength and volume change parameters. This research used cylindrical specimen 6 -inches in diameter and 12 - inches in height {{in a large scale}} triaxial apparatus. Three types of backfill material were tested and specimens were mixed and compacted in 4 different gradations for each material type. Each <b>gradation</b> was <b>tested</b> at confining stresses corresponding to wall heights of 10, 15, and 20 feet for a total of 36 tests. Basic material parameters such as unit weight and friction angle were evaluated directly from testing, while more complex material parameters were selected from the data for use in the Duncan-Chang elastic constitutive model. This method utilizes hyperbolic curve fitting of both strength and volumetric test data to define soil behavior parameters which include the following: modulus number (K), modulus exponent (n), initial tangent modulus (Ei), failure ratio (Rf), initial Poisson?s Ratio (?i), and Poisson?s Ratio Parameters G, F, and d. Friction angles from triaxial testing ranged from 32 to 53 degrees having some uncertainty due to inconsistent compaction. The variation in sand and fine size particles in the backfill tended to reduce friction angles, except in the case of Type-B material where density increased due to the high percentage of sand and fines. Duncan-Chang parameters fit reasonably well with experimental data for strength barring some experimental errors. Volumetric parameters were inconclusive due to inconsistent compaction and membrane leakage. Additional testing is needed to provide more sound volumetric data...|$|R

However, certain green technologies have been developed in the absence of design standards. Ecoroofs, which are vegetated soil masses placed on the top of a building’s roof structure, present several engineering concerns. Several important engineering concerns include overstressing of the roof structure due to ponding or excessive saturated soil dead loads during storm events, sliding of the ecoroof material causing overtopping or complete failure of the parapet walls during a seismic event, and the increase of inertial load at the top of the building. Standardization of ecoroof soil and the development of design codes for ecoroof systems in the United States would minimize the possibility of structural failure. Accordingly, this study presents the quantification of the geotechnical index properties and their variability, static stress-strain and volumetric response, and dynamic soil response and properties for ecoroof soil. A field exploration program, which included gathering undisturbed Shelby tube samples of ecoroof soil, was conducted in Portland, Oregon. The field exploration provided the basis for the geotechnical characterization of ecoroof soil. Sample statistics of the geotechnical index properties showed significant variability. Sieve testing showed that field samples of ecoroof soils tended to cluster; therefore, three target gradations were selected to serve as representative ecoroof gradations, which varied in the amount of fines present (i. e. material passing No. 200 sieve), median grain sizes, and uniformity of the gradation. Drained static simple shear tests were conducted on specimens reconstituted from each of the target <b>gradations.</b> The <b>tests</b> were performed to investigate the effect of relative density, applied vertical stress, and gradation on static shear strength, each of which contribute to variations in ecoroof strength. To understand the effect of organic matter on the strength parameters, three undisturbed specimens were sheared and the test results indicated that the organic content has significant influence on the volumetric and stress-strain response of ecoroof soil. Preliminary dynamic soil properties, such as the modulus reduction and damping characteristics, and the liquefaction susceptibility of ecoroof soil was determined from a series of undrained cyclic simple shear tests on reconstituted and undisturbed tube specimens. Many reconstituted ecoroof soil specimens exhibited liquefaction under undrained cyclic strain controlled conditions, and variations in liquefaction susceptibility, were attributed to the type of soil gradation. Cyclic simple shear tests on undisturbed tube specimen specimens indicated that the organic content influences the dynamic response of ecoroof soil. Accordingly, this study provides a baseline with which practicing engineers can begin to assess the loading associated with ecoroof soil, and may be used to guide future studies and code development...|$|R

Aggregate stability {{has a significant}} impact on the development of the root system, water and carbon cycle and soil resistance against soil erosion. Soil aggregate stability, defined as the ability of the aggregates to remain intact when subject to a given stress, is an important soil property that affects the movement and storage of water, aeration, erosion, biological activity and growth of crops. Dry soil aggregate stability (Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), Geometric Mean Diameter (GMD)) and Wet Aggregate Stability (WAS) are important indices for evaluating soil aggregate stability. To improve soil physical properties, including modifying aggregate, using various additives (organic, inorganic and chemicals), zeolites are among what has been studied. According to traditional definition, zeolites are hydratealuminosilicates of alkaline and alkaline-earth minerals. Their structure is made up of a framework of[SiO 4]− 4 and [AlO 4]− 5 tetrahedron linked to each other's cornersby sharing oxygen atoms. The substitution of Si+ 4 by Al+ 3 intetrahedral sites results inmore negative charges and a high cation exchange capacity. Zeolites, as natural cation exchangers, are suitable substitutes to remove toxic cations. Among the natural zeolites,Clinoptilolite seems to be the most efficient ion exchanger and ion-selective material forremoving and stabilizing heavy metals. Due to theexisting insufficient technical information on the effects of using different levels of zeolite on physical properties of different types of soils in Iran, the aim of this research was to assess the effects of two different types of zeolite (Clinoptilolite natural zeolite, Z 4, and Synthetic zeolite, A 4) on aggregate stability indicesof soil. Materials and Methods: In this study at first, after preparation of two different types of soil with light and medium texture and doing identification tests such as determination of <b>gradation</b> and hydrometer <b>tests</b> and Atterberg limits, zeolite in four levels, 0 (control), 1...|$|R
40|$|This past {{winter the}} sieve {{analysis}} of combined aggregate was investigated. This study was given No. 26 by the Central Laboratory. The {{purpose of this}} work was to try and develop a sieve analysis procedure for combined aggregate which is less time consuming and has the same accuracy as the method described in I. M. 304. In an attempt to {{use a variety of}} aggregates for this investigation, a request was made to each District Materials Office to obtain at least 3 different combined aggregate samples in their respective districts. At the same time it was also requested that the field technician test these samples, prior to submitting them to the Central Laboratory. The field technician was instructed to test each sample as described in method I. M. 304 and also by a modified AASHTO T 27 method which will be identified in the report as Method A. The modified AASHTO Method A was identical to T 27 with the exception that a smaller sample is used for testing. The field technicians submitted the samples, test results and also comments regarding the modified AASHTO procedure. The general comments of the modified AASHTO procedure were: The method was much simpler to follow; however, it took about {{the same amount of time}} so there was no real advantage. After reviewing AASHTO T 27, T 164, I. M. 304 and Report No. FHWA-RD- 77 - 53 another test method was purposed. Report No. FHWA-RD- 77 - 53 is a report prepared by FHWA from data they gathered concerning control practices and shortcut or alternative test methods for aggregate <b>gradation.</b> A second <b>test</b> method was developed which also was very similar to AASHTO T 27, The test procedure for this method is attached and is identified as Method B. The following is a summary of test results submitted by the Field Technicians and obtained by the aggregate section of the Central Laboratory...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} effects of radiology and x-rays equipments do not only give excellent benefit for human, but also harmful effect {{at the same}} time. Protecting people form the radiation is an important aspect to control such harmful effect. Hence every nuclear installation and radiology unit must pay attention on protecting surrounding people from the radiation. Lead is commonly used as component of shield, {{but the use of}} lead requires special work and energy. In economical aspects, the cost of such effort is relatively expensive, but in workability aspects, the application of iron sand mortar can be used as alternative material to protect from radiation. This study assessed gamma radiation absorption on mortar cube sample with dimension of 15 x 15 cm and thickness variation of 1 cm to 15 cm. Mortar ingredient consisted of iron sand, cements and water, with cements - iron sand volume ratio of 1 : 6. Water cement ratio was determined at 0, 4 and the gamma radiant energy applied were Iodine- 131 (131 I) denergi 284, 00 keVs, 364, 00 keVs, 637, 00 keVs and Caesium- 137 (137 Cs) dissociation energy of diatomic 662, 00 keV. Physical <b>test</b> <b>gradation</b> conducted to iron sand from Congot beach Kulonprogo regency of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province, showed specific gravity of 4, 331 with, Ssd specific gravity of 4, 330, unit weight of 2, 554 gr/cm³, water absorbency 0, 442 %, and grain finest modulus of 1, 33, which was categorized as zone IV (smooth gradation). Compressive strength and specific gravity of Iron sand mortar at 28 days reached 7, 92 MPa and 2, 59 respectively. Especially, specific gravity was heavier than ordinary cements mortar with average value ranged from 1, 80 - 2, 20. Coefficient linear magnitude attenuation (μ) of iron sand mortar at radiation energy 284 keVs, 364 keVs, 637 keVs and 662 keVs were 0, 2816 cm- 1, 0, 2253 cm- 1, 0, 1297 cm- 1 and 0, 1003 cm- 1 respectively. Based on these relation, the line equation obtained was y = 0, 5631 e(- 0025 X) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to visualize the crushing of a weak granular material during compression. In {{order to be able to}} see the individual particles of the sample with out the usage of sophisticated and expensive equipment, roasted chick peas were used to model granular material. The chick peas were chosen because of their size and availability. A series of uniaxial confined compression tests were run on the chick peas to check different aspects of the fragmentation. All the samples used in the tests were prepared the same way having the same initial height and mass. The samples also had uniform <b>gradation.</b> An initial <b>test</b> was run on the chick peas to an applied vertical load of 3 kN. This test was used to create a void ratio versus the logarithm of the stress curve. From the curve constructed from the results of the first test four applied vertical loads were chosen. These four applied vertical loads were used throughout the research. The first set of uniaxial confined compression tests were used to determine how many chick peas were broken during compression. The next set of uniaxial confined compression tests were used to run sieve analysis on each sample and to determine how the gradation of the sample changed as the applied vertical load increased. Another confined uniaxial compression test was run to a selected load to determine how the crushing occurred internally. Through out the research several pictures were taken with a digital camera to help illustrate the crushing inside and outside the samples. Pictures outside the samples were possible since the cylinders used for the compression tests were transparent. A fractal analysis was done using the results of the sieve analysis for each sample. Fractal fragmentation dimensions were calculated to determine the degree of crushing at each of the applied vertical loads. Another fractal analysis was done using a Seirpinski Gasket in order visualize the way the samples developed a fractal size distribution. Six level of the gasket were generated and used to model a sample fragmenting during compression...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo {{has been}} a {{traditional}} construction material in many regions for centuries. The rapid growth and maturation rate of bamboo {{as well as its}} good strength properties and global accessibility make it a promising non-conventional building material resource. However, due to limited standardization and design criteria, bamboo has often been relegated to non-engineered and marginally-engineered construction. The current study assesses the performance of full-culm structural bamboo components and appropriate standard material and member test methods. A brief overview is given to the motivation for the study of structural bamboo, placing the work in its social context, followed by background on the properties of bamboo and the structural applications of the material as well as the pathway to its further standardization and utilization. Experimental and analytical studies are conducted focusing on the tensile, flexural, buckling, and environmental sustainability performance of full-culm bamboo components. Standard bamboo tension tests are carried out to investigate the test interferences associated with the functionally graded fiber distribution across the culm wall thickness. Tension specimens oriented in both the radial and tangential directions are considered in order to isolate the effects of the fiber <b>gradation</b> both on <b>test</b> results and experimental methodology. Recognizing longitudinal splitting induced by flexure as a dominant limit state, modified standard bamboo flexural tests are performed to investigate the development of a standard test procedure for this limit state, which involves a mixed-mode longitudinal splitting failure in the flexural element. Flexural testing considers two test configurations and three difference species of bamboo. Results of modified full-culm tests are compared with smaller clear bamboo flexural specimens taken from the culm wall as well as standard or proposed tests for pure mode I and pure mode II failure components. The experimental buckling capacity of single-culm and multiple-culm bamboo columns is studied as further understanding of column strength is critical to the construction of more robust and potentially multiple-story bamboo structures. Finally, in an effort to quantify the perceived sustainability benefits of bamboo, the environmental impacts of multiple-culm bamboo columns are compared with structurally comparable timber and steel alternatives in a comparative midpoint life cycle analysis...|$|R
