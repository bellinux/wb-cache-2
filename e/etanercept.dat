5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, <b>etanercept</b> has showed encouraging results.|$|E
25|$|There {{has also}} been a report of strongyloides hyperinfection after use of <b>Etanercept.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anti-TNF {{therapy has}} shown only modest effects in cancer therapy. Treatment of renal cell {{carcinoma}} with infliximab resulted in prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients. <b>Etanercept</b> was tested for treating patients with breast cancer and ovarian cancer showing prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients via downregulation of IL-6 and CCL2. On the other hand, adding infliximab or <b>etanercept</b> to gemcitabine for treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer {{was not associated with}} differences in efficacy when compared with placebo.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} anti–tumor {{necrosis}} factor medications such as infliximab and <b>etanercept</b> are unclear and possibly harmful. Evidence is unclear for pentoxifylline. Propylthiouracil {{may result in}} harm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etanercept</b> {{is being}} studied as {{treatment}} {{for a number of}} diseases. This includes certain forms of vasculitis (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, in which it was not effective).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and <b>etanercept),</b> abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etanercept</b> is a dimeric molecule, {{and this}} dimeric {{structure}} {{is necessary for}} its proper therapeutic activity. During its development at Immunex Corporation an earlier monomeric version did not have sufficient biologic activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etanercept</b> is {{made from}} the {{combination}} of two naturally occurring soluble human 75-kilodalton TNF receptors linked to an Fc portion of an IgG1. The effect is an artificially engineered dimeric fusion protein.|$|E
25|$|Other {{monoclonal}} antibodies targeting TNF-α are golimumab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. <b>Etanercept</b> also binds and inhibits {{the action}} of TNF-α, but is not a monoclonal antibody (it is instead a fusion of TNF-receptor and an antibody constant region).|$|E
25|$|<b>Etanercept</b> was {{developed}} by researchers at Immunex, and was released for commercial use in late 1998, soon {{after the release of}} infliximab (Remicade), which was the first chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNFα to be marketed for clinical use.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of TNF receptors: those found {{embedded}} in white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other cytokines, and soluble TNF receptors which are used to deactivate TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). <b>Etanercept</b> mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that <b>etanercept,</b> because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.|$|E
25|$|High-dose {{corticosteroid}} {{therapy is}} often used for severe disease manifestations. Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab has shown promise in treating the uveitis associated with the disease. Another Anti-TNF agent, <b>etanercept,</b> {{may be useful in}} people with mainly skin and mucosal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013, the Indian pharma major Cipla made an {{announcement}} about launching the first biosimilar of <b>Etanercept</b> in India under {{the brand name}} 'Etacept' {{for the treatment of}} rheumatic disorders. The company's April 17, 2013 press release claimed that the biosimilar will cost 30% less as compared to the innovator.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis can develop anti-dsDNA antibodies, however {{they are usually}} treatment related. Anti-TNFα biological therapies, such as adalimumab, infliximab and <b>etanercept,</b> can often induce the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. They are usually low avidity and are only detectable transiently after treatment. The presence of these antibodies can induce a lupus-like syndrome in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNFα) is a cytokine {{produced by}} lymphocytes and macrophages, {{two types of}} white blood cells. It mediates the immune response by attracting additional white blood cells to sites of inflammation, and through additional molecular mechanisms which initiate and amplify inflammation. Inhibition of its action by <b>etanercept</b> reduces the inflammatory response which is especially useful for treating autoimmune diseases.|$|E
25|$|TNF {{blockers}} and methotrexate {{appear to}} have similar effectiveness when used alone and better results are obtained when used together. TNF blockers {{appear to have}} equivalent effectiveness with <b>etanercept</b> appearing to be the safest. Abatacept appears effective for RA with 20% more people improving with treatment than without but long term safety studies are yet unavailable. However, {{there is a lack}} of evidence to distinguish between the biologics available for RA. Issues with the biologics include their high cost and association with infections including tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etanercept</b> is {{a fusion}} protein {{produced}} by recombinant DNA. It fuses the TNF receptor {{to the constant}} end of the IgG1 antibody. First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for soluble TNF receptor 2, which is a receptor that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the Fc end of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc.|$|E
25|$|In psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, improve {{the signs and}} symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, the results suggest infliximab, <b>etanercept,</b> and adalimumab {{have the potential to}} reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. Results suggest infliximab is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA.|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, 2008, the FDA {{placed a}} black box warning on <b>etanercept</b> {{due to a}} number of serious infections {{associated}} with the drug. [...] Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of <b>Etanercept</b> including reactivation of latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B infections.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Etanercept</b> (trade name Enbrel) is a {{biopharmaceutical}} {{that treats}} autoimmune diseases by interfering with tumor necrosis factor (TNF; a soluble inflammatory cytokine) by {{acting as a}} TNF inhibitor. It has U.S. F.D.A. approval to treat rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. TNF-alpha is the [...] "master regulator" [...] of the inflammatory (immune) response in many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. <b>Etanercept</b> {{has the potential to}} treat these diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha.|$|E
2500|$|Infliximab has adverse effects, some life-threatening, {{common to}} {{drugs in the}} class of TNF {{inhibiting}} immunosuppressants (which also includes <b>etanercept</b> (Enbrel) and adalimumab (Humira)). Some of the most severe are: ...|$|E
2500|$|In North America, <b>etanercept</b> is marketed by Amgen {{under the}} trade name Enbrel in two {{separate}} formulations, one in powder form, the other as a pre-mixed liquid. Wyeth [...] was the sole marketer of Enbrel outside North America excluding Japan where Takeda Pharmaceuticals markets the drug.|$|E
2500|$|Most rheumatic {{diseases}} {{are treated with}} analgesics, NSAIDs (Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), steroids (in serious cases), DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs), monoclonal antibodies, such as [...] infliximab and adalimumab, and the soluble TNF receptor <b>etanercept</b> and Methotrexate for moderate to severe Rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agent Rituximab (Anti-B-Cell Therapy) is now licensed for use in refractory Rheumatoid Arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015, Samsung and Biogen's {{joint venture}} [...] "Samsung Bioepis" [...] {{successfully}} submitted Benepali, a biosimilar {{version of the}} drug, for review to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and {{announced that it will}} seek regulatory approvals in other territories as well. Later the same year, the European Medicines Agency also accepted Sandoz’s application for review of its <b>etanercept</b> product that will be marketed by Novartis.|$|E
2500|$|Infliximab neutralizes the {{biological}} activity of TNF-α by binding with high affinity to the soluble (free {{floating in the}} blood) and transmembrane (located on the outer membranes of T cells and similar immune cells) forms of TNF-α, and inhibits or prevents the effective binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Infliximab and adalimumab (another TNF antagonist) are in the subclass of [...] "anti-TNF antibodies" [...] (they are {{in the form of}} naturally occurring antibodies), and are capable of neutralizing all forms (extracellular-, transmembrane-, and receptor-bound) TNF-α. <b>Etanercept,</b> a third TNF antagonist, is in a different subclass (receptor-construct fusion protein), and, because of its modified form, cannot neutralize receptor-bound TNF-α. Additionally, the anti-TNF antibodies adalimumab and infliximab have the capability of lysing cells involved in the inflammatory process, whereas the receptor fusion protein apparently lacks this capability. Although the clinical significance of these differences have not been absolutely proven, <b>etanercept,</b> has been shown to perform worse than placebo for Crohn's disease. These differences may account for the differential actions of these drugs in both efficacy and side effects.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{biological}} therapy {{agents and}} monoclonal antibodies have not showed as much efficacy {{in the treatment}} of IBD. [...] These include <b>etanercept</b> (which is the soluble receptor for TNF. Adalimumab (which is a humanized recombinant antibody to TNF) showed effectiveness in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, but less than that of infliximab. [...] It however conveys an advantage in that it is given by subcutaneous injection as opposed to infliximab, which is given by intravenous infusion.|$|E
2500|$|TNF {{promotes}} the inflammatory response, which, in turn, causes {{many of the}} clinical problems associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and refractory asthma. [...] These disorders are sometimes treated by using a TNF inhibitor. This inhibition can be achieved with a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab (Remicade) binding directly to TNFα, adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) or with a decoy circulating receptor fusion protein such as <b>etanercept</b> (Enbrel) which binds to TNFα with greater affinity than the TNFR.|$|E
2500|$|The {{patent on}} Enbrel was {{originally}} set {{to expire on}} October 23, 2012, but, in the United States, a second patent, granting exclusivity for another 16 years, has been granted. Before the extension it seemed unlikely that a generic would have been available. As a biologic, <b>etanercept</b> is subject to different laws from those applicable to chemical formulations. Currently many countries do not permit the manufacture of generic biologics. However, the European Union and the United States (...) do currently have in place a system to approve generic biologics (biosimilars) which [...] "requires mandatory clinical testing and periodic review".|$|E
2500|$|In the US, Sandoz {{submitted}} a biologics license application (BLA) {{for the proposed}} <b>etanercept</b> product [...] "GP2015" [...] in July 2016. [...] Upon acceptance of the first application process, the U.S. FDA reviewed data from European clinical trials and bio-analytical investigations, demonstrating the biosimilarity of GP2015 to the US-licensed Enbrel. Sandoz in 2009 tried to invalidate the patents held by Hoffman-La Roche/Immunex and exclusively licensed to Amgen but lost in federal court. Sandoz was then countersued by Amgen for patent infringements related to the methods of treating psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. The case Immunex Corp. et al. vs. Sandoz Inc. et al., 16-cv-01118-CCC-JBC (D.N.J.) is pending.|$|E
2500|$|Treatments for {{autoimmune}} disease {{have traditionally been}} immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, or palliative. Managing inflammation is critical in {{autoimmune disease}}s. Non-immunological therapies, such as hormone replacement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat outcomes of the autoaggressive response, thus these are palliative treatments. [...] Dietary manipulation limits the severity of celiac disease. [...] Steroidal or NSAID treatment limits inflammatory symptoms of many diseases. IVIG is used for CIDP and GBS. Specific immunomodulatory therapies, such as the TNFα antagonists (e.g. <b>etanercept),</b> the B cell depleting agent rituximab, the anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab and the costimulation blocker abatacept {{have been shown to}} be useful in treating RA. [...] Some of these immunotherapies may be associated with increased risk of adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5000|$|Edward Lewis Tobinick is an American {{physician}} {{who is known}} for the study and promotion of <b>etanercept</b> as a potential off-label treatment for neurological disorders. Tobinick trained in internal medicine and dermatology. Prior to his work with <b>etanercept,</b> Tobinick practiced dermatology and developed a laser hair removal technique. Tobinick offered <b>etanercept</b> therapy for back problems (in a treatment known as DiskCure) before promoting its use for other neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, stroke and Parkinson's disease. An article in Science Based Medicine was written critical of his use of perispinal <b>etanercept</b> injections for these conditions. Author Steven Novella was subsequently sued by Tobinick in 2015 for that article. On September 30, 2015 the court found no merit in Tobinick's claim that Novella and SBM were profiting from criticism of perispinal <b>etanercept</b> and found in Novella's favor.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the third}} TNF inhibitor, after {{infliximab}} and <b>etanercept,</b> to be approved in the United States. It was constructed from a fully human monoclonal antibody, while infliximab is a mouse-human chimeric antibody and <b>etanercept</b> is a TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein.|$|E
5000|$|On May 2, 2008, the FDA {{placed a}} black box warning on <b>etanercept</b> {{due to a}} number of serious infections {{associated}} with the drug. [...] Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of <b>Etanercept</b> including reactivation of latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B infections.|$|E
50|$|Tofacitinib is {{a current}} investigational drug in psoriasis. Tofacitinib has {{demonstrated}} its effectiveness for plaque psoriasis in Phase 3 randomized, controlled trials {{in comparison to}} placebo and to <b>etanercept.</b> In particular, a 10 mg twice-daily dose of tofacitinib was shown to be noninferior to <b>etanercept</b> 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly.|$|E
50|$|Biologics for {{immunosuppression}} include Adalimumab, Certolizumab, <b>etanercept,</b> Golimumab, Infliximab, and ustekinumab.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etanercept</b> {{is being}} studied in Alzheimer's disease. Its use is controversial.|$|E
