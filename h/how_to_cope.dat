5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as}} the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{formally}} describe new optimization models for distributed telecommunication networks. Modern distributed networks put more focus on the processing of information and less on the actual transportation of datathan we are traditionally used to in telecommunications. This paper introduces new approaches for modelling decisionsupport at operational, tactical and strategic levels. This is done by first defining the technological framework we areworking within. One of the main advantages of this framework is its inherent flexibility, which enables us to do dynamicplanning and consider uncertainty when decisions are made. When we present the models, emphasis is placed on themodelling discussions around the shift of focus towards processing, the new technological aspects, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> utilizeflexibility <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with uncertainty. ...|$|R
