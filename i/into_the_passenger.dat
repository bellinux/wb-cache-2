25|$|The {{opening of}} the {{railroad}} from Portland to Astoria cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> carriage business of the Telephone, so that on June 2, 1898, Telephone carried only 75 passengers, yet this was the largest number since rail operations had commenced.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Hespeler {{was sold}} for mercantile use to Union Steamships Ltd. of Vancouver. Converted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> ship Chilcotin, Union Steamships paid $25,000 to {{purchase}} the vessel, and another $400,000 to convert ex-Hespeler <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> ship. The converted ship had a gross register tonnage of 1,837 tons. Chilcotin sailed between Alaska and Vancouver until 1957 when Chilcotin was sold to Sunline Inc. She underwent a refit in 1957 and began service as Capri in 1958 operating under a Liberian flag. In 1960, her flag was transferred to Panama and the ship was renamed Stella Maris. Stella Maris was used to give round-trip cruises on the Saint Lawrence Seaway, starting from Montreal.|$|E
25|$|Although the BR {{was not a}} {{passenger}} line, it put a first-class effort <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> service that it provided the public. The locomotives used represented the best available, as did the care given these engines, leading to an enviable record for on-time completion of trips.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} design is one {{similar to a}} ship. <b>The</b> <b>passenger</b> cabin is {{relatively}} low, a few meters below sea level. The cabin is equipped with large windows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>passengers</b> can observe <b>the</b> marine environment that is passed during the voyage.|$|R
5000|$|... === Finnair Plus === Finnair Plus is Finnair's frequent-flyer programme. Passengers {{are awarded}} points {{based on the}} type and class of flight flown. Once enough miles are banked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> account, a {{membership}} tier (Basic, Silver, Gold or Platinum) is awarded. There is a Junior tier exclusively for minors. Silver, Gold, and Platinum members have privileges such as premium check-in desks and priority boarding.|$|R
25|$|Bridoux's {{plane had}} taken off from National just 10 minutes earlier and was {{in contact with the}} tower during a brief test flight. The Eastern Air Lines DC-4 was on {{approach}} from the south when the nimble and much faster P-38 banked and plunged right <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> plane. Both aircraft dropped into the Potomac River.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a cargo hold with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated {{the air in the}} cargo hold. This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. When the door between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> cabin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, open stock had a two-window {{arrangement}} whereby each seating bay had two windows side by side. One window was fixed {{and the other}} was a droplight. Restaurant vehicles such as the B2 first class dining car and the B3 third class dining saloon had Stone's pattern ventilators above the fixed windows but this feature was not included in other open stock. The J5 open thirds were unusual in having four doors per side rather than two. The doors had adjacent quarter lights like those on the side corridor stock and opened directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> saloon rather than the end vestibules which only accommodated the lavatories.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to re-open Primrose Hill station by bringing the short stretch of line between [...] and [...] stations back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> regular <b>passenger</b> service by incorporating it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> London Overground network.|$|R
50|$|On April 19, 2005, Icewood {{was shot}} while at a car wash on 7 Mile Road and Faust {{on the west}} side of Detroit. A gunman pulled up {{alongside}} Icewood's Range Rover and fired 17 rounds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> side killing Icewood. The location he was shot at was nearly a mile away from where he had hosted a nonviolence rally a year prior to his death. After Blade's death, the family of the rapper founded Icewood Entertainment, a record label in honor of the fallen Detroit artist.|$|R
50|$|The London {{suburban}} railway companies, {{such as the}} Underground Electric Railways Company of London and the Metropolitan Railway, {{were also}} excluded. Later legislation under <b>the</b> London <b>Passenger</b> Transport Act 1933 amalgamated these and London area bus and tram operations <b>into</b> <b>the</b> London <b>Passenger</b> Transport Board (see List of transport undertakings transferred to <b>the</b> London <b>Passenger</b> Transport Board).|$|R
25|$|While Ben Gurion Airport {{has been}} a target of Palestinian attacks, the {{adoption}} of strict security precautions has ensured that no aircraft departing from Ben Gurion airport has ever been hijacked. On the other hand, airliners hijacked from other countries have landed at Ben Gurion, contributing to two major incidents in the airport's history. In the first, on 8 May 1972, four Palestinian Black September terrorists hijacked a Sabena flight en route from Vienna and forced it to land at Ben Gurion airport. Sayeret Matkal commandos led by Ehud Barak stormed the plane, killing two of the hijackers and capturing the other two. One passenger was killed. Later that month, on 30 May 1972, in an attack known as the Lod Airport Massacre, 24 {{people were killed and}} 80 injured when three members of the Japanese Red Army sprayed machine gun fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> arrival area. The victims included Aharon Katzir, a prominent protein biophysicist and brother of Israel's 4th president. Those injured included Efraim Katzir and a group of twenty Puerto Rican tourists who had just arrived in Israel. The only terrorist who survived was Kozo Okamoto, who received a life sentence but was set free in a prisoner exchange with the PFLP-GC.|$|E
2500|$|A feature was the [...] "desert only" [...] {{setting on}} the A/C {{thermostat}} control, {{a position that}} typically ran the compressor continually. In humid environments, the evaporator will freeze up from the accumulating condensation if the compressor operates constantly, which will ultimately block airflow. Other temperature settings cycle the compressor to prevent this problem. Freeze up is not a concern in dry environments such as deserts, and this setting provides constantly cooled air flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> compartment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air brake}} can fail {{if one of}} the cocks where the pipes of each {{carriage}} are joined together is accidentally closed. In this case, the brakes on the wagons behind the closed cock will fail to respond to the driver's command. This happened in the 1953 Pennsylvania Railroad train wreck to the Federal Express, a Pennsylvania Railroad train which became runaway while heading into Washington DC's Union Station, causing the train to crash <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> concourse and fall through the floor. [...] Similarly, in the Gare de Lyon train accident, a valve was accidentally closed by the crew, reducing braking power.|$|E
25|$|The London Electric Railway (LER) was an {{underground}} railway company operating three {{lines on the}} London Underground. It was formed in 1910 and existed until 1933, when it was merged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> London <b>Passenger</b> Transport Board.|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, a {{civilian}} <b>passenger</b> in <b>the</b> {{back seat of}} a South African Air Force Pilatus PC-7 MK II ejected from the aircraft while in flight. The civilian accidentally pulled the yellow and black ejection lever while trying to brace himself. <b>The</b> <b>passenger</b> is thought to be a friend of the pilot, Captain Gerhard Lourens of the Silver Falcons. Civilians are not usually allowed in SAAF aircraft equipped with ejector seats. An air force spokesman confirmed that officials had launched an investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> accident. <b>The</b> <b>passenger</b> survived <b>the</b> incident.|$|R
50|$|The SS Aquarama, {{formerly}} known as the SS Marine Star, was a World War II troop ship for the United States Navy. In 1952, it was converted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>passenger</b> ship ever to operate in the Great Lakes.|$|R
2500|$|Metrolink {{commuter}} train 111, {{consisting of a}} [...] EMD F59PH locomotive (SCAX855) pulling three Bombardier BiLevel Coaches, departed Union Station in downtown Los Angeles at 15:35PDT (22:35UTC) heading westbound to Moorpark in suburban Ventura County. Approximately 40 minutes later, it departed the Chatsworth station with 222 people aboard, and had traveled approximately [...] when it collided head-on with an eastbound Union Pacific local freight train. The freight train was led by two SD70ACe locomotives, UP8485 and 8491, weighing [...] each, and was pulling 17 freight cars. The Metrolink locomotive telescoped rearward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> compartment of the first passenger car and caught fire. All three locomotives, the leading Metrolink passenger car and ten freight cars, were derailed, and both lead locomotives and the passenger car fell over.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was duralumin throughout and {{was flat}} sided and bottomed, though its top was slightly rounded and the nose was rounded in both plan and elevation. [...] The pilots' cabin had two seats side-by-side, fitted with dual control and radio equipment by the righthand seat. Behind them {{there was a}} separate cabin with a [...] floor, which could be fitted as a navigator's post or a bar and gave access to an underfloor baggage hold; a port-side external door accessed this space and allowed the pilots to reach their positions via an internal door. A second internal door opened <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> cabin, [...] in plan and [...] high, which had nine rows of seats, {{one on each side}} under its own window. There was a toilet at the rear and behind it a final space containing a library and the main passenger door port-side.|$|E
2500|$|One Friday {{evening in}} March, 1980, Bonin offered a 17-year-old named William Ray Pugh {{a ride home}} as the pair left the house of Everett Fraser. Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill somebody, you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> train rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> station; <b>passengers</b> {{stepped in}} and out; doors slammed, and the guard had already placed the whistle in his mouth, when Captain Crippen, {{breathing}} stentorously, came stumbling blindly on to the platform, and was hustled into a third class carriage.|$|R

60|$|He {{was right}} in this supposition, for {{in a few minutes}} the sound of the whistle was heard in the distance, and soon {{afterward}} the train came thundering in. It slackened its speed as it advanced, and finally stopped opposite to the platform on which Stuyvesant was standing. The baggage-master put the trunks into the baggage car, and the passengers got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> cars, and in a very few minutes the bell rang, and the train began to move on again. Stuyvesant got an excellent seat near a window.|$|E
60|$|We {{began our}} descent, now, {{by the most}} {{remarkable}} road I have ever seen. It wound its corkscrew curves down {{the face of the}} colossal precipice--a narrow way, with always the solid rock wall at one elbow, and perpendicular nothingness at the other. We met an everlasting procession of guides, porters, mules, litters, and tourists climbing up this steep and muddy path, and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a tolerably fat mule. I always took the inside, when I heard or saw the mule coming, and flattened myself against the wall. I preferred the inside, of course, but I should have had to take it anyhow, because the mule prefers the outside. A mule's preference--on a precipice--is a thing to be respected. Well, his choice is always the outside. His life is mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest against his body--therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge of mountain paths, to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or banks on the other. When he goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> business he absurdly clings to his old habit, and keeps one leg of his passenger always dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passenger's heart is in the highlands, so to speak. More than once I saw a mule's hind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the bottom abyss; and I noticed that upon these occasions the rider, whether male or female, looked tolerably unwell.|$|E

An inquiry concluded that the pilot had taken an unnecessary but not wholly unjustifiable risk continuing with two-engines and he should have considered turning for the French coast.|$|R
25|$|In 1920 Salford {{commenced}} motorbus operation, and {{the first}} tram routes were withdrawn in 1932. The last tram went out of service on 31 March 1947.

After passing the tunnel curve, the driver Wang Mingru {{discovered}} that the building near the tunnel exit had collapsed and the light reflections from the rails were missing from the Liziyida bridge. Wang Mingru tried to make an emergency stop, but failed due to steep gradients of the rail before the bridge (at 14‰). As a result, two Diesel locomotives, the baggage car No. 13, the post office van No, 12, and passenger car No. 11 fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river. <b>Passenger</b> car No. 10 and No. 9 crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river bank. <b>Passenger</b> car No. 8 derailed in the tunnel and overturned outside of the tunnel exit.|$|R
