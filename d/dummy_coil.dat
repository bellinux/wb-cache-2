40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an up to date review of the status of the European DIPOle (EDIPO) project whose {{objective}} is to build a new facility to perform both DC and AC tests of large superconductor samples in high magnetic background field (up to similar to 12. 5 T). EDIPO was designed by EFDA, is being built by BNG (Babcock-Noell) and, once completed, it shall be installed near the existing SULTAN facility at the Paul-Scherer-Institute, (CRPP, Villigen, Switzerland). The results presented focus on the manufacture of the <b>dummy</b> <b>coil</b> (which is a 1 : 1 model of one of the EDIPO poles) that was completed in spring 2009. Details are given about the <b>dummy</b> <b>coil</b> winding results, coil reaction heat treatment, impregnation and acceptance tests. Moreover, a progress status is provided about the manufacturing of the other parts of the EDIPO magnet assembly, in particular with respect to the manufacturing of the test-well, AC coils, yoke sheets cutting and assembly, the outer cylinder production and welding (316 LN steel, 35 mm thick) and the coils ends preparation. Some results regarding the R&D studies are also reported about the winding trials carried out to improve the winding accuracy and the numerical simulations made to support coil winding (e. g. conductor spring back) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} mechanical {{model of}} the LHC Nb/sub 3 /Sn quadrupole magnet structure has been designed, built and tested. The structure will support a 90 mm bore, lm long magnet prototype {{as part of the}} US LHC Accelerator Research Program (LARP). The structure utilizes Bladder and Key Technology to control and transfer pre-stress from an outer aluminum shell to an inner coil. Axial aluminum rods take care of pre-stress at the ends-ensuring that the coil is fully constrained along all three axes. The outer aluminum shell and an inner "dummy coil" (aluminum tube) were extensively instrumented with strain gauges. The gauges were used to monitor and map the effectiveness of the stress relation between the loading structure and a "dummy" coil through varying mechanical load conditions-from bladder and key pre- stress at room temperature through cool-down. Test results of the stress distribution in the structure and the in <b>dummy</b> <b>coil</b> is reported and compared with expected results calculated with the structural analysis program ANSYS...|$|E
40|$|The LHC Accelerator Research Program (LARP) {{has been}} engaged in the {{fabrication}} of the 3. 7 m long quadrupole magnet LQS 01 in order to demonstrate that Nb{sub 3 }Sn magnets are a viable option for future LHC Luminosity upgrades. The LQS 01 design, a scale-up of the 1 m long Technology Quadrupole TQS, includes four 3. 4 m long cos(theta) coils contained in a support structure based on four 1 m long aluminum shells pre-tensioned with water-pressurized bladders (shell-type structure). In order to verify assembly procedures and loading operations, the structure was pre-stressed around solid aluminum 'dummy coils' and cooled-down to 77 K. Mechanical behavior and stress variations were monitored with strain gauges mounted on the structure and on the <b>dummy</b> <b>coils.</b> The <b>dummy</b> <b>coils</b> were then replaced with Nb{sub 3 }Sn coils in a second assembly and loading procedure, {{in preparation for the}} cool-down and test.

The structure of the FRESCA 2 magnet {{is designed to provide}} the adequate pre-stress, through the use of keys, bladders, and an Al alloy shrinking cylinder. In order to qualify the assembly and loading procedures, the structure was assembled with Al blocks (<b>dummy</b> <b>coils)</b> that replaced the brittle Nb 3 Sn coils, and then cooled-down to 77 K with liquid nitrogen. The evolution of the mechanical behaviour was monitored via strain gauges located on different components of the structure (shell, rods, yokes and <b>dummy</b> <b>coils).</b> We focus on the expected stresses within the structure after assembly, loading and cool-down. The expected stresses were determined from the 3 D finite element model of the structure. A comparison of the 3 D model stress predictions with the strain gauge data measurements is made. The coherence between the predicted stresses with the experimental gauge measurements will validate the FEM model of the structure. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the scope}} of the High Field Magnets work package of the European FP 7 -EuCARD project, the {{structure}} of the future dipole magnet RMC and FRESCA 2 has been tested at liquid nitrogen temperature replacing the actual Nb 3 Sn-based <b>coils</b> by aluminium <b>dummy</b> <b>coils.</b> Such test aims at measuring during the cooling the evolution of the mechanical stresses and the temperatures via compensated strain gauges and carbon-ceramic sensors placed at various locations on the structure (shell, rods, yokes, <b>dummy</b> <b>coils).</b> These measurements help assess the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the assembly for different applied pre-stresses and validate the finite element simulation of the magnet cooling before including the definitive brittle Nb 3 Sn coils. For this purpose, a specific cool-down/warm-up nitrogen test station has been built up at CERN in order to control the required maximum temperature gradient in the magnet during both cooling and warming. In this paper, we present in detail the test facility, the instrumentation along with the automatic process control system. An analytical approach computing the expected temperature evolution during a thermal cycle is introduced and the temperature measurements related to the magnets cooling down to 77 K and warm up to room temperature are presented...|$|R

40|$|Cooling of {{electrical}} generators is of high importance since an uncontrolled temperature rise {{can lead to}} formation of hot spots which can cause material failure. The efficiency of the machines in converting the mechanical energy to electricity is also affected by temperature, as the electric resistances of the cables and windings are temperature dependent. In order to tackle the problem, air {{is used as a}} cooling fluid, which circulates through the stator and rotor in the generator. Despite the fact that electrical generators have been used for many years, the knowledge about the cooling air flow inside them is still limited. Understanding the air flow inside the generators leads us into better predictions of heat transfer. The knowledge is also important when modifying the stator and rotor shapes, or when innovating new air cooling systems. In this work, a generator model has been specially designed to perform fluid flow measurement. Rapid Prototyping was used to build the model due to its capability to create complex geometries in good accuracy in a short time. Planar two-component Particle Image Velocimetry (2 D- 2 C) was used to measure the fluid velocity inside the stator channels. A section of the stator was built in fully transparent material, to give optimal optical access. The flow path inside the channels was small and thus the optical view was prone to light scattering and reflection from the walls. A marker paint was used to paint the channel walls black, leaving just one transparent wall. A special <b>dummy</b> channel without <b>coils</b> and baffles was manufactured, for use when measuring in the middle channel rows. Stereo PIV (2 D- 3 C) was used to measure the fluid velocity outside the stator body. In total 15 measurement planes were created to capture the overall picture of the flow. This data was then interpolated to get an overview of the flow field around the stator body. The results show that the tangential velocity component dominates the flow outside the stator. The flow outside is highly swirling and three-dimensional. Inside the stator channels the fluid moves radially with large recirculation region (almost half of the stator channel width) behind the coil. Phase-averaged measurements show that the flow structures inside the channels are independent of the rotor pole position...|$|R
