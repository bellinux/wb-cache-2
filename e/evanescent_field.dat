The resulting <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T.

25|$|The <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> {{can also}} be used to trap cold atoms and {{molecules}} near the surface of an optical waveguide or optical nanofiber.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{updated version}} of the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> optical {{tweezers}} makes use of extended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide {{a large number of}} particles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed as Lensless Optical Trapping (“LOT”). The orderly movement of the particles is aided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical potential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are propelled by the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> while being trapped by the linear bright fringes. At the moment, there are scientists working on focused evanescent fields as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an optical}} fiber platform {{which can be}} used to interrogate proximity interactions between free-electron <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> and photonic nanostructures at optical frequencies {{in a manner similar to}} that in which optical <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> are sampled using nanoscale aperture probes in scanning near-field microscopy. Conically profiled optical fiber tips functionalized with nano-gratings are employed to couple electron <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> to light via the Smith-Purcell effect. We demonstrate the interrogation of medium energy (30 - 50 keV) electron fields with a lateral resolution of a few micrometers via the generation and detection of visible/UV radiation in the 700 - 300 nm (free-space) wavelength rang...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a quasi-periodic array of nanoholes {{in a metal}} screen can focus light into subwavelength spots in the far-field without contributions from <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields.</b> The subwavelength spots were observed with a conventional optical microscope and mapped to the far-field. We relate the formation of subwavelength light localizations in the far-field to the phenomenon of super-oscillations. This effect offers {{a new way to}} achieve subwavelength imaging, which differs from approaches based on the recovery of <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most {{ideas for}} {{achieving}} super-resolution in optics {{are based on}} the recovery of <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> which are commonly believed to be the necessary components to form subwavelength field concentrations. For instance, the famous Veslago-Pendry idea for a far-field super-lens is based on the recovery of evanescent information by "amplifying" the fading evanescent components in a slab of a negative-index material. However, <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> may not be needed to achieve subwavelength concentration of light: according to a phenomenon called superoscillations, band-limited functions are able to oscillate arbitrarily faster than the highest Fourier components they contain. We also show that properly designed arrays of nano-holes {{can be used as a}} far-field imaging super-lens thus opening a new way of achieving optical resolution beyond Rayleigh limit, which is different from many existing approaches depending on the recovery of <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{circuit design}} for {{technology}} of near-field interference microwave microscopy using <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> of several active radiators (probes) is suggested and substantiated. The feasibility of providing the spatial overlap of the <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> of two probes representing expanding coaxial conical horns is demonstrated. It is {{shown that the}} structure of the electromagnetic field in the region of overlap can effectively be controlled by changing the phase difference of oscillations arriving at inputs of the probes. This technology can be used for diagnostics of liquid media comprising dielectric inhomogeneities, flaw detection, and hygroscopy...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} atoms {{interacting}} with <b>evanescent</b> light <b>fields,</b> generated at the interface of a dielectric with vacuum, experience artificial gauge potentials. These potentials depend crucially {{on the physical}} parameters which characterize the <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> most notably the refractive index of the dielectric material and the angle of incidence of the laser beam totally internaly reflected at the interface. Gauge fields are derived for various <b>evanescent</b> light <b>fields</b> and for both two-level and three-level systems. The use of such artificial gauge potentials for the manipulation of atoms trapped at the interfaces is pointed out and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{study of}} <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> in an {{isotropic}} backward-wave (BW) (double negative or "left-handed") slab is {{performed with the}} FDTD method.

The excitation of surface modes on the interfaces of the slab, which is the key process responsible for the sub-wavelength focusing, is numerically confirmed and the time-domain field behavior is studied. In particular, a numerical verification of the amplification of evanescent modes by an isotropic BW slab with epsilon=mu=- 1 is provided. Comment: 4 pages, figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} experimentally {{the interference}} in far-field radiation of two contra-propagating <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> using a conventional optical microscope. A laser beam illuminates a glass-air interface under {{total internal reflection}} condition and through the proper setup a double evanescent illumination was produced. The <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> radiate from the surface into the far-field domain due to small surface scatterers. Thus, coherent interference is produced in the far-field region which is correlated with the relative positions of the evanescent illumination sources. Finally, the above-described could {{be considered as a}} device for high accuracy micro-scale measurements as well as a direct visualization method of evanescent phenomena...|$|R
50|$|This is {{accomplished}} through frustrated total internal reflection, {{also known as}} <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> coupling. This occurs when a third medium (in this case the sharpened fiber probe) of refractive index n3 (with n3>n2) is brought near the interface at a distance <λ. At this distance the third medium overlaps the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field,</b> disrupting the total reflection {{of light in the}} first medium and allowing propagation of the wave in the third medium. This process is analogous to quantum tunneling; the photons confined within the first medium are able to tunnel through the second medium (where they cannot exist) into the third medium. In PSTM, the tunneled photons are conducted through the fiber probe into a detector where a detailed image of the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> can then be reconstructed. The degree of coupling between the probe and surface is highly distance dependent, as the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> is an exponentially decaying function of distance from the interface. Hence, the degree of coupling is used to measure the tip to surface distance in order to obtain topographical information about the sample placed on the surface.|$|E
50|$|Under total {{internal}} reflection, {{although no}} energy is propagated {{through the second}} medium, a non-zero electric field is still present in the second medium near the interface. This field exponentially decays with increasing distance from the interface and {{is known as the}} <b>evanescent</b> <b>field.</b> Figure 1 shows the optical component of the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> is modulated by the presence of a dielectric sample placed on the interface (the surface of the prism), hence the field contains detailed optical information about the sample surface. Although this image is lost in the diffraction limited far field, a detailed optical image may be constructed by probing the near field region (at a distance <λ) and detecting sample induced modulation of the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{the decay}} {{constant}} is typically determined through empirical methods, detailed mathematical models of probe - sample coupling interactions {{that account for}} probe tip geometry and sample distance have been published by Goumri-Said et al. In many cases the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> is primarily modulated by sample surface topography, hence the detected optical signal {{can be interpreted as}} the topography of the sample. However, the refractive index and absorption properties of the sample can cause further changes to the detected <b>evanescent</b> <b>field,</b> making it necessary to separate optical data from topographical data. This is often accomplished by coupling PSTM to other techniques such as AFM (see below). Theoretical models have also been developed by Reddick to account for modulation of the <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> by secondary effects such as scattering and absorbance at the sample surface.|$|E
40|$|Photon-induced {{near-field}} {{electron microscopy}} (PINEM) {{is a technique}} to produce and then image <b>evanescent</b> electromagnetic <b>fields</b> on the surfaces of nanostructures. Most previous applications of PINEM have imaged surface plasmon-polariton waves on conducting nanomaterials. Here, the application of PINEM on whole human cancer cells and membrane vesicles isolated from them is reported. We show that photons induce time-, orientation-, and polarization-dependent <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> on the surfaces of A 431 cancer cells and isolated membrane vesicles. Furthermore, {{the addition of a}} ligand to the major surface receptor on these cells and vesicles (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFR) reduces the intensity of these fields in both preparations. In the absence of plasmon waves in biological samples, we propose these <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> reflect the changes of EGFR kinase domain polarization upon ligand binding...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} dual-color total-internal-reflection (TIR) -based chip that can {{generate}} two overlapping <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> with different wavelengths for simultaneous imaging of {{two types of}} fluorophores. We derived a general relationship among {{the dimensions of the}} components of the chip to guarantee the overlap of two <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields.</b> Optical simulation results also confirm the generation and overlap of two <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields.</b> Using Si bulk micromachining and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) casting, our fabrication method integrates all miniaturized optical components into one monolithic PDMS chip. Thus, assembly is unnecessary, and misalignment is avoided. Our PDMS chip can be employed with various sample delivery platforms, such as glass slide, flow cell, microchannel, etc. We first demonstrated the capability of the chip by imaging TIR fluorescent spots of a mixture of two fluorophores, namely, fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine. We then employed the chip to observe the Brownian motion of a mixture of nile-red and dragon-green 500 -nm microbeads. Our chip could potentially be integrated into a micro-total analysis system for highly sensitive and high-resolution dual-fluorescence imaging applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Evanescent</b> optical <b>fields</b> {{existing}} {{in close proximity}} to illuminated objects contain detailed information on length scales smaller than the wavelength. They do not propagate to external observers but can be accessed using negative-index lenses, or coupled to propagating waves via subwavelength apertures, to achieve imaging resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Free electrons moving in vacuum also carry imperceptible localized, visible-frequency <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields,</b> and we demonstrate experimentally here that these fields can be amplified by a plasmonic film as electrons fly over the surface, offering new avenues toward the exploitation of electron <b>evanescent</b> <b>fields</b> for enhanced microscopy and nanoscale light generation. Amplifiers are fabricated at the tips of tapered optical fiber probes decorated with nanogratings to resonantly scatter electron fields to UV/vis light.

Even when there in fact is an electromagnetic wave produced (e.g., by a transmitting antenna) one can still identify as an <b>evanescent</b> <b>field</b> the component of the electric or magnetic field that cannot be attributed to the propagating wave observed at a distance of many wavelengths (such as the far field of a transmitting antenna).|$|E

The highly concerned imaging and optical manipulation which is required in the nanometric range could be achieved in an efficient manner, by using optical near-fields.
