25|$|On 25 January 2006, the Palestinians held general {{elections}} for the Palestinian Legislative Council. The Islamist group Hamas won with an unexpected majority of 74 seats, compared to 45 seats for Fatah and 13 for other parties and independents. <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> officially declared as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union and its gaining control over the Palestinian Authority (such as by forming the government) would jeopardize international funds to the PA, by laws forbidding sponsoring of terrorist group.|$|E
25|$|On {{other aspects}} of the {{conflict}} between Palestinians and Israel, the Harper government followed a policy based on realism, in contrast to the idealism of previous governments. In 2006, the Conservatives responded to the successes of the Hamas terror group in 2006 legislative elections by reducing funds. (<b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> categorized as a terrorist organization by Canadian authorities.) Foreign Minister MacKay did meet with Palestinians in the West Bank but not with any member of Hamas, as Canadian diplomats are not allowed to negotiated with terrorist group.|$|E

2500|$|The {{attacks of}} Hamas gunmen against Fatah {{security}} {{forces in the}} Gaza Strip resulted in a reaction of Fatah gunmen against Hamas institutions in the West Bank. [...] Although <b>Hamas's</b> numbers <b>were</b> greater in the Gaza Strip, Fatah forces were greater in the West Bank.|$|R
2500|$|Several days later, Hamas {{retracted}} its apology, {{stating that}} its statement had been incorrectly interpreted. According to Gaza analyst Naji Sharrab, <b>Hamas's</b> retraction <b>was</b> likely {{a result of}} public pressure on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. [...] "They are addressing two different audiences," [...] Sharrab said of Hamas.|$|R
25|$|Not {{long after}} the U.S. re-established public {{security}} assistance to the PA, Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton was appointed {{to take over the}} USSC mission, and in January 2006, PA parliamentary elections gave Hamas a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), which had previously been dominated by the Fatah party. Because <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> considered by the U.S. government to be a Foreign Terrorist Organization, it is illegal for U.S. funds to be used to support them even {{as part of a broader}} organization like the PA. Though the elections were originally supported by the U.S. government, the U.S. encouraged President Abbas to retain control over the government by consolidating his power. The U.S. contributed to this by transferring money for security assistance directly to Abbas and Fatah rather than through the PA. The Presidential Guard, the security forces for protecting President Abbas, were the primary recipients of the U.S. support.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Palestinian {{legislative}} elections Hamas won {{a majority}} in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority insisting that the Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs that Israel has no right to exist and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must be wiped out. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E

5000|$|It is more {{difficult}} to determine whether Palestinian suicide bombings have proved to be a successful tactic. Hamas [...] "came to prominence" [...] after the first intifada as [...] "the main Palestinian opponent of the Oslo Accords" [...] ("the US-sponsored peace process that oversaw the gradual and partial removal of Israel's occupation in return for Palestinian guarantees to protect Israeli security") according to the BBC.The accords were sidetracked after the election in 1996 of right wing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas's suicide bombings of Israeli targets (from 1994-1997 there were 14 suicide attacks killing 159—not all of which were attributed to Hamas) [...] "were widely" [...] credited for the popularity among Israelis of the hardline Netanyahuof, [...] who like <b>HAMAS</b> <b>was</b> a staunch opponent of the Oslo accords, but an even stauncher enemy of HAMAS).|$|R
5000|$|Speaking at the IDC's Herzliya Conference in Israel in January 2008, Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen {{criticized the}} actions of the Human Rights Council actions against Israel. [...] "At the United Nations, censuring Israel has become {{something}} of a habit, while <b>Hamas's</b> terror <b>is</b> referred to in coded language or not at all. The Netherlands believes the record should be set straight, both in New York and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva", Verhagen said.|$|R
25|$|In October 2010, Hamas {{officials}} {{claimed to}} have thwarted an attempt to locate Shalit. A collaborator in <b>Hamas's</b> military wing <b>was</b> caught planting bugs in two-way radios.

2500|$|<b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> in {{communication}} with members of Sinai Bedouin groups and {{is thought to be}} capable of supplying them with rockets. [...] Egypt’s imperfect control over Sinai Bedouin makes Bedouin-supported use of the Sinai as a base for launching rocket attacks possible. [...] According to The Economist, Hamas has already sent [...] "a group from Gaza" [...] to launch rocket attacks form Sinai at Eilat. According to Ronen Bergman, security affairs commentator for Yedioth Ahronoth: [...] "The farther from Cairo, the weaker the central authority is. They are having great difficulties with the Bedouin. If <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> able to deepen its cooperation with the Bedouin, and create bases in Sinai for recruitment, we're talking about a new ballgame." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics argue}} that America's policy of advocating {{democracy}} may be ineffective and even counterproductive. Zbigniew Brzezinski declared that [...] "he coming to power of <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> a very good example of excessive pressure for democratization" [...] and argued that George W. Bush's attempts to use democracy as an instrument against terrorism were risky and dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|In a New York Times {{editorial}} in June 2010, he wrote: “Hamas {{is not just}} a terrorist organization. <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> an idea, a desperate and fanatical idea that grew out of the desolation and frustration of many Palestinians.

Israel has to sign a peace agreement with President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah government in the West Bank.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Terrorists are {{predisposed}} to attribute success to their technique whenever plausible (62-64). Pape claims that [...] "recent suicide terrorist campaigns ... {{are associated with}} gains for the terrorists' political causes about half the time" [...] (64-65). <b>Hamas's</b> success <b>is</b> difficult to evaluate, but Hamas spokespersons express belief in their own success (65-73). Terrorists learn from each other; {{the spread of the}} method is therefore neither irrational nor surprising (73-75).

2500|$|According to leaked American cables, Syrian President Bashar al Assad {{allegedly}} called Hamas an [...] "uninvited guest" [...] {{and said}} [...] "If {{you want me}} to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties. <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence", comparing Hamas to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood which was crushed by his father Hafez al Assad.

2500|$|On 18 December 2013, Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat {{ordered the}} {{referral}} of Morsi to criminal court for charges of espionage {{in a statement}} under the title [...] "The Biggest Case of Espionage in the History of Egypt".

2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E
50|$|The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) {{has stated}} that it is {{prepared}} to recognize the state of Israel {{on the basis of}} the removal of settlements and retreat from Palestinian territory back to the 1967 borders.

25|$|Rantisi <b>was</b> <b>Hamas's</b> {{political}} leader and spokesman in the Gaza Strip following the Israeli killing of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in March 2004.

25|$|The stated {{aim of the}} Israeli {{operation}} was to stop rocket fire from Gaza into Israel, which increased after an Israeli crackdown on Hamas in the West Bank was launched following the 12 June kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by two Hamas members. Conversely, <b>Hamas's</b> goal <b>was</b> to bring international pressure to bear to lift Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, end Israel's offensive, obtain a third party to monitor and guarantee compliance with a ceasefire, release Palestinian prisoners and overcome its political isolation. According to the BBC, in response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, Israel launched air raids on Gaza.|$|R
2500|$|He noted {{further that}} Hamas had removed {{significant}} sections of their constitution {{which called for}} Israel's destruction, though the basic idea remains the same: Israel cannot be allowed to remain as a Jewish state in the Middle East. [...] "In the past," [...] he said, [...] "it was said that we don't understand politics, only force, but we are a broad, well-grounded movement that is active {{in all areas of}} life. Now we are proving that we also understand politics better than the others." [...] Abu Tir's final thought on Israeli negotiation was to leave it to the new parliament [...] "as with every matter, to be discussed and decided upon in a rational manner". After Hamas's landslide victory in January 2006 many countries decided to back Israel's decision to cut foreign aid to The Palestinian Authority. After being asked what Hamas planned to do in light of this Abu Tir stated that Hamas [...] "would not go to foreign donors on [...] bended knee". In a 6 February 2006 open letter to Newsweek International Tir stated that [...] "The European Union and America should cooperate with us. We have ways of creating understanding among our people. We are facilitators, helpers, aides. The presence of <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> a guarantee of safety and stability in the region. Any money that is given to us will be channelled to the correct path." [...] As he tried to address Western fears that donations would go to buy arms Tir told the West to [...] "... be afraid...we can always find arms on the black market. It is obvious that we have built our military infrastructure in that way. Our weapons are the only guarantee of our existence. If a proper Palestinian state were established, then all the militias would melt inside the Palestinian Army." [...] Summing up his letter Tir attempted to ease western anxiety about Hamas by stating that [...] "The West has nothing to fear from Hamas. We're not going to force people to do anything. We will not impose Sharia. <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> contained. Hamas deals only with the Israeli occupation. We are not Al Qaeda." ...|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Richard Kemp, former {{commander}} of British forces in Afghanistan, addressed the UNHRC in October 2009, speaking {{on behalf of}} UN Watch. He said that <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> [...] "adept at staging and distorting incidents" [...] and asserted that during the conflict the Israel Defense Forces [...] "did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare" [...] and that Palestinian civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas' way of fighting, which involved using human shields as a matter of policy, and deliberate attempts to sacrifice their own civilians. He added that Israel took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas, aborted potentially effective missions in order to prevent civilian casualties, and took [...] "unthinkable" [...] risks by allowing huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the fighting. Goldstone stated that Kemp was not interviewed [...] "because the report did not deal with the issues he raised regarding the problems of conducting military operations in civilian areas".|$|E
2500|$|Considered one of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} conservative Norwegian politicians in his time, he has in later years shifted his position in many areas. He has taken issue with the [...] "culture of greed", [...] "tax paradises', the environment [...] and has been particularly harsh in his condemnation of Israel's policies toward Palestinians, claiming that the occupation of and settlement on Palestinian land (outside the 1967 borders) is unlawful. Though widely respected for his activism and argumentative style, he has also received criticism from several commentators, for example for accusing the country of [...] "ethnic cleansing," [...] and for saying it is [...] "creating terror" [...] by cultivating extremism [...] "as if in a greenhouse in the Palestinian areas". [...] One of the critics, his long-time friend and party colleague Jo Benkow, commented that [...] "On this topic, Willoch must be the most partisan public person in this country.". Willoch has also stated that, though [...] "there are strong reasons to warn against the new antisemitism, it will not strengthen Israel's cause to accuse critics of Israeli politics of antisemitism". He also claims that Israel indirectly contributes to New antisemitism stating that [...] "It would be naïve to ignore that Israel's politics towards the Palestinians has become a new source of negative attitudes." [...] In May 2006, Willoch invited Atef Adwan, an official in Hamas to a private luncheon at Det Norske Selskab, commenting that [...] "A dialogue with <b>Hamas</b> <b>is</b> very useful." [...] an action that prompted criticism by fellow Conservative party member and former foreign minister Jan Petersen.|$|E
