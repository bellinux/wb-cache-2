50|$|Maschinenfabrik Weidemann KG {{was founded}} in 1960 in Diemelsee-Flechtdorf (Hesse, Germany). From 1960 to 1972, the company focused on {{production}} of farmyard equipment and dung removal equipment. In 1972, Weidemann invented the Hoftrac <b>farm</b> <b>crane.</b> This small, articulated machine was specifically designed for narrow and low farmyard buildings.|$|E

Argos opened a regional warehouse on Pipps Hill Industrial Estate in the 1990s. In 2015, an Amazon delivery base was opened in Christopher Martin Road.|$|R
5000|$|Billy Martin, {{baseball}} legend, {{second baseman}} and New York Yankees manager; operated and {{lived on a}} <b>farm</b> in Port <b>Crane</b> after retiring. It was on that road where his fatal car accident occurred on Christmas Day in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Crane Island {{was first}} settled in 1879 by Walter P. Cadwell, {{a member of}} a pioneer family living near Pole Pass (a passage between the eastern side of Crane Island and Orcas Island). Cadwell {{operated}} a fruit and vegetable <b>farm</b> on <b>Crane</b> Island. In 1906 Cadwell sold the island to John C. Hammond of Seattle. Other activities conducted on Crane Island in the past have included a lime quarry {{on the west side of}} the island, a pheasantry business, sheep ranching and logging activities until 1959.

25|$|Section 2 – <b>Cranes</b> <b>Farm</b> Road. Included dualling of the {{existing}} carriageway of which was already there (1500m approx.) and enhancing and upgrading junctions – {{with the creation of}} a dedicated left turn lane at the roundabout at Eastmayne to help ease traffic flows during busy hours at the junction.|$|R
25|$|Martin {{was working}} as a special {{consultant}} to George Steinbrenner when he was killed in a low speed, single vehicle collision during an ice storm {{at the end of the}} driveway to his <b>farm</b> in Port <b>Crane,</b> north of Binghamton, New York, on Christmas Day 1989. He was pronounced dead at a hospital in Johnson City, New York, where efforts to revive him were unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|Marceline was {{probably}} chosen for being accessible from Chicago, for its rural setting, and because {{his younger brother}} Robert owned a 440 acre farm west of the city. The <b>Crane</b> <b>Farm</b> had orchards of apples, peaches, and plums, and fields of grain. The farm animals included pigs, chickens, horses, and cows. The Disneys had a telephone connection by 1907. Herbert and Raymond Disney never liked life on the farm. They moved out around the fall of 1908, heading back to Chicago. They found work as clerks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920 Oliver Crane, Richard Crane's son, {{developed}} the heirloom Crane Melon. He crossed {{several species of}} melons including a Japanese melon, a Persian melon, an ambrosia melon, and a white melon. The Crane Melon is not found at grocery stores, it is <b>farmed</b> in the <b>Crane</b> Melon Barn, it is vine ripened, and does not have shelf life to be shipped. “The Crane melon’s flavor is due to its terroir. The melon was developed to be grown...in a particular soil, within a specific climate zone, farmed in a certain style.” ...|$|R
50|$|With {{scale of}} the models {{becoming}} variable in the Super Series, Siku also released the M87 series in 2003. All of the models are faithfully reproduced in 1:87, though this line is independent of the Wiking line. The range of models is limited but consists of semi-trailers, <b>cranes,</b> <b>farm</b> tractors, and cars. The trucks, <b>cranes,</b> and <b>farm</b> tractors {{are very similar to}} those made in smaller size in the Super Series (i.e., those that have their roots in the Club Series). The difference is that the M87 series vehicles are more detailed and are packaged in small window boxes versus blister card.|$|R
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of Basileiades machine works was {{connected with the}} rapid development of Piraeus as an industrial and commercial center in Greece, replacing Ermoupolis in Syros. Except for shipbuilding (with its first all-metal steamship built in 1892), Basileiades produced an extensive range of metal and mechanical products, including steam engines, boilers, pumps, <b>cranes,</b> <b>farm</b> equipment, hydraulic devices, metal bridges, railroad material etc., while it was undertaking installation of entire factories and customized machinery building. It was also exporting some of its products, while in its advertisements it called itself [...] "the most significant machine builder in Greece and the East".|$|R
50|$|Forbes {{secretly}} obtains {{a sample}} from the Crane's well and has it analysed {{at a nearby}} lab. The water is found to contain an strange, unknown element which is altering its metabolic properties. Carl Willis, a TVA representative who is surveying the local area for the planned reservoir, enters the Cranes' house looking {{for a glass of}} water. Helping himself from the kitchen faucet, he has just started drinking when he is attacked and nearly killed by Frances, who has gone insane and is horribly mutating. Worried that Forbes is going to alert the authorities, Davidson and Esther arrive at the <b>Crane</b> <b>farm</b> looking for the doctor but are attacked by infected dogs who have turned feral. Esther is mauled to death and Davidson hides himself in the cellar only to be killed by Frances who had been locked in there by Nathan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first record}} of {{continuous}} European {{settlement of the}} Montcalm area is the 1840 census of Mercer County {{in what was then}} the state of Virginia. [...] A 700-acre <b>farm,</b> located where <b>Crane</b> Creek joins the Bluestone, was the property of George Bailey. He, his wife, and six children lived on the farm that included a farmhouse, likely located on the lower slopes of Tabernacle Mountain, an orchard and in what would be today’s Main Street, and a field of timothy grass. About one hundred acres of corn field could be found {{at the top of a}} mountain on the “the opposite side of the river” (either Methodist Church Hill or Browning Lambert Mountain). The farm also featured a small dam on the Crane Creek that powered a corn grist mill, the only one in the area and the farm’s most valuable property.|$|R
40|$|Aim. The task of {{reducing}} the deflection and increase the rigidity of single-span beams are made. In the article the calculation algorithm for truss crane girders is determined. Methods. To identify the internal effort required for the selection of cross section elements the design uses the Green's function. Results. It {{was found that the}} simplest truss system reduces deflection and increases the strength of design. The upper crossbar is subjected not only to bending and shear and compression work due to tightening tension. Preliminary determination of the geometrical characteristics of the <b>crane</b> <b>farms</b> elements are offered to make a comparison with previous similar configuration of his farms, using a simple approximate calculation methods. Conclusion. The method of sequential movements (incrementally) the two bridge cranes {{along the length of the}} upper crossbar truss beams is suggested. We give the corresponding formulas and conditions of safety. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The jack-up {{wind turbine}} {{installation}} vessel {{is a special}} kind of vessel for building the offshore wind power <b>farm.</b> The main <b>crane</b> pedestal, which is the supporting structure of the crane on the main deck of the vessel, is always under high level loads when the ship is in operation condition. In this paper, the structural strength analysis of main crane pedestal of the jack-up wind turbine installation vessel was presented. The direct calculated method was used to evaluate the strength of the main crane pedestal. The FE model of main crane pedestal was established with refined mesh, and the adjoining hull structure was also modeled to provide accurate boundary condition. Considering the permanent loads, variable loads (crane loads) and wind loads on the pedestal, the load combinations were defined for the ultimate limit state for every 45 degree. The deformation and stress of the pedestal and the hull structures were calculated and checked. The results showed that all stress results were within the maximum allowable stresses. The critical areas are often located at the link region of hull and pedestal...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Henrik Stiesdal {{designed}} (along with Karl Erik Jørgensen) one of {{the first}} wind turbines representing the so-called [...] "Danish concept". [...] In 1979, his design was licensed to Vestas A/S, a Danish manufacturer of <b>farm</b> wagons, truck <b>cranes</b> and ship coolers. Stiesdal’s design formed the basis of this company's rise to become {{one of the}} leading wind turbine manufacturers. After first working for Vestas as a consultant, he joined the company in 1983 as project manager. In 1987, Stiesdal joined the Danish wind turbine manufacturer Bonus Energy A/S as a development specialist. In 1988, he became a technical manager and in 2000 he took the role of Chief Technology Officer. In 2004, Bonus Energy A/S was acquired by the German technology company Siemens. Stiesdal became the Chief Technology Officer of Siemens Wind Power and remained in this position undtil the end of 2014, when he retired. According to rough calculations by Stiesdal, one person's work for a year at a wind turbine manufacturer or subcontractor compensates for 650 western peoples' CO2 emissions for that year. In 2016, he became affiliate professor at DTU Wind, the Technical University of Denmark´s Department of Wind Energy.|$|R
