5|$|A {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} recognition of Peleinae and Patholopinae, comprising the genera Pelea and Pantholops respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> Pelea in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of Pelea, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. Pantholops, earlier classified in the Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and morphological analysis supports the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E

5|$|A related {{issue is}} the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> {{pregnant}} women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E
