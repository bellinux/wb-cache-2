50|$|Charles (Boss) Kettering, vice {{president}} of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley, Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F or R11), chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2 or R22), trichlorotrifluoroethane (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and <b>dichlorotetrafluoroethane</b> (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was {{a joint venture between}} DuPont and General Motors.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{simulation of}} an actual steam-water geothermal well based on field data obtained in New Zealand is carried out in a two-phase flow facility using <b>dichlorotetrafluoroethane,</b> known commercially as refrigerant 114. The simulation of steam-water flow is accomplished by a similarity theory {{which is achieved by}} using appropriate dimensionless numbers; namely, the Mach, Froude, and Reynolds numbers at the flashing front. The theory is used to scale the flow properties from that of water to that of refrigerant 114 in the two-phase region, and permits the prediction of steam-water characteristics in a flowing well, under much reduced pressure and temperature levels. Two experimental series were conducted to confront the similarity theory with actual measurements from a flowing well with significant noncondensable gases. Experimental results using refrigerant 114 indicate that the pressure distribution along the pipe can be predicted accurately in the two-phase region of a geothermal well...|$|E
40|$|A {{directional}} spectrometer {{that uses}} a superheated emulsion of <b>dichlorotetrafluoroethane</b> at the centre of a 30 cm diameter moderating-sphere of nylon- 6. The system has a telescope-design wherein the detector views a narrow solid angle of about 1 / 6 steradians. The hydrogenous sphere effectively attenuates laterally incident neutrons, thus providing a strong angular dependence of the response. The central detector is sequentially operated at seven temperatures between 25 °C and 55 °C in order to generate a matrix of nested response functions suitable for few-channel spectrometry. The response matrix of the system has been determined by calibrations with monoenergetic neutrons and by Monte Carlo neutron transport calculations. The double-differential unfolding method developed for this system applies the principle of maximum entropy and allows for the rigorous use of all a priori information. The spectrometer is intended {{for use in the}} mixed neutron/photon fields encountered in the nuclear power industry, being suitable for spatially distributed radiation sources with maximum neutron energies up to 10 MeV...|$|E
40|$|An accelerator-driven {{thermal neutron}} {{facility}} for boron neutron capture therapy of skin melanoma is currently under construction at the Legnaro National Laboratories, Italy. The installation {{relies on the}} production of neutrons from a thick beryllium target bombarded with 5 MeV protons. A complete set of double differential data, i. e. angle- and energy-differential neutron spectra produced by the beryllium target, {{is necessary for the}} Monte Carlo-based design of the installation. For this purpose, double differential fluence measurements are currently performed with the "BINS" neutron spectrometer using 5 MeV protons at the "CN" Van de Graaf accelerator. This spectrometer uses a superheated emulsion of <b>dichlorotetrafluoroethane</b> which is sequentially operated at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55 °C and thus provides a series of seven sharp thresholds covering the 0. 1 - 10 MeV neutron energy interval. Deconvolution of the data is performed with the code "MAXED", which is based on the maximum entropy principle. The analysis of our first neutron spectrometry measurements at angles of 0 °, 40 °, 80 ° and 120 ° supports the viability of the BINS spectrometry method for the generation of the required double differential data. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a fluid undergoing a phase change from liquid to vapor while flowing through a duct is of interest to engineers in many practical situations. For the case of interest to us, geothermal hot water flowing through various channels (well bores, surface pipes, equipment, etc.) may reach its flash point and choke point under appropriate conditions. The proper design of energy conversion systems depends {{on the ability of}} the engineer to predict this behavior with an acceptable degree of accuracy. The present study was in part motivated by the task of designing the blow-down, two-phase fluid flow test facility at Brown University. In that facility, a refrigerant (<b>dichlorotetrafluoroethane</b> or R- 114) is boosted to a selected stagnation state and allowed to flow through a nozzle orifice into a long straight tube. The operation relies on the fluid being choked at the inlet section, and under certain circumstances, at the downstream section as well. A simple schematic of the test section is shown. This paper treats the problem generically and analytically, making use of the basic laws of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Specific calculations have been performed using R- 114 as the flowing medium. They attempt to identify and describe all possible flow conditions in and downstream of the nozzle for all possible stagnation conditions...|$|E
