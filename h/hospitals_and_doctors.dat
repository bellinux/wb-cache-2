He became a hypochondriac, developing a fear of <b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> <b>doctors.</b> Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.|$|E

25|$|In {{some of the}} camps, food rations were {{scarce and}} medical care was inadequate. In 1945 alone, more than 13,000 people died, among them some 7,000 {{children}} under the age of five. The situation was worst in the months right before and after the capitulation, when Danish <b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> were reluctant to treat German refugees. The reason for this was not only anti-German resentment, but also lack of resources, the time needed to rebuild administrative structures, and the fear of epidemic diseases which were highly prevalent among the refugees. Instead, Danish authorities established a camp-internal medical system with German medical personnel, which took some time to work adequately. In the camps, there was school education for children up to the upper secondary level, work duty for adults, study circles, theatre, music and self-issued German newspapers. After initial inadequacy, food rations became more sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Richardson (1998) {{examines}} the social, political, economic, class, and professional factors {{that contributed to}} ideological and practical differences between leaders of the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses (AAGN), established in 1916, and the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), founded in 1915, regarding the promotion and acceptance of midwifery as a recognized subspecialty of registered nurses. Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, {{the leaders of the}} UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. Irene Parlby, the UFWA's first president, lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided <b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> <b>doctors,</b> and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.|$|E

500|$|Six {{placed a}} Japanese male {{at the front}} of the {{centipede}} for two reasons: first to create a language barrier between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film. Six stated in the director's commentary for The Human Centipede that he has a personal fear of <b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> <b>doctors,</b> so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his [...] "own nightmare." ...|$|E

2500|$|Individuals {{with private}} or {{government}} insurance {{are limited to}} medical facilities which accept the particular type of medical insurance they carry. Visits to facilities outside the insurance program's [...] "network" [...] are usually either not covered or the patient must bear more of the cost. Hospitals negotiate with insurance programs to set reimbursement rates; some rates for government insurance programs are set by law. The sum paid to a doctor for a service rendered to an insured patient is generally less than that paid [...] "out of pocket" [...] by an uninsured patient. In return for this discount, the insurance company includes the doctor {{as part of their}} [...] "network", which means more patients are eligible for lowest-cost treatment there. The negotiated rate may not cover the cost of the service, but providers (<b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> <b>doctors)</b> can refuse to accept a given type of insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid. Low reimbursement rates have generated complaints from providers, and some patients with government insurance have difficulty finding nearby providers for certain types of medical services.|$|E

40|$|For generations, <b>hospital</b> administrators <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> have closely guarded {{information}} about <b>hospital</b> outcomes <b>and</b> physician effectiveness, if they measured them at all.
