The essence of this dissertation {{is investigating the}} balance between the aforementioned objectives; {{taking advantage of the}} noise immunity property of external sensors, and designing novel integrated tracking architectures to advance the performance of a GPS receiver under strong interference conditions. Speci cally, the problem of interest is resolving the interference due to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> on the GPS receiver used in aviation navigation. Using GPS for landing aircraft in equatorial regions is more di cult than in other regions because <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> is prevalent. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> causes amplitude fades of 20 dB or more, and an increase in the phase jitter. This research evaluates techniques to enhance a GPS receiver's ability to overcome <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation.</b> To validate the designed GPS receiver, a GPS channel model for aircraft landing in equatorial regions is built based on the use of a high delity GPS constellation simulator, a clock emulator, and real GPS data from the equator that contains an abundance of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{particular}} {{locations where}} the Swarm GPS receivers show a degraded performance {{suggest that the}} receivers are affected by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation.</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> occurs when electromagnetic signals propagate through an irregular ionosphere. GPS signals are vulnerable to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> which can degrade or interrupt GPS receiver operations (Kintner et al. 2007). This is particularly true for semi-codeless tracking of the GPS P(Y)-code signal due to the losses implied by this tracking technique (Woo 2000). The tracking performance of a GPS receiver under <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> conditions depends {{not only on the}} magnitude of the observed scintillation activity, but also on the receiver tracking capabilities (Skone et al. 2001). Differences in receiver performance are due to many factors, such as antenna gain patterns, internal processing algorithms and tracking loop bandwidths (Skone et al. 2001). For receivers in low-Earth orbit (LEO), an adverse impact of scintillation in polar regions and two belts around 15 ° north and south of the geomagnetic equator has, for example, been reported in van den IJssel et al. (2011) and Kramer and Goodman (2005).|$|R
30|$|Although the {{modified}} tracking loops significantly improve the Swarm GPS performance over areas affected by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> noticeably larger errors at these locations remain present in Figs.  9 and 12.

It is therefore recommended to widen the L 2 carrier loop bandwidth by e.g. another 50  %, to further improve the robustness of the Swarm GPS receivers. By implementing this update first on Swarm-C, it is again possible {{to assess the impact}} using a comparison with Swarm-A.

In the following section, it is assessed whether the implemented tracking loop modifications improve the robustness of GPS tracking performance and the impact on both the reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbit quality is shown. Finally, the paper concludes with a short summary of the results and gives recommendations for further improvements.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the Swarm GPS {{receivers}} {{are affected}} by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> which slightly degrades their performance when flying close to the geomagnetic poles and the geomagnetic equator.

To improve the robustness of the Swarm GPS receivers for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> the receiver settings have been modified by widening the bandwidths of the tracking loops. With the updated tracking loops, the amount of collected GPS observations increases by about 1.3  % and occasional tracking losses due to severe equatorial <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> are greatly reduced. The wider bandwidths of the carrier loops also significantly reduce the large carrier phase residuals close to the geomagnetic poles, and no degradation is visible for GPS observations at midlatitudes. Both the reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbits show lower SLR residuals, which indicates that the updated tracking loops also improve the POD performance for both orbit types.|$|R

The disturbances that the ionosphere can induce on the electromagnetic signals emitted by the Global Navigation Satellite System constellations are due to the presence of electron density anomalies in the ionosphere, which are particularly frequent at high latitudes, where the upper atmosphere is highly sensitive to perturbations coming from outer space. With the development of present and future low-frequency space-borne microwave missions (e. g., Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [SMOS], Aquarius, and Soil Moisture Active Passive missions), there is an increasing need to estimate the effects of the ionosphere on the propagation of electromagnetic waves that affects satellite measurements.

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} {{has always}} been a major limitation for GNSS positioning applications. Free electrons in the ionosphere perturb the propagation of GNSS radio signals involving both refraction and diffraction effects. In particular, small-scale ionospheric irregularities generated by different physical processes may cause scattering effects on GNSS signals, producing rapid fluctuations of the signal phase and amplitude as a result. Such scintillations of GNSS signals are responsible for critical consequences regarding applications, such as precise positioning, due to many resulting effects: cycle slips, signal power fading, receiver loss of lock and poor resulting satellite geometry. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Scintillation</b> Monitoring Receivers collect high-rate GNSS data. Specific scintillation parameters, such as the well-known S 4 and Phi 60 indices, are built on high-rate measurements performed on GNSS signals and provide additional information to characterize the intensity of such an event occurring at a specific geographic location at a given time. Spatial Statistics belong to the field of Spatial Analysis, Geography and GIS (Geographic Information System). This discipline allows to perform analyses of data which are localised in space. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Scintillation</b> observations achieved by ISMR stations can be characterized by a set of attributes (S 4, Phi 60, Rate of TEC, etc.) including also the geographic location of their respective Ionospheric Pierce Point (IPP). By combining the simultaneous Multi-GNSS ISMR measurements from a network of ISMR stations, we can obtain a spatially denser data set, able to support spatial statistics tests. The idea of our research is to provide a spatio-temporal analysis of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> events over Equatorial regions by applying spatial statistics on ISMR Multi-GNSS measurements.

Next, we introduce a novel method based on nonparametric local regression with bias Corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICC). All methods are then applied to data from the Norwegian Regional <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Scintillation</b> Network (NRISN), which is shown {{to be dominated by}} phase scintillation and not amplitude scintillation. We find that all methods provide highly correlated results, demonstrating the validity of the new approach to this problem. All methods are shown to be very sensitive to filter characteristics and the averaging interval. Finally, we find that the new method is more robust to discontinuous phase observations than conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|Irregular {{electron}} {{content in}} the ionosphere affects the propagation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals with a phenomenon known as <b>scintillation.</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> are rapid fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of the signal that can lead a receiver to lose lock. In recent years the number of <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Scintillation</b> Monitoring Receivers (ISMR) have increased dramatically. This paper presents an initial analysis of the effect that interference may have in the calculation of the widely used amplitude scintillation index S 4. Interference {{is one of the}} growing threats to the performance of GNSS. Our analysis shows that interference may have particular effects on GNSS receivers that can lead them to output an erroneous measurement of the S 4 index...|$|R
