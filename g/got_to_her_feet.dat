5|$|Sabina <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} {{to persuade her}} {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's tense silence, {{and then}} she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{and looked at him}} proudly.|$|E
60|$|Joan <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> {{and with}} all her woman's soul {{uplifting}} and inflaming her she stood ready to meet the moment that portended.|$|E
60|$|She started up, {{wringing}} her hands. It {{was something}} <b>to</b> have <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Bessie <b>got</b> vividly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "No apologies, Mr. Durgin, please! But in {{just another}} moment you'd have last your dance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{when the}} nine years were gone, the King's {{daughter}} of Duntrine <b>got</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> like one that remembers; {{and she looked}} about her in the masoned house; and all her servants were gone; only the man that piped sat upon the terrace with the hand upon his face; and as he piped the leaves ran about the terrace and the sea beat along the wall. Then she cried {{to him with a}} great voice, [...] "This is the hour, and let me see the power in it". And with that the wind blew off the hood from the man's face, and, lo! there was no man there, only the clothes and the hood and the pipes tumbled one upon another {{in a corner of the}} terrace, and the dead leaves ran over them.|$|R
60|$|A {{few of them}} stood up, {{moving out}} into the aisle, toward the lounge and the {{cocktail}} bar. Beside Thacher the girl <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> pulling her jacket around her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for a spell in silence. Her back was to the light and her face in shadow, so that I could not read what passed there. Then, very slowly, like one utterly weary, she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{makes no}} {{difference}} when I left." [...] Cornelia <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> trembling. [...] "And I'll thank you not to call me by my first name, Mr. Dickerson. I don't know why you should do it, and I don't like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice! Ask all {{the plain}} girls he danced with, all the dull girls he talked with! When I think {{what a good}} time I should have with him as a plain girl, if I were not his sister, I lose all patience." [...] She glanced up in her father's face, with all the strange charm of {{features}} that had no regular beauty; and then, as {{she had to do}} whenever she remembered them, she asserted the grace which governed every movement and gesture in her, and <b>got</b> as lightly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{as if she were a}} wind-bowed flower tilting back <b>to</b> its perpendicular. <b>Her</b> father looked at her with as fond a delight as a lover could have felt in her fascination. She was, in fact, a youthful, feminine version of himself in her plainness; though the grace was all her own. Her complexion was not the leathery red of her father's, but a smooth and even white from cheek to throat. She let her loose cloak fall to the chair behind her, and showed herself tall and slim, with that odd visage of hers drooping from a perfect neck. [...] "Why," [...] she said, [...] "if we had all been horned cattle, he couldn't have treated us better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There now!" [...] exclaimed Maria Port, {{springing}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "What {{have you}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say to that? If that isn't brazen I never saw brass!" ...|$|R
60|$|The two ladies rush <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> each {{carrying}} a slipper. Catherine, about <b>to</b> put <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> into them, is checked by a disturbance in the antechamber.|$|R
60|$|Margaret Duffe <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{and moved}} {{slowly toward the}} great stellar maps that towered above them {{at the far end}} of the chamber. She stood for a long time, gazing up at the myriad suns, the legions of systems, awed by what she saw.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few seconds}} she stared at Farmer Brown's boy, too frightened to move or even think. Then she began to wonder why that dreadful gun didn't go off. What was Farmer Brown's boy waiting for? She <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She was sure that the first step would be her last, yet she couldn't stay there.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> trembling, {{and moved}} quickly {{from under the}} yew-trees. She tried to think--tried to {{understand}} exactly what this portended for her, for him, for her lover. But she could not. There was around her thoughts the same breathless darkness that brooded over this night. Ah! but to the night had been given that pale-gold moon-ray, to herself nothing, no faintest gleam; as well try to pierce below the dark surface of that water! ...|$|E
60|$|Her eyes shone. The {{years had}} fallen away. She rose tremblingly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>her</b> arms stole around his neck.|$|R
60|$|Katharine rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> {{tone and}} {{expression}} were impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|She rose unwillingly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> manner was sullen and unyielding.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had been}} {{kneeling}} before him in dressing his hurt, {{and then in}} critically regarding her handiwork, she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "I know you oughtn't," [...] she retorted, [...] "but I'm glad you done it. And I'm thankful every breath I draw. And now I want you to go. And don't you think I done what I done out of love for you, Joseph Dylks. I'd 'a' done it for any hurt or hungry dog." ...|$|E
60|$|I did not answer, {{knowing that}} she saw the full cruelty of the predicament. What {{happiness}} remained to her now of a battered life stood squarely {{in the way of}} her son's happiness. That was the issue, and no advice or aid of mine could change it. There was another silence that seemed to me an eternity as I watched, a helpless witness, the struggle going on within her. At last she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> her face turned to the shadow.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia did not know. She merely {{wondered}} {{where she would}} be if she hadn't learned it. Something told her {{that if it were}} not for this anchor she would be drifting out to sea: might, indeed, soon be drifting out to sea in spite of it. It was one thing for Mr. Robert Worthington, with his numerous resources, to amuse himself with a girl in her position; it would be quite another thing for the girl. She <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and held out her hand to him.|$|E
60|$|Madeline sprang <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>her</b> {{face flushed}} {{and her eyes}} ablaze.|$|R
60|$|Slowly, still groaning out supplications, {{she rose}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
60|$|Panting--her face convulsed with rage, La sprang <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Laura Hope <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> suddenly. [...] "My friend," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think you}} are a witch. Yes, you are quite right. I have not seen a line of the other man's writing; and I have no more notion than the dead of what or where he is. But it is of him that I am frightened. It is he who is all about my path. It is he who has half driven me mad. Indeed, I think he has driven me mad; for I have felt him where {{he could not have}} been, and I have heard his voice when he could not have spoken." ...|$|E
60|$|She sat up, and {{presently}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{and went}} to the window and stared through the panes until she distinguished the blue whiteness of the fallen snow on her little balcony. The night, despite the clouds, had a certain luminous quality. Then she drew the curtains, searched for the switch, and flooded the room with a soft glow--that beautiful room in which he had so proudly installed her four months before. She smoothed the bed, and walking to the mirror gazed intently at her face, and then she bathed it. Afterwards she opened her window again, admitting a flurry of snow, and stood for some minutes breathing in the sharp air.|$|E
50|$|Sabina <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} {{to persuade her}} {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
60|$|He swung {{round to}} where the {{dragoman}} was lying, forced his mouth open, {{but it was too}} late--the man was dead. He returned to Laura. She stumbled <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She was pale, and drops of perspiration were standing on her forehead. She was able <b>to</b> rise <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> however, without assistance.|$|R
60|$|She rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>Her</b> {{expression}} {{was one of}} dogged but patient humility.|$|R
60|$|She rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> Jacob {{was desperately}} unwilling <b>to</b> let <b>her</b> go.|$|R
50|$|While she {{was waiting}} to board the ship, Lucheni ran {{over to her and}} slammed his body against hers, {{penetrating}} her chest with a sharp needle file (which is now part of the Sisi Museum exhibition at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna). Not realising she was hurt because of her extremely tight corset, and wanting to board as quickly as possible, Elisabeth <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> straight away and boarded the steamer. The vessel departed but quickly turned around when it was realised that Elisabeth was injured. She was carried back to the Beau-Rivage hotel on an improvised stretcher and two doctors were summoned, but they pronounced her dead at 2:10 pm.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{weeks after}} her win at Newmarket, May-day was moved up in {{distance}} {{to contest the}} Oaks over {{one and a half}} miles at Epsom. She started the 7/1 third favourite against fourteen opponents. The race was delayed by half an hour by a series of false starts and the early pace was unusually slow. May-day, ridden by Frank Boyce was restrained by her jockey until the straight where she moved up on the outside and had [...] "the appearance of a winner" [...] when she fell heavily approaching the final furlong. May-day <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> but had sustained a complete fracture of her left foreleg just above the fetlock and was immediately euthanised. The race was won by the 20/1 outsider Pussy.|$|E
60|$|And, {{scrambling}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> {{she went}} over to the wash-stand.|$|R
60|$|Jess started <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> {{and told}} Hendry <b>to</b> help <b>her</b> ben the house.|$|R
60|$|The {{automobile}} {{had come}} to a standstill. She rose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
60|$|She started <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{and stared}} at him with bewildered eyes.|$|R
