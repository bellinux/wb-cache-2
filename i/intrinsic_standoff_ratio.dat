40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been conducted {{on the role of}} the ¯amefront motion in droplet burning to determine the range of validity of the classical quasi-steady theory in predicting the ¯ame <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio,</b> as well as its implication on transient fuel vapor accumulation/depletion. Recognizing that ¯amefront motion can be induced by droplet surface regression, by initial conditions, and by far-®eld unsteadiness, and that the ¯amefront <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> is in general large, of the order of 10, it is phenomenologically anticipated that small ¯amefront velocities can lead to large variations of the mass ¯ow rate. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the in¯uence of this ¯amefront motion can be characterized by a quasi-steady parameter Qs, which is the product of the cube of the <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> and the ratio of the gas to liquid densities, such that the in¯uence is large when it is O(1), and small otherwise. By working in the ¯ame coordinate and, hence, naturally allowing for this motion, and by further assuming gas-phase quasi-stead-iness (in this coordinate), calculated results show that the <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> continuously increases with time for O(1) values of Qs but approaches a constant, which is close to but exceeds the d 2 -law prediction, when it is suf®ciently small. The present generalized transient formulation also provides a rigorous description of fuel vapor accumulation effects related to the initial condition, demonstrates that these effects can indeed be accounted for on the basis of gas-phase quasi-steadiness, and allows for the simultaneous inclu-sion of far-®eld transient diffusion effects...|$|R
40|$|Droplet {{combustion}} experiments {{performed on}} board the International Space Station have shown that normal-alkane fuels with negative temperature coefficient (NTC) chemistry can support quasi-steady, low-temperature combustion without any visible flame. Here we review the results for n-decane, n-heptane, and n-octane droplets burning in carbon dioxidehelium diluted environments at different pressures and initial droplet sizes. Experimental results for cool-flame burning rates, flame <b>standoff</b> <b>ratios,</b> and extinction diameters are compared against simplified theoretical models of the phenomenon. A simplified quasi-steady model based on the partial-burning regime of Lin predicts the burning rate, and flame <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> reasonably well for all three normal alkanes. The second-stage cool-flame burning and extinction following the first-stage hot-flame combustion, however, shows a small dependence on the initial droplet size, thus deviating from the quasi-steady results. An asymptotic model that estimates the oxygen depletion by the hot flame and its influence on cool-flame burning rates is shown to correct the quasi-steady results and provide a better comparison with the measured burning-rate results. This work {{was supported by the}} NASA Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications Program and the International Space Station Program...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to gain a better}} {{understanding}} of ethanol combustion, isolated droplet experiments were performed by varying initial droplet diameter, oxygen concentration, and ambient pressure. Experiments were performed at the NASA Glenn 2. 2 sec. drop tower and the JAMIC 10 sec. dropshaft. These experiments revealed that while ethanol droplets burned in 1 atmosphere air without soot formation, luminous radiation from soot particles at higher pressures, with increased sooting at higher oxygen indices were observed. The measurement of the burning rate, soot <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> and soot volume fraction are described. These experiments provide the first measurements of the soot volume fraction for ethanol droplets burning under microgravity conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Flame Extinguishment (FLEX) {{experiment}} {{that is currently}} underway in the Combustion Integrated Rack facility onboard the International Space Station is aimed at understanding the effects of inert diluents on the flammability of condensed phase fuels. To this end, droplets of various fuels, including alkanes and alcohols, are burned in a quiescent microgravity environment with varying amounts of oxygen and inert diluents to determine the limiting oxygen index (LOI) for these fuels. In this study we report experimental observations of methanol droplets burning in oxygen-nitrogen-carbon dioxide and oxygen-nitrogen-helium gas mixtures at 0. 7 and 1 atmospheric pressures. The initial droplet size varied between approximately 1. 5 mm and 4 mm to capture both diffusive extinction brought about by insufficient residence time at the flame and radiative extinction caused by excessive heat loss from the flame zone. The ambient oxygen concentration varied from a high value of 30 % by volume to as low as 12 %, approaching the limiting oxygen index for the fuel. The inert dilution by carbon dioxide and helium varied over a range of 0 % to 70 % by volume. In these experiments, both freely floated and tethered droplets were ignited using symmetrically opposed hot-wire igniters and the burning histories were recorded onboard using digital cameras, downlinked later to the ground for analysis. The digital images yielded droplet and flame diameters as functions of time and subsequently droplet burning rate, flame <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio,</b> and initial and extinction droplet diameters. Simplified theoretical models correlate the measured burning rate constant and the flame <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> reasonably well. An activation energy asymptotic theory accounting for time-dependent water dissolution or evaporation from the droplet is shown to predict the measured diffusive extinction conditions well. The experiments also show that the limiting oxygen index for methanol in these diluent gases is around 12 % to 13 % oxygen by volume...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} of {{a moving}} liquid fuel drop has been investigated. The drop experiences a strong evaporation-induced radial velocity while undergoing slow translation. In {{view of the}} high evaporation velocity, the flow field {{is not in the}} Stokes regime. The combustion process is modelled by an indefinitely fast chemical reaction rate. While the flow and the transport in the continuous phase and the drop internal circulation are treated as quasisteady, the drop heat-up is regarded as a transient process. The transport equations of the continuous phase require analysis by a singular perturbation technique. The transient heat-up of the drop interior is solved by a series-truncation numerical method. The solution for the total problem is obtained by coupling the results for the continuous and dispersed phases. The enhancement in the mass burning rate and the deformation of the flame shape due to drop translation have been predicted. The initial temperature of the drop and the subsequent heating influence the temporal variations of the flamefront <b>standoff</b> <b>ratio</b> and the flame distance. The friction drag, the pressure drag and the drag due to interfacial momentum flux are individually predicted, and the total drag behaviour is discussed. The circulation inside the drop decreases with evaporation rate. A sufficiently large non-uniform evaporation velocity causes the circulation to reverse...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{droplets}} with diameters {{ranging from}} about 2 mm to 5 mm were burned under microgravity conditions in air at 1 bar with an ambient temperature of 300 K. Each droplet was tethered by a {{silicon carbide fiber}} of 80 mm or 150 mm diameter {{to keep it in}} view of video recording, and, in some tests, a forced air flow was applied in a direction parallel to the fiber axis. Methanol, two methanol-water mixtures, two methanol-dodecanol mixtures, and two heptane-hexadecane mixtures were the fuels. Droplet diameters were measured as functions of time and compared with existing theoretical predictions. The prediction that methanol droplets extinguish at diameters that increase with increasing initial droplet diameter is verified by these experiments. In addition, the quasi-steady burning rate constant of the heptane-hexadecane mixtures appears to decrease with increasing droplet diameter; obscuration consistent with very heavy sooting, but without the formation of soot shells, is observed for the largest of these droplets. Forced convective flow around methanol droplets was found to increase the burning rate and to produce a ratio of downstream-to-upstream flame radius that remained constant as the droplet size decreased, a trend in agreement with earlier results obtained at higher convective velocities for smaller droplets having larger flame <b>standoff</b> <b>ratios.</b> There are a number of implications of the experimental results regarding droplet-combustion theory...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{combustion}} is {{a highly}} complicated process where chemical reactions may occur {{not only in the}} gas phase, but also in the condensed phase {{as well as at the}} solid-gas interphase. The chemistry depends strongly on the coupling between the condensed phase and gas phase phenomena. For some polymers, additional complications arise due to the formation of char layers. For others, the behavior of the condensed phase involves swelling, bubbling, melting, sputtering, and multi-stage combustion. Some of these features bear resemblance to the phenomena observed in coal particle combustion. In addition to its relevance to spacecraft fire safety, the combustion of polymeric materials is related to many applications including solid and hybrid rocket propulsion, and of recent interest, waste incineration. The burning rate is one of the most important parameters used to characterize the combustion of polymers. It has been used to rank the polymer flammability under the same experimental conditions and to evaluate various modes of inhibiting polymer flammability. The main objective of this work is to measure the burning rates of a polymeric material in low gravity. Because of inherent logistical difficulties involved in microgravity experiments, it is impossible to examine a wide spectrum of polymeric materials. It is desirable to investigate a polymer whose combustion is less complicated, and yet will lead to a better understanding of the burning characteristics of other more complicated materials. Therefore, a typical non-charring polymer is selected for use in this experimental study. PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) has been chosen because its thermo-physical properties are well characterized. Although the combustion of PMMA has been extensively studied in 1 G experiments, only a limited amount of work has been conducted in low gravity. A spherical sample geometry is chosen in this study because it is the simplest configuration in terms of the microgravity hardware design requirements. Furthermore, a burning PMMA sphere in microgravity represents a one-dimensional flame with overall combustion characteristics expected to be analogous to the combustion of a liquid fuel droplet, a field with many well-developed theories and models. However, differences can also be expected such as the flame-front <b>standoff</b> <b>ratios</b> and the condensed phase processes occurring during combustion...|$|R
40|$|To {{measure the}} {{magnetic}} field strength in the solar corona, we examined 10 fast (> 1000 km/s) limb CMEs which show clear shock structures in SOHO/LASCO images. By applying piston-shock relationship to the observed CME's standoff distance and electron density compression ratio, we estimated the Mach number, Alfven speed, and magnetic field strength in the height range 3 to 15 solar radii (Rs). Main {{results from this study}} are: (1) the standoff distance observed in solar corona is consistent with those from a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and near-Earth observations; (2) the Mach number as a shock strength is in the range 1. 49 to 3. 43 from the <b>standoff</b> distance <b>ratio,</b> but when we use the density compression ratio, the Mach number is in the range 1. 47 to 1. 90, implying that the measured density compression ratio is likely to be underestimated due to observational limits; (3) the Alfven speed ranges from 259 to 982 km/s and {{the magnetic field}} strength is in the range 6 to 105 mG when the standoff distance is used; (4) if we multiply the density compression ratio by a factor of 2, the Alfven speeds and the magnetic field strengths are consistent in both methods; (5) the magnetic field strengths derived from the shock parameters {{are similar to those of}} empirical models and previous estimates.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCold flow model tests of exhaust gas eductors with constant area mixing stacks {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of geometric configuration on eductor performance. Single-nozzle and four -nozzle designs were tested. The other geometric variables were mixing stack length to diameter ratio (L/D), primary nozzle <b>standoff</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> (S/D), and mixing stack entrance configuration. Non-dimensional parameters governing the flow phenomena are developed from a one-dimensional analysis of a simple eductor system. The eductor performance is evaluated in terms of these nondimensional parameters. The four- nozzle configurations {{were found to have}} better performance than single-nozzle configurations for L/D's less than eight. The effects of L/D, S/D, and entrance shape on performance were found to be highly interdependent at short L/D's. Performance for L/D's greater than four was found to be independent of S/D within the range of S/D's studied.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 202 - 208). Prediction of {{the total}} impulse for a mine-protected vehicle must be empirically determined for South African Paardefontein soil pit soil at the start-up phase of a new vehicle project, particularly when experimental data are not yet available for the calibration of computational efforts. The total impulse on a mine-protected vehicle is influenced {{by a number of}} factors, such as size of the exposed target area, explosive mass, explosive diameter to height <b>ratio,</b> <b>standoff</b> distance, depth of burial, and soil properties. This investigation entails the development of an empirical equation for predicting total impulse by applying regression analysis. A series of comparative test results were obtained with the Scientific Instrumented Impulse Measurement Apparatus (SIIMA) for TNT equivalent surrogate mines of 2. 13 kg - 8 kg mass and diameter to height ratio of 5 : 1, and are reported. The lethal aspects of buried mines (target loading mechanisms), such as the detonation shock load, impact load and distributed load, are identified and discussed. Important parameters influencing anti-vehicular blasts, such as standoff distance, soil effects, mine composition and geometry and target shape, are investigated and reported. In conclusion, a SIIMA empirical equation is established which, although limited in standoff distance, can be used as an affordable and quick tool to calculate the vertical impulse on a flat bottom mine-protected vehicle. The SIIMA results show reasonable agreement with the published data of Westine et al (1985) (Braid [1], Williams et al [2] and Williams and Poon [3]), and with the computational predictions provided by the CSIR DPSS-LS. The results provide {{a better understanding of the}} complex behaviour of shallow-buried mines in dry sand as an anti-vehicular mine threat, when considering parameters such as standoff distance and depth of burial for constant conditions of explosive aspect ratio (diameter to height values) ...|$|R
