40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of {{one-dimensional}} earth-alkaline fermionic atoms and ytterbium 171 atoms is investigated {{by means of}} a low-energy approach and density-matrix renormalization group calculations. For incommensurate filling, four gapless phases with a spin gap are found and consist of two superconducting instabilities and two coexisting bond and charge density-waves instabilities. In the half-filled case, seven Mott-insulating phases arise with the emergence of four non-degenerate phases with <b>exotic</b> <b>hidden</b> orderings.

40|$|The cosmological {{origin of}} both dark and baryonic matter can be {{explained}} through a unified mechanism called hylogenesis where baryon and antibaryon number are divided between the visible sector and a GeV-scale hidden sector, while the Universe remains net baryon symmetric. The "missing" antibaryons, {{in the form of}} <b>exotic</b> <b>hidden</b> states, are the dark matter. We study model-building, cosmological, and phenomenological aspects of this scenario within the framework of supersymmetry, which naturally stabilizes the light hidden sector and electroweak mass scales. Inelastic dark matter scattering on visible matter destroys nucleons, and nucleon decay searches offer a novel avenue for the direct detection of the hidden antibaryonic dark matter sea.

40|$|Quantum phases and {{fluctuations}} in correlated electron systems with frustration and competing interactions are reviewed. In the localized moment case the S= 1 / 2 J 1 - J 2 - model on a square lattice exhibits a rich phase diagram with magnetic {{as well as}} <b>exotic</b> <b>hidden</b> order phases due to the interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations. Their signature in magnetocaloric quantities and the high field magnetization are surveyed. The possible quantum phase transitions are discussed and applied to layered vanadium oxides. In itinerant electron systems frustration is an emergent property caused by electron correlations. It leads to enhanced spin {{fluctuations in}} a very large region of momentum space and therefore may cause heavy fermion type low temperature anomalies as in the 3 d spinel compound LiV 2 O 4. Competing on-site and inter-site electronic interactions in Kondo compounds {{are responsible for the}} quantum phase transition between nonmagnetic Kondo singlet phase and magnetic phase such as observed in many 4 f compounds. They may be described by Kondo lattice and simplified Kondo necklace type models. Their quantum phase transitions are investigated by numerical exact diagonalization and analytical bond operator methods respectively...|$|R

Pottery found by an expedition led by Neville Chittick, in Oponean tombs at Damo, date back to the Mycenaean kingdom of Greece that flourished between the 16th century BC. Merchants from as far afield as Indonesia and Malaysia in the Far East also passed through the settlement.

40|$|<b>Exotic</b> mesons with <b>hidden</b> strange (ss̅) {{and heavy}} quark pairs (QQ̅), where Q=c,b, are {{considered}} as diquark-antidiquark systems, (Qs) (Q̅s̅).

The classification of exotic mesons is discussed, coefficients for decay modes are given, predictions for new states are presented.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the color-magnetic interaction, we systematically investigate the mass splittings of the QQQ̅q̅ tetraquark states and estimated their rough masses in this work. These systems include the explicitly exotic states ccb̅q̅ and bbc̅q̅ and the <b>hidden</b> <b>exotic</b> states ccc̅q̅, cbb̅q̅, bcc̅q̅, and bbb̅q̅. If a state around the estimated mass region could be observed, its nature as a genuine tetraquark is favored.

5000|$|The {{most common}} motifs were the wearers' name or initials. Charlie teased, at $20 per letter (in 1977), [...] "that's just cheap {{insurance}} against getting' 'em stolen." [...] SL Charlie liked to make fancy or unusual designs [...] "because {{a lot of}} people can't make 'em like that," [...] just as he liked to make boots for people [...] "who say they can't be fit." [...] His supreme confidence in fitting anybody carried over to his making of designs: [...] "most other boot makers won't work" [...] with initials or names or designs [...] "because they're afraid they won't fit and they'll be stuck with them." [...] Charlie refused payment for any boots that didn't fit, a rarity affecting only a handful of the thousands of pairs during his last decade of bootmaking. He adorned fearlessly.As Charlie's boots grew in popularity and expense, the palette and variety of exotic skins increased, too: ostrich, anteater, shark, alligator, sting ray, and others, in addition to the traditional calf, snake, lizard, and bull hides in a rainbow of hues. Charlie's favorite hide was kangaroo, because of its combination of strength and pliability, and his least favorite were shark and crocodile, with [...] "skin as unpredictable as they were alive. You never know when it's going to break or give way," [...] he explained. [...] No matter how colorful or <b>exotic</b> the <b>hide,</b> regardless of the amount or type of designs, Charlie stayed true to his goal: [...] "If you can't fit people, no matter how beautiful the boot is, no matter how exotic the leather, it ain't worth a damn." ...|$|R

While, in later years, much has helped refine those childhood insights, nothing has served to nullify them. Both my parents were readers; interestingly, they seldom read to us. My mother, raised in various log cabins {{in the north of}} Alberta, was a human tome of macabre stories involving young girls falling off horses and dying of concussion, of schoolhouses catching fire, of bodies stored in granaries waiting until spring to be buried, of the roving uncle who dropped in annually for his bath, of long-haired hermits and keening widows, of stillborn babies swathed in cotton batting and buried in roughhewn boxes. The stories of my father's family were constructed from the shadowed allusions, made by aging aunts and uncles, to the atrocities of Stalinist Russia. These fragments, told with unfocused eyes and flushed faces, were more fearful for their imagined horror than for details truly known.
