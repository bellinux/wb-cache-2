40|$|Sea turtles {{are highly}} migratory and usually dispersed, but {{aggregate}} off beaches during the nesting season, rendering them vulnerable to coastal threats. Consequently, coastal Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) {{have been used}} to facilitate the recovery of turtle populations, but the effectiveness of these programs is uncertain as most have been operating for less than a single turtle generation (or, 20 yr). South Africa, however, hosts one of the longest running conservation programs, protecting nesting loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles since 1963 in a series of coastal MPAs. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the long-term effect of spatial protection on the abundance of two highly migratory turtle species with different life history characteristics. Population responses were assessed by modeling the number of nests over time in an <b>index</b> <b>area</b> (13 km) and an expanded monitoring area (53 km) with varying survey effort. Loggerhead abundance increased dramatically from, 250 to. 1700 nests pa (<b>index</b> <b>area)</b> especially over the last decade, while leatherback abundance increased initially, 10 to 70 nests pa (<b>index</b> <b>area),</b> but then stabilized.

To investigate the correlates of angina pectoris, echocardiographic and hemodynamic data from 44 patients with aortic stenosis and no coronary artery disease (mean age 56 ± 10 years) were analyzed.

40|$|This article investigates {{experimentally}} {{the application}} of health monitoring techniques to assess the damage on {{a particular kind of}} hysteretic (metallic) damper called web plastifying dampers, which are subjected to cyclic loading. In general terms, hysteretic dampers are increasingly used as passive control systems in advanced earthquake-resistant structures. Nonparametric statistical processing of the signals obtained from simple vibration tests of the web plastifying damper is used here to propose an <b>area</b> <b>index</b> damage. This <b>area</b> <b>index</b> damage is compared with an alternative energy-based index of damage proposed in past research that is based on the decomposition of the load?displacement curve experienced by the damper. Index of damage has been proven to accurately predict the level of damage and the proximity to failure of web plastifying damper, but obtaining the load?displacement curve for its direct calculation requires the use of costly instrumentation. For this reason, the aim {{of this study is to}} estimate index of damage indirectly from simple vibration tests, calling for much simpler and cheaper instrumentation, through an auxiliary <b>index</b> called <b>area</b> <b>index</b> damage. Web plastifying damper is a particular type of hysteretic damper that uses the out-of-plane plastic deformation of the web of I-section steel segments as a source of energy dissipation. Four I-section steel segments with similar geometry were subjected to the same pattern of cyclic loading, and the damage was evaluated with the index of damage and <b>area</b> <b>index</b> damage indexes at several stages of the loading process.
