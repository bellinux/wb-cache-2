The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.|$|E

5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> any further.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break Ender down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. The jealous commander of the army with whom Ender first served, Bonzo Madrid, compels him to fight outside the simulation, and Ender unintentionally kills him, once again seeking to preemptively prevent all future struggles with Bonzo.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms <b>from</b> <b>growing.</b> Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E

If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> beyond a critical volume.|$|E

They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies instrumented so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son <b>from</b> <b>growing</b> up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
