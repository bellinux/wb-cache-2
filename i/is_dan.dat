5|$|After {{cutting and}} dyeing her hair, Sil takes an {{attraction}} to Preston, having dreamt of him the previous night. After the team celebrates their apparent victory, she stalks {{them in their}} hotel, {{and they do not}} recognize her. Arden, who is upset at being single, walks into his room to find Sil waiting there. She has intercourse with Arden, then kills him when he realizes who she <b>is.</b> <b>Dan</b> senses that Sil is in the hotel and he alerts Preston, Laura, {{and the rest of the}} team. She morphs again and escapes and they follow her into the sewers where Fitch is subsequently killed. Sil gives birth and Dan finds her offspring in a cavern behind the sewers. The child attacks him and he incinerates it. Sil, angered, attacks the trio in an attempt to kill Preston and Dan. Preston uses a shotgun on her head, decapitating and killing her. The trio leaves the area. The last scene shows a rat chewing on one of Sil's severed tentacles; it starts to mutate into a vicious beast and attacks another rat.|$|E

500|$|Coral Springs {{uses the}} commission-manager form of {{municipal}} government, with all governmental powers resting in a legislative body called a commission. Coral Springs' commission {{is composed of}} five elected commissioners, {{one of whom is}} the mayor of the city and another of whom is the vice-mayor. The mayor and vice-mayor serve a two-year term; the commissioners serve four-year terms. The offices are non-partisan; no candidate is allowed to declare a party affiliation. The role of the commission is to pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations, and appoint city officials, including the city manager. While the mayor serves as a presiding officer of the commission, the city manager is the administrative head of the municipal government, and is responsible for the administration of all departments. The city commission holds its regular meetings biweekly. As of 2014, the Mayor is Walter [...] "Skip" [...] Campbell.

Assist leaders include Carter (108 in 1980) in the National League and the major leagues and Sundberg (103 in 1977) in the American League. No Gold Glove-winning catchers had posted errorless seasons until Johnson (1997) and Matheny (2003) each accomplished the feat in the National League within six years; their fielding percentages in those seasons were 1.000, and Matheny posted two other winning seasons with only one error and a [...]999 fielding percentage in his career. Bengie Molina leads in the American League with a one-error, [...]999 fielding percentage season in 2002; Sherm Lollar also posted only one error in the award's inaugural season, but a reduced number of chances left his fielding percentage at [...]998.

2500|$|Although Sadoveanu {{continued}} to be hailed as a major writer during the Ceaușescu years, and the seventy years of his debut were marked with state ceremony, the reaction against Soviet influence affected presentations of his work: his official bibliography no longer included any mention of Păuna-Mică. Among the memoirs dealing with Sadoveanu's late years were those of Alexandru Rosetti, published in 1977. The official revival of nationalist discourse in the 1960s allowed controversial critic Edgar Papu to formulate his version of Protochronism, which postulated that phenomenons within Romanian culture preceded developments in world culture. In this context, Papu spoke of Sadoveanu as [...] "one of the great precursory voices", comparing him to Rabindranath Tagore. After the 1989 Revolution toppled communism, Sadoveanu remained an influence on some young authors, who recovered the themes of his work in a Postmodern or parodic manner. Among them <b>is</b> <b>Dan</b> Lungu, who, according to critic Andrei Terian, alluded to the Hanu Ancuței frame story when constructing his 2004 novel Paradisul găinilor. In 2001, a poll carried among literati by Observator Cultural magazine listed six of his works {{as some of the}} best 150 Romanian novels.|$|E
