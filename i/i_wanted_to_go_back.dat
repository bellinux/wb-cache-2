500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amos had {{initially}} planned {{to record the}} entire album in the American South because [...] "there's a hiddenness about the South, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there because it was similar to how I felt in my relationships with men," [...] {{but the bulk of}} the record was recorded in a church in County Wicklow, Ireland, as well as in New Orleans, Louisiana. Given her religious upbringing, Amos was drawn to record in a church, not in anger, but [...] "with the intention of wholeness and of bringing a fragmented woman back to freedom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E
2500|$|After the rock–dance sound which {{dominated}} {{her previous}} album Simply Deep, Rowland {{felt she was}} still struggling with finding her sound as solo artist, and instead of capitalizing off its international success, the singer and her management settled on [...] "a more urban approach" [...] with her second album. Commenting on her decision, Rowland later told MTV News, [...] "in general, I'm going in the urban, more R route. Of course, that's what I started with Destiny's Child, [...] my first solo album I did more of a pop-sounding record. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my roots and dibble and dabble with some beats." [...] Consequently, Columbia Records consulted {{a wider range of}} contemporary R and hip hop producers and artists such as Big Tank, Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith, Rockwilder, Rich Harrison, Rodney Jerkins, and Robin Thicke to work with Rowland on the album. Female rappers Remy Ma, Eve, and Shawnna also lent their voices to guest parts.|$|E
2500|$|After Titanic sank, Jones {{suggested}} {{going back}} to save some {{of those in the}} water. Only three passengers agreed; the rest refused, fearing that the boat would be capsized by desperate swimmers. Jones acquiesced, but told them: [...] "Ladies, if any of us are saved, remember <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> I would rather drown with them than leave them." [...] The passengers' conduct during the subsequent hours presented some striking contrasts. Lady Rothes– who {{had been one of the}} few passengers to support a rescue attempt– took charge of the tiller and put others to work at the oars. Her conduct was later complimented by Jones, who called her [...] "more of a man than any we had aboard" [...] and gave her the lifeboat's numeral 8, in a frame, as a keepsake. In fact, when Walter Lord, author of A Night to Remember, interviewed the Countess and Seaman Jones in 1954, he discovered their mutual admiration had led to a lifelong correspondence. By contrast, Ella White was so annoyed that the stewards in lifeboat number 8 were smoking cigarettes that she complained about it at the US Senate inquiry into the disaster; she was particularly indignant that one of the ship's crewmen had said to another during the night: [...] "If you don't stop talking through that hole in your face, there will be one less in the boat!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she cried. [...] "Do {{not leave}} me. I would rather die.

6000|$|... "I {{must have}} thought at a frightful pace. It seemed {{a long time before}} I was sure that the thing meant to keep steady. At first it heeled sideways. Then I noticed the face of the rock which seemed to be {{streaming}} up past me, and me motionless. Then I looked down and saw in the darkness the river and the dead Sepoy rushing up towards me. But in the indistinct light I also saw three Chins, seemingly aghast at the sight of me, and that the Sepoy was decapitated. At that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "But on the Sunday {{afternoon}} {{a message}} {{was brought to}} the house. They were all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened. Word had come that he was to be killed. I needn't tell the next part, because you know it. I thought I'd have time to rush up and get the papers from their hiding-place, but I was caught. So I screamed out that he was escaping, and I said <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Marguerite. I shouted the name three times very loud. I knew the others would think I meant Mrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the picture. He'd unhooked one the first day--that's what made me hesitate to trust him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{upon all}} these determinations. I began to {{demand in the}} intellectual slang of the time [...] "more actuality," [...] and to amaze my father with talk about empire makers and the greatness of Lord Strathcona and Cecil Rhodes. Why, I asked, shouldn't I travel for a year in search of opportunity? At Oxford I had made acquaintance with a son of Pramley's, the big Mexican and Borneo man, and to him I wrote, apropos of a half-forgotten midnight talk in the rooms of some common friend. He wrote back with the suggestion that I should go and talk to his father, and I tore myself away from Mary {{and went up to}} see that great exploiter of undeveloped possibilities and have one of the most illuminating and humiliating conversations in the world. He was, I remember, a little pale-complexioned, slow-speaking man with a humorous blue eye, a faint, just perceptible northern accent and a trick of keeping silent for a moment after you had finished speaking, and he talked to me as one might talk to a child of eight who wanted to know how one could become a commander-in-chief. His son had evidently emphasized my Union reputation, and he would have been quite willing, I perceived, to give me employment if I had displayed the slightest intelligence or ability in any utilizable direction. But quite dreadfully he sounded my equipment with me and showed me the emptiness of my stores.|$|E
