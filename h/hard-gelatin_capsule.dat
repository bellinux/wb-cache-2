40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics of once-daily saquinavir (SQV) <b>hard-gelatin</b> <b>capsule</b> (HGC) /ritonavir (RTV), 1600 / 100 mg, compared with once-daily SQV soft-gelatin capsule (SGC) /RTV, 1600 / 100 mg. METHODS: We evaluated 13 randomly selected HIV- 1 -infected subjects taking once-daily SQV SGC/RTV, 1600 / 100 mg, plus dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in this pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy. Subjects took 1 week of SQV HGC/RTV and NRTIs, followed by steady-state SQV PK determinations. Subjects then changed to SQV SGC/RTV and NRTIs for 1 week, followed again by steady-state SQV PK determinations. Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C(max)), minimum concentration (C(min)), time to C(max), and elimination half-life were calculated. RESULTS: There {{was no significant}} difference in AUC values between HGCs and SGCs, with a median (plus interquartile range [IQR]) of 50. 0 (42. 6 - 71. 5) versus 35. 5 (28. 0 - 50. 2) mg/L/h, respectively (=. 056). Intersubject variability resulted in 4 of 13 subjects on the SQV SGCs and 2 of 13 subjects on the SQV HGCs having a C(min) below the minimum effective concentration of 0. 05 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Once-daily SQV HGCs, 1600 mg, boosted with once-daily RTV, 100 mg, resulted in PK parameters that were similar to those observed with 1600 mg of SQV SGC/ 100 mg RTV once daily. Once-daily SQV HGC/RTV, 1600 / 100 mg, may be easier to use in developing countries and may increase access where drug costs can be less, the capsule size is smaller, and the need for refrigeration is lessene...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{short-term}} and long-term {{effect of a}} combination of saquinavir, ritonavir and stavudine in moderately to severely immunosuppressed protease inhibitor-naive patients. DESIGN: Prospective open-label multicentre study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 64 protease inhibitor-naive and stavudine-naive HIV-infected patients with a CD 4 count of 10 000 HIV- 1 RNA copies/mL received saquinavir <b>hard-gelatin</b> <b>capsules,</b> ritonavir and stavudine. Full (drop in viraemia of > 2 log 10 and/or < 500 copies/mL) and partial responders (drop to between 500 and 5000 viraemia copies/mL) at week 9 (end of phase I) entered the second phase (additional 12 -month period). RESULTS: Fifty-six patients completed phase I, 45 (70 %) full responders and nine (14 %) partial responders by intent-to-treat analysis. Thirty-nine patients completed phase II, 33 (52 %) full responders and two (3 %) partial responders. Six patients had < 50 HIV- 1 RNA copies/mL at week 9, and 20 (31 %) patients at month 12 of phase II. Mean CD 4 cell counts increased significantly in the 56 patients from 89 to 184 cells/microL after 9 weeks and from 100 to 292 cells/microL in the 39 patients treated for another 12 months. Higher baseline viraemia and lower baseline CD 4 cell counts were not associated with an unfavourable virological response at week 9 and month 12 of phase II. HIV DNA in peripheral blood monocytes decreased substantially (- 1. 5 log 10) but was detectable in all except one patient at the end of phase II. CONCLUSION: In protease- and stavudine-naive HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe immunosuppression, saquinavir in combination with ritonavir and stavudine caused a substantial long-term decrease in plasma viral load in approximately half the participants and a substantial increase in CD 4 cell counts...|$|R
