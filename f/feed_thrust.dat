40|$|Abstract — In turning process, {{engineers}} are often {{faced with the}} problems of relating the cutting parameters (Speed, feed, depth of cut) to the output responses(Feed force, Thrust force, Cutting force, Surface roughness) to optimize the process. Also, Turing is done with the aim of achieving the best surface finish. But without optimization, {{it is not possible to}} automate the process. Turning process involves a large number of variables that affect its performance. However, based on the literature survey and the pilot experiments, it is found that speed, feed and depth of cut have significant affect on the <b>feed</b> force, <b>thrust</b> force, cutting force and surface finish. Therefore in the present work, they are considered as the decision variables and the feasible ranges of the decision variables are found by conducting trial experiments on INCONEL 600.

40|$|Aero-static thrust {{bearings}} offer some distinct advantages {{in comparison with}} contact bearings {{as there is no}} contact between the moving and stationary parts, thus there is no wear, limited heat generation and long life can be achieved. Moreover, linear positioning control is not affected by the highly nonlinear friction forces, and high precision positioning or high speed can be achieved. The main drawbacks of aerostatic bearings are low stiffness and load capacity and sometimes poor damping in comparison to contact bearings, so that their application in some sectors, e. g. machine tools, is less popular. Active compensation methods {{can be used as a}} solution for this problem. Electronic control with piezo actuators give generally good results in both static and dynamic conditions but they are expensive do to use of many sensors and piezo actuators for each pad. In addition in this type of methods, special design is necessary for each air bearing and normal commercial air bearings cannot be used. Pure pneumatic control is an interesting alternative solution in terms of performances and cost. This thesis presents designing, modelling and test of pneumatic valve which is an upstream restrictor and can control the air flow to improve the stiffness of any commercial thrust bearing. The static experiments show that the active system can improve the static stiffness significantly but it was in cost of losing the load carrying capacity. Different improvement have been made to improve the valve design in order to improve the load carrying capacity. In the final design it is possible to use the active system instead of wide range of commercial thrust air bearing with higher load carrying capacity and stiffness. In this study the numerical simulation of grooved <b>feeding</b> <b>thrust</b> air bearings is done for the first time.

In the high-speed cutting of Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V, it is observed that the several chips adhere on the rake face of cutting edge.

These materials are generally regarded as extremely difficult to machine, because of the abrasive characteristics of the reinforced particulates.

These characteristics in machining of Al/SiCp MMCs tend to adversely affect the machined surface quality/integrity. Hence, an attempt is made to improve the machinability of Al/SiCp MMCs and surface quality by hot machining.

Experiments on Al/SiCp 10 % composites of two different particle size of Silicon carbide reinforcement i. e. coarse and fine (220 and 600 mesh size respectively) are performed using L 16 orthogonal array as per the Taguchi method. The study of Al/SiCp MMCs on the basis of surface integrity was tried out in order to know the machinability. The experimental study showed that feed, depth of cut and preheating temperature have a significant influence on cutting force, <b>feed</b> force, <b>thrust</b> force, surface roughness and micro-hardness variation beneath the machined surface. The micro-hardness is found to be higher near the machined surface layer and decreases with the depth of machined subsurface for all experimental conditions. Qualitative analysis of surface and subsurface damage is analysed using SEM photographs. A SEM photograph reflects the SiC particulates debonding, fracture, feed marks and smeared layer on machined surface. Better values of surface roughness are obtained at 60 °C temperature during machining of both Al/SiC/ 10 p/ 220 (0. 776 μm) and Al/SiC/ 10 p/ 600 (0. 640 μm) MMCs...|$|R
