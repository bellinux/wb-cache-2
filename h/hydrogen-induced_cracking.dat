40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} of the terrace-like fracture morphology of gaseous <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>crack</b> growth in acicular alpha-beta titanium alloys in terms of specimen configuration, magnitude of applied stress intensity, test temperature, and hydrogen pressure. Although the overall appearance of the terrace structure remained essentially unchanged, a distinguishable variation {{is found in the}} size of the individual terrace steps, and step size is found to be inversely dependent upon the rate of <b>hydrogen-induced</b> slow <b>crack</b> growth. This inverse relationship is independent of all the variables investigated. These observations are quantitatively discussed in terms of the formation and growth of a thin hydride film along the alpha-beta boundaries and a qualitative model for <b>hydrogen-induced</b> slow <b>crack</b> growth is presented, based on the film-rupture model of stress corrosion cracking...|$|R
50|$|By far, {{the most}} {{damaging}} effect of hydrogen in structural materials is hydrogen embrittlement. Materials susceptible to this process exhibit a marked decrease in their energy absorption ability before fracture {{in the presence of}} hydrogen. This phenomenon is also known as hydrogen-assisted <b>cracking,</b> <b>hydrogen-induced</b> blister <b>cracking.</b> The embrittlement is enhanced by slow strain rates and low temperatures, near room temperature.|$|R
50|$|For steel {{there are}} three major failure modes by which {{weldability}} can be measured: <b>hydrogen-induced</b> cold <b>cracking,</b> lamellar tearing, and spot-weld peeling. The most prominent of these is hydrogen induced cold cracking.|$|R
5000|$|During {{hydrogen}} embrittlement, {{hydrogen is}} {{introduced to the}} surface of a metal and individual hydrogen atoms diffuse through the metal. Because the solubility of hydrogen increases at higher temperatures, raising the temperature can increase the diffusion of hydrogen. When assisted by a concentration gradient where there is significantly more hydrogen outside the metal than inside, hydrogen diffusion can occur even at lower temperatures. These individual hydrogen atoms within the metal gradually recombine to form hydrogen molecules, creating pressure from within the metal. This pressure can increase to levels where the metal has reduced ductility, toughness, and tensile strength, up {{to the point where it}} cracks open (<b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking,</b> or HIC). Though hydrogen atoms embrittle a variety of substances, including steel, aluminium (at high temperatures only), and titanium, hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steel is of the most importance. Austempered iron is also susceptible, though austempered steel (and possibly other austempered metals) display increased resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Steel with an ultimate tensile strength of less than 1000 MPa (~145,000 psi) or hardness of less than 30 HRC is not generally considered susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. In tensile tests carried out on several structural metals under high-pressure molecular hydrogen environment, it has been shown that austenitic stainless steels, aluminium (including alloys), copper (including alloys, e.g. beryllium copper) are not susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement along with a few other metals. [...] As an example of severe hydrogen embrittlement, the elongation at failure of 17-4PH precipitation hardened stainless steel was measured to drop from 17% to only 1.7% when smooth specimens were exposed to high-pressure hydrogen.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> is {{characterized}} by the decreased ductility and fracture toughness of a material due to the absorption of atomic hydrogen in the metal crystal lattice. Corrosion is the source of hydrogen generation. For the current design of the engineered barrier without backfill, <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> may be a concern because the titanium drip shield can be galvanically coupled to rock bolts (or wire mesh), which may fall onto the drip shield, thereby creating conditions for hydrogen production by electrochemical reaction. The purpose of this report is to analyze whether the drip shield will fail by <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> under repository conditions within 10, 000 years after emplacement. <b>Hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> is a scenario of premature failure of the drip shield. This report develops a realistic model to assess the form of <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> degradation of the drip shield under the <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking.</b> The scope of this work covers the evaluation of hydrogen absorbed due to general corrosion and galvanic coupling to less noble metals (e. g., Stainless Steel Type 316 and carbon steels) under the repository conditions during the 10, 000 -year regulatory period after emplacement and whether the absorbed hydrogen content will exceed the critical hydrogen concentration value, above which the <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> is assumed to occur. This report also provides the basis for excluding the features, events, and processes (FEPs) related to <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> of the drip shield with particular emphasis on FEP 2. 1. 03. 04.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{conservative}} {{model has been}} developed to evaluate the effects of <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> on the drip shield. The basic premise of the model is that failure will occur once the hydrogen content exceeds a certain limit or critical value, HC. This model is very conservative because it assumes that, once the environmental and material conditions can support that particular corrosion process, failure will be effectively instantaneous. In {{the description of the}} HIC model presented in Section 6. 1, extensive evidence has been provided to support a qualitative assessment of Ti- 7 as an excellent choice of material for the drip shield with regard to degradation caused by <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking.</b> LTCTF test data observed at LLNL, although unqualified, provides additional indication beyond a qualitative level that hydrogen concentration appears to be low in titanium materials. Quantitative evaluation based on the HIC model described in Section 6. 1 indicates that the hydrogen concentration does not exceed the critical value.

40|$|As-fabricated EN 82 H welds are {{susceptible}} to low temperature embrittlements in 54 degree C hydrogenated water. Values of J[sub]IC in water are typically 90 % to 98 % lower than those in air due to a fracture mechanism transition from microvoid coalescence to hydrogen-included intergranular fracture. Environmental J[sub]IC testing demonstrated that a high temperature (1093 degree C) anneal and furnace-cool alleviates the material's susceptibility to <b>hydrogen-induced</b> intergranular <b>cracking.</b> To identify metallurgical and compositional features {{that are responsible for}} the material's environment-sensitive behavior, detailed characterization of the microstructure and grain boundary chemistry for the as-fabricated and as-annealed materials was performed. Results from light optical microscopy, analytical electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, Auger electron spectroscopy and mechanical property characterization are used to provide insight into the observed low temperature embrittlement phenomenon. The key microstructural feature responsible for low temperature cracking in as-fabricated welds appears to be fine niobium and titanium-rich carbonitrides that cover most grain boundaries. These precipitates are effective hydrogen traps that promote <b>hydrogen-induced</b> intergranular <b>cracking.</b> Dissolution the fine carbonitrides during the 1093 degree C anneal reduces grain boundary trapping sites, which accounts for the improved fracture resistance displayed by the annealed weld. The role of strength level in promoting low temperature embrittlement is evaluated by cold-rolling the annealed weld to increase its yield strength from 280 to 640 MPa. The annealed and cold-rolled weld exhibits high toughness in 54 degree C water and shows no evidence of <b>hydrogen-induced</b> intergranular <b>cracking,</b> thereby demonstrating that strength is not a primary cause of low temperature embrittlement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{understanding}} of <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> (HIC) of Ti Grade 7 and other relevant titanium alloys {{within the context}} of the current waste package design for the repository environmental conditions anticipated within the Yucca Mountain repository.

50|$|The {{weldability}} of steel, {{with regard}} to <b>hydrogen-induced</b> cold <b>cracking,</b> is inversely proportional to the hardenability of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment. The hardenability of steel depends on its chemical composition, with greater quantities of carbon and other alloying elements resulting in a higher hardenability and thus a lower weldability. In {{order to be able}} to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a plain carbon steel. The effect on weldability of elements like chromium and vanadium, while not as great as carbon, is more significant than that of copper and nickel, for example. As the equivalent carbon content rises, the weldability of the alloy decreases.|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} to <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> in H 2 S environment of welded API X 80 steel was studied.

40|$|A phase {{field model}} was {{developed}} to simulate hydrogen diffusion and <b>hydrogen-induced</b> <b>cracking</b> of lead zirconate ferroelectric ceramics (PZT- 5). In this model, the evolution of hydrogen concentration around a crack in PZT was coupled with stress field analysis by solving both time-dependent diffusion equation and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau strain field equation. Combined with a fracture criterion, we simulated hydrogen diffusion and crack initiation in PZT ceramics caused by hydrogen ingress from the environment. Numerical results showed that, as the concentration of hydrogen increased, the fracture toughness of PZT ceramics decreased significantly by one or two orders of magnitudes.

40|$|<b>Hydrogen-induced</b> cold <b>cracking</b> and {{blistering}} in hydrogen-charged X 70 steel {{was found}} to be highly dependent on microstructure, with the banded ferrite-pearlite microstructure of hot rolled strip showing a higher susceptibility than other microstructures produced by different thermal-mechanical routes. Although crack initiation was particularly sensitive to microstructure, crack growth occurred largely parallel to the rolling plane, at least at a macroscopic level, for all of the microstructures investigated. The crack plane was associated with structural anisotropy arising from processing by rolling and was not found to be related to a preferred grain orientation. At a microstructural level, crack propagation was mostly transgranular and occurred dominantly along slip planes of the ferrite grains. Cracks were initiated at strong traps in the microstructure when the hydrogen and local stress concentrations reached critical levels for hydrogen-induced fracture.
