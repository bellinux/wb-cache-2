500|$|The {{dead man}} in plate 37, <b>Esto</b> <b>es</b> peor (This is worse), forms a {{mutilated}} {{body of a}} Spanish fighter spiked on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers.

Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In <b>Esto</b> <b>es</b> peor he subverts the classical motifs used in war art through his addition of a degree of black theatre– the branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing. The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, {{during the time of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Art critic Robert Hughes remarked that the figures in this image [...] "remind us that, if only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like Menges would have been in aesthetic raptures over them." ...|$|R
