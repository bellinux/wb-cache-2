Wealthy planters exercised considerable {{economic and political power}} in the state. Slavery did not end until after the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Cho had come back in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, it was even more unbelievable. Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that he came back and won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. This certainly showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E
