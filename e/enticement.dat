5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an <b>enticement,</b> but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|The federal government's {{strategy}} {{in both the}} West Triangle and Western China in general is to provide large amounts of monetary investment {{in order to provide}} an industrial and infrastructure base, which would then attract foreign investment. Areas which the government has invested heavily in include infrastructure, <b>enticement</b> of foreign investment, ecological protection, education, and retention of talent flowing to richer provinces or foreign nations. Over RMB 1 trillion has been spent on the West as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler's in the War Department, {{suggested}} Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in Washington, D. C. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, endearing him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary—about five times that of a US senator at the time—proved a significant <b>enticement,</b> and Chandler agreed {{to be considered for}} the job.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the <b>enticement</b> of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an <b>enticement.</b> At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain was attempting to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was attempting to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong <b>enticement</b> for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E

Rector indicated that if there were insufficient volunteers to fill these new companies, a draft would be made upon the militia regiments and brigades.

25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Wisconsin is 18 {{and there is}} no close-in-age {{exception}}. There is, however, a marital exception which allows a person to have sex with a minor 16 or older if they are married to the minor. If the minor is below 16 both sexual intercourse and any sexual contact are a felony; sexual intercourse with a minor 16-17 by a perpetrator who is not married to the minor is a Class A misdemeanor. However, Wisconsin has a child <b>enticement</b> law that prohibits people of any age from taking people under 18 to a private area such as a room and exposing a sex organ to them or having the minor expose their sex organ to them. This is a Class B or C felony.|$|E

25|$|Barrientos was {{appointed}} an Inquisitor during this time, and in 1438 was elected Bishop of Segovia. On 3 May 1440 a church council was convened in the Church of San Miguel of Turégano, {{at which he}} presented his synodal commandments for the theological and pastoral formation of his clergymen. Being loyal to John II, in 1442 he reformed the diocese of Segovia, which had been {{under the influence of}} the rebellious prince Henry, to serve the province of Ávila in supporting the King. Later, he engineered a conciliation in the Tordesillas area to create a joint front in the face of the opposition of the Kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon. In 1444 he occupied the diocese of Cuenca and in the following year he lent the diocese's aid to the region's troops in the First Battle of Olmedo. Similarly, in 1449, he pledged the arms of the diocese in defense against the troops of don Alonso de Aragón and other Castilian noblemen who opposed the king. One offered him the archbishopric seat of Santiago de Compostela, but he rejected this <b>enticement.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{street network}} pattern {{can affect the}} {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an <b>enticement</b> for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} pharmaceutical companies persuade and offer <b>enticements</b> to Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia) general practitioners (GPs), {{in an attempt to}} encourage them to recommend health websites to the health consumer. A survey instrument consisting of seven single response questions was mailed to 250 (61 %) out of 410 GPs. Questions were designed to measure the percentages (%) and proportions associated with levels of persuasion and types of <b>enticements</b> pharmaceutical companies are offering GPs, in an attempt to encourage them to recommend health websites to the health consumer. The survey instrument allowed participants to indicate their (1) gender, (2) age and (3) years of experience (less experienced 㠱 0 years / more experienced 砱 0 years). One hundred and eight (43 %) of the 250 GPs returned a completed survey. The return rate for male GPs was 72 (40 %) and for female GPs, it was 36 (33 %). Sixty-eight (63 %) GPs indicated that they actively recommend health websites to their patients [male GPs - 48 (71 %), female GPs - 20 (29 %) ]. This study highlights that female GPs (80 %), those aged between 31 and 40 (77 %) and GPs with < 10 years experience (72 %) were more frequently targeted by pharmaceutical companies. This study reports that pharmaceutical companies are offering various types of <b>enticements</b> in an attempt to persuade Gold Coast GPs to recommend specific health websites to the health consumer. Further research should explore if similar levels of persuasion and types of <b>enticements</b> are being offered to GPs across Australia. No Full Tex...|$|R
