Beyond thickness, there is also clinical interest in identifying how the composition and texture of the intima-media complex (IMC) changed and how these textural changes grow into atherosclerotic plaques that can cause stroke.

The objective of this work was to carry out a comparative evaluation of <b>despeckle</b> filtering on ultrasound images of the carotid artery, and develop a new segmentation system, for detecting the IMT of the common carotid artery and the borders of the athrerosclerotic carotid plaque in longitudinal ultrasound images of the carotid artery. To the, best of our knowledge no similar system has been developed for segmenting the atherosclerotic carotid plaque, although a number of techniques have been proposed for IMT segmentation. A total of 11 <b>despeckle</b> filtering methods were evaluated based on texture analysis, image quality evaluation metrics, and visual evaluation made by two experts, on 440 ultrasound images of the carotid artery bifurcation. Furthermore, the proposed IMT and plaque segmentation techniques were evaluated on 100 and 80 longitudinal ultrasound images of the carotid bifurcation respectively based on receiver operating chatracteristic (ROC) analysis. The <b>despeckle</b> filtering results showed that a <b>despeckle</b> filter based on local statistics (lsmv) improved the class separation between asymptomatic and symptomatic classes, gave only a marginal improvement in the percentage of correct classifications success rate, and improved the visual assessment carried out by the experts. It was also found that the lsmv <b>despeckle</b> filter can be used for despeckling asymptomatic images where the expert is interested mainly in the plaque composition and texture analysis, whereas a geometric <b>despeckle</b> filter (gf 4 d) can be used for despeckling of symptomatic images where the expert is interested in identifying the degree of stenosis and the plaque borders.

The plaque segmentation, results showed that, the Lai & Chin snakes segmentation method gives results comparable to the manual delineation procedure. The IMT and plaque snakes segmentation method may be therefore used to complement and assist the final expert's evaluation. The proposed despeckling and segmentation methods will be further evaluated on a larger number of ultrasound images and on multiple experts' evaluation.

In recent years, predominant state-of-the-art approaches for <b>despeckling</b> are usually based on nonlocal methods which mainly concentrate on achieving utmost image restoration quality, with relatively low computational efficiency. Therefore, in this study we aim to propose an efficient <b>despeckling</b> model with both high computational efficiency and high recovery quality. To this end, we exploit a newly-developed trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion(TNRD) framework which has proven a simple and effective model for various image restoration problems. In the original TNRD applications, the diffusion network is usually derived based on the direct gradient descent scheme. However, this approach will encounter some problem for the task of multiplicative noise reduction exploited in this study. To solve this problem, we employed a new architecture derived from the proximal gradient descent method. Taking into account the speckle noise statistics, the diffusion process for the <b>despeckling</b> task is derived. We then retrain all the model parameters in the presence of speckle noise. Finally, optimized nonlinear diffusion filtering models are obtained, which are specialized for <b>despeckling</b> with various noise levels. Experimental results substantiate that the trained filtering models provide comparable or even better results than state-of-the-art nonlocal approaches. Meanwhile, our proposed model merely contains convolution of linear filters with an image, which offers high level parallelism on GPUs.
