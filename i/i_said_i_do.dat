6000|$|... "But I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea of {{falling in love with}} him. In spite of what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope that I can help it. And then I feel to him just as though he were my brother. I've got almost to know what it would be to have a brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|There, without doubt, was old Brother John with {{a wreath}} of flowers--I noted in disgust {{that they were}} orchids--hanging in a bacchanalian fashion from his dinted sun-helmet over his left eye. He was in a furious rage and reviling Bausi, who {{literally}} crouched before him, and I was in a furious rage and reviling him. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not remember, but he said, his white beard bristling with indignation while he threatened Bausi with {{the handle of the}} butterfly net: ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Some {{say that}} I would be unpopular if I remove the fuel subsidies. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not seek popularity", he said.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and {{proceeded}} to hint {{that it would be}} advisable for him to go below now and take a rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bertha," [...] he said, [...] "you know I did {{not mean}} any thing {{personal}} to the bishop in what <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like bishops; I {{think there is no}} use in them; but I have no objection to him personally; I think him an agreeable man; not at all a bore. Just put it right, Bertha. But I tell you what, Bertha, I cannot go to church here. Lord Culloden does not go, and he is a very religious man. He is the man I most agree with on these matters. I am a free-church man, and there is on end of it. I cannot go this afternoon. I do not approve of the whole thing. It is altogether against my conscience. What I mean to do, if I can manage it, is to take a real long walk with the Campians." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I Love You" [...] debuted at 43 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for {{the week}} of July 31, 1999. [...] "I Love You" [...] reached No. 1 on the Country Charts in late 1999 and {{remained}} there for five consecutive weeks until it was knocked off by When <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do</b> by Clint Black and Lisa Hartman Black. It is also McBride's biggest country hit to date. The song also charted at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 21 on the Adult Contemporary tracks. [...] "I Love You" [...] is McBride's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, and was her first entry as a solo artist on the Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
5000|$|Out Stealing Horses has double {{meanings}} and {{two sets of}} twins. When asked “How did the Nazi Occupation of Norway translate into the plot of your novel?” Mr. Petterson responded “Well, like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not plan, so that double meaning came up when I needed it. That is disappointing to some readers, I know. But for me it shows the strength of art. It is like carving out a sculpture from some material. You {{have to go with}} the quality of the material and not force upon it a form that it will not yield to anyway. That will only look awkward. Early in the book, in the 1948 part, I let the two fathers (of my main characters, Jon and Trond) have a problem with looking at each other. And I wondered, why is that? So I thought, well, it’s 1948, only three years after the Germans left Norway. It has to be something with the war. And then I thought, shit, I have to write about the war. You see, I hate research.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Later, in SOHH.com's Pre VMA Interview, Ludacris {{was asked}} if the song was self-referential. Ludacris replied, [...] "Man, {{somebody}} misquoted me talking about...they misquoted me saying it was about me. What I was telling them was that I devote {{a lot of information}} about myself, and I think they're taking that in. I'm not battling myself on the record, that's ridiculous. What happens is {{you got a lot of}} people taking subliminal shots, but nobody ever says my name. I'm not for sure, so that record is like my way of taking subliminal shots right back. Don't get it misquoted, don't get it messed up. That's basically what it is man. It's like, you know, like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> devote a lot of information about myself on there. I started to wreck it up by saying I'm the best, and there's nothing you could do about it. say I've never done this I've never done that, so you know when you look into it, it's a lot more records where it comes from on the album, September 26, Release Therapy, where it's the most personal album I've done. It's nothing but honesty so you can criticize it all you want to but at the end of the day you got to respect it cause I'm coming straight from the heart. I'm just telling the truth, and that's all you gotta know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly! <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand." [...] The {{feeling of}} having scored a point made Derek {{feel a little}} better. [...] "I admit it. Your {{behaviour}} is incomprehensible. Where did you meet this fellow?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand, and he {{said what}} he wanted was my true name, for he guessed I picked up this one since I stole my last chickens. They all laughed loudly at that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, miss, my {{brother-in-law}} brought it home, {{and told me}} it was just a scrap that was left over, and he was free to have, though <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wonder the lady did not want to keep it in case of an accident happening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} Barton, {{his voice}} sinking to {{a tone of}} reluctant horror--"well, your poor friend was murdered! That's what <b>I</b> meant when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not blame the jury; they could have given no other verdict than they did on the evidence of my partner." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1914, the World War I {{forced him}} {{returned}} to Germany. His records show: When I {{had to leave}} Paris, and I {{had to be a}} soldier, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not go against the country where I had acted The French had my house and things steal. Yet I never felt a hatred against them.|$|R

60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{desire to}} demean {{myself in the}} world, both as becometh {{a man and a}} Christian.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} this {{too much for}} twelve hours, if the {{intellectual}} character of the entertainment was correspondingly high.|$|R
2500|$|... "Some have {{stumbled}} {{over the fact}} that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not claim to be a prophet; and they have asked, Why is this? I have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I am the Lord's messenger... Early in my youth I was asked several times, Are you a prophet? I have ever responded, I am the Lord's messenger. I know that many have called me a prophet, but I have made no claim to this title." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't, {{but that}} doesn't count," [...] {{answered}} Harry. [...] "We {{have to follow}} it, anyway. I remember when I got my first deer. Dad was with me, and before I fired he asked if I thought I could hit it where <b>I</b> wanted. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{and he told me}} to make sure, because if the beast got away with a bullet in it I'd have to trail it until it dropped." [...] He stopped with a significant laugh. [...] "As it happened, we followed it close on three hours, through the thickest kind of bush, and--I wasn't so big then--it was mighty hard work {{to get back to the}} ranch afterward." ...|$|R
5000|$|During an {{appearance}} on Good Morning America on August 30, 2016, Lochte said his claim of being held up at gunpoint was a [...] "very big mistake," [...] but regarding the ensuing scandal, [...] "I think it's everyone blowing this way out of proportion. I think that's what happened." [...] Regarding his claim that a gun was held to his head, he stated, [...] "Like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> lie about that one part." [...] {{and that it was}} made while still intoxicated the next day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am full of {{imaginary}} tortures,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} <b>I</b> {{could be any}} more uncomfortable if they were real ones. What must <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{to get rid of}} them?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Four or {{five weeks}} later, Al {{comes over to}} me and says, When {{are you going to do}} the next fold-in? And <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> have another fold-in. That was it! So he said, Come on, you can come up with {{something}} else. I wracked my brain, and the only thing I could come up with was Nixon face was hidden within curtain folds. That one really set the tone for what the cleverness of the fold-ins has to be. It couldnt just be bringing someone from the left to kiss someone on the right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see where}} the joke comes in there either!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel {{particularly}} pleased with him for saying such things. He laid {{his hand on my}} arm, and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} didn't mean to shoot Mr. Stubbs," [...] said Toby, with {{moistening}} {{eyes as he}} spoke of his pet, [...] "an' I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{to you in the}} woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he said. [...] "I say, I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> about lying. <b>I</b> {{was rather}} sick {{that you should}} think I wrote that rot you showed me. I hope you don't mind." ...|$|R

[...] "He could give you an account of them," [...] said he, [...] "but Lord Marischal has given the true {{character}} of the Prince, and certified under his hand to the people of England what a scoundrel he is {297} [...] . The Prince had the canaille of Scotland to assist him, thieves, robbers, and the like. [...] "' ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} German, but Mrs. Colesworthy knows the language well, and, {{stepping up to}} the man, she said (she afterward told me {{the meaning of the}} words that passed between them): [...] "Are you Dr. Hildstein?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, Sir John; but, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} {{we should all be}} told until the blow is ready to be struck, as they would be afraid that some one might inform against them, if time and {{opportunity}} were granted them." ...|$|R
6000|$|De Stancy entered saying, 'I have ridden across for ten minutes, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would <b>do,</b> {{to know if}} {{everything}} is easy and straightforward for you. There will be time {{enough for me to}} get back and prepare if I start shortly. Well?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well!' cried Tom, 'I {{am glad to}} hear it; I am overjoyed to hear it. I am {{sure there}} is not, when you say so in that manner. You won't take it ill, John, that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> just now!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I can't {{say that}} I forgive her. How {{is a man}} to forgive such treatment? If <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> you wouldn't believe me. I will keep out of her way, {{and that will be}} better for her than {{forgiving}} her." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of the twenty-first of June, we were awakened and {{notified}} that the Azores islands were in sight. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not take any interest in islands at three o'clock in the morning. But another persecutor came, and then another and another, and finally believing that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in peace, I got up and went sleepily on deck. It was five and a half o'clock now, and a raw, blustering morning. The passengers were huddled about the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators, and all were wrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitiless gale and the drenching spray.|$|R
