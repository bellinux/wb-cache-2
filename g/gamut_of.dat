Of particular significance {{was the work of}} National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E

The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP and Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E

5|$|The diverse {{linguistic}} and religious ethnicities that are native to Karnataka, combined with their long histories, have contributed immensely to the varied cultural {{heritage of the}} state. Apart from Kannadigas, Karnataka is home to Tuluvas, Kodavas and Konkanis. Minor populations of Tibetan Buddhists and tribes like the Soligas, Yeravas, Todas and Siddhis also live in Karnataka. The traditional folk arts cover the entire <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> music, dance, drama, storytelling by itinerant troupes, etc. Yakshagana of Malnad and coastal Karnataka, a classical dance drama, {{is one of the}} major theatrical forms of Karnataka.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} tetra-chroma {{display unit}} that has, {{in contrast to}} the contemporary trichromatic displays, four primary colors. Extra fourth cyan light allows better reproduction not only region of cyan colors but also, thanks to advanced position of green primary light, orange and yellow colors. These both regions are printable through modern inkjet printers. Colorimetric driving is discussed in detail and also reproduction on the basis of spectral matching isn’t omitted. An aim is to give for graphic designer or photographer solution that make easier preparation of their art work from the color accuracy point of view. Tetra-chroma display unit offers high quality soft-proofing. 1 Color <b>gamuts</b> <b>of</b> displays and printers Position of contemporary three display primaries (in terms of chromaticity diagram) is given by compromise to cover with the given reproduction triangle the area of the most frequently occurred colors. As for green primary light in contemporary reproductive triangle, {{in contrast to the}} blue and red primary, is the most compromisingly located to achieve satisfactory reproduction of yellows as well as cyans. Due to this compromise, cyans and orange-yellows that are achievable in printing are not reproducible by the contemporary trichromatic display systems. This leads into poor function of soft-proofing – simulation of printed colors on the monitor [1].

50|$|As in the {{majority}} of Cage's compositions from the 1940s, the music of The Seasons is based on a predefined proportion. In this case the proportion is 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, and it governs not only the construction of individual movements, but also the proportions of the entire work, roughly defining the relative lengths of the movements. The compositional technique involves using <b>gamuts</b> <b>of</b> sounds, i.e. predefined sonorities (single notes, chords, aggregates); Cage started developing this approach in The Seasons, and later perfected it in String Quartet in Four Parts and Concerto for Prepared Piano.|$|R

25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} chromaticities {{visible to}} the average person. These are shown in color and this region is called the <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> human vision. The <b>gamut</b> <b>of</b> all visible chromaticities on the CIE plot is the tongue-shaped or horseshoe-shaped figure shown in color. The curved edge of the gamut is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure hue of a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} the gamut is called the line of purples. These colors, although they are on the border of the gamut, have no counterpart in monochromatic light. Less saturated colors appear in the interior of the figure with white at the center.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{the color}} balance of {{illumination}} in Degrees Kelvin {{has been of}} significant importance due to color sensitivity of film. Today, digital cameras including camera phones have an automatic white balance setting that reduces the importance of illumination color balance over film cameras. However, with the relatively fast pace of change of fluorescent and now light emitting diode (LED) illumination including camera strobes, the quality of light measured by Rendering Index (Ra) may be of more importance than Color Balance (Kelvin). Combining low rendering index values of some artificial light sources with the large color <b>gamuts</b> <b>of</b> inkjet printers versus traditional silver halide printers, increases the effects of color inconsistency and metamerism.

40|$|The problem <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> mapping is <b>of</b> {{interest}} in achieving an optimum color reproduction whenever a translation from one device (source) to another device (destination) is requested {{and the source}} gamut differs from destination gamut.

In order to map the out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> colors to the colors that can be reproduced on an output device, several mapping methods have been proposed. Most of them use a constan...|$|R
40|$|Image fusion is {{maintaining}} the spectral {{quality of the}} Multispectral (MS) image while retaining the spatial quality of the panchromatic image (PAN) image. Image fusion is a good alternative for increasing interpretability of MS image by inserting spatial information from PAN image to MS image. For the image fusion traditional IHS (intensity, hue and saturation) have been used, but this leads to out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> problem. Out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> leads to color distortion and contrast reduction in the resultant fused image. In this paper improved nonlinear IHS image fusion is used, which solves the out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> problem. But, due to the large intensity differences between PAN image and MS image, leads to color distortion. This paper proposes and implemented adding spatial information from PAN image to MS image rather than conventional intensity substitution. DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transformation) is used for getting spatial information from PAN image that {{will be added to}} MS image. This solves the color distortion due to large intensity difference between MS and PAN image and preserves spectral quality of MS image in the fused image.

50|$|While {{processing}} {{a digital}} image, {{the most convenient}} color model used is the RGB model. Printing the image requires transforming the image from the original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors from the RGB which are out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> must be somehow converted to approximate values within the CMYK space gamut. Simply trimming only the colors which are out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> to the closest colors in the destination space would burn the image. There are several algorithms approximating this transformation, {{but none of them}} can be truly perfect, since those colors are simply out of the target device's capabilities. This is why identifying the colors in an image which are out <b>of</b> <b>gamut</b> in the target color space as soon as possible during processing is critical for the quality of the final product.|$|R

5000|$|Six Melodies is a {{collection}} of six pieces for violin and keyboard instrument by John Cage. It was composed in 1950, shortly after Cage completed his String Quartet in Four Parts. The work uses the same techniques: the gamut technique and the nested rhythmic proportions. First, a fixed number of sonorities (single tones, intervals and aggregates) is prepared, each created independently of the other. These sonorities are called <b>gamuts.</b> Sequences <b>of</b> <b>gamuts</b> are then used to create melodies with harmonic backgrounds that are in no way connected to functional harmony, which Cage sought to avoid. The collection <b>of</b> <b>gamuts</b> used in Six Melodies is nearly identical to the one used in the String Quartet (Cage called Six Melodies [...] "a postscript" [...] to that work). The structure of each piece, and that of each phrase, is defined by the same rhythmic pattern: 3 1/2, 3 1/2, 4, 4, 3, 4. The violinist is instructed in the score to play without vibrato and with minimum weight on the bow.|$|R
