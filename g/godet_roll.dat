40|$|Nanostructured {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) /silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) hybrid {{nanoparticles}} exhibit a high-potential for reinforcement of polymers. In the present investigation, silicon carbide (β-SiC) nanoparticles (~ 30 [*]nm) were sonochemically coated on acicular silicon nitride (~ 100 [*]nm[*]×[*] 800 [*]nm) particles {{to increase the}} thermal and mechanical properties of Nylon- 6 nanocomposite fibers. To produce Nylon- 6 /(SiC/Si 3 N 4) nanocomposite fibers, we have followed a two-step process. In the first step, SiC nanoparticles were coated on Si 3 N 4 nanorods using a sonochemical method and Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide surfactant. In the second step, the SiC coated Si 3 N 4 hybrid nanoparticles were blended with Nylon- 6 polymer and extruded {{in the form of}} nanocomposite polymer fibers. The nanocomposite fibers were uniformly stretched and stabilized using a two-set <b>Godet</b> <b>roll</b> machine. The diameters of the extruded neat Nylon- 6 and SiC/Si 3 N 4 /Nylon- 6 nanocomposite fibers were measured using a scanning electron microscope and then tested for their tensile and thermal properties. These results were compared with the neat Nylon- 6 polymer fibers. These results clearly indicate that the as-prepared nanocomposite polymer fibers are much higher in tensile strength (242 %) and Young’s modulus (716 %) as compared to the neat polymer fibers...|$|E
