40|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} for the school children to take the pure <b>milk</b> especially the <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> every day because of the unpleasant taste and smell of the <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> are not so good. Besides, the pure milk has a short life time. It is difficult to store the <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> in {{a long period of}} time at room temperature. The solution for this problem is change the <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> from liquid form into the chewable milk tablet that can be easily consume by the school children. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> in the form of tablet formulation will increase the shelf life of the product. Therefore, the chewable <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> tablet can be stored in {{a long period of time}}, convenience, and suitable for distribution to remote areas.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} Lactoperoxidase system (LPS) alone and in combination with pasteurisation, on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) ATTC 7644 in <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese during a shelf life of 10 days at 4 °C. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> was inoculated with LM ATTC 7644 and divided into two samples, one the control and Lactoperoxidase (LP) was activated in the other sample. Both the control and LP activated samples were kept at ambient temperature for 6 h. After 6 h the control and LP activated samples were again divided into two and one of the respective samples was pasteurised at 72 °C for 15 s. All the four samples were analysed for LM ATTC 7644 immediately after LP activation at 0 h, after 6 h of LP activation and after pasteurisation. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese was made with all four samples, i. e. control raw, control pasteurised, LP activated raw and LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> and analysed for LM ATTC 7644 on days 1, 2, 5, and 10. Six hours after LP activation the mean LM ATTC 7644 count for the LP activated milk decreased by log 0. 5 cfu/ml where as the LM ATTC 7644 for the control increased by log 0. 5 cfu/ml. The reduction of LM ATTC 7644 count in LP activated milk when compared to the control shows that <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> lactoperoxidase is capable of reducing L. monocytogenes when stored at ambient temperatures. Furthermore, LM ATTC 7644 count in LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> decreased by log 1. 1 cfu/ml more, compared to the control pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> Therefore, pasteurisation together with LP activation may be more effective than pasteurisation alone in controlling the growth of L. monocytogenes in <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> For the control raw <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese on day 10, the LM ATTC 7644 count was 90 % less than on first day of storage. The LP activated raw <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese count followed a similar trend to the control raw <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese, and reached levels of log 2. 9 cfu/g {{on the last day of}} storage. The control pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese LM ATTC 7644 count on day 10 was 92 % lower compared to day 1 where as the LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese LM ATTC 7644 count was 98 % less than on day 1. The results of this study indicate that the activation of the LPS significantly (p≤ 0. 05) decreased the LM ATTC 7644 count in <b>goat</b> <b>milk,</b> during a period of 6 h. Combined pasteurisation and LP activation had a synergistic effect on the LM ATTC 7644 count in <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> The LM ATTC 7644 count declined in cottage cheese made from both control and LP activated <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> A greater decrease was observed in LP activated pasteurised <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese over the storage period of 10 days at 4 °C. This combination may be used to reduce the multiplication of LM ATTC 7644 for production of safer products like <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> cottage cheese.

40|$|<b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> and its {{products}} {{have a significant}} role in human nutrition in many developing countries and some developed countries. <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> feeds more people in developing countries than cow milk. It is also useful as a food for people with cow milk allergies and gastrointestinal disorders. In developed countries, <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> is often perceived as ‘healthier’ than cow milk and possibly for this reason has a growing market. However, its characteristic goaty flavour is a barrier to increased consumption. Prior research has shown that β-cyclodextrin, which can trap small hydrophobic molecules, reduces <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> flavour due to certain free fatty acids (FFAs) when added at low concentrations to <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> and <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> products. This thesis explores the chemistry of this phenomenon. The concentration of FFAs responsible for <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> flavour was increased when a lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens was added. After addition of lipase, β-cyclodextrin was added at various times up to four hours. In all cases, FFA concentrations were increased by β-cyclodextrin, which at first sight is contrary to the idea that β-cyclodextrin reduces <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> flavour. A chemical model to explain this paradox was developed. It was proposed that β-cyclodextrin increased FFA concentration by a mass action effect, because as a trap for FFAs it was a chemical ‘sink’ so enhancing lipase activity. The method to measure FFA concentration in these experiments determines total FFAs, trapped or otherwise, so it was of major interest to show whether or not these FFAs remained trapped in β-cyclodextrin, in suspension or solution, and were therefore unavailable for odour/flavour sensing in the headspace above <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> This was tested by dynamic headspace analysis of four <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> treatments: milk; milk plus β-cyclodextrin; milk plus lipase; and milk plus lipase plus β-cyclodextrin. β-Cyclodextrin alone in milk reduced the profile of FFAs in the headspace, particularly of octanoic acid. Lipase greatly increased the headspace profile of FFAs as expected, but when β-cyclodextrin was also present, the profiles were even lower than for milk plus β-cyclodextrin. The reason for this apparent synergism is unknown, but it confirms why β-cyclodextrin is so effective in reducing <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> odour/flavour in spite of its mass action effect. The remarkable effectiveness of β-cyclodextrin in reducing <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> odour might also be due to preferential binding of goat-milk characterising branched chain fatty acids, like the potent 4 -methyloctanoic acid, but which are present in only low concentrations in <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> fat. A spectrophotometeric competition experiment with phenolphthalein showed that although branched chain fatty acids were more strongly bound by cyclodextrins including β-cyclodextrin than their straight chain geometric isomers (nonanoic for 4 -methyloctanoic acid), the difference was not marked. It was concluded that the remarkable effectiveness of β-cyclodextrin in reducing <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> flavour is best explained by its ability to bind nearly all FFAs...|$|R

The INVIMA technique was used to isolate L. monocytogenes; the species was confirmed by PCR. Results. The study showed that eight <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> providers of the zone neither had refrigeration nor pasteurized the milk. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 3 %; 15 % of the samples had other species of Listeria. The milk obtained from this zone contained the pathogen that may cause listeriosis in children less than 5 years of age, pregnant women, adults and immunologically compromised patients. Conclusions. This study shows the occurrence of this pathogen in <b>goat’s</b> <b>milk</b> and identified areas of risk for those people who drink <b>goat’s</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) in modifying the functionality of proteins in cows milk {{has been extensively}} studied but {{to a lesser degree}} for <b>goats</b> <b>milk.</b> On a comparative basis, the effect of cross-linking by mTGase on the physical properties of chemically acidified UHT <b>goats</b> <b>milk</b> and UHT cows milk has been performed. Transglutaminase treatment (3  U mTGase/g protein) of cows and <b>goats</b> <b>milk</b> was conducted at 40  °C for 60  min and terminated by heat treatment (85  °C/ 10  min) for enzyme inactivation. Gelation was induced by acidification with 40  g. L− 1 d-glucono-δ-lactone. Monitoring gel formation by oscillatory rheometry revealed that the incubation of milk with mTGase accelerated gelation, which occurred at a higher pH for cows milk in comparison to <b>goats</b> <b>milk.</b> Electrophoretic analysis revealed that under the same conditions, nearly 31 % of the cows milk proteins were cross-linked by the action of mTGase compared to only 9. 6 % of the <b>goats</b> <b>milk</b> proteins. This resulted in increased gel stiffness and reduced syneresis of the acid gels of both systems, but the extent of the effect depended on the milk source. In general, even with the mTGase treatment, <b>goats</b> <b>milk</b> gels were much weaker than cows milk gels. Despite this fact, the information gained in this study indicates that mTGase might be successfully applied in the production of acidified <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> products...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to find out}} the gross composition, nitrogen distribution, and selected mineral content in Surti <b>goat</b> <b>milk,</b> and its comparison was made between cow and buffalo milk. Materials and Methods: <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> samples of Surti breed and buffalo milk samples were collected during the period from July to January 2014 at Reproductive Biology Research Unit, Anand Agricultural University (AAU), Anand. Cow milk samples of Kankrej breed were collected from Livestock Research Station, AAU, Anand. Samples were analyzed for gross composition such as total solids (TS), fat, solid not fat (SNF), protein, lactose, and ash. Samples were also analyzed for nitrogen distribution such as total nitrogen (TN), non-casein nitrogen (NCN), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), and selected minerals content such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and chloride. Total five replications were carried out. Results: <b>Goat</b> <b>milk</b> had the lowest TS, fat, protein, and lactose content among all three types of milk studied in the presentinvestigation. On the other hand, the highest TS, fat, protein, and lactose content were found in buffalo milk. Buffalo milk had the highest SNF, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous content, which was followed by <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> and lowest in cow milk. The SNF, protein, TN, and calcium content of <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> were statistically non-significant (p 0. 05) than that of the cow milk as well as buffalo <b>milk.</b> The <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> had the highest ash and NCN content, which were followed by buffalo milk and lowest in cow milk. However,the differences in ash, NPN, and phosphorous content of three types of <b>milk</b> studied, viz., <b>goat</b> <b>milk,</b> cow milk, and buffalo milk were found statistically non-significant (p 0. 05) than that of the cow milk. The magnesium content of <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> was statistically non-significant (p 0. 05) than that of the buffalo milk as well as cow milk. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the study that the <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> has lower TS, fat, lactose, protein content, TN aswell as NPN but higher ash and NCN content compared to cow milk and buffalo <b>milk.</b> The <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> has lower calcium, phosphorous compared to buffalo milk while it has higher calcium, phosphorous compared to cow milk, and it has higher magnesium, chloride content compared to cow milk and buffalo milk...|$|R

In contrast to fermented <b>goat’s</b> <b>milk,</b> weaker inhibitory effect of fermented cow’s milk was observed only during the first phase of fermentation (incompletely fermented samples with higher pH values and lower number of viable cells of Bifidobacterium longum Bb- 46). The obtained results suggested that there was no correlation between changes of pH or CFU of Bifidobacterium longum Bb- 46 during fermentation and the inhibitory effect of fermented cow’s and <b>goat’s</b> <b>milk.</b> However, the results suggested some correlation between the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus growth and the content of SCFA and MCFA in fermented cow’s milk.

40|$|Fat {{is present}} in milk as {{droplets}} of triglycerides surrounded by a complex membrane derived from the mammary epithelial cell called milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). Although numerous studies have been published on human or bovine MFGM proteins, to date few studies exist on MFGM proteins from <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} thus to investigate the protein composition of the <b>goat</b> MFGM. <b>Milk</b> fat globule membrane proteins from <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> were separated by 6 % and 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and were Coomassie or periodic acid–Schiff stained. Most of MFGM proteins [mucin- 1, fatty acid synthase, xanthine oxidase, butyrophilin, lactadherin (MFG EGF- 8, MFG-E 8), and adipophilin] already described in cow milk were identified in <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> using peptide mass fingerprinting. In addition, lectin staining provided a preliminary characterization of carbohydrate structures occurring on MFGM proteins from <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> depending on αS 1 -casein genotype and lactation stage. We provide here first evidence of the presence of O-glycans on fatty acid synthase and xanthine oxidase from <b>goat</b> <b>milk.</b> A prominent difference between the cow and the goat species was demonstrated for lactadherin. Indeed, whereas 2 polypeptide chains were easily identified by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight analysis within bovine MFGM proteins, lactadherin from <b>goat</b> <b>milk</b> consisted of a single polypeptide chain. Another striking observation was the presence of caseins associated with MFGM preparations from <b>goat</b> <b>milk,</b> whereas virtually no caseins were found in MFGM extracts from bovine milk.

40|$|In this paper, {{changes in}} {{composition}} and contents of each fatty acid during fermentation with ABT- 2 culture were examined. The {{objective of this}} study was to determinate the increase of short (SCFA) and medium (MCFA) chain fatty acids in <b>goat's</b> and cow's <b>milk</b> during fermentation with ABT- 2 culture. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that higher contents of SCFA and MCFA are produced in <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> in comparison with cow's milk, during fermentation with ABT- 2 culture. Obtained results have shown that fermentation process in <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> is faster than in cow's milk. The number of viable cells of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus La- 5 and Bifidobacterium spp. was statistically greater in <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> than in cow's milk; consequently, pH value decreased more obviously in <b>goat's</b> <b>milk</b> than in cow's milk during whole fermentation process. Increase of SCFA and MCFA contents during fermentation was noted in both types of milk due to activity of bifidobacteria derived from ABT- 2 culture.
