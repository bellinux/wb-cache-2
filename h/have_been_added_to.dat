5|$|Some {{concerns}} were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield {{would not have}} been able to protect it during the higher speed ballistic reentry associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several solid rocket motors would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E

5|$|The Glidden Barn, located to {{the rear}} and east of the home, was thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the National Register of Historic Places when the {{original}} nomination for the house was approved in 1973. However, in the late 1990s, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency revealed that the nomination included only the house.

Those moves were approved by the Illinois Historic Sites Advisory Council in 2002 and the barn officially {{became part of the}} National Register.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 13th-century buildings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> several times, {{including a}} 15th-century great hall {{which has an}} arch-braced-collar truss roof.

5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E

5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Barthel {{referred}} {{to each of}} 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (recto) or v (verso) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line being discussed is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A (Tahua), side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer uses an idiosyncratic numbering system.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E

Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it in reverse {{to try to take}} miles off the odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E
5|$|Stoke sub Hamdon Priory is {{a complex}} of {{buildings}} and ruins which initially formed a 14th-century college for the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, and later {{was the site of}} a farm in Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, England.

The hall is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building, while the outbuildings and gateway are Grade II listed. The whole site has been scheduled as an ancient monument.

Since the change, a bar and TV screens <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995.
