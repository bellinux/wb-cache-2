The USMC method to determine body composition is two-fold: weight and body fat based. The Department of Defense (DOD) body fat estimate was developed based on data collected in 1984 from the Naval Health Research Center, San Diego. In this thesis, multiple linear regression is used to estimate body fat on the overweight sample from the 1984 data. This thesis applies the DOD body fat estimate on a sample of current USMC males and females. Models are also fit to estimate weight in the current active-duty USMC population using physical fitness attributes. We find that physical fitness does not predict weight well. Models fit to the overweight members of the 1984 data are biased, overpredicting body fat {{at the lower end}} of the spectrum and underpredicting at the higher end. When applied to the current male USMC sample, the DOD body fat estimate overpredicts body fat in 30 % of overweight males.

40|$|AbstractThe current U. S. Air Force's 30 -year plan (America's Air Force: A Call to the Future, July 2014) {{identifies}} Capability Development as a {{key area}} where existing practices fall short {{and need to be}} transformed in order to keep pace with new threats and the evolving operational environment. The strategy recognizes that traditional <b>DoD</b> <b>methods</b> of requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe, {{in a manner that is}} receptive to more frequent decision points and opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling activities. We believe that in order for the U. S. Air Force (and the defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to verify and validate that potential component implementations can interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the desired mission. In this paper, we outline a systems engineering approach using a dynamic, executable Model-Based Engineering methodology that we believe can help the government create the systems engineering environment required to implement agile capability development and finally reap its benefits...|$|R

As the rate of overseas currencies fluctuates on a daily basis, such fluctuations {{have an impact on the}} various expenditures that DOD makes. For budgeting purposes, DOD establishes foreign currency exchange rates to determine its O&M and MILPERS funding needs. During the fiscal year, DOD incurs expenditures at the actual exchange rate, which varies from the budgeted rate. For example, if the dollar depreciates in value, more dollars are needed to pay for goods and services than originally budgeted. Concerned about whether <b>DOD's</b> <b>method</b> for selecting foreign currency rates has produced realistic estimates in its budget submissions, Congress required DOD to consider alternative methods. Specifically, the Ronald W.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "From fiscal years 2001 through 2010, the Department of Defense's (DOD) spending for health care increased from about $ 19 billion to nearly $ 49 billion, representing approximately 6 percent of DOD's total spending in fiscal year 2001 and approximately 9 percent in fiscal year 2010. This health care spending primarily funds TRICARE [...] DOD's program that provides health care to active duty personnel and other beneficiaries, including retired servicemembers. According to DOD, the increase in its health care spending {{can be attributed to}} factors such as {{growth in the number of}} TRICARE beneficiaries. From fiscal years 2001 through 2010, the number of TRICARE beneficiaries increased by nearly 15 percent, from 8. 3 million to 9. 5 million beneficiaries. To help reduce DOD's health care costs, Congress passed section 707 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (section 707), which went into effect January 1, 2008. Section 707 prohibits employers with 20 or more employees from offering financial or other incentives to their employees who are eligible for TRICARE to not enroll in the employer-sponsored health insurance plan or to terminate such coverage. Historically, some employers offered financial or other incentives, which resulted in shifting much of the cost of providing health care for these employees from the employer to DOD. TRICARE beneficiaries who might have been offered incentives are retirees and their dependents under age 65 who have access to employer-sponsored health insurance in addition to TRICARE. When these employees accepted the incentives and did not enroll in the employer-sponsored health insurance, TRICARE became the primary payer and paid a greater share of the health care costs. As a result of section 707 's prohibition on such incentives, DOD projected, in April 2010, that there would be approximately $ 436 million in total TRICARE savings for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Congress requested that we examine how DOD developed its savings estimate and evaluated the effect of the law.

DOD in turn uses OMB's price in establishing the standard price {{to be used for}} a barrel of fuel for budgeting purposes by DOD fuel customers such as the military services. Because of the volatility of world petroleum prices, the standard price for a barrel of fuel included in the President's annual budget request for DOD may be lower or higher than the actual price established by the world market at any point in time after DOD's budget request is submitted to the Congress. During the fiscal year, DOD pays for fuel at the actual market rate, which typically varies from the budgeted rate. As a result, if the actual price of crude oil increases above the price DOD charges its customers, more dollars are needed to pay for fuel than originally budgeted. If the actual price is lower than what DOD charges its customers, DOD has more dollars than needed. Additionally, if DOD responds to increases in the world market crude oil prices by increasing the price it charges its customers above what they initially budgeted, the customers will have additional funding needs to pay their fuel bills.

40|$|The {{construction}} of levees along the Mississippi River [MR], {{beginning in the}} mid-to-late nineteenth century, have isolated the river along many segments from its floodplain. Sediment from the river is currently deposited in the hydrologically connected floodplain [HCF], the area between the channel margin at low water and the levees. Researchers have studied the amount and rates of sediment deposition along the Upper and Lower Mississippi River segments from the headwaters to Pool 22 and from the Ohio River to the delta; however, no such assessments have been undertaken along the Middle Mississippi River [MMR]. This study attempts to fill the knowledge gap by assessing sedimentation along three islands within the Middle Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge. On these islands two approaches were undertaken to assess sedimentation along the MMR’s HCF: dendrogeomorphology and the DEM of Difference [DoD] approach. The dendrogeomorphic approach uses tree-ring analyses to document and interpret geomorphic processes and the rates at which they are occurring. The DoD approach subtracts an older DEM from a newer DEM {{in order to see}} the change in elevation/depth over time. The geomorphology of the islands and then the entire MMR HCF (from the confluence of the Missouri River to Thebes, IL) were mapped. Using the sedimentation rates for the geomorphic landforms from the three study islands, the sedimentation rates and volumes for the aforementioned portion of the MMR’s HCF were estimated. The estimated volume of sediment was then compared to the MMR’s suspended sediment flux to determine how much of the suspended sediment was going into storage within the MMR’s HCF. The dendrogeomorphic and <b>DoD</b> <b>methods</b> for the study islands yielded average sedimentation rates of 13. 3 - 16. 9 mm year- 1 and 21. 5 - 80. 1 mm year- 1, respectively. The rates for the individual landforms on the islands using the dendrogeomorphic results ranged from 5. 2 mm year- 1 for the splay to 21. 8 mm year- 1 for the natural levee and splay, with a weighted average of 16. 6 mm year- 1 for the MMR HCF. Using these rates and the likely range of densities for the floodplain sediments, it is estimated that 4. 9 - 6. 6 million metric tons of sediment is accumulating within the MMR annually. This is approximately 5. 4 - 7. 4 % of the average annual suspended sediment load of the Mississippi River at St. Louis. This means that the MMR is a major sediment sink. If these relatively rapid rates of deposition continue, they have the potential to substantially reduce the HCF’s ability to convey and store flood water which will result in increased flood levels and, consequently, flood risk within the MMR’s levee protected floodplain in the coming decades...|$|R

The paper examines the history of PTSD, the preventive measures employed by Department of Defense (<b>DoD),</b> treatment <b>methods,</b> cost of treatments, and possible recommendations that could aid in alleviating the dangers facing family members with PTSD patients. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental condition common among war veterans. War veterans are susceptible to PTSD condition because of their military experiences in combats. They have either killed, narrowly escaped death, or witnessed someone die hence developing PTSD. Unfortunately, PTSD inhibits their ability to live a meaningful life after retirement. PTSD does not only affect the patient but also has an adverse impact on the health of other family members. The data in this research was obtained from analyzing DoD documents, health documents in public and private hospitals, online articles on PTSD, scholarly articles on PTSD, and medical journals on PTSD. The results indicate most of the war veterans with PTSD do not receive adequate healthcare to manage their conditions. Moreover, PTSD condition puts strains on available family resources since the victims have to be treated. There is a need for DoD to overhaul current policies regarding PTSD condition and the government to increase funds to ensure war veterans receive quality healthcare.

DOD also identified changes to contract requirements in response to legislative changes to the TRICARE pharmacy benefit. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2013 required DOD to implement a mail-order pilot for maintenance drugs for beneficiaries who are also enrolled in Medicare Part B. DOD officials incorporated this change in the requirements for the upcoming pharmacy services contract. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Department of Defense (DoD) manages {{programs}} of systems from concept through development to production with Joint Capability Areas (JCAs). JCAs are a standardized grouping of capabilities that enable DoD decision makers to allocate resources {{based on a}} programs contribution to joint operations. Additionally, the DoD has established Universal Joint Tasks (UJTs) {{to serve as a}} common language for describing functions a system performs across the four services. Similar to JCAs, a system performs one or more UJTs in support of the joint war fight. Although JCAs and UJTs are well described and understood by the joint community within the DoD, the <b>DoD</b> lacks a <b>method</b> for visualizing the links between program, JCAs, and UJTs at the enterprise level. Enterprise Architecting is an approach for analyzing an enterprise level system and developing candidate architectures for the enterprise to deliver value. Enterprise Architecture tools, specifically, the X-Matrix provides an opportunity for the DoD to visualize these links to ensure alignment of programs to JCAs and UJTs. Additionally, the X-Matrix enables DoD decision makers to understand potential gaps or unnecessary redundancies at the enterprise level. Given the current fiscal reality in the DoD, analysts must provide leaders with data based recommendations on systems to ensure that the DoD is being efficient with their limited resources. This modification of the X-Matrix enables the visualization of essential links between programs, the form of the enterprise, and the JCAs and UJTs, the function of the enterprise. It provides DoD leadership with a tool to visualize the impacts of resourcing decisions and potentially make better investments in programs to support the joint warfighter...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Defense (<b>DoD)</b> is researching <b>methods</b> {{to enhance}} energy {{security}} and reduce energy costs. The energy security of DoD installations {{relies on the}} commercial electricity grid. One method being considered to improve energy security and reduce energy costs is microgrids that include combinations of energy storage, energy sources, critical loads, and non-critical loads. A microgrids power demand {{and the benefits of}} a microgrid integrated with a power electronics enabled Energy Management System (EMS) is investigated in this thesis. The power demand of a single family household is analyzed. The peak power demand of the single family household displays the drawbacks of peak power demand on the commercial electricity grid and the installations receiving power from it. Drawbacks include reduced energy security due to blackouts and increased cost as a result of meeting the peak demand. One benefit of an EMS is its ability to island or continue supplying power to critical loads when the commercial electricity grid is lost. A second benefit is reduced power demand on the commercial electricity grid during peak power demand or on distributed resources (DR) while islanded by performing peak power control. The performance of peak power control by an EMS is demonstrated using a Simulink model and an experimental laboratory setup. The Simulink model and EMS functionality are validated with the laboratory experiments. The Simulink model is then used to demonstrate the reduction in peak power demand on the commercial electricity grid using an EMS on more complex loads such as motors and diode rectifiers. The Simulink model is also used to compare the power demand on the commercial electricity grid with and without the EMS. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{incompressible}} Newtonian liquid {{drops of}} density ρ, viscosity μ, and surface tension σ from a nozzle into air is studied using high-speed, high-resolution visualization and large-scale, high-accuracy computation. Two drastically different physical problems are considered: (1) formation of millimeter-sized drops from capillary tubes by dripping and (2) ejection of drops from drop-on-demand (DOD) ink-jet nozzles of 10 – 50 μm radius. Since both DOD drop formation and drop-air interface pinch-off occur over {{very short time}} periods, novel experimental techniques are developed to image drop dynamics occurring within 100 μs. The computational modeling techniques developed here are indispensable as many quantities of interest such as pressure and velocity fields within growing drops are typically unavailable from experiments. The powerful experimental and theoretical tools are used to advance <b>DOD</b> drop production <b>methods.</b> ^ Computational predictions are validated using experimental measurements and scaling theories describing local dynamics of liquid threads as they thin and pinch off. The interfaces of low-viscosity drops, where viscous forces remain negligible compared to surface tension and inertial forces, are shown to overturn before pinch-off {{for the first time}} by both experiment and computation. By contrast, moderate-viscosity drops undergo transitions from this potential flow (PF) scaling regime where viscous force is negligible to the inertial-viscous (IV) scaling regime where all three forces are important. The computed value of the minimum thread radius under IV scaling follows Eggers 2 ̆ 7 s universal solution, demonstrating heretofore unparalleled accuracy from simulations. Numerical results uncover when Eggers 2 ̆ 7 s solution ceases to be valid and probe the unexpected role played by viscosity in setting transitions from PF to IV regimes. ^ The combined experimental and computational approach is used to overcome an obstacle present since the advent of DOD ink-jet printing. The new approach allows, for the first time, formation of drops with radii much smaller than the radius of the nozzle from which they are produced. ^ Electric fields, due to deliberate voltage imposition or unwanted static charge accumulation, are well known to affect drop formation dynamics. Computations show that radial electric fields shorten the breakup length of low-viscosity liquid threads but have the opposite effect on high-viscosity threads. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{first on}} orbit measured {{data from the}} Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment (FTSCE). FTSCE is a space experiment housed within the 5 th Materials on the International Space Station Experiment (MISSE- 5). MISSE- 5 was launched aboard the Shuttle return to flight mission (STS- 114) on July 26, 2005 and deployed on {{the exterior of the}} International Space Station (ISS). The experiment will remain in orbit for nominally one year, after which it will be returned to Earth for post-flight testing and analysis. While on orbit, the experiment is designed to measure a 36 point current vs. voltage (IV) curve on each of the experimental solar cells, and the data is continuously telemetered to Earth. The experiment also measures the solar cell temperature and the orientation of the solar cells to the sun. A range of solar cell technologies are included in the experiment including state-of-the-art triple junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cells from several vendors, thin film amorphous Si and CuIn(Ga) Se 2 cells, and next-generation technologies like single-junction GaAs cells grown on Si wafers and metamorphic InGaP/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction cells. In addition to FTSCE, MISSE- 5 also contains a Thin-Film Materials experiment. This is a passive experiment that will provide data on the effect of the space environment on more than 200 different materials. FTSCE was initially conceived in response to various on-orbit and ground test anomalies associated with space power systems. The Department of Defense (<b>DoD)</b> required a <b>method</b> of rapidly obtaining on orbit validation data for new space solar cell technologies, and NRL was tasked to devise an experiment to meet this requirement. Rapid access to space was provided by the MISSE Program which is a NASA Langley Research Center program. MISSE- 5 is a completely self-contained experiment system with its own power generation and storage system and communications system. The communications system, referred to as PCSat, transmits and receives in the Amateur Radio band providing a node on the Amateur Radio Satellite Service. This paper presents an overview of the various aspects of MISSE- 5 and a sample of the first measured on orbit data...|$|R
40|$|For almost 70 years, {{actual costs}} of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) in the Department of Defense (DoD) have {{exceeded}} on average between 20 % and 506 % {{of their life}} cycle cost estimates, which are official expectations of actual program costs prior to completion. Despite numerous DoD acquisition reform efforts and implementation of sophisticated cost estimation techniques, this cost growth continues to exist. Accurate cost estimates are vital to the capital budgeting process for the DoD since {{they are used to}} set the affordability cap for each MDAP and across DoD Component weapon system program portfolios. Affordability is defined as the upper limit a DoD Component can allocate for a program without reducing costs or shifting resources between programs. To improve affordability in the <b>DoD,</b> a <b>method</b> that quantifies and adjusts for the persistent cost growth to enhance the accuracy of cost estimates is needed to promote more responsible and sustainable MDAP capital investment decisions. This thesis presents a simple yet powerful method of quantifying and correcting for systemic cost estimation risk in MDAPs to improve cost estimate accuracy and, consequently, affordability. Cost estimation risk is defined as the difference between estimated and actual MDAP costs (on average a deficit), and it consists of systemic and program-specific components. This dichotomized risk framework is similar to the one used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in which the growth rate in value of any one of a set of assets comprising a market in equilibrium is proportional to its systemic risk exposure to that market. In the CAPM, systemic risk aggregated risk from multiple economic factors - pervades the market and is unavoidable, and asset-specific risk is considered unpredictable due to idiosyncratic uncertainties. By analogy, the growth rate in cost estimates for a program belonging to the "market" of MDAPs is assumed proportional to that MDAP's systemic risk exposure to the market. Like in CAPM, systemic cost estimation risk - aggregated risk from 26 systemic factors identified in this thesis - pervades the market for MDAPs, as evidenced by historical cost overruns, and program-specific cost risk is considered unpredictable and best mitigated by program-dedicated professional cost estimators in the DoD and defense industry. From this analogy, the expected growth-beta relationship of CAPM may be adapted to determine for MDAPs the systemic cost risk-adjusted growth rates for the defense commodity classes of aircraft, electronics and software, missiles, ships, space and satellites, and vehicles. These classes are the same used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to segment defense commodities into distinct price index "baskets" based upon common inflation risks among commodities within each class. Based on this rationale, each MDAP is assumed to share systemic cost risk within its respective class; this risk is measured by beta in the expected growth-beta relationship. Defense commodity class beta values are calculated by linear regression of historical percentage cost estimate changes of member MDAPs with those of all MDAPs, and then averaging these beta values over the appropriate defense commodity class. Next, the expected cost estimate growth rate for any MDAP may be calculated by first estimating the future expected growth rate in all MDAPs using the arithmetic mean of historical annual cost estimate percentage changes, and then scaling this rate by the particular MDAP's systemic cost risk exposure - the defense commodity class beta value for which it is a member. Finally, the Systemic Risk Factor (SRF) for each defense commodity class is calculated from these growth rates and the forecast time horizon, adjusted for compounding effects over relatively longer time horizons, and then applied to current MDAP cost estimates to form systemic risk-adjusted cost estimates to improve affordability. This method was applied to an empirical retrospective case study using a set of cost data from six MDAPs, one from each commodity class, as a partial validation of the method. The results of this study show an overall 57 % enhancement in estimation accuracy when comparing the initial and SRF-adjusted MDAP cost estimates to the final estimates, indicating quantifying and adjusting for systemic cost risk can improve cost estimation accuracy. To show the effectiveness of this method on improving affordability, these six programs were combined to form a hypothetical acquisition portfolio and assessed for affordability over a five year period. While the unadjusted portfolio was not affordable four out of five years, the SRF-adjusted portfolio was affordable in all but the last year, illustrating the benefit of adjusting cost estimates for systemic risk. However, the benefits of improved cost estimate accuracy and affordability come at the cost of potentially over-budgeting for priority MDAPs thereby leaving less funds available for other, lower priority programs. Additionally, this method is not shown to be optimal in the sense of minimizing cost estimate errors to maximize affordability. Still, empirical results are promising and warrant further research into the idea of using SRFs to adjust life cycle cost estimates and ultimately improve MDAP affordability for the DoD. by David Petrucci.
