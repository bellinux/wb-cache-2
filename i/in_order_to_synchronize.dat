The exercise consisted of three events: a table top exercise (TTX) focused on pandemic influenza response, senior manager disaster response, and multinational involvement; a field training exercise (FTX) consisting of area security, entry control point, vehicle control point, convoy security, non lethal weapons, and weapons training; and a humanitarian civic action (HCA) focused on providing medical and dental assistance to the local population. During the exercise, the BFSB – as part of Task Force Kitgum – performed command and control operations in Kitgum, Uganda, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>synchronize</b> multinational forces conducting field training exercises and humanitarian civic assistance operations to enhance interoperability among participating forces. the 560 BFSB served as a joint and multinational task force headquarters of over 1000 army, navy, air force, marines and personnel from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This was the largest exercise of its kind in East Africa and the first test of a BFSB as a joint and multinational HQs.|$|E

Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. But it really shoulda been much better. If we had more time and we didn't {{have to deal with the}} situation of nobody talking".|$|E
2500|$|Series II of the Fairlight CMI (computer musical instrument) used dual 6809 CPUs and OS9, {{and also}} used one 6809 CPU per voice card.

A broad class of producer/consumer and reader/writer problems are well-suited to this model of concurrency. This pattern is commonly used in distributed systems requiring multi-threaded servers. In addition, client applications (such as windowing systems and network browsers), are increasingly employing active objects to simplify concurrent, asynchronous network operations...|$|R

The extraction algorithm is based on common speech recognition low-level features, such as MFCC and LPC. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> distinguish phonemes, three different classification techniques (SVM, GMM and MLP) have been used and their results are depicted in the paper. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In {{distributed}} {{signal processing}} systems, every node samples analog signals {{by its own}} AD converter. Sampling is controlled by autonomous clocks, that are generally not synchronizable. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> ensure <b>synchronized</b> operation among the different nodes of the distributed system, both the drift of these clocks, and the jitter of the sampling must be handled. This problem is investigated in this paper, and signal processing methods are proposed <b>to</b> guarantee the <b>synchronized</b> operation and <b>to</b> reduce {{the effect of the}} jitter. The proposed solution is based on low-level interpolation and resampling of the sampled signals. A realization of this method is demonstrated on a test-system...|$|R

40|$|SummaryCircadian clocks are {{synchronized}} by {{the natural}} day/night and temperature cycles. Our previous work demonstrated that synchronization by temperature is a tissue autonomous process, similar to synchronization by light.

Using luciferase imaging we demonstrate that brain clock neurons depend on signals from peripheral tissues <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> be <b>synchronized</b> by temperature. Reducing {{the function of the}} gene nocte in chordotonal organs changes their structure and function and dramatically interferes with temperature synchronization of behavioral activity. Other mutants known to affect the function of these sensory organs also interfere with temperature synchronization, demonstrating the importance of nocte in this process and identifying the chordotonal organs as relevant sensory structures.
