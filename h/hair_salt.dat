40|$|The {{management}} system {{of solid waste}} at Benowo landfill is using controled landfill. This process can pollute salt pond around this site because the leachate containing heavy metal, especially lead (Pb). Pb can enter salt consumer body through ingestion can cause some diseases. The purpose {{of this research was}} to observe the correlation between leachate lead (Pb) pollution at salt pond around Benowo Landfill to lead level on hair of salt consumer. This was an analytical observational research with cross sectional approach. The lead level in leachate at outlet WWT of Benowo landfills was 21. 83 mg/l. The lead level at salt pond in the north and the west of landfills radius + 100 m, + 800 m, + 1500 m was different. The lead level at consumer <b>hair</b> (<b>salt</b> from salt ponds near Benowo landfill) was different to the comparison group (p = 0. 039). It is concluded that the leachate drained into water was ineligible refer to Minister of Environment Decree No. 51 /MENLH/ 10 / 1995 about Liquid Waste Quality Standard for Industrial Activities, and it had polluted the salt ponds in radius + 100 m in the north and the west of landfills, also in radius + 800 m in the north of landfills.

40|$|Mature stomata of four {{mangrove}} taxa {{of different}} families reveal three distinct types of stomatal complex on abaxial surfaces, such as diacytic (in Acanthus ilicifolius), anomocytic (in Aegialitis rotundifolia and Xylocarpus granatum), and paracytic (in Ceriops decandra). In transverse section, {{there is a}} beak-like cuticular outgrowth overarching the stomatal pore either at the outer side or at both the outer and inner side of the stomatal pore. The guard-cell mother-cell divides once longitudinally to form two guard cells {{and the development of}} subsidiary cells is not at all concerned with the former cell. Ontogenetically it is revealed that the development of a stomatal complex in these investigated taxa is aperiginous (X. granatum) and periginous (A. ilicifolius, A. rotungifolia and C. decandra). Glandular <b>hairs</b> (<b>salt</b> gland) are present only at the adaxial surface of leaves in A. ilicifolius and A. rotundifolia. In A. ilicifolius it is pear-shaped and protrudes from the normal epidermal layer while in A. rotundifolia it is present within a cup-shaped crypt in the epidermal layer. In both the cases, the ontogenic pathway is similar, at least up to the three-celled stage, but at maturity, the morphology is quite different. The salt gland consists of 4 – 8 radiating terminal cells, two stalk cells and one basal cell...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{authors of}} the present study have {{investigated}} six halophyte species from Chenopodiaceae family. These species have been harvested from different saline habitats. Some interesting and intriguing features such as successive cambia phenomenon, succulence, <b>salt</b> <b>hairs,</b> tracheids, fleshy tissues and peculiar foliar anatomy structures have been noticed. These aspects are discussed in relation to their ecological, adaptive and evolutionary significance...|$|R
50|$|H. urva is {{generally}} grey in color, {{with a broad}} white stripe on its neck extending from its cheeks to its chest. Its throat is steel-gray with white ends of its <b>hair,</b> rendering a <b>salt</b> and pepper appearance. Its hind feet possess hairy soles. Its tail is short and homogeneously colored with a fairer tip. The body of the crab-eating mongoose is 36 - 52 cm in length, and 1 - 2.3 kg in weight.|$|R
40|$|While {{members of}} the genus Oryza are very {{sensitive}} to salinity, salt concentrations as high as 20 % of that of seawater had no adverse effect on the growth of the tropical wild rice (Porteresia coarctata Tateoka) in experiments undertaken in a greenhouse in the UK. P. coarctata plants accumulated sodium and chloride ions in the leaves, but maintained a Na: K ratio as low as 0. 7, even after 6 weeks of growth in 25 % artificial seawater (ASW) where the Na: K ratio was 34. This ability to maintain a high K: Na ratio in the leaves is in part a consequence of the secretion of ions from the leaves. The ratio of Na: K in the secreted salt (more than 5 for plants growing in 25 % ASW) is similar to that measured by X-ray microanalysis in the vacuoies of hairs found in folds of the adaxial surface of the leaf lamina, suggesting that the secretions emanate from these <b>hairs.</b> The <b>salt</b> secreted by the hairs {{is an important factor in}} the salt-balance of the leaves: the consequences of these findings for the transfer of salt-tolerance from this species into cultivated rice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Bicellular microhairs {{are present}} on the {{surfaces}} of leaves of grasses {{with the exception of}} the Pooideae. In some halophytic grasses, these glandular <b>hairs</b> secrete <b>salt,</b> suggesting the intriguing question 'can the microhairs of grasses that do not normally encounter salinity also secrete salt?' Microhairs were counted in replicas of the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves of various ages of maize plants growing either in the absence of salt or in the presence of 40, 80 or 120 mM NaCl. The number of microhairs per unit area of adaxial leaf surface of the youngest leaf almost doubled as the salinity increased from zero to 120 mM NaCl; on the abaxial surface, the number of microhairs increased by 50 %. Spraying this leaf with benzyl adenine (BA) caused, when averaged across salinities and surfaces, a 32 % increase in the number of microhairs. Salinity reduced leaf area but in all the salinity treatments, spraying with BA increased the total number of microhairs per leaf. Washing leaves of plants provided estimates of the loss of salt from those leaves. There were large differences between the Na:K molar ratios in the washing solution and the leaf tissue, indicating a high selectivity for sodium over potassium for loss from the leaf. BA did not influence the efficiency of salt loss, expressed per microhair, at any salinity level, but did increase loss per leaf. Thus, BA increased salt loss from plants due to its influence on the number of microhairs and leaf area, but not due to its effect on the efficiency of the secretion process per se...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Root {{colonization}} and mitigation of NaCl {{stress on}} wheat seedlings were studied by inoculating seeds with Azospirillum lipoferum JA 4 ∷ngfp 15 tagged {{with the green}} fluorescent protein gene (gfp). Colonization of wheat roots under 80 and 160 mM NaCl stress was similar to root colonization with this bacterial species under nonsaline conditions, that is, single cells and small aggregates were mainly located in the root <b>hair</b> zone. These <b>salt</b> concentrations had significant inhibitory effects on development of seedlings, but not on growth in culture of gfp-A. lipoferum JA 4 ∷ngfp 15. Reduced plant growth (height and dry weight of leaves and roots) under continuous irrigation with 160 mM NaCl was ameliorated by bacterial inoculation with gfp-A. lipoferum JA 4 ∷ngfp 15. Inoculation of plants subjected to continuous irrigation with 80 mM NaCl or to a single application of either NaCl concentration (80 or 160 mM NaCl) did not mitigate salt stress. This study indicates that, under high NaCl concentration, inoculation with modified A. lipoferum reduced the deleterious effects of NaCl; colonization patterns on roots were unaffected and the genetic marker did not induce undesirable effects on {{the interaction between the}} bacterium and the plants...|$|R
40|$|The sensory {{epithelium}} of {{the chick}} cochlea contains only two cell types, hair cells and supporting cells. We developed methods to rapidly dissect out the sensory epithelium {{and to prepare}} a detergent-extracted cytoskeleton. High salt treatment of the cytoskeleton leaves a "hair border", containing actin filament bundles of the stereocilia still attached to the cuticular plate. On SDS-PAGE stained with silver the intact epithelium is seen to contain {{a large number of}} bands, the most prominent of which are calbindin and actin. Detergent extraction solubilizes most of the proteins including calbindin. On immunoblots antibodies prepared against fimbrin from chicken intestinal epithelial cells cross react with the 57 - and 65 -kD bands present in the sensory epithelium and the cytoskeleton. It is probable that the 57 -kD is a proteolytic fragment of the 65 -kD protein. Preparations of stereocilia attached to the overlying tectorial membrane contain the 57 - and 65 -kD bands. A 400 -kD band is present in the cuticular plate. By immunofluorescence, fimbrin is detected in stereocilia but not in the <b>hair</b> borders after <b>salt</b> extraction. The prominent 125 A transverse stripping pattern characteristic of the actin cross-bridges in a bundle is also absent in hair borders suggesting fimbrin as the component that gives rise to the transverse stripes. Because the actin filaments in the stereocilia of hair borders still remain as compact bundles, albeit very disordered, there must be an additional uncharacterized protein besides fimbrin that cross-links the actin filaments together...|$|R
40|$|Root hair {{development}} in plants {{is controlled by}} many genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. A number of genes {{have been shown to}} be important for root <b>hair</b> formation. Arabidopsis <b>salt</b> overly sensitive 4 mutants were originally identified by screening for NaCl-hypersensitive growth. The SOS 4 (Salt Overly Sensitive 4) gene was recently isolated by map-based cloning and shown to encode a pyridoxal (PL) kinase involved in the production of PL- 5 -phosphate, which is an important cofactor for various enzymes and a ligand for certain ion transporters. The root growth of sos 4 mutants is slower than that of the wild type. Microscopic observations revealed that sos 4 mutants do not have root hairs in the maturation zone. The sos 4 mutations block the initiation of most root hairs, and impair the tip growth of those that are initiated. The root hairless phenotype of sos 4 mutants was complemented by the wild-type SOS 4 gene. SOS 4 promoter-β-glucuronidase analysis showed that SOS 4 is expressed in the root hair and other hair-like structures. Consistent with SOS 4 function as a PL kinase, in vitro application of pyridoxine and pyridoxamine, but not PL, partially rescued the root hair defect in sos 4 mutants. 1 -Aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid treatments promoted root hair formation in both wild-type and sos 4 plants, indicating that genetically SOS 4 functions upstream of ethylene and auxin in root hair development. The possible role of SOS 4 in ethylene and auxin biosynthesis is discussed...|$|R
6000|$|But it is {{one thing}} to decide to go back, and another to do it. At the little station I studied time-tables, and I could not get to England again without a delay of half a day. Somewhere I must wait. I did not want to wait where there was any {{concourse}} of people. I decided to stay in the inn by the station for the intervening six hours, and get some sleep before I started upon my return, but when I saw the bedroom I changed my plan and went down out of the village by a steep road towards the shore. I wandered down through the rain and spindrift to the very edge of the sea, and there found a corner among the rocks a little sheltered from the wind, and sat, inert and wretched; my lips <b>salt,</b> my <b>hair</b> stiff with <b>salt,</b> and my body wet and cold; a miserable defeated man. For I had now an irrational and entirely overwhelming conviction of defeat. I saw as if I ought always to have seen that I had been pursuing a phantom of hopeless happiness, that my dream of ever possessing Mary again was fantastic and foolish, and that I had expended all my strength in vain. Over me triumphed a law and tradition more towering than those cliffs and stronger than those waves. I was overwhelmed by a sense of human weakness, of the infinite feebleness of the individual man against wind and wave and the stress of tradition and the ancient usages of mankind.
