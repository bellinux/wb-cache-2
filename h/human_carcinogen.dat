5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for {{people who work in}} mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a <b>human</b> <b>carcinogen</b> by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Guideline values have been created for exposure, but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50µg/m3 and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50µg/m3. It is thought that the guidelines on {{exposure levels}} could be exceeded for short periods of time without significant health effects on the general population.|$|E

40|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} several antineoplastic {{drugs in}} Group 1 (<b>human</b> <b>carcinogens),</b> among which chlorambucil, cyclophospha-mide (CP) and tamoxifen, Group 2 A (probable <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens),</b> among which cisplatin, etoposide, N-ethyl-and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and Group 2 B (possible <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens),</b> among which bleomycins, merphalan and mitomycin C. The {{widespread use of}} these mutagenic/ carcinogenic drugs {{in the treatment of}} cancer has led to anxiety about possible genotoxic hazards to medical personnel handling these drugs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate work environment contamination by antineoplastic drugs in a hospital in Central Italy and to assess the genotoxic risks associated with antineoplastic drug handling.

5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected <b>human</b> <b>carcinogen.</b> For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible <b>human</b> <b>carcinogen</b> based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

40|$|The NTP {{lifetime}} rodent bioassay (LRB) is the “gold standard” {{for predicting}} human carcinogenicity. Unfortunately, little attempt {{has been made}} to validate it against human carcinogenicity. Here we show that the extremely limited data available do not support either of the two common interpretations of LRB results. If a risk-avoidance interpretation is used where any positive result in a sex/species combination is considered positive, 9 of the 10 known <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> tested are positive, but an implausible 22 % of all chemicals are positive. If a less risk averse interpretation is used where only chemicals positive in both rats and mice are considered positive, only 3 of the 6 known <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> tested are positive. In either interpretation, some known <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> are not positive in the LRB, potentially allowing widespread human exposure to misidentified chemicals. Improving the predictive accuracy of the LRB and other tests for human carcinogenicity requires that test results be validated against the known human carcinogenicity of chemicals. This will require redirecting available resources from screening chemicals to validating carcinogenicity tests as well as a substantial investment in epidemiology to identify more known <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> and presumed <b>human</b> non-carcinogens...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{selected}} {{aspects of}} progress and setbacks in cancer risk assessment and prevention during the four decades since the founding in 1947 of the Institute of Environmental Medicine at the New York University Medical Center. The period {{has been marked by}} substantial gains in quantifying the risks posed by exposures to known <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> such as tobacco and ionizing radiation. By contrast, the search for sensitive and specific laboratory screens for <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> has met setbacks, and epidemiological data still are needed to monitor the adverse effects of environmental exposures. The determination of acceptable levels of exposure to potential <b>human</b> <b>carcinogens</b> remains a formidable task, one for which no scientific framework yet exists. Future challenges in cancer risk assessment include the validation and use of biological markers of exposure and effective monitoring of risk among exposed populations. Future challenges in cancer prevention include the elimination of tobacco consumption and the acquisition of knowledge needed to prevent nutritionally and hormonally related cancers such as cancers of the bowel, prostate, and breast...|$|R
