500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there and I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

500|$|Pound taught Hemingway {{to write}} sparingly. Pound wrote {{to him that}} [...] "anything put {{on top of the}} subject is BAD... The subject is always {{interesting}} enough without blankets." [...] Hemingway would write in A Moveable Feast (published posthumously in 1964), [...] "If I started to write elaborately, like someone presenting or introducing something, I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written." [...] In Our Time was written during the author's experimentation phase, his first attempts towards a minimalist style. The prose in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] is sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and by employing simple sentences and diction– techniques he learned writing for newspapers– the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality, explains Benson. The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound's imagist style, bringing to prose narrative the stripped-down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as [...] "In a Station of the Metro". Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway's prose to Pound's poetry, writing, [...] "Hemingway's terse, tight-lipped, tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|The Government Accountability Office ("GAO") {{published}} its own {{report in}} November 2005 (herein, the [...] "GAO study"). [...] The report examined {{trends in the}} use of seller-funded down-payment assistance, its impact on home prices, the performance of the FHA insured loans that had received this assistance, and the standards used by the FHA for approving and monitoring these loans. [...] Its findings generally corroborated those of the earlier government reports and studies. [...] Specifically, the GAO <b>found</b> <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> the percentage of FHA insured loans that had received down-payment assistance from nonprofit organizations was increasing and that, by 2004, they accounted for approximately one in every three new loans insured by the FHA, (ii) the seller-funded programs created an [...] "indirect stream" [...] of funds from sellers to buyers that caused the home buyers to pay higher prices, and (iii) loans that received down-payment assistance had higher delinquency and default rates than those that did not receive it (and that seller-funded down-payment assistance programs comprised about 95% of all FHA insured loans that received any type of down-payment assistance from a nonprofit organization). [...] Although the report did not focus on any particular program, it did identify Nehemiah as one of the three programs that accounted for most of the seller-funded down-payment assistance found in FHA insured loans.|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E

500|$|The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") took {{public action}} in 2005. [...] In mid year, it {{released}} two private letter rulings, {{each of which}} described an organization that was conducting operations {{in a manner similar}} to the Nehemiah Program. [...] Each ruling <b>found</b> <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> the organization's operations did not exclusively serve a charitable purpose but, instead, served to promote [...] "the private interests of home sellers and other private parties" [...] and, consequently, (ii) the payments made by home sellers to the organization would not qualify as [...] "charitable contributions" [...] for which the seller could claim a tax deduction. [...] And in November 2005, the Department of Justice filed suit in Chicago on behalf of the IRS, seeking an injunction against an Illinois-based seller-funded down-payment program. [...] The injunction sought to bar that program from [...] "falsely advising" [...] home sellers that they could claim their payments to the program as charitable-contribution tax deductions. [...] The IRS made its findings applicable to all seller-funded down-payment assistance programs when it issued a revenue ruling in May 2006. [...] That ruling, Revenue Ruling 2006–27, contrasted the tax treatment of seller-funded programs with the treatment accorded to other types of down-payment assistance. [...] Seller-funded programs, the ruling stated, were [...] "not operated exclusively for charitable purposes". [...] Furthermore, payments made by the seller to the organizations were to be treated not as charitable contributions, but either as rebates to the home buyer or as reductions in the sales price of the home. [...] Shortly after the revenue ruling was issued, Nehemiah published an open letter from its president, in which it noted its opposition to the ruling but added that the ruling did not prevent the Nehemiah Program from continuing its operations. The letter did note, however, that Nehemiah might have to pay [...] "appropriate business taxes on the revenue generated by its downpayment assistance program".|$|E

2500|$|Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines, {{with their}} {{alternating}} heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy from Motörhead and Johnny Ramone. [...] "Johnny Ramone is my hero. I {{wanted to make}} that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{consumed}} Naipaul. [...] In 1983, he wrote:The book {{took three}} years to write.

[...] The labour ended; the book began to recede. [...] And I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was unwilling to re-enter the world I had created, unwilling to expose myself again to the emotions that lay below the comedy. [...] I became nervous of the book. [...] I haven't read it since I passed the proofs in May 1961.|$|E

In her 1987 autobiography, she credits that tour with helping to develop the comic timing she soon became famous for: [...] "I played the title role in Patience, and I absolutely loved the character, because Patience is a very funny, flaky girl. ... I played her as a dumb Dora {{all the way through}} and really had fun with the role. ... My Patience grew clumsier and clumsier with each performance, and audiences seemed to like her. ... I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a gift for slapstick humor, and it was fun to exercise it onstage." [...] Sills sang in light operas for several more years.|$|E
