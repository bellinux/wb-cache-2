2500|$|A copy of The History of a Drowning Boy {{remains in}} the {{possession}} of one of many individuals with whom Nilsen corresponds and in whom Nilsen holds unquestioning trust. In his autobiography, Nilsen states that, beginning with his service in the British Army, he constantly lived two separate lives: his [...] "real life" [...] and his [...] "fantasy life". He writes: [...] "When I was with people, I was in the [...] "real" [...] world, and in my private life, <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> instantly into my fantasy life. I could oscillate between the two with instant ease." [...] With reference to his murders, Nilsen claims that his emotional state upon the dates of the murders, in conjunction with the amount of alcohol he had consumed, were both core factors in his decision to kill. He further emphasises that, when feeling low, seizing an opportunity to satisfy the sexual fantasies he had developed in which the victim would be the young, attractive and passive partner, and he the older active partner, would temporarily relieve him of a general feeling of inadequacy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. It's {{none of my}} business," [...] <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> out, consigning, moreover, the Steward and Hamilton {{aloud to}} eternal perdition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you suppose}} I've been talking such a lot? Why do you imagine <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> your poor, {{innocent}} head off just now! I'm terrified inside, terrified!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The only hotel, I have assured him. The Meurice? Chut! <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers. The Ritz? Bah! Once again <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers. 'In all Paris {{there is}} no hotel like this.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Injā beškanam, yār gele dāre (If <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> here, {{this one}} will complain) ...|$|R
5000|$|Unjā beškanam, yār gele dāre (If <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> there, {{that one}} will complain) ...|$|R
60|$|I seized it; <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> it; I dashed it; I trod it; and {{dragging}} the dark lightning-king {{out of my}} door, flung his elbowed, copper sceptre after him.|$|E
60|$|Target snorted shrilly {{and started}} back from the water, ready to stampede. Slipping the bridle into place, <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> the bit between his teeth. I had to swing off my feet to pull his head down.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> {{the catch}} back, and flung up the sash. An icy wind {{swept into the}} room, bearing {{particles}} of snow. I scrambled on to the window-sill, and a crash from behind me told of the falling of the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "'None o' your dam' business,' <b>I</b> <b>snaps</b> back, hot as {{hell in a}} secunt, 'but just {{to touch}} you up, I'll tell you. I'm goin' over to see Nance McRae.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{the monarch}} of the Sea, [...] The {{ruler of the}} Queen's Navee,-- [...] When at anchor here I ride, [...] My bosom swells with pride, And <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers at a foeman's taunts.|$|R
6000|$|He {{instantly}} bounded {{up in the}} hammock. [...] "The bull! Caramba! Not {{a thousand}} bulls! And thees one, look you, was a craven. <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers over his horn; I roll my cigarette under his nose." ...|$|R
60|$|Another moment {{found me}} {{at the top of}} the {{partition}} wall again with the boy beside me. Unbuckling my harness <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> it together with a single long strap which I lowered to the waiting Xodar below. He grasped the end and was soon sitting beside us.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> {{the fingers}} of my hand that was free, in his face. [...] "That for my promise!" [...] I said. [...] "Your contemptible {{weakness}} is putting her happiness in peril as well as yours." [...] I turned my head towards the door, and called to her. [...] "Lucilla!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Brice's heart sank, but he {{remained}} steadfast and truthful. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I knew it when I handed down the box. I {{saw that the}} lock had been forced, but <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> it together again. It was my fault. Perhaps I should have warned you, but I am solely to blame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>snapping</b> {{the spring}} of the locket which hung from my watch-chain, and holding up the little {{vignette}} of Flora.|$|R
6000|$|... "You, {{a master}} of books, by all the sea-blood in your body {{should be able to}} pick up the theoretics of {{navigation}} while <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers. Furthermore, remember that I can supply the seamanship. Why, any squarehead peasant, in a six months' cramming course at any seaport navigation school, can pass the examiners for his navigator's papers. That means six hours for you. And less. If you can't, after an hour's reading and an hour's practice with the sextant, take a latitude observation and work it out, I'll do it for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why <b>I</b> could <b>snap</b> {{those in}} a moment,' said he; 'if {{you want to make}} sure that I cannot escape, better take a line of kelp and bind me with that.' ...|$|R
60|$|I took it {{from him}} and passed it over my head. Then ere <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> down the visor and hid the face of Boccadoro, I bade him, unless he would render futile all this masquerade, to lock {{the door of his}} closet, and lie there {{concealed}} till my return. At that a sudden doubt assailed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur de Saint-Eustache," [...] said I, [...] "you have so dishonoured this blade that I do {{not think}} you would care to wear it again." [...] Saying which, <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> it across my knee, and flung it far out into the river, for all that the hilt was a costly one, richly wrought in bronze and gold.|$|E
6000|$|It was pitiful. [...] "Lost fiddlesticks!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> back at him, with bared teeth. [...] "I wouldn't--I've never harmed a fly. Who, I {{should like}} to know, came to my help when...?" [...] But I choked down the words. Silence fell between us. The idiot clock chimed five. He turned his face away to conceal the aversion that had {{suddenly}} overwhelmed him at sight of me.|$|E
60|$|Our crew is {{composed}} of three brothers: Sam Dobbs, Dick Dobbs, and Bob Dobbs; all active seamen, and as worthy and hearty fellows as any {{man in the world}} could wish to sail with. My friend's name is Mr. Migott, and mine is Mr. Jollins. Thus, we are five on board altogether. As for our characters, I shall leave them to come out as they may {{in the course of this}} narrative. I am going to tell things plainly just as they happened. Smart writing, comic colouring, and graphic description, are departments of authorship at which <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers in contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Church--caramba! {{the priests}} were ever with the Escossas, the aristocrats, {{and against the}} Yorkenos, {{the men of the}} Republic--the people," [...] {{interrupted}} Martinez vehemently; [...] "they will not accept, they will not proclaim the Republic to the people. They shut their eyes, so--. They fold their hands, so--. They say, 'Sicut era principio et nunc et semper in secula seculorum!' Look you, Senor, I am not of the Church--no, caramba! <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers at the priests. Ah! what they give one is food for the bull's horns, believe me--I have read 'Tompano,' the American 'Tompano.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's tellin'!' {{the old man}} grinned as he re-hoisted his faggot. 'I reckon Mus' Ridley he've got {{rheumatism}} along o' lyin' in the dik to see <b>I</b> didn't <b>snap</b> up any. Think o' that now!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does {{that concern}} you?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>snapped.</b> [...] "Let him return {{with what he}} pleases. To-day I enrol more forces from the countryside, take up the bridge and mount our cannon. This is my lair and fortress, and I'll defend it and myself as becomes my name and blood. For I am the lord and master here, and the Lord of Mondolfo {{is not to be}} dragged away thus at the heels of a Captain of Justice. You have my orders, obey them. About it, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|The cougar, {{becoming}} uneasy, stood up, {{reached for}} another limb, climbed out upon it, and peering down, spat hissingly at Jones. But he kept steadily on with Moze close on his heels. <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> my camera on them when Kitty was {{not more than}} fifteen feet above them. As Jones reached the snag which upheld the leaning tree, she ran out on her branch, and leaped into an adjoining pine. It was a good long jump, {{and the weight of}} the animal bent the limb alarmingly.|$|E
60|$|Greaser smoked out his cigarette, {{and began}} to nod. That was the signal for me. I crawled noiselessly from the tree. When I found myself going down into the hollow, I stopped and rose to my feet. The forest was so pitchy black that I could not tell the trees from the darkness. I groped to the left, trying to circle. Once <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> a twig; it cracked like a pistol-shot, and my heart stopped beating, then began to thump. But Greaser never stirred {{as he sat in}} the waning light. At last I had half circled the camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{was told}} that all the power was {{in the hands of}} his majesty's eldest first cousin of the {{masculine}} gender; in which case I thought <b>I</b> might <b>snap</b> my fingers at his majesty himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Theign took, on this, with a frank show of {{reaction}} {{from some of}} his friend's terms, a sharp turn off; he even ironically indicated the babbler {{or at least the}} blunderer in question to Lady Sandgate. [...] "He too has known me so long, and he comes here to talk to me of 'the drift of public opinion'!" [...] After which he quite charged at his vain informant. [...] "Am I to tell you again that <b>I</b> <b>snap</b> my fingers at the drift of public opinion?--which is but another name for the chatter of all the fools one doesn't know, in addition to all those (and plenty of 'em!) one damnably does." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "A silly <b>snap</b> <b>I</b> made in my {{mirror for}} [...] "Talk Like a Pirate Day."" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{explained}} our {{circumstances to}} her skipper {{and asked for}} food, water and oil; but when he found {{that we were not}} German, he became very angry and abusive and started to draw away from us; but I was in no mood for any such business. Turning toward Bradley, who was in the conning-tower, <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> out: [...] "Gun-service on deck! To the diving stations!" [...] We had no opportunity for drill; but every man had been posted as to his duties, and the German members of the crew understood that it was obedience or death for them, as each was accompanied by a man with a pistol. Most of them, though, were only too glad to obey me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fancy!" [...] I replied. I was so {{struck with}} the oddity of her telling me her secrets {{that for the}} moment my indignation {{did not come to}} a head,--my indignation, I mean, at her accusing poor Lady Emily (and even the girl herself) of having [...] "trapped" [...] our friend. Later I said to myself that I {{supposed}} she was within her literal right in abusing her rival, if she was trying sincerely to give him up. [...] "I don't know anything about his having been hunted down," [...] I said; [...] "but this I do know, Lady Vandeleur, I assure you, that if he should throw Joscelind over she would simply go out like that!" [...] And <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> my fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now let's {{understand}} {{each other on the}} spot, old friend. I am only a farm bailiff, it is true; but I am not poor, nevertheless. I have been very fortunate this year--you would be astonished to know how I have thriven. I tell you the honest truth when I say I could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care that for the expense!" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>snapped</b> my fingers. I could see myself rise a foot at a time in Marco's estimation, and when I fetched out those last words I was become a very tower for style and altitude. [...] "So you see, you must let me have my way. You can't contribute a cent to this orgy, that's settled." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{would have}} <b>snapped</b> out a reply, but I {{caught sight of}} Dick's pale face and anxious eyes.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the double}} line <b>snapped.</b> <b>I</b> fell {{back in the}} boat and Dan fell back in the chair.|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{shut the}} book up with a <b>snap.</b> <b>I</b> noticed {{that there was a}} sort of {{peculiar}} alacrity in everything he did.|$|R
