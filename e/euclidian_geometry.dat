In this paper we have discussed how different somatic and gonadal tissues of a freshwater loach Nemacheilus mooreh (Sykes, 1839) scale with each other. We observed that tissues, which directly influence the reproductive success, show non-isometric relationships, i. e. relations not scaled as per the <b>Euclidian</b> <b>geometry,</b> with high values of exponents than expected; while tissues, which directly do not influence the reproductive behavior scale as per the <b>Euclidian</b> <b>geometry.</b> This finding suggests that the scaling exponents could be subject to selection towards higher reproductive efficiency.

40|$|International audienceSpace-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) {{performs}} two-dimensional {{space and}} time adaptive filtering where different space channels are combined at different times. In the context of radar signal processing, the aim of STAP is to remove ground clutter returns, {{in order to enhance}} slow moving target detection. Filters weights are adaptively estimated from training data in the neighborhood of the range cell of interest, called cell under test (CUT). The estimation of these weights is always deduced, more or less directly, from an estimation of the covariance matrices of the received signal, which is the key quantity in the process of adaptation. This STAP method is usually referred to as the sample matrix inversion (SMI). One main consideration goes into the choice of the training covariance matrices: how many and which matrices share the same statisticswith the matrix of the cell under test. On one hand, the statistics of the clutter often change rapidly and, on the other hand, we want to use as many matrices as possible to obtain a good estimate of the covariance matrix that minimizes the estimation loss. The traditional way to answer these questions is to use the Euclidean distance which relies on a power selection criterion. One can clearly see that this method, which works only on the signal power of the covariance matrix, does not take advantage {{of the structure of the}} covariance matrix. We propose in this paper a new criterion based on a physical point of view and look for the distance that fits to the minimization problem of the STAP filter. We show that this distance outperforms the classical Euclidian distance. We extend this distance to the Riemannian distance. When working on Hermitian positive-definite matrices, it is natural and desirable to work with the information geometry metric. We show that the distance associated with the information geometry metric performs very well in detecting clutter nonhomogeneity and we compare two processing using both the classical <b>Euclidian</b> and information <b>geometry</b> metric based on the Riemannian distance. These results lead to the hypothesis that information geometry may also be used for the computation of the mean of the selected covariance matrices, enabling better performance for target detection in heterogeneous environments...|$|R

In order to do so, a one group pre-test/ post-test procedure was conducted around an intensive geometry module, and a representational group of students was interviewed before and after the module to discuss their high school experiences of learning geometry and to analyse their attitudes towards the subject. The van Hiele Theory of Levels of Thought in Geometry was used as the theoretical framework for this study. The PME students in this study, prior to their completion of the geometry module, lacked the content knowledge, skills and insight in <b>Euclidian</b> <b>geometry</b> that is expected at matric level (Level 3). The pre-test results revealed that half the group could only be classified as being on Level 0. By the time the post-test was written, 60 % of the group had moved onto Level 1 as their maximum competence level. This implies that these students were all brought to greater insight by the teaching they received during the geometry module. However, the overall improvement in the group as revealed in the post-test results, consisted of an upward movement of only one level. Therefore, the geometry module offered did not bring about sufficient improvement for these students to be able to teach geometry adequately (Level 3 is required). The students who were interviewed for this study uniformly expressed their dislike or fear of <b>Euclidian</b> <b>geometry</b> in general, but described the positive change in their attitude {{during the course of the}} module because of the way it was presented.
