40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>taboos</b> {{are widely}} seen {{all over the}} world. This is a {{complicated}} phenomenon in which various elements in each cultural area are intricately intertwined. One of the strictest <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> is based on religious reasons. Grounds for <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> in each religion are presented in each doctrine. However, holiness, purity, impurity etc. are vague ideas from an objective viewpoint. Therefore, it might be difficult for those outside of a certain religious group to accept these prohibitions. <b>Food</b> <b>taboos</b> are seen in {{the doctrine of the}} Jainism too. Jainism regards non-violence (ahiṃsā) as the highest virtue and has practiced non-violence for about 2, 500 years in India. There are two kinds of <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> in Jainism. One is intended for the mendicant and the other is intended for the layperson. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify a part of <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> of Jainism by focusing on the latter. To consider <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> in Jainism, this paper adopts the following order. In case of Jainism, it is expected that non-violence has a big influence on <b>food</b> <b>taboos.</b> Therefore, firstly, we survey the Jaina view of life and Jaina bioethics. The Jaina view of life distinguishes immobile beings (sthāvara) and mobile beings (trasa). Furthermore, it holds that the hierarchy of the living thing is based on the number of sense organs. In this paper we confirm that these greatly influence the degree of violence (hiṃsā). Secondly, we investigate the prohibited food on the basis of the original text and the previous works. Concretely, we examine the one that is called "Fundamental virtue (mūlaguṇa) " of the layperson. By this procedure, we clarify the next two points. The first is that the texts are divided into four types. The second is that six kinds of <b>food</b> <b>taboos,</b> i. e. the abandonment of meat, the abandonment of alcohol, the abandonment of honey, the abandonment of five kinds of plants, the abandonment of the midnight snack, and the abandonment of non-filtered water are seen in these texts. Finally, we consider the conditions and the reasons which bring about the above-mentioned <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> in detail. We can make the following conclusions on the basis of such considerations. That is, the standard of the <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> of Jainism are extremely lucid from the viewpoint of the non-Jain too, because they are based on non-violence alone...|$|R
40|$|Comparing <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> across 78 cultures, {{this paper}} {{demonstrates}} that meat, though a prized food, {{is also the}} principal target of proscriptions. Reviewing existing explanations of taboos, we � nd that both functionalist and symbolic approaches fail to account for meat’s cross-cultural centrality and do not re � ect experience-near aspects of <b>food</b> <b>taboos,</b> principal among which is disgust. Adopting an evolutionary approach to the mind, this paper presents an alternative to existing explanations of <b>food</b> <b>taboos.</b> Consistent with the attendant risk of pathogen transmission, meat has special salience as a stimulus for humans, as animal products are stronger elicitors of disgust and aversion than plant products. We identify three psychosocial processes, socially-mediated ingestive conditioning, egocentric empathy, and normative moralization, each of which likely {{plays a role in}} transforming individual disgust responses and conditioned food aversions into institutionalized <b>food</b> <b>taboos...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>taboos</b> or <b>food</b> {{prohibitions}} {{are still}} controversial in ecological anthropology and in human ecology. In the literature, the explanations for such taboos find their {{origin in the}} book of Leviticus in the Bible, or in the abundance of fat found in the tissue of different fish species, or on the consequences for conservation practices. In this comparative study, we show the various interpretations concerning the <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> observed in tropical societies, including their association to the availability of resources, i. e., the protein coming from local fish resources. We show that, in the Amazon and on the Atlantic Forest coast, fish <b>food</b> <b>taboos,</b> or dietary prohibitions during illness, are associated with carnivorous fish, especially piscivorous fish, and the fish that are recommended for consumption during illness are usually herbivorous or invertebrate eaters. Explanation for this preference is based into the consideration that, at high trophic levels, animals may accumulate toxins by eating plants, invertebrates, or other fish. We therefore consider that fish <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> may represent an adaptive strategy of local inhabitants of the Atlantic Forest coast and of Amazonian rivers...|$|R
500|$|The backcountry {{relied heavily}} on a diet based on mush made from soured milk or boiled grains. Clabber, a yogurt-like food made with soured milk, was a {{standard}} breakfast dish and was eaten by backcountry settlers of all ages. This dietary habit was not shared by other British immigrant groups and was equally despised by those still in Britain. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason, who spent time among Ulster Irish immigrants, described them as depending [...] "wholly on butter, milk, clabber and what in England is given to hogs". Oatmeal mush was a popular meal in the British borderlands and remained popular in America. The only difference was that the oatmeal was replaced by corn, and is still known today in the South as grits. Cakes of unleavened dough baked on bakestones or circular griddles were common and went by names such as [...] "clapbread", [...] "griddle cakes" [...] and [...] "pancakes". While the potato had originated in South America, it did not become established in North America until it {{was brought to the}} colonies by northern British settlers in the 18th century and became an important backcountry staple along with corn. Pork had been a <b>food</b> <b>taboo</b> among northern Britons and the primary meat had been sheep. In the American colonies the raising of sheep was not as efficient and mutton was therefore replaced with pork. The habit of eating [...] "sallet" [...] or [...] "greens" [...] remained popular, but the vegetables of the Old World were replaced with plants like squashes, gourds, beans, corn, land cress, and pokeweed.

This paper presents quantitative and qualitative data on food consumption, food distribution practices, <b>food</b> <b>taboos,</b> garden sizes and work effort to show how Lese horticulturalist women living in the Ituri Forest of northeast Democratic Republic of Congo attempt to alleviate nutritional stress. The Lese experience an annual hunger season when approximately {{one quarter of the}} population suffer from energy deficiency. Nutritional intake is also compromised by a complex system of <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> against meat from wild forest animals. Anthropometric data collected over several years suggest that Lese women suffer from nutritional stress more than men during the hunger season. They also have more <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> particularly during pregnancy and lactation. Their low fertility is compounded by nutritional stress. Despite these inequities, Lese women use several strategies to improve their food intake. Since they are responsible for all household cooking, they manipulate food portions. During the hunger season, they snack frequently, and increase their consumption of palliative foods. Women with more <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> plant larger gardens to supplement their diet with vegetable foods. Although this results in their consumption of more daily protein, they work harder compared to women with smaller gardens. Women cheat in their adherence to specific <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> by actively discounting them, or by eating prophylactic plants that supposedly prevent the consequences (usually illness) of eating <b>tabooed</b> <b>foods.</b> In addition, women resort to subterfuge to access desirable resources. Lese women do not reduce work effort during the hunger season, but adapt physiologically by reducing resting metabolic rates during periods of weight loss. These results point to the ability of Lese women to minimize the ecological and cultural constraints on their nutrition. More data, however, are required to assess the long-term effectiveness of these strategies. Nutritional stress Sex differences Food allocation Congo Ituri Forest...|$|R

Among forest populations, vulnerable categories, such as pregnant and lactating women, have to respect numerous <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> which detend symbolic as well as social functions. These taboos concern numerous species rich in protein content, such as game. This assertion had upset numerous nutritionnists of the 50 - 70 ies. Some thirty years ago, although the protein factory like tropical forest showed numerous <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> which were respected, the rate between forbidden and allowed species was high. Nevertheless, at this time, weaning was delayed and the majority of the most frequent species of the diet was not concerned. Nowadays, game is not so abounding, due to an overexploitation related to new trading behaviours. Conversely, a great number of forbidden species is no more respected. Consequently, the protein value of the diet has declined, but this harmfull fact has been countered by the evolution of social behaviours, such as abandoning most taboos.

40|$|Food taboos {{are known}} from {{virtually}} all human societies. Most religions declare certain food items fit and others unfit for human consumption. Dietary {{rules and regulations}} may govern particular phases of the human life cycle and {{may be associated with}} special events such as menstrual period, pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, and – in traditional societies – preparation for the hunt, battle, wedding, funeral, etc. On a comparative basis many food taboos seem to make no sense at all, as to what may be declared unfit by one group may be perfectly acceptable to another. On the other hand, food taboos have a long history and one ought to expect a sound explanation for the existence (and persistence) of certain dietary customs in a given culture. Yet, this is a highly debated view and no single theory may explain why people employ special food taboos. This paper wants to revive interest in <b>food</b> <b>taboo</b> research and attempts a functionalist's explanation. However, to illustrate some of the complexity of possible reasons for <b>food</b> <b>taboo</b> five examples have been chosen, namely traditional food taboos in orthodox Jewish and Hindu societies as well as reports on aspects of dietary restrictions in communities with traditional lifestyles of Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Nigeria. An ecological or medical background is apparent for many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. On the one hand food taboos can help utilizing a resource more efficiently; on the other food taboos can lead to the protection of a resource. Food taboos, whether scientifically correct or not, are often meant to protect the human individual and the observation, for example, that certain allergies and depression are associated with each other could have led to declaring food items taboo that were identified as causal agents for the allergies. Moreover, any <b>food</b> <b>taboo,</b> acknowledged by a particular group of people as part of its ways, aids in the cohesion of this group, helps that particular group maintain its identity in the face of others, and therefore creates a feeling of "belonging"...|$|E

The logic of food restrictions {{during a period of}} increased energy and protein needs has been challenged, but few data are available to test the impact of these practices on the diets of lactating women. In the eastern Amazon the immediate postpartum period is referred to as resguardo, lasts for 40 - 41 days and includes <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> and work restrictions. Taking a biocultural perspective, this paper combines data on the beliefs and attitudes surrounding the practice of resguardo with quantitative data on the actual dietary intakes and activity patterns of a cohort of 23 lactating women followed from birth through 15 months postpartum. This paper addresses three topics: (1) shared ideals regarding resguardo; (2) adherence to food and work restrictions; and (3) the impact of these practices on women's dietary intakes and energy expenditure. The results show that the majority of women adhered to <b>food</b> <b>taboos</b> and work restrictions. During resguardo energy expenditure in physical activity was lower, reducing women's energy needs and allowing them to devote more time to infant care. However, energy intakes were also lower. The reduction in dietary intake was impacted more by work restrictions and the loss of women in subsistence tasks during resguardo than by adherence to <b>food</b> <b>taboos.</b> In addition to altering maternal energetic strategies, resguardo served an important social function by reinforcing bonds and, for young women, marking the transition to womanhood.
