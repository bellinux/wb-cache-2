5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{conducted}} two inquiries {{into the}} reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that Hoods aft magazine had exploded after one of Bismarcks shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's torpedoes. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's gun turrets that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.|$|E
5|$|What Bouton {{described}} <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> a mystery, but various {{theories have}} been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori {{noted that the}} Martinique macaw seemed similar to the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, {{and may have been}} the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown. Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw, as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which {{was supposed to have been}} collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the tail of a dove.|$|E

500|$|The {{staff of}} the BBC {{television}} series Horizon—which presented an episode in 2000 on the Star Dust disappearance—received hundreds of messages from viewers proposing explanations of STENDEC.

It is especially undermining in its morose tone in the film's final sequences, when the pace naturally slows down as Wilde's life enters its final phase.

2500|$|Contrary to {{the neoclassical}} position, Georgescu argues that flow factors and fund factors (that is, natural {{resources}} and man-made capital) are essentially complementary, since both are needed in the economic process {{in order to have}} a working economy. Georgescu's conclusion, then, is that the allocation of exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations is a large problem that cannot, and should not, be relaxed or ignored: [...] "There seems to be no way to do away with the dictatorship of the present over the future, although we may aim at making it as bearable as possible." [...] Georgescu's followers and interpreters have since been discussing the existential impossibility of allocating Earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when mankind will eventually face extinction. In effect, any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.

2500|$|If someone {{suspects}} {{they have}} vaginismus, sexual penetration <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> painful or truly impossible until their vaginismus is addressed. This {{is a highly}} frustrating condition, as other people, including doctors, may speculate negatively on the origin or existence of their difficulties. Vaginismus {{does not mean that}} someone does not want intercourse or does not love their partner. People with vaginismus may be able to engage in a variety of other sexual activities, as long as penetration is avoided. Sexual partners of vaginismic people may come to believe that vaginismic people do not want to engage in penetrative sex at all, though this may not be true for most such people. There is currently no indication that vaginismus reduces the sexual drive or arousal of affected people, and as such it is likely that many vaginismic people wish to engage in penetrative sex to the same degree as unaffected people, but are deterred by the pain and emotional distress that accompanies each attempt. Psychological pressure to [...] "perform" [...] sexually or become aroused quickly with a partner can deter the person from future attempts and/or cause their vaginismus to become more severe.|$|E
