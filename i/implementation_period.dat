The potential fallacies of applying the pair-t test, causal factor analysis model with dummy specification, and causal factor analysis model with time-based specification to measure the policy effect by using different prior and post <b>implementation</b> <b>periods</b> are demonstrated. The policy of criminal sanction for drunk driving in Taipei City is used as an empirical example. The results indicate the different choice of the lengths of the prior and post <b>implementation</b> <b>periods</b> would obtain the different sizes of the policy effect. Finally, the findings provide a set of valuable information for policy evaluation and alert the analysts to interpret their evaluation results carefully to avoid making an inappropriate conclusion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Energy {{labelling}} {{and minimum}} efficiency performance standards {{have proved to}} be very effective in stimulating energy efficiency improvement in the domestic appliance sector. But standards suffer from long and often difficult <b>implementation</b> <b>periods</b> because of the resistance of the industrial sector. As a consequence, the question has been raised as to whether similar results could not be obtained more easily and at lower cost with voluntary agreements, which offer flexibility margins in the achievement of commitments. This paper analyses the specific advantages of voluntary agreements compared with efficiency standards in the domestic appliance sector. We conclude that voluntary agreements may be an effective instrument in this respect but in certain conditions. The alternative of regulatory measures must remain a credible, realistic threat if voluntary agreements are to have a really significant impact on performance improvement. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper is an investigation into how ubiquitous computing technologies can contribute to improving the quality of existing public transport environments through the integration of responsive technologies. The paper argues that given the significant challenges associated with transport infrastructure expansion including cost, disruption, energy use, and <b>implementation</b> <b>periods</b> augmenting existing transport environments offers alternate measures to manage demand and improve the user experience. The paper proposes improving transport environments by integrating smart, or responsive, digital information into the existing physical fabric in a coherent architectural and spatial context. This approach offers an opportunity to shift away from the static nature of public transport infrastructure to the dynamic notion of public transport ‘info’structure. The research uses an architecture graduate studio as a foundation to investigate the objectives. The contribution of this paper is an investigation of ways in which digital technologies and networked communications can transform and augment public transport infrastructure, allowing new forms of intelligent, adaptive, interactive and self-aware architecture to be developed...|$|R

40|$|Part 4 : EIS as a ServiceInternational audienceWithin {{the cloud}} {{computing}} hype, ERP SaaS is receiving more focus from ERP vendors such as ERP market leader SAP announcing SAP by Design, their new ERP SaaS solution. SaaS {{is a new}} approach to deliver software and has had proven success with CRM systems such as Salesforce. com. The appeal of SaaS is driven by amongst other things, lower Total Cost of Ownership and faster <b>implementation</b> <b>periods.</b> However, the rate at which ERP SaaS is being adopted is low in comparison to other SaaS applications such as CRM or Human Resource systems. Hence the need to establish the reasons for this low adoption. Consequently the purpose of this research was to determine barriers that affect the adoption of ERP SaaS in South Africa. Using interviews and qualitative data analysis, this study developed a model that explains the factors that affect the adoption of ERP SaaS. Network limitations, customisation, security and cost concerns were raised as dominant factors affecting the adoption of ERP SaaS. The research concludes by suggesting that over time the adoption of ERP SaaS should increase as the technology matures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract“When to {{implement}} actions” and “how much to abate emissions” {{are two major}} concerns of policy makers {{when it comes to}} policy formulation and planning for CO 2 mitigation. This study investigates CO 2 mitigation potential in the Thailand transport sector under four possible mitigation pathways. Those pathways comprise four mitigation actions and three different time frames as <b>implementation</b> <b>periods</b> (2015, 2025 and 2035 as commencement years). To represent that, along with business as usual (BAU) case (as reference), four countermeasure scenarios were modeled namely L 2035, L 2025, L 2015 and fuel switching (FS). Results show that the L 2015 scenario can achieve the highest CO 2 mitigation with 23 % cumulative reduction against the BAU from 2010 - 2050. However, due to countermeasure implementation delays (by 10 years in L 2025 and by 20 years in L 2035), the mitigation potentials have dropped significantly. In addition, early in implementations of actions have resulted considerable reduction in energy consumption and it has allowed more penetrations of bio-fuel blends and electricity as replacements to fossil oils. Moreover, in terms of abatement costs, technologies such as efficient vehicles and modal shifts provide cost savings along with high mitigation potentials...|$|R
