5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became {{a significant source of}} employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> classes.|$|E
