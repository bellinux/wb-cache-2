[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 An alternative approach for precision aerial delivery utilizing a ﬂying wing for controllable <b>forward</b> <b>glide</b> is presented. Although effective, current delivery methods either display {{a lack of}} control, or require close standoff distances, potentially endangering aircraft personnel as well as bystanders. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations provide an efﬁcient method for evaluating various wing designs and actuation conﬁgurations. Four control surface conﬁgurations are presented and evaluated, encompassing traditional aircraft and ram-air parafoil control approaches. Fixed-wing and multirotor unmanned aircraft-basedﬂight tests were conducted to evaluate the controllability and handling performance of the various conﬁgurations of both a ﬁxed wing model and a model with collapsing wings. A manufacturing process was developed to allow repeatable results in the ﬁeld using cheap, mostly disposable materials. A powered ﬂying wing model was used to maximize data collection in later stages of software development. Data collected during ﬂight tests was {{used to create a}} model of the system and develop a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion controller for autonomous ﬂight. The NDI controller was able to provide stable ﬂight in pitch, but will need more development to control yaw, instead an intentional bias was built in to show proof of concept for direct yaw control. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the ﬂying wing-based aerial delivery; however, signiﬁcant challenges remain regarding the stability and scalability of the system.

5000|$|The {{charlotte}} (pronounced shar-lot), {{also known}} as the candle stick, is a figure skating spiral. The skater bends <b>forward</b> and <b>glides</b> on one leg with the other one lifted into the air. The skater's torso is upright, but during the charlotte, the skater's torso is as close to the grounded foot as possible. When performed well, the skater's legs are almost in a straight vertical split position. The charlotte requires great flexibility and balance.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} entry into a flip, for a {{counterclockwise}} jump, {{is a long}} <b>forward</b> straight-line <b>glide</b> on the left foot {{down the center of}} the rink with the (right) free foot held forward. Then the skater uses the toe of the right foot to push into a left forward outside 3 turn, reaching back to pick with the right foot to vault into the jump from the left back inside edge immediately after the turn. The skater performs one or more rotations in the air before landing on a right back outside edge.|$|R
40|$|In this note, we {{introduce}} a simple homemade toy called the brush-creeper, which can <b>glide</b> <b>forward</b> with no propellers, limbs, wheels, and seemingly no movement {{of any kind}} that can push forward against the ground. The toy arouses pupils' interest and their incentive to ask “Why?” in lessons related to friction...|$|R

Down came the game, {{and the boys}} <b>glided</b> <b>forward</b> to secure the prizes. The {{partridges}} were of good size, and plump, and the lads gazed at them and turned them over in deep satisfaction.|$|R
50|$|When disturbed, this worm {{tends to}} curl up, writhe and wriggle. Movement is {{performed}} by small waves of muscular contraction that flow along {{the body from}} tail to head. Several waves may occur simultaneously and the worm <b>glides</b> <b>forward</b> slowly and smoothly, the swellings running evenly along the body. It is carnivorous, being both a predator and a scavenger.|$|R
6000|$|A little compunction, {{a little}} curiosity, a sudden revolt {{against all the}} discomfiture and sordid doubts she had been {{suffering}} from, made Cecilia glance softly at Mr. Purcey's figure; almost before she knew it, she was seated in the A.i.

60|$|And {{from out}} {{the group of}} dowdy country matrons and starchy-looking dévotes a {{brilliant}} figure now detached itself and <b>glided</b> <b>forward</b> with consummate grace. Irène de Stainville was approaching for presentation to the Queen, her eyes becomingly cast down, a rosy flush on her cheeks, for she was conscious that she was beautiful and that the King's wearied eyes had lighted up at sight of her.|$|R
60|$|As {{they entered}} the drawing-room by one door, Mary, looking very {{handsome}} and imposing in a low black dress, which became her fair beauty admirably, appeared at the other. Catching sight of Morris, she ran, or rather <b>glided,</b> <b>forward</b> with the graceful gait {{that was one of}} her distinctions, and caught him by both hands, bending her face towards him in open and unmistakable invitation.|$|R

5000|$|Vannellidae {{tend to be}} {{flattened}} and fan-shaped during motion, {{although some}} are long and narrow, and have a prominent clear margin at the anterior. In most amoebae, the endoplasm <b>glides</b> <b>forward</b> {{through the center of}} the cell, but vannellids undergo a sort of rolling motion with the outer membrane sliding around like a tank tread. These amoebae are usually 10-40 μm in size, but some are smaller or larger.|$|R
50|$|Stability {{problems}} due to {{its length}} limited the submarine to dives to a maximum depth of 10 m (33 ft). The front of the submarine would tend to dive first, hitting the bottom, so that the submarine would <b>glide</b> <b>forward.</b> Pumps were installed {{to compensate for the}} tilt, but proved too slow to be effective. The installation of longitudinal rudders would have improved stability as later demonstrated by the Gymnote and Gustave Zédé submarines.|$|R
40|$|Motility is a {{fundamental}} part of cellular life and survival, including for Plasmodium parasites [...] single-celled protozoan pathogens responsible for human malaria. The motile life cycle forms achieve motility, called gliding, via the activity of an internal actomyosin motor. Although gliding {{is based on the}} well-studied system of actin and myosin, its core biomechanics are not completely understood. Currently accepted models suggest it results from a specifically organized cellular motor that produces a rearward directional force. When linked to surface-bound adhesins, this force is passaged to the cell posterior, propelling the parasite <b>forwards.</b> <b>Gliding</b> motility is observed in all three life cycle stages of Plasmodium: sporozoites, merozoites and ookinetes. However, it is only the ookinetes [...] formed inside the midgut of infected mosquitoes [...] that display continuous gliding without the necessity of host cell entry. This makes them ideal candidates for invasion-free biomechanical analysis. Here we apply a plate-based imaging approach to study ookinete motion in three-dimensional (3 D) space to understand Plasmodium cell motility and how movement facilitates midgut colonization. Using single-cell tracking and numerical analysis of parasite motion in 3 D, our analysis demonstrates that ookinetes move with a conserved left-handed helical trajectory. Investigation of cell morphology suggests this trajectory may be based on the ookinete subpellicular cytoskeleton, with complementary whole and subcellular electron microscopy showing that, like their motion paths, ookinetes share a conserved left-handed corkscrew shape and underlying twisted microtubular architecture. Through comparisons of 3 D movement between wild-type ookinetes and a cytoskeleton-knockout mutant we demonstrate that perturbation of cell shape changes motion from helical to broadly linear. Therefore, while the precise linkages between cellular architecture and actomyosin motor organization remain unknown, our analysis suggests that the molecular basis of cell shape may, in addition to motor force, be a key adaptive strategy for malaria parasite dissemination and, as such, transmission...|$|R
60|$|Adam and Oolanga {{both had}} pistols; Lady Arabella, {{who had not}} one, was {{probably}} the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting, but that being impossible, she made her effort in another way. <b>Gliding</b> <b>forward,</b> she tried to seize the African; but he eluded her grasp, just missing, in doing so, falling into the mysterious hole. As he swayed back to firm foothold, he turned his own gun on her and shot. Instinctively Adam leaped at his assailant; clutching at each other, they tottered on the very brink.|$|R
60|$|The figure {{turned and}} beckoned {{to us to}} follow her as she <b>glided</b> <b>forward,</b> picking {{her way through the}} skeletons which were {{scattered}} about upon the lava bed of the cleft. Thus she went on into the shadow of the opposing cliff that the moonlight did not reach. Here in the wet season a stream trickled down a path which it had cut through the rock in the course of centuries, and the grit that it had brought with it was spread about the lava floor of the ravine, so that many of the bones were almost completely buried in the sand.|$|R
50|$|At {{heel strike}} the {{vertical}} ground reaction force is located posterior to {{the axis of}} rotation of the ankle joint. An external plantar flexion moment is created which must be resisted by an internal dorsiflexion moment. Once the foot is flat and the trunk <b>glides</b> <b>forward</b> over the stance foot, an internal plantar flexion moment is generated to decelerate the forward motion of the body’s center of mass. From mid-stance to toe off, however, this moment continues but {{the function of the}} plantar flexors switches over to accelerating the knee into extension and propelling the center of mass forward.|$|R
50|$|Stott Pilates {{exercises}} {{can be done}} on {{the floor}} using a mat or on specialized equipment. Merrithew Health & Fitness manufactures equipment used for Stott Pilates exercises. The main piece of equipment used in the Stott Pilates method is the Reformer, which was designed by Lindsay, a horizontal carriage that <b>glides</b> <b>forward</b> and backward on rollers. Resistance is provided using springs, along with other attachments for a variety of exercises and positions (i.e., lying down, seated, and standing). The mat exercises may also include props such as the Stability Ball, Mini Stability Ball, Toning Balls, Flexband, Fitness Circle, etc..|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless this calm {{security}} was presently invaded {{by a sense}} of stealthy life and motion. What had seemed a fixed shadow suddenly detached itself from the deck, and began to slip stanchion by stanchion along the bulwarks toward the companion way. At the cabin door it halted and crouched motionless. Then rising, it <b>glided</b> <b>forward</b> with the same staccato movement until opposite the slight elevation of the forehatch. Suddenly it darted to the hatch, unfastened and lifted it with a swift, familiar dexterity, and disappeared in the opening. But as the moon shone upon its vanishing face, it revealed the whitening eyes and teeth of the Lascar seaman.|$|R
40|$|Model sclerites of the {{trilobite}} Dikelocephalus were qualitatively observed under 2 different hydrodynamic conditions: {{falling through}} still water and entrained in flowing water. Most pygidia {{were found to}} glide backwards through still water in a convex up attitude, whereas most cranidia <b>glided</b> <b>forwards</b> in a convex down position. Presented data from fossils show just such a pattern of final dispositions. In flowing water both sclerites were found to behave {{in a similar manner}} to each other. Taphonomic studies using trilobite orientations and attitudes should therefore take account of the different hydrodynamic properties of cranidia and pygidia as well as differences between sclerites of different taxa and of different sizes. -Autho...|$|R
500|$|After {{sighting}} a female, the tufted morph pushes {{himself as}} high as possible with the last three pair of legs, and claps with the foremost pair, {{while at the same}} time waving the palps up and down, and swinging the abdomen from side to side, usually about [...] from the female. In contrast, the gray morph crouches down and points the foremost two pairs of legs directly forward, crosses the tips of the legs creating a triangle-like configuration, holds his orange-colored palps beneath his <b>forward</b> eyes, and <b>glides</b> back and forth in stationary or receding semi-circles in front of the female, [...] at [...] away. The movements of the two morphs are identical later in the sequence.|$|R

Is it a battle or a triumph? For by sea Lord Howard, instead of {{fighting}} is rewarding; and after Lord Thomas Howard, Lord Sheffield, Townsend, and Frobisher have received at his hands that knighthood, which was then more honorable than a peerage, old Admiral Hawkins kneels and rises up Sir John, and shaking his shoulders after the accolade, observes to the representative of majesty, that his [...] "old woman will hardly know herself again, when folks call her My Lady." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{illusion}} {{is involved}} in creating {{the appearance of the}} dancer gliding backwards. Initially, the front foot is held flat on the ground, while the back foot is in a tiptoe position. The flat front foot remains on the ground but is slid lightly and smoothly backward past the tip-toe back foot. What is now the front foot is lowered flat, while the back foot is raised into the tiptoe position. These steps are repeated over and over creating the illusion that the dancer is being pulled backwards by an unseen force while trying to walk forward. Variations of this move allow the moon walking to also appear to <b>glide</b> <b>forwards,</b> sideways, and even in a circle.|$|R

In contrast, the gray morph crouches down and points the foremost two pairs of legs directly forward, crosses the tips of the legs creating a triangle-like configuration, holds his orange-colored palps beneath his <b>forward</b> eyes, and <b>glides</b> back and forth in stationary or receding semi-circles in front of the female, [...] at 3 cm away.
