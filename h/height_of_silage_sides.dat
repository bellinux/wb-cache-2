40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the following parameters for the ear <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> maize: variability <b>of</b> inbred lines and their diallel hybrids, superior-parent heterosis, components of genetic variability, heritability and combining ability on the basis of a diallel set. The two-year four-replicate trail was set up according to the randomized block design in the location of Zemun Polje. The analysis of components of genetic variance for ear height indicates that the additive components (D) were lower than dominant components (H 1 and H 2) of genetic variance, while the frequency of dominant (u) and recessive genes (v) for this observed trait shows that dominant genes prevailed. The results of the Vr/Wr regression analysis point out to superdominance <b>of</b> ear <b>height</b> inheritance. The analysis of variance of combining abilities shows that there were highly significantly positive values of GCA and SCA for ear height in both years of investigation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. High densities in bunker silos {{minimize}} {{losses and}} reduce storage costs; however, the guidelines to attain high densities {{are based on}} relatively little research. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine those practices or factors most correlated with bunker silo density. Density was measured in 175 bunker silos across Wisconsin using core samples collected at chest height (1. 13 m, 3. 70 ft, on average) across the feed-out face. Silo filling practices were surveyed and correlated with density. Most silages sampled were alfalfa or corn. Dry matter densities ranged from 106 to 434 kg/m 3 (6. 6 to 27. 1 lb/ft 3). The core densities were correlated with the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> above the core, indicating the effect of selfcompaction. To adjust for this, all densities were corrected for the median depth below the surface (2. 16 m or 7. 09 ft) using the equations of Pitt (1983) for density with height for the center of tower silos. The adjusted dry matter densities were most strongly correlated with how thinly a load was spread (L), tractor weight (W), packing time per tonne as-fed (T), and dry matter content (D). These four factors were combined into a packing factor [W (TD) 1 / 2 L – 1] that explained 18. 2 % of the variation in dry matter density. Additional factors such as the use of dual wheels, etc. did not significantly improve the prediction of dry matter density. An equation was developed to predict average density in a bunker silo based on the packing factor plus crop height in the silo. Keywords. Silage, Silos, Density, Packing, Tractor, Tires, Bunker.

Os híbridos avaliados foram AS 32, AG 9090, CD 308, DKB 747 e P 30 F 87, colhidos em três alturas de corte: 15, 35 e 55 cm. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados com parcelas subdivididas e três repetições. Para confecção das silagens, utilizaram-se silos experimentais de PVC com 20 cm de diâmetro e 40 cm de altura. A produtividade de leite, por tonelada de silagem (eficiência alimentar) e por hectare, foi estimada pelo modelo Milk 2006. A produtividade de forragem ensilável reduziu com o aumento da altura de colheita, com resultados de 14, 6; 13, 0 e 12, 6 t/ha MS para as alturas de colheita de 15 cm, 35 cm e 55 cm, respectivamente. O híbrido de milho e a altura de colheita influenciaram a composição bromatológica das silagens, com exceção do teor de extrato etéreo (EE), que não foi influenciado pela altura de colheita. Ocorreu interação híbrido × altura de colheita para o teor de amido, a digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da MS e da fibra em detergente neutro (FDN) e o teor de nutrientes digestíveis totais (NDT).

Observou-se também efeito do tipo de híbrido sobre a produtividade de leite e a eficiência alimentar, com melhores valores verificados para o híbrido DKB 747 colhido na altura de 55 cm. Ao elevar a altura de colheita, melhora-se o valor nutritivo da silagem sem prejudicar a produtividade de leite por hectare. O manejo da altura de corte não substitui a escolha de melhores híbridos para produção de silagem de alta qualidade e produtividade.

Daily animal growth was the highest in the animal group having the second highest amount of industrially processed feed. This amount was 36 - 44 % of the dry matter of the total feed. But under the current feed and meat prices the highest net returns were obtained at the highest level of industrially processed feed in the sample (47 - 75 % of the dry matter). The MVP for a MJ of convertible energy was estimated at FIM 0, 143. For example, the MVP for barley, a basic energy feed, is estimated at FIM 1, 67, which clearly exceeds the price of barley. The result suggests that, around the amount of energy feed in the sample, it is profitable to increase energy in the feeding ratios.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> consumed by cattle {{can influence the}} subsequent rumen microbial fermentation patterns and methane (CH 4) emissions. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) evaluate the effect of ensilage on the in vitro rumen methane output of perennial ryegrass and (ii) relate the <b>silage</b> fermentation characteristics <b>of</b> grass <b>silages</b> with in vitro rumen methanogenesis. Three pre-harvest herbage-conditioning treatments and seven silage-additive treatments were used in a laboratory-scale silo experiment to produce a diversity <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> fermentation characteristics. Ensilage reduced (P< 0 · 01) the in vitro rumen CH 4 output (mLCH 4 g- 1 dry matter (DM) disappeared). This reflected differences in the direction of rumen fermentation (lower acetic (P< 0 · 05) and higher propionic (P< 0 · 001) acid proportions in volatile fatty acids) rather than major changes in the extent of in vitro rumen fermentation (i. e. mmolVFAg- 1 DM). The magnitude of the decrease in CH 4 output (mLg- 1 DM incubated) owing to ensilage increased as the extent <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> fermentation, and in particular the lactic acid concentration, increased. In contrast, among silages with relatively similar extents <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> fermentation (i. e. total fermentation products), an increase in the proportion of lactic acid in silage fermentation products led to a more extensive in vitro rumen fermentation and thus to a greater CH 4 output (mLg- 1 DM). © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> {{additives}} on ensiling {{characteristics and}} nutritive value of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) silages was studied. Napier grass silages {{were made with}} no additive, fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB), molasses or cassava meal. The ensiling characteristics were determined by ensiling Napier grass silages in airtight plastic pouches for 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 45 d. The effect <b>of</b> Napier grass <b>silages</b> treated with these additives on voluntary feed intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial rumen fermentation was determined in 4 fistulated cows using 4 × 4 Latin square design. The pH value <b>of</b> the treated <b>silages</b> rapidly decreased, and reached to the lowest value within 7 d of the start of fermentation, {{as compared to the}} control. Lactic acid content <b>of</b> <b>silages</b> treated with FJLB was stable at 14 d of fermentation and constant until 45 d of ensiling. At 45 d of ensiling, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> treated with cassava meal were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than the others. In the feeding trial, the intake <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> increased (p< 0. 05) in the cow fed with the treated silage. Among the treatments, dry matter intake was the lowest in the silage treated with cassava meal. The organic matter, crude protein and NDF digestibility <b>of</b> the <b>silage</b> treated with molasses was higher than the silage without additive and the silage treated with FJLB. The rumen parameters: ruminal pH, ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), volatile fatty acid (VFA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and bacterial populations were not significantly different among the treatments. In conclusion, these studies confirmed that the applying of molasses improved fermentative quality, feed intake and digestibility of Napier grass...|$|R
40|$|Sugar cane silage has a {{potential}} for animal feeding, but uncontrolled growth of undesirable microorganisms may cause nutritional losses and affect the animal productivity and health. The objective of this work was to evaluate the microbiological quality and chemical composition of ensiled sugar cane with and without nutritional additives after 30 days of fermentation. Yeasts, filamentous fungi and distinct groups of bacteria were enumerated by plate count methods and the chemical analyzes comprised dry matter, crude protein, fiber content, lignin, and pH. Facultative aerobic bacteria and filamentous fungi were not detected during the fermentative process {{in any of the}} treatments. The number of yeasts in five varieties <b>of</b> sugar cane <b>silage</b> without additives was about 6. 55 Log CFU g- 1 <b>of</b> <b>silage,</b> and with 1 % ammonium sulfate and 1 % urea were about 5. 86 and 5. 50 Log CFU g- 1 <b>of</b> <b>silage,</b> respectively. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count without additive was about 8. 62 Log CFU g- 1 <b>of</b> <b>silage,</b> and with 1 % ammonium sulfate and 1 % urea the count was about 6. 40 and 6. 54 Log CFU g- 1 <b>of</b> <b>silage,</b> respectively. The average percent of dry material in the three treatments was 20. 76 %.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this review is to investigate the effects of temperature of fermentation environment, chopped length of the forages and fermentation period on the quality <b>of</b> <b>silage.</b> The problem in this agricultural research industry {{is that there is}} a lack of interest in doing the investigation by cross-relating other available knowledge in this field. Fermentation process <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> can also apply the concept of chemical processing by investigating the parameters related to the process, like those mentioned above. From this review, it was found that temperature and chopped length do not significantly affect the quality <b>of</b> <b>silage</b> produced but the fermentation period must be considered as a crucial parameter. Recommendation is that further investigation on fermentation period by different type of forage must be considered and the effect of additive on the completion of fermentation process must also be investigated in order to save time, cost and to optimize nutrient content in silage...|$|R
