40|$|Introduction Safe {{hands-on}} defibrillation (HOD) {{will allow}} uninterrupted chest compression during defibrillation and may improve resuscitation success. We tested {{the ability of}} electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> to protect the rescuer during HOD using a ‘worst case’ electrical scenario. Materials and method Leakage current flowing from the patient to the ‘rescuer’ during antero-lateral defibrillation of patients undergoing elective cardioversion was measured. The ‘rescuer’ maintained firm (20 kgf) contact with the patient during defibrillation, wearing Class 1 electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> while simulating an inadvertent contact with the patient, through an additional wired contact between ‘rescuer’ and patient. Results Data from 61 shocks from 43 different patients were recorded. The median leakage current from all defibrillations was 20. 0 ?A, (range: 2. 0 – 38. 5). In total, 18 of the shocks were delivered at 360 J and had a median leakage current of 27. 0 ?A (range: 14. 3 – 38. 5). Conclusion When using Class 1 electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> for hands-on defibrillation, rescuer leakage current is significantly below the 1 mA safe threshold, allowing safe hands-on defibrillation if the rescuer makes only one other point of contact with the patient...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Emerging {{concepts}} of “reduced port surgery” have gained considerable attention from laparoscopic surgeons, including {{the field of}} liver resection. To date, 86 cases of single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) have been reported, with commercially available access devices being used {{in most of these}} cases. We report herein a use of homemade transumbilical glove port for SILH. Methods: A 39 -year-old woman represented giant hepatic hemangioma (9 -cm in size) located at the left lateral segment (S 2 / 3). Partial hepatectomy was performed by the <b>glove</b> <b>method</b> via single port access with conventional laparoscopic bipolar forceps, grasper and scissors without the need of any single-port specific devices. Results: The operative time was 77 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 50 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusions: <b>Glove</b> <b>method</b> not only has significant advantages in terms of cost, but also is superior in its versatility, allowing wider range of movements compared to conventional access devices.

The dielectric properties of NR-based products rely heavily on the compounding formulation and manufacturing processes involved. Considerable efforts are being applied to improve the dielectric performance of NR formulations to ensure that maintenance personnel work in the safer and most comfortable conditions. This work studies the addition of different weight fractions of surface-modified BaTiO 3 -OH nanoparticles to NR formulations to enhance dielectric properties such as breakdown strength and leakage current. The results presented in this work show that the addition of a low weight fraction of surface-modified BaTiO 3 -OH nanofillers (= 1 wt. %) enhances the surface and volume resistivity, crystallinity, breakdown strength under ac conditions and lowers the leakage current under dc stress.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} This article {{summarizes}} current {{knowledge of the}} causes and consequences of interruption of chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recent findings Pauses in chest compressions occur during analysis of the heart rhythm, delivery of ventilation, interventions such as intubation, and gaining intravenous access, but pauses may also be unprompted. Pauses related to defibrillation are because of preshock pauses for rhythm analysis and charging, and postshock pauses to evaluate {{the outcome of the}} shock. Prolonged pauses, mainly preshock pauses (> 10 s) are associated with decreased survival to discharge in retrospective analyses. Measures to reduce preshock and postshock pauses include resuming chest compressions during defibrillator charging, continued chest compression during defibrillation by mechanical chest compression devices or during manual chest compression with sufficiently <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> for the rescuer, and eliminating postshock rhythm and pulse checks. New filtering techniques may allow rhythm analysis during chest compressions. Summary It is important to avoid any unnecessary pause in chest compressions before and after a defibrillation shock.

40|$|Daily working {{activities}} and functions require a high contribution of hand and forearm muscles in executing grip force. To study {{the effects of}} wearing different gloves on grip strength, under a variety of hand skin temperatures, an assessment of the maximum grip strength was performed with 32 healthy male workers with a mean age (standard deviation) of 30. 44 (5. 35) years wearing five industrial gloves at three hand skin temperatures. Their ages and anthropometric characteristics including body mass index (BMI), hand length, hand width, hand depth, hand palm, and wrist circumference were measured. The hand was exposed to different bath temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C) and hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer with and without wearing the gloves (chemical protection <b>glove,</b> rubber <b>insulating</b> <b>glove,</b> anti-vibration impact glove, cotton yarn knitted glove, and RY-WG 002 working glove). The data were analyzed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Tukey test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the within-subject design analysis. The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength. Wearing the RY-WG 002 working glove produced a greater reduction on the maximum grip when compared with the bare hand, while low temperatures (5 °C) had a significant influence on grip when compared to medium (25 °C) and high (45 °C) hand skin temperatures. In addition, participants felt more discomfort in both environmental extreme conditions. Furthermore, they reported more discomfort while wearing neoprene, rubber, and RY-WG 002 working gloves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Although {{the human}} hand {{is a complex}} biomechanical system, only a small set of {{features}} may be necessary for observation learning of functional grasp classes. We explore how to methodically select a minimal set of hand pose features from optical marker data for grasp recognition. Supervised feature selection is used to determine a reduced feature set of surface marker locations on the hand that is appropriate for grasp classification of individual hand poses. Classifiers trained on the reduced feature set of five markers retain at least 92 % of the prediction accuracy of classifiers trained on a full feature set of thirty markers. The reduced model also generalizes better to new subjects. The dramatic reduction of the marker set size {{and the success of}} a linear classifier from local marker coordinates recommend optical marker techniques as a practical alternative to data <b>glove</b> <b>methods</b> for observation learning of grasping.

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the susceptibility of an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator to electromagnetic interference in an electrically hostile work site environment, with the ultimate goal of allowing the patient to return to work. Background. Normal operation of an implanted cardioverterdefibrillator depends on reliable sensing of the heart's electrical activity. Consequently, there is concern that external electromagnetic interference from external sources in the work place, especially welding equipment or motor-generator systems, may be sensed and produce inappropriate shocks or abnormal reed switch operation, temporarily suspending detection of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Methods. The effects of electromagnetic interference on the operation of one type of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (Medtronic models 7217 and 7219) was measured by using internal event counter monitoring in 10 patients operating arc welders at up to 900 A or working near 200 -hp motors and 1 patient close to a locomotive starter drawing up to 400 A. Results. The electromagnetic interference produced two sources of potential interference on the sensing circuit or reed switch operation, respectively: 1) electrical fields with measured frequencies up to 50 MHz produced by the high currents during welding electrode activation, and 2) magnetic fields produced by the current in the welding electrode and cable. The defibrillator sensitivity was programmed to the highest (most sensitive) value: 0. 15 mV (model 7219) or 0. 3 mV (model 7217). The ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation therapies were temporarily turned off but the detection circuits left on. Conclusions. None of the implanted defibrillators tested were affected by oversensing of the electric field as verified by telemetry from the detection circuits. The magnetic field from 225 -A welding current produced a flux density of 1. 2 G; this density was not adequate to close the reed switch, which requires ∼ 10 G. Our testing at the work site revealed no electrical interference with this type of defibrillator. Patients were allowed to return to work. The following precautions should be observed by the patient: 1) maintain a minimal distance of 2 ft (61 cm) from the welding arc and cables or large motors, 2) do not exceed tested currents with the welding equipment, 3) wear <b>insulated</b> <b>gloves</b> while operating electrical equipment, 4) verify that electrical equipment is properly grounded, and 5) stop welding and leave the work area immediately if a therapy is delivered or a feeling of lightheadedness is experienced...|$|R

This article reports a study investigating hand and environmental contamination levels when health care workers (HCWs) followed two different <b>methods</b> of removing <b>gloves</b> at two distances from the rubbish bin. Methods: Fifty HCWs performed a personal or causal <b>glove</b> removal <b>method</b> (pretest) and a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) -recommended <b>glove</b> removal <b>method</b> (posttest) at distances of 2 feet and 3 feet from the rubbish bin after the application of fluorescent solution (the simulated contaminant) onto their gloved hands. Results: The incidence of the small patch of fluorescent stain (1 cm 2) {{on the front of}} the doffed gloves and on the cover of the rubbish bin was significantly lower at 3 feet than at 2 feet. Health care assistants had significantly higher levels of contamination than other HCWs in the pretest but not in the posttest. There was no significant difference in hand contamination rate between pretest and posttest based on distance from the rubbish bin and type of HCW. Conclusion: The impact of the glove removal procedure and the distance to the bin in which used gloves are discarded should be taken into consideration on a daily basis, along with the supervision of infection control measures by minor staff.

Objectives To evaluate patients with {{occupational contact dermatitis}} caused by their rubber gloves, and to describe a method for analysing {{the content of the}} allergens in the <b>gloves.</b> Materials and <b>methods</b> Patch tests were performed with the baseline series, a rubber chemical series, and the patients' own <b>gloves.</b> A <b>method</b> for analysing 1, 3 -diphenylguanidine (DPG) and cetylpyridinium chloride in the gloves was developed. Results Contact allergy to thiuram mix was found in 8 of 16 patients, whereas 12 of 16 patients reacted to DPG. In 7 of 8 patients, contact allergy to cetylpyridinium chloride was found. In the patients' gloves, cetylpyridinium chloride and DPG were detected at higher concentrations {{on the inside of the}} gloves than on the outside. Most patients had worked for decades in their present occupations, but their hand dermatitis had only been present for months. Conclusion Contact allergy to DPG in gloves has been disputed, but, in this study, we were able to confirm the presence of DPG and cetylpyridinium chloride in the causative gloves by using a modified method for the analysis.

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown that rubbing hands with an alcohol/chlorhexidine {{solution}} provides equivalent microbial decontamination to a conventional surgical scrub using aqueous chlorhexidine. However, the authors believe that these studies have methodological flaws that limit their applicability to the operating theatre environment. As such, a method was developed to compare products in an everyday operating theatre environment using working operating theatre personnel. Aim: To determine whether or not an alcohol/chlorhexidine rub is as efficacious as a traditional surgical scrub using a novel method. Methods: Bacterial counts at baseline were collected from 20 anaesthetists using the <b>glove</b> juice <b>method.</b> Subsequently, with sequential exchange of sterile gloves, one hand underwent a 3 -min scrub using 4 % aqueous chlorhexidine, and the other hand underwent a 60 -s rub with a 70 % isopropyl alcohol/ 0. 5 % chlorhexidine solution. The residual bacterial count was collected for each hand after 30 min using the <b>glove</b> juice <b>method.</b> These counts were converted to log values to compare the baseline counts of right and left hands, and efficacy between the treatment groups. Findings: Mean [± standard deviation (SD) ] bacterial counts at baseline were (log) 4. 42 ± 0. 81 for left hands and 4. 64 ± 0. 60 for right hands (P> 0. 05). The mean (± SD) reduction from baseline was (log) 1. 45 ± 0. 50 for 4 % chlorhexidine and 2. 01 ± 0. 98 for alcohol/chlorhexidine (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: An alcohol/chlorhexidine hand rub was found to be as efficacious as a traditional scrub after 30. min; this study differs from previous work as it was undertaken in a population of practising anaesthetists in their working environment. The McKenzie method allows baseline and study evaluations to be performed contemporaneously on the same individual. Each subject was his/her own control.
