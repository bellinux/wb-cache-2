He also wrote about ancient technology, exploring subjects as diverse as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organs,</b> water clocks, ancient surveying instruments, temple machinery, Greek artillery, and ancient railways.

500|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> pipe <b>organ</b> (hydraulis) was [...] "one of {{the most}} {{significant}} technical and musical achievements of antiquity", and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre, as well as stage performances.

50|$|The water organ or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> (ὕδραυλις) (early {{types are}} {{sometimes}} called hydraulos, hydraulus or hydraula) {{is a type}} of pipe organ blown by air, where the power source pushing the air is derived by water from a natural source (e.g. by a waterfall) or by a manual pump. Consequently, the water organ lacks a bellows, blower, or compressor.|$|E
50|$|After the Greeks, the hydraulis {{was adopted}} willingly by the Romans {{and then the}} Byzantines. Byzantine and Arab inventors developed, among other pieces, an {{automatic}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> (described by the Banu Musa in their 9th-century treatise Book of Ingenious Devices), a 'musical tree' at the palace of Khalif al-Muqtadir (ruled 908-32), and a long-distance <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> that could be heard from sixty miles away (described in the Arabic Sirr al-asrar and later translated into Latin by Roger Bacon). By {{the end of the}} 13th century hydraulic automata had reached Italy and the rest of Western Europe. During the Renaissance, water organs again acquired magical and metaphysical connotations among followers of the hermetic and esoteric sciences. Organs were placed in gardens, grottoes and conservatories of royal palaces and the mansions of rich patricians to delight onlookers not only with music but also with displays of automata - dancing figurines, wing-flapping birds and hammering cyclopes - all operated by projections on the musical cylinder. Other types of water organ were played out of sight and were used to simulate musical instruments apparently being played by statues in mythological scenes such as 'Orpheus playing the viol', 'The contest between Apollo and Marsyas' and 'Apollo and the nine Muses'.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> is {{unfortunately}} often {{confused with}} the hydraulis. The hydraulis {{is the name of}} a Greek instrument created by Ctesibius of Alexandria. The hydraulis has a reservoir of air which is inserted into a cistern of water. The air is pushed into the reservoir with hand pumps, and exits the reservoir as pressurized air to blow through the pipes. The reservoir is open on the bottom, allowing water to maintain the pressure on the air as the air supply fluctuates from either the pumps pushing more air in, or the pipes letting air out.|$|E
50|$|Around 1604 the Drebbel {{family moved}} to England, {{probably}} {{at the invitation of}} the new king, James I of England (VI of Scotland). He was accommodated at Eltham Palace. Drebbel worked there at the masques, that were performed by and for the court. He was attached to the court of young Renaissance crown-prince Henry. He astonished the court with his inventions (a perpetuum mobile, automatic and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organs)</b> and his optical instruments.His fame circulated through the courts of Europe. In October 1610 Drebbel and his {{family moved to}} Prague on invitation of Emperor Rudolf II, who was preoccupied with the arts, alchemy and occult sciences. Here again Drebbel demonstrated his inventions. When in 1611 Rudolf II was stripped of all effective power by his younger brother Archduke Matthias, Drebbel was imprisoned for about a year. After Rudolf's death in 1612, Drebbel was set free and went back to London. Unfortunately his patron prince Henry had also died and Drebbel was in financial trouble.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fame and}} {{glory of the}} Villa d'Este was above all {{established}} by its extraordinary system of fountains; fifty-one fountains and nymphaeums, 398 spouts, 364 water jets, 64 waterfalls, and 220 basins, fed by 875 meters of canals, channels and cascades, and all working entirely {{by the force of}} gravity, without pumps. [...] Pirro Ligorio, who was responsible for the iconographic programs worked out in the villa's frescos, was also commissioned to lay out the gardens for the villa, with the assistance of Tommaso Chiruchi of Bologna, one of the most skilled hydraulic engineers of the sixteenth century; Chiruchi had worked on the fountains at Villa Lante. At Villa d'Este he was assisted in the technical designs for the fountains by a Frenchman, Claude Venard, who was a manufacturer of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organs.</b> The result was one of the finest gardens of the Renaissance, rivaled only by the Villa Lante, the Villa Farnese at Caprarola and the Villas Aldobrandini and Torlonia in Frascati. The garden and water features were admired and imitated over the next two centuries in gardens from Portugal to Saint Petersburg.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> pipe <b>organ</b> (hydraulis), which {{worked by}} water pressure, was [...] "one {{of the most}} {{significant}} technical and musical achievements of antiquity". Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes (also see Pipe organ#History). The hydraulis accompanied gladiator contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1992, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> (ύδραυλις) was found in {{excavations}} within {{the remains of a}} building, which is situated opposite the villa of Dionysos. It {{is one of the most}} important exhibits of the museum and dates from the 2nd century AD. It corresponds to the instruments mentioned by Heron of Alexandria and Vitruvius. The organ pipes are arranged in two rows and consist of 24 additional and 16 narrower pipes. They were decorated with silver rings. The body of the organ was decorated with silver stripes and multi-colored, rectangular glass ornaments. The instrument found in Dion is the only find of its kind in Greece; It is the oldest, so far discovered specimen of the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{pipe organ}} is the grandest musical {{instrument}} {{in size and}} scope.

Along with the clock, it was {{considered one of the most}} complex human-made mechanical creations before the Industrial Revolution. Pipe organs range in size from a single short keyboard to huge instruments with over 10,000 pipes. A large modern organ typically has three or four keyboards (manuals) with five octaves (61 notes) each, and a two-and-a-half octave (32-note) pedal board.|$|E
50|$|Hedylus (Ἥδυλος, Hḗdylos), son of Melicertus and Hedyle, {{a native}} of Samos or Athens, was an epigrammatic poet. His epigrams were {{included}} in the Garland of Meleager (Prooem. 45.) Eleven of them are in the Greek Anthology, but the genuineness of two of these (ix. and x.) is very doubtful. Most of his epigrams are in praise of wine, and all of them are jocular. In some he describes the dedicatory offerings in the temple of Arsinoe, among which he mentions the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> of Ctesibius. Besides this indication of his time, we know that he was the contemporary and rival of Callimachus and friend of Poseidippus of Pella. He lived therefore in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and is to be classed with the Alexandrian school of poets. According to Athenaeus, he killed himself for love of a certain Glaucus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Archbishop of Esztergom György Lippay's summer {{residence}} and garden in Pozsony (Bratislava) were represented {{on a series}} of engravings published in 1663. According to the dedication text on the title page, the series originally consisted of twenty sheets only four of which survive, along with two copies of the title page (see Appendix I. 1 – 5). The prints were made after the drawings by Johann Jacob Khün, the archbishop's court artist. Khün's mark is discernable on a recently recovered copy of the title page (a later imprint of the original plate). The engravings were executed by Mauritius Lang of Augsburg. Descriptions of the missing sheets are included in Notitia Hungariae Novae Geographico Historica by Mátyás Bél. The idea behind redecorating the garden and commissioning the engravings is conveyed by the motto on the title page: “Haec dicit Dominus Deus: Tu signaculum similitudinis, plenus sapientiâ et perfectus decore in delitiis paradisi Dei fuisti. ” (Ez 28 : 12 – 19). The biblical allusion points to a chain of ideas typical mainly of encyclopedic works representing the versatility of the created universe. Man is like God in his wisdom; his works, made from the wonders of created nature, are the results of repeated and ongoing creation themselves, reflecting the fullness and beauty of Paradise. The garden's most detailed contemporary description is given by Johann Sebastian Müller, ambassador of Saxe-Weimar, who visited the garden in 1660. Contemporary visitors as well as Mátyás Bél praise the multitude of scientific mechanisms in the garden: machines and automatons producing motion and musical effects, giochi d'acqua — type phenomena, and catoptrical constructions. The Mount Parnassus in the south-west corner of the garden was inspired by an engraving in Les raisons des forces mouvantes by Salomon de Caus (1615), showing a paraphrased version of the artificial hill in the garden of the Villa Medici in Pratolino. According to Müller, Lippay's Parnassus probably hid a water organ, a symbol of status from the 1560 s well into the mid- 17 th century, especially favoured by the Papal court and the college of cardinals. Its most celebrated specimen was attached to the Parnassus in the water theatre of Villa Aldobrandini in Frascati. This construction was populated by figurines of Apollo and the Musae, imitating the sound and movement of a whole orchestra, just like Lippay's Parnassus. Manual <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organs</b> and constructions imitating the sound of wind instruments and birdsong are known from Heron's works. Their modern automatic versions (brought up to date according to the Pratolino model) featured in De Caus's treatises and in the derivative works of Jesuit scientists Athanasius Kircher (Musurgia universalis, 1650) and Caspar Schott (Mechanica hydraulico-pneumatica, 1657). Such constructions were hidden in two niches in the ground floor arcades (“inferior galleria”) of Lippay's {{summer residence}}. One niche displayed figurines of singing sirens surrounding a bagpipe player, the other artificial ruins equipped with a hydromechanical machine imitating birdsong. When Kircher dedicated the chapter on Egyptians' mechanical and architectural knowledge in his Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1653) to Lippay, he referred to the machinae hydraulicae of the garden as most representative of his patron's expertise in mathematics. Another area of mathematicae mixtae was represented in Lippay's garden by spectacular phenomena caused by catoptrical and dioptrical mechanisms, belonging to the category of magia catoptrica. The man behind these was Zachias Traber SJ (1611 – 1679), professor of mathematics at the University of Nagyszombat (Trnava) and later at Vienna. As an expert mainly on optics, Traber spent years in Lippay's court playing a definitive role in redecorating and mechanizing the garden. He also took part in planning and executing the hydraulic constructions, such as the waterworks of the grotto which were shooting a jet of water 50 feet up into the air. His treatise Nervus opticus, based on the writings of Kircher and Schott, was published in Vienna in 1675. It contains detailed and illustrated descriptions of Traber's catoptrical constructions planned for Lippay (see Appendix II). In the upper niches in the walls of the grotto, a variety of “miraculous metamorphoses” (mirae metamorphoses Catoptricae) were located. These could be brought about by mirrors joined to each other at different angles, effecting distorted reflections of the figures of “woodland gods” standing in the niches or those of the spectators, making them appear as monsters. Their construction was probably motivated by a chapter of Kircher's Ars magna lucis et umbrae, which gives a description of the same metamorphoses created by the so-called multividium in the Museum Kircherianum. Traber also designed a theatrum catoptricum for Lippay. Descriptions of the early modern version of this contraption are provided by Kircher, Schott, and Traber after Giovanni Battista della Porta. The famous theatrum catoptricum in the Stanza del Centauro of the Villa Borghese was similar to the one in Lippay's garden. Kircher's celebrated theatrum polydicticum was presented in the Roman College museum. The hermitage in Lippay's garden had a peephole cave, equipped with a magnifying lense, showing scenes from the lives of holy anchorites. This was the work of Gervasius Mattmüller (c. 1593 – 1668), the famous Viennese court optician. Traber knew Mattmüller personally, several sources testify to their professional cooperation. Traber probably contributed to acquiring and installing the construction. In his own treatise, he presents a different version using the magnifying effect of concave mirrors. Lippay's speculum polygonum planoconcavum, made from 16 mirrors, probably came from Mattmüller's workshop as well. This mirror, according to Müller's account, multiplied the light of candles placed in front of it and probably served to illuminate parts of the garden or the upper rooms of the building at night. Traber demonstrates the Aristotelian explanation of the rainbow relying on arguments based on his experiences in Lippay's garden, with an illustration of one of two fountains, that were erected in the the archbishop's garden between 1660 – 63, probably with the contribution of Traber. The two fountains are represented on separate plates in the series of engravings depicting the garden. The engravings present the most spectacular effect produced by the fountains: the rainbow appearing on water-dust. The rainbow here is more than a beautiful phenomenon evoking the traditional symbolism associated with its appearance. It is a scientific experiment set up to prove a scientific statement. It is meant to herald the wisdom and scientific erudition of the garden's owner. It also points to a deep knowledge of natura pictrix by presenting the artificial recreation of the only aerial phenomenon which can be recreated at all. As a sort of catoptrical showroom, Lippay's garden was a unique one in Central Europe. Its decoration was derived from the displays in the appropriate department of the Museum Kircherianum. The new guide to interpreting the Museum's catoptric instruments was provided by the works of Kircher and Schott. Catoptric compositions, executed through reliance on classical authors, were no longer to be regarded as supernatural miracles. They were constructions producing artificial versions of natural effects. Through these constructions, God's infinite wisdom and the perfection of creation were made manifest, together with the intellectual talent of their engineer or owner. Divine wisdom and human intellect were put on the same plane. No matter how simple or complex they might be, all catoptric phenomena in the archbishop's garden tend towards this ideological conclusion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} ancient string and {{percussion}} instruments with additional {{focus on a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ,</b> an instrument {{that is difficult to}} categorize. The first part of the thesis is a follow-up to the bachelor thesis Wind Instruments of Ancient Greece and Rome, which is devoted to wind instruments, and deals with the classification, description and evolution of the instruments of the other two instrumental groups. This is illustrated on the background of literary, archaeological and iconographic sources, especially on the vase painting. Vase painting well demonstrates the shape, evolution and regional occurrence of these instruments. In the second part of this thesis the Attic and southern Italy vase paintings will be used to compare musical culture in both of these areas. In Attic music scenes the chronological evolution of depicted instruments is examined, while in southern Italian scenes we will concentrate on the differences of depicted instruments in the regions of Campania, Lucania, Sicily, Paestum and Apulia. Finally, the Attic musical instruments are compared with the instruments of southern Italy. The results of the analyses will be entered into graphs.

40|$|Gerbert of Aurillac {{lived at}} the end of the millenium {{preceding}} our own. He was born an obscure peasant. But by virtue of his excellent education, political acumen and good fortune, he ascended to the highest post in Christendom, becoming Pope Sylvester II {{at the end of}} the tenth century. His meteoric rise in power helped bring about the genesis of "the legend of Gerbert" after his death. A renowned teacher, Gerbert was accomplished in all the liberal arts and distinguished himself in nearly every field of human endeavor. It was in the context of his role as a teacher and a mathematician that he acquired a reputation as an organbuilder. Among his contributions in that area is a treatise on pipe measurements which is attributed to him in a 12 th-century manuscript. Gerbert's reputation as an organbuilder has rested mainly, however, not on any actual deeds he may have accomplished, but on the testimony of William of Malmesbury, a 12 th-century English historian. William completed the legend surrounding Gerbert's life, which began in the eleventh century. In the course of his narrative, William credited Gerbert with having built a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>organ</b> in the cathedral of Reims. William's account of the organ is examined in its context, perhaps for the first time. This study reveals that William's account must be dismissed as pure fancy. A feature unique to this study is the use of sources from a variety of disciplines. In order not to present a one-dimensional (and therefore false) appraisal of Gerbert as an organbuilder, we have examined him in his various roles as letter-writer, mathematician, scientist, politician and churchman. Only when we know Gerbert in the context of his life and times can we make a valid assessment of his contribution to the art and craft of organbuilding...|$|E
