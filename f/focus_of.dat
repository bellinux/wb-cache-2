40|$|The paper aims {{to further}} {{knowledge}} of proactive employee behaviour by exploring whether pro-organizational, prosocial, and pro-self focused proactive behaviour {{can be measured}} in an empirically distinct manner, and whether these types of proactive behaviour show differential relationships with other variables. Results of two multi-source studies using self-rated and peer-rated measures empirically support the distinctiveness <b>of</b> the different <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> proactive behaviour. Study 1 (N = 117 dyads) shows that the different <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> proactive behaviour are differentially related to different <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> affective commitment. Study 2 (N = 126 dyads) builds on these findings and shows that different <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> proactive behaviour have differential relationships with transformational leadership, goal orientations, and individual task performance...|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> the {{collapse}} energy {{is well established}} for the case of collective collapse of cloud cavitation. It has been indicated however that erosion can also be generated by cavities that stay glassy until a very late stage of {{the collapse}}, a circumstance implying that <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> energy should be analyzed also {{for this type of}} cavities. In this study, the concept <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> the collapse energy has been applied in practical observations as a procedure for analysis of erosive cavities. From some experiments, it was found that glassy cavities can, as focusing cavities, be closely related to the generation of severe erosion. A simplified cascading process <b>of</b> the <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> collapse energy is also assumed for the glassy cavity. Furthermore, erosion tests results showed that any type of fluctuations in the <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> the collapse energy lead to a decrease of the collapse pressure and thus a decrease of the erosion...|$|R

40|$|This book {{deals with}} the subject of optical and {{electronic}} negative refraction (NR) and negative index materials NIM). Diverse approaches for achieving NR and NIM are covered, such as using photonic crystals, phononic crystals, split-ring resonators (SRRs) and continuous media, <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> waves, guided-wave behavior, and nonlinear effects. Specific topics treated are polariton theory for LHMs (left handed materials), <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> waves, guided-wave behavior, nonlinear optical effects, magnetic LHM composites, SRR-rod realizations, low-loss guided-wave bands using SRR-rods unit cells as LHMs, NR of electromagnetic and electronic waves in uniform media, field distributions in LHM guided-wave structures, dielectric and ferroelectric NR bicrystal heterostructures, LH metamaterial photonic-crystal lenses, subwavelength <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> LHM/NR photonic crystals, <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> sound with NR and NIMs, and LHM quasi-crystal materials for focusing...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Leukaemic {{patients}} receiving intensive chemotherapy and patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) are routinely screened for oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection to reduce infectious complications that could occur during therapy. In this prospective study we assessed {{the effect of}} leaving chronic oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection untreated {{on the development of}} infectious complications in intensively treated haematological patients. METHODS: We included and prospectively evaluated all intensively treated leukaemic patients and patients undergoing ASCT who were referred to our medical centre between September 2012 and May 2014, and who matched the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Acute oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection were removed before chemotherapy or ASCT, whereas chronic oral foci were left untreated. RESULTS: In total 28 leukaemic and 35 ASCT patients were included. Acute oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection were found in 2 leukaemic (7 %) and 2 ASCT patients (6 %), and chronic oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection in 24 leukaemic (86 %) and 22 ASCT patients (63 %). Positive blood cultures with microorganisms potentially originating from the oral cavity occurred in 7 patients during treatment, but were uneventful on development of infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study supports the hypothesis that chronic oral <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> infection can be left untreated as this does not increase infectious complications during intensive chemotherapy.

40|$|Replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimeric {{single-stranded}} DNA binding protein, {{is required}} for recombination, and stimulates homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange promoted in vitro by human recombination protein HsRad 51. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that purified RPA interacts physically with HsRad 51, {{as well as with}} HsDmc 1, the homolog that is expressed specifically in meiosis. The interaction with HsRad 51 was mediated by the 70 kDa subunit of RPA, and according to experiments with deletion mutants, this interaction required amino acid residues 169 - 326. In exponentially growing mammalian cells, 22 % <b>of</b> nuclei showed <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> RPA protein and 1 - 2 % showed <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> Rad 51. After gamma-irradiation, the percentage of cells with RPA foci increased to approximately 50 %, and those with Rad 51 foci to 30 %. All of the cells with <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> Rad 51 had <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> RPA, and in those cells the two proteins co-localized in a high fraction <b>of</b> <b>foci.</b> The interactions <b>of</b> human RPA with Rad 51, replication proteins and DNA are suited to the linking of recombination to replication...|$|R
