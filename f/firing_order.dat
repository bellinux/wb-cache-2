5|$|Each level {{starts with}} the quantity, types, and <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are {{eliminated}} after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed {{as well as for}} damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players may re-attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars.|$|E
25|$|Four-stroke radials have an {{odd number}} of {{cylinders}} per row, so that a consistent every-other-piston <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> can be maintained, providing smooth operation. For example, on a five-cylinder engine the <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> is 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 and back to cylinder 1. Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression. The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform. If an even {{number of cylinders}} were used, an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible. The prototype radial Zoche aero-diesels (below) have an even number of cylinders, either four or eight; {{but this is not}} problematic, because they are two-stroke engines, with twice the number of power strokes as a four-stroke engine.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{historic and}} contemporary documents about the Ten Standard <b>Fire</b> <b>Orders</b> in the Lessons Learned Center Library and elsewhere, {{to examine how}} justifications for these traditional safety rules have changed over time. Using ethical theory as a lens for analysis, the paper shows how the original <b>Fire</b> <b>Orders</b> attempted to codify an individual “virtue ethic ” for firefighter safety traditionally managed through narrative write-ups. However, their introduction simultaneously ushered in an individual “duty ethic ” that would come to eclipse the virtue ethic over time. The findings from the South Canyon fire accident investigation reflect an organization at odds with whether it manages safety as a virtue or safety as a duty. The 2002 revision of the <b>Fire</b> <b>Orders</b> {{is said to be}} a return to basics. Whereas the early <b>Fire</b> <b>Orders</b> were intended to harness individual loyalty to the group as a way to repair defects in individual thinking, the analysis shows how the new <b>Fire</b> <b>Orders</b> are intended to function as a resource for individuals to repair defects in group reasoning. Therefore, while the new <b>Fire</b> <b>Orders</b> may indeed attempt to recover a virtue ethic, it is a distinctly organizational one. However, this is at odds with investigations that attribute accidents to violations, which a view that is more compatible with an individual duty ethic...|$|R

50|$|To {{calculate}} {{the total number}} of <b>firing</b> <b>orders</b> possible requires only simple combinatorics; specifically: circular permutations. <b>Firing</b> <b>orders</b> are cyclic, or circular; so 1-2-3 is the same as 2-3-1 etc. This means {{the total number of}} permutations can be reduced by a factor of the number of cylinders; five in this case.|$|R
25|$|The precise {{details of}} how a British Prime Minister would {{authorise}} a nuclear strike remain secret, although {{the principles of the}} Trident missile control system is believed {{to be based on the}} plan set up for Polaris in 1968, which has now been declassified. A closed-circuit television system was set up between 10 Downing Street and the SSBN Control Officer at the Northwood Headquarters of the Royal Navy. Both the Prime Minister and the SSBN Control Officer would be able to see each other on their monitors when the command was given. If the link failed – for instance during a nuclear attack or when the PM was away from Downing Street – the Prime Minister would send an authentication code which could be verified at Northwood. The PM would then broadcast a <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> to the SSBN submarines via the Very Low Frequency radio station at Rugby. The UK has not deployed control equipment requiring codes to be sent before weapons can be used, such as the U.S. Permissive Action Link, which if installed would preclude the possibility that military officers could launch British nuclear weapons without authorisation.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional <b>firing</b> <b>order,</b> which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E
500|$|Any {{target with}} a high {{probability}} was then passed to the Battery Control Data Processor (BCDP), which selected missiles and radars for an attack. This started with the assignment of a Target Tracking Radar (TTR) to a target passed to it from the DCC. TTRs operated in the C band from 5250–5750MHz at 10MW, allowing tracking of a 0.1m2 target at , a range they expected {{to be able to}} double with a new maser-based receiver design. Once targets were being successfully tracked and a <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> was received, the BCDP selected available Zeus missiles for launch and assigned a Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) to follow them. These were much smaller radars operating in the X-band between 8500–9600MHz and assisted by a transponder on the missile, using only 300kW to provide missile tracking to [...] The wide variety of available frequencies allowed up to 450 MTRs to be operating in a single Defense Center. Information from the ZDR, TTR and MRTs was all fed to the Target Intercept Computer (TIC) which handled the interceptions. This used twistor memory for ROM and core memory for RAM. Guidance commands were sent to the missiles in-flight via modulation of the MTR signal.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{available}} engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic {{engine control}} unit (ECU), with cylinder bank selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda mixture control via intake air volume metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol. Fuel was delivered to the combustion chambers via eight intake manifold-sited electronic fuel injectors, fed from two common fuel rails (one per cylinder bank), and were sequentially 'fired' or activated {{in accordance with the}} engine's <b>firing</b> <b>order.</b> [...] Whilst the 3.6V8 was able to use 95RON (91AKI) fuel, for the 4.2V8, the more expensive 98RON (93AKI) 'SuperPlus' unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output. The usage of 95RON in the 4.2V8 resulted in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.|$|E

50|$|Evenly spaced <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> (also called even <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> or even firing interval) {{means that}} the angle between each firing is equal.

On the other hand, engines with unevenly spaced <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> (sometimes called odd <b>firing</b> <b>order)</b> not all angles between firings are equal, for example a six-cylinder engine with unevenly spaced <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> can have a combination of 90° and 150° firing intervals compared to a six-cylinder engine with even <b>firing</b> <b>order</b> which must have 720° / 6 = 120° firing interval.|$|E
