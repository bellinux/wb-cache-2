25|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of mining technology, the cone crusher {{can be divided}} into four types: compound cone crusher, spring cone crusher, hydraulic cone crusher and <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher.</b> According to different models, the cone crusher is divided into VSC series cone crusher (compound cone crusher), Symons cone crusher, PY cone crusher, single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher,</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|A <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> {{is similar}} in basic concept to a jaw crusher, {{consisting}} of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it is small enough to fall out through {{the gap between the}} two surfaces.|$|E
25|$|A {{cone crusher}} {{is similar in}} {{operation}} to a <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher,</b> with less steepness in the crushing chamber {{and more of a}} parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening {{at the bottom of the}} crusher.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{crushing}} {{and screening}} models {{are essential for}} the meaningful simulation of ore dressing plants such as the iron ore beneficiation plant studies in this work. Crushing and screening models were studies, developed and enhanced. The basic simulator used was Microsim, which was subsequently expanded to incorporate these new models. The models were then evaluated individually. The Whiten crushing model was modified for haematite, as this is a particularly hard ore. A new model was developed for the gyradisc crushing of haematite, with two interparticle breakage mechanisms {{taking place in the}} crushing chamber. The gyradisc model has only the crusher closed side setting as parameter. Both models showed good agreement with experimental data. The Karra screen model was enhanced to include the use of ‘poly’ decks and non-square screen apertures, as used on the plant. The Rose efficiency model was developed to use efficiencies from plant data or experiments. The Rose model showed a better relative accuracy than the entirely empirical enhanced Karra model. The screen models developed can be used for different ores but the crushing models are not transferable. Thereafter simulation was done for the quaternary sub-plant manufacturing two or three products respectively. The product ratios obtained by simulation were accurate in both cases. The optimization routine was then used to calculate an improved fine to lumpy ore ratio. It was found that only a small improvement could be achieved in the quaternary plant. Simulation of the preliminary comminution plant, however, failed to give accurate results. This plant does not operate in steady state, therefore the error could be ascribed to this. The accuracy of the Nordberg <b>gyratory</b> <b>crushing</b> model used in this sub-plant could not be established. The washing and screening plant was successfully simulated with the new screening models. The choice of size classes was found to be very important in the simulation of crushing and screening circuits. The maximum number must be used and should coincide with screen apertures. Microsim {{has proved to be a}} powerful simulator subject, to the quality of input data and evaluative skills of the user.

25|$|A <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} types of primary crushers in a mine or ore {{processing}} plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.|$|E

The project aimed to show whether there were functional relationships between the input data in the primary crushing phase (gap size (mm), feed size distribution, throughput (t/hr) and ore type) with the output data (product size distribution and power draw). The effect that changing the gap size has on the product size distribution was investigated for the <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> using the {{software package}} JKSimMet.

40|$|Gyratory crushers are {{frequently}} used for first stage sizing in the minerals processing industry and are typically critical path fixed plant equipment. Hence any associated downtime or inefficient operation can have serious consequences for downstream processing {{and therefore the}} overall plant productivity. Despite the pressing requirement to tightly control <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> operation, no accurate, reliable, cost efficient, or practical condition monitoring tools or holistic performance assessment methods have been utilized by practitioners to date. This paper introduces a new method combining laser scanning based CrusherMapperTM software 3 D liner shape information and Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling to assess the effect of measured concave and mantle liner wear on <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> production. In order to illustrate this effect, two DEM models of an iron ore case study site are presented, one based on the 3 D shape of newly installed liners, and the second on that of very worn liner geometry as {{at the time of}} replacement. The Bonded Particle Model (BPM) approach is used for modelling the rock material during the crushing sequence inside the crusher and other relevant DEM crushing parameters closely resemble actual production settings. A comparison between resulting modelling output parameters for the two liner geometries provides the basis for aligning actual with desired operational crusher performance...|$|E

This paper accounts for a closely controlled experimental program aimed at clarifying the variation of aggregate shape with two parameters, <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> setting and feed grading. The results show that crusher setting has a significant influence on the flakiness index of produced elementary size fractions, {{which is not the}} case for spread size fractions. Moreover, a variation of the proportions of feed fraction constituents has no significant influence on the flakiness index of produced aggregates, whereas a variation of the spreading or size of the feed fraction has. Regarding the shape characteristics of particles, it has been observed that the dimensions of a particle were not related, but flat particles are elongated, and vice versa. Finally, it has been observed that flakiness index varies conversely with the size of produced aggregate...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to determine}} the size distribution curve of the ROM was developed in a Brazilian iron ore mine. The size of the larger fragments was determined taking photographs and setting {{the scale of the}} images to analyze their dimensions (length of their edges and areas). This was implemented according to a specific protocol of sampling that involves split and homogenization stages in situ of a considerable quantity of ore (about 259 metric tonnes). During the sampling process, larger fragments were separated and smaller size material was screened. The methodology was developed initially in order to preview the performance of a primary <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> that is fed directly from trucks. Operational conditions of the equipment such as closed and open-side settings could be adjusted previously, obtaining different product size distributions. Variability of size of the fragments affects subsequent stages of crushing and can increase circulating load in the circuit. This leads to a decrease of productivity or recovery of the ore dressing. The results showed insignificant errors of accuracy and reproducibility of the sampling protocol when applied to friable itabirite rocks...|$|E
40|$|Chadormalo mine is one {{the most}} {{significant}} iron mines in Iran which its products is used in steel making factory. A mineral processing plant with three semi-autogenous (SAG) mills, 9. 7 m in diameter and 4 m in width, produces iron concentrates using Chadormalo ore. Each SAG mill has about 400 t/h capacity which a <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> feeds them. The aim of this project was to estimate the breakage indices, selection and breakage functions of Chadormalo samples. To do that the required samples from feed of SAG mill within 10 various days were taken, and after size reduction, experiments were carried out. The tests results were then applied into the BFDS software to estimate selection and breakage functions in three different methods; Berube, Herbst, and modified Herbst methods. The experiments were performed in a laboratory ball mill, using materials in various size fractions: - 5 mm+ 6 mesh, - 6 + 10, - 10 + 14, - 14 + 18, - 18 + 30, - 30 + 40, - 40 + 50, and - 50 + 70 mesh. It was achieved that the maximum value of selection function is 0. 00729 sec- 1 for the size of - 14 + 18 mesh, which indicates the most selectivity of particles in this size to be broken.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work was to investigate on the ball filling estimation of Miduk semi-autogenous (SAG) Mill via an utilized method. Miduk copper concentrator is located in Kerman Province, Iran, and its size reduction stage includes one <b>gyratory</b> <b>crusher</b> which feeds one SAG mill (9. 75 dia.

After SAG mill, a trommel screen produces two over and under size materials which the oversize part is circulated into SAG mill and undersize reports to hydrocyclone for further process. Ball filling identify was implemented in this work using mill`s load sampling and ball abrasion test. These methods could estimate ball filling variation with easy, undeniable, and useful tests. Also, these tests have shown the digression of operating ball filling amount and its manual designed. To make more homogenous load, mill load samplings were carried out from 6 points after whirling the mill via inching motor. Acquired load sampling results were compared with ball abrasion tests. Ball abrasion tests were calculated for 3 different conditions include maximum, average, and minimum ball abrasion. However, the calculated maximum and minimum conditions never occurred. However, these are just for obtaining to ball filling variation in the mill. The results obtained from this work show, the ball filling percentage variation is between 1. 2 – 3. 7 % which is lower than mill ball filling percentage, according to the designed conditions (15 %).
