40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} automatic facility containing two <b>interactive</b> <b>microprocessors,</b> peripherals, and {{an optical}} bench {{was used to}} obtain device characteristics for use in evaluating CID's as the sensor element in a prospective star tracker application. Each of the ST- 256 chips tested contains a 256 x 256 pixel element array with 65536 picture elements. Two ST- 256 devices were tested at 20 C under light levels of 10 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 01 % saturation, and in darkness. The saturation level was established at 0. 95 microwatts sq cm {{as measured by the}} radiometeric sensor. Two test runs under each condition were performed for each chip. Two complete sets of data for each of the devices were thus obtained. A separate data field was used to store the results of each test condition. Repetitive runs of a test condition were stored sequentially in the same file. Examination of the data using print-outs is shown in examples...|$|E
40|$|The TIME Project of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications {{is using}} <b>interactive</b> videodisc, <b>microprocessor</b> and voice {{recognition}} technology to create patient simulations {{for use in}} the training of medical students. These interactive case studies embody dramatic, lifelike portrayals of the social and medical conditions of a patient and allow uncued, verbal intervention by the student for independent clinical decisions...|$|R
40|$|QUIZ is an {{interactive}} computer program {{which allows the}} as-sembly of objective tests. Fully conversational, the program enables the user to construct tests composed of items disproportionately sampled from up to 20 subsections of a master item bank. WITHIN the past several years, in consequence of the accelerated development of the <b>microprocessor,</b> <b>interactive</b> modes of operation on smaller and more affordable computers have become more readily available to teachers and researchers. This development suggests the worthwhileness of developing computer programs, operable on small and medium-size minicomputers, which will effect some of the tedious but common tasks that educators face. One such task is that of com-piling objective tests to assess student acquisition of cognitive skills. Recent trends in individualizing instruction through models of teach-ing incorporating the mastery-based test model have considerably strengthened {{the need for such}} a facility, as they necessitate the ready availability of multiple test forms from different content domains. Several computer-based test generation systems have been de-scribed in the literature (for example, Christensen, 1979; Gleich, 1979; Gorth, Allen, and Grayson, 1971). As these systems have generally been large in scale, they have not been readily adaptable to the needs of individual teachers. Furthermore, these systems have been exces-sively costly for small-scale use. Two articles have recently appeared in Educational and Psychological Measurement which describe ex...|$|R
40|$|The Naval Postgraduate School {{recognizes that}} the {{experimental}} approach {{is very important in}} education, especially in the basic sciences and in engineering. Graduate students in the U. S. Navy and in the other services need a "hands-on" experience {{in order to be able}} to validate assumptions, to verify complex analytical models, and to explore new fundamental knowledge. Since the Naval Postgraduate School is dedicated to educating for the future needs of the Naval Service, it is essential that a laboratory experience export students to the instruments which will allow the measurement of complex phenomena to be made and which may advance to fleet operations in the years ahead. During the past two decades, significant technological advances have occurred in numerous fields which must be incorporated into graduate curricula. New measuring systems using lasers and advanced optics, recent developments in communications and signal processing equipment, and the advancement of computerized data processors for measurement and control must all be treated. In addition, students should be exposed to and have an appreciation for the current high resolution, low noise, and fast response instrumentation available. The dramatic accomplishments in the areas of <b>microprocessors,</b> <b>interactive</b> computer graphics, and computer-aided design especially deserve attention. This document provides an updated source of information concerning present laboratory capabilities and activities at the Naval Postgraduate School with plans for future changes/additions. Many of the laboratories are used for teaching. as well as for research; some, however, are used solely for teaching, while others are uniquely related to ongoing faculty and student research programs. Our laboratories vary widely with regard to size of the facilities utilized, type of operation (e. g., the same use of chemical versus the routine operation of computer terminals), location (e. g. on campus versus mobile labs such as the research vessel ACANIA), type of equipment/instrumentation used, etc. The information provided in this document has been catalogued by academic department. In assessing objectives and future directions, some reference to the Naval Postgraduate School curricular programs is necessary. The identification of specific laboratories with curricular programs is therefore included...|$|R
