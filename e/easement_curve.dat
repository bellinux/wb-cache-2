50|$|A velodrome is {{an arena}} for track cycling. Modern velodromes feature steeply banked oval tracks, {{consisting}} of two 180-degree circular bends connected by two straights. The straights transition to the circular turn through a moderate <b>easement</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
50|$|On early railroads {{this instant}} {{application}} of lateral force {{was not an}} issue since low speeds and wide-radius curves were employed (lateral forces on the passengers and the lateral sway was small and tolerable). As speeds of rail vehicles increased over the years, it became obvious that an easement is necessary so that the centripetal acceleration increases linearly with the traveled distance. Given the expression of centripetal acceleration , the obvious solution is to provide an <b>easement</b> <b>curve</b> whose curvature, , increases linearly with the traveled distance. This geometry is an Euler spiral.|$|E
25|$|The Manawatu Railway Company railway {{when first}} {{constructed}} {{was a single}} track railway with crossing loops at principal stations to allow opposing trains to pass. In the 1920s the need for extra train services on the line was recognised, both to increase the tonnage of goods trains and to allow more frequent suburban passenger services. To {{increase the number of}} trains that the line could carry, duplication and electrification of the line along with other improvements, such as <b>curve</b> <b>easements,</b> was planned and progressed in stages.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{track in}} Playa del Rey was banked at a 3:1 pitch (about 20 degrees), but later tracks were built with higher banking and some {{motorcycle}} tracks were banked up to 60 degrees. [...] Even though {{the physics of}} such track designs were intuitively obvious, {{it was not until}} construction of the Beverly Hills track in 1919 that builders began to incorporate engineering knowledge that had been known to railroads for decades. At Beverly Hills, designer Art Pillsbury, who eventually worked on {{more than half of the}} championship-caliber board tracks nationwide, first employed the Searle Spiral <b>Easement</b> <b>Curve,</b> and the effect on car handling was pronounced. [...] According to Pillsbury, a correctly engineered track could be driven without steering input from the driver - the car would steer itself, simply due to the track geometry.|$|E
5000|$|The Speedway Association {{consisted}} of eleven members around a nucleus of racer Cliff Durant (son of General Motors' William C. Durant) and William Danziger of the Rodeo Land and Water Company, and included future three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Louis Meyer. [...] The group purchased land from a bean farmer at $1,000 per acre (0.40 ha) in 1919 and began work once the farmer had harvested his crop.The circular Motordrome in Playa del Rey {{had been built}} by contractor Jack Prince, a British former bicycle racer who was given {{the work on the}} strength of his experience building velodromes. [...] Prince had subsequently built a number of oval tracks, many of which suffered from badly designed transitions between the straightaways and curves. [...] The Association's civil engineer, Art Pillsbury, turned to Prince for consultation, found that he was a capable builder but was [...] "quite innocent of any engineering knowledge," [...] and so resorted to a method used by railroads, called the Searle Spiral <b>Easement</b> <b>Curve,</b> to design the track's layout and contours.|$|E

This paper adopts finite element method to carry out three-dimensional finite element simulation analysis for Longhai railway separate overpass. Researching variation law of the overpass’s stress and displacement in construction process and operating process. Analysis results show that, structure of Longhai railway separate overpass is reasonable, force of overpass structure is explicit, it meets the requirements for engineering. Project Summary The upper structure of Longhai railway separate overpass is prefabricated prestressed concrete continuous box girder, its size is 2 （ 5 m× 35 m）+ 3 m× 35 m+ 2 （ 5 m× 35 m）. The lower structure is pillar pier, the foundation is bored piles, the abutment is rib platform.

40|$|During {{the project}} for {{generating}} a mathematical algorithm for autonomous vehicles, a sample road which included different turns and scenarios was required. Studying different types of roads and their line equations Euler spirals, also known as Clothoids {{were found to be}} the best solution for designing new roads suitable for autonomous vehicles. During 19 th century Arthur Talbot derived the equation of Clothoids to be used as an <b>easement</b> <b>curve</b> for the purpose of avoiding shock and disagreeable lurch of trains, due to instant change of direction. The Euler Spiral is a curve whose degree-of-curve increases directly with the distance along the curve from the start point of the spiral. This provides a linear change in the steering angle required by the driver to go through the turn. In other words for a car traveling on a Clothoid transition road curve {{there is no need for}} sudden changes in the steering angle of the wheels. The angle required starts from zero and increases to a maximum value and goes back to zero linearly. This provides a very comfortable ride for the passengers of the vehicle. The use of these curves for road design have been investigated, and a design chart have been proposed to be used for finding the best suitable transition curve for different applications...|$|E
