500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her that I did not like her, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E

(quotation {{referring}} to Jan Karski and Felix Frankfurter: When Jan Karski disclosed {{the message of}} Nazis' slaughtering of the Jews, the U.S. Supreme Court judge Felix Frankfurter's response to a Polish diplomat was, [...] "Mr. Ambassador, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> this young man is lying. I said I am unable to believe him. There is a difference.") [...] Harry Wu's quote, is anecdotal and its accuracy is suspect. There is, however, no substantive {{difference between the two}} quotations, the one cited above and the filmed interview given by Karski himself in 1978.|$|E

2500|$|August {{would also}} be a tough month for the other Rangers ace Cliff Lee, whose record for the month was 1–6. Lee was also accused by ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd {{claiming}} people close to Lee said he wanted to sign with the Yankees or another elite team, that Lee didn't care about Texas, and Cowherd also accused Lee of mailing it in against Baltimore on August 21, a game in which Lee gave up 8 runs. After the August 22 game Lee told reporters [...] "It's a lie. Write that. Are you writing? Write that it's a lie. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that and nobody close to me would say that. Either say who the source is or shut up because I am saying it is not true." [...] Following the events in Baltimore Lee would lose his next two games before reporting that he was having muscle pain in his back and would receive an injection.|$|E

I replied that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written it and it was so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> what I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we know very well, tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Gove's {{key points}} were rebuffed by the {{academics}} that Gove {{had used to}} support his thesis. Gove had criticised Cambridge professor Sir Richard Evans saying his views were more like that of an undergraduate cynic in a Footlights review. Instead he urged people to listen to Margaret MacMillan of Oxford University. MacMillan responded, saying: [...] "I agree with some of what Mr Gove says, but he is mistaking myths for rival interpretations of history. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say,</b> as Mr Gove suggests, that British soldiers in the First World War were consciously fighting for a western liberal order. They were just defending their homeland and fighting {{what they saw as}} German militarism." [...] Evans said Gove's attack was [...] "ignorant" [...] and asked how anyone could possibly say Britons were fighting for freedom given their country's main ally was Tsarist Russia. Jeremy Paxman said Gove had [...] "wilfully misquoted" [...] Evans {{on the subject of the}} First World War.|$|E

[...] In 2004, Joe Higgins {{described}} Ahern's response to questions as [...] "like playing handball against a hay stack. You hear a dull thud but the ball never comes back to you". Ahern features as one of the main characters portrayed in spoof radio comic strips Gift Grub and Nob Nation. The fortnightly magazine The Phoenix featured [...] "De Diary of a Nortsoide Taoiseach", a satirical column written from Ahern's point of view in a phonetic transliteration of his broad north Dublin accent. His idiosyncratic delivery made Ahern a doyen of satirists and impersonators, from Dermot Morgan (in the 90's) to Mario Rosenstock (RTÉ 2 TV, 2012). Ahern was satirised in a spoof publication Bertie's little book of ethics.|$|E

"This feeling led me {{into the}} excess of being very rude to that zealous and most {{charitable}} man, Mr. Spencer, {{when he came to}} Oxford in January, 1840, to get Anglicans to set about praying for Unity.

So glad in my heart was I to see him when he came to my rooms, whither Mr. Palmer of Magdalen brought him, that I could have laughed for joy; I think I did; but I was very rude to him, I would not meet him at dinner, and that, (though <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> so,) because I considered him [...] " [...] in loco apostatx [...] " [...] from the Anglican Church, and I hereby beg his pardon for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goddard {{had already}} {{said that it would}} be his last series. Immediately after the Third Test ended, while the players were celebrating in the {{dressing}} room, one of the selectors told Goddard he had been left out of the team for the final Test now that the series was won, in order that the team should consist only of players who would be touring England later that year. The decision and its timing were widely unpopular. Peter Pollock said [...] "it was no way to say thanks to {{a man who had been}} involved almost from the start in South Africa's rise to cricketing glory". Trevor Chesterfield described it as [...] "cruel and unnecessary; an act which took some of the sparkle out of the 4–0 whitewash". The captain, Ali Bacher, said that despite the team's success, the day was [...] "one of the saddest since I first played Test cricket for South Africa". Goddard himself simply said, [...] "I wouldn't be human if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> I was disappointed. But that's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 27, 2011, Pippen {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of criticism by saying that Miami Heat star LeBron James may be a better player than Michael Jordan. This came only a day after the Heat beat the Bulls 4 games to 1 to advance to the 2011 NBA Finals. Pippen said: [...] "Michael Jordan is probably the greatest scorer to ever play the game. I may go so far as saying LeBron James may be the greatest player to ever play the game." [...] Pippen faced a backlash from Bulls fans after his comments, and even former teammates such as Horace Grant who stated in a radio interview: [...] "Wow, Pippen's my man, and we'll always be close, but I totally disagree. LeBron {{is going to be one}} of the top players to ever play the game, but Michael Jeffrey Jordan, who we bumped heads at times, is I think, the best basketball player I've ever seen." [...] In a later interview on the radio show Kap & Haugh Pippen stated: [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> I would take LeBron over Michael. The reality is you need to go back and figure out what I said." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bachmann {{brought up}} the {{interview}} before business leaders and Republicans during a campaign stop in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on October 21, 2008.

I did not, nor do I, question Barack Obama's patriotism... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American... I'm very concerned about Barack Obama's views. I don't believe that socialism {{is a good thing}} for America." [...] However, in March 2010, Bachmann said, [...] "I said I had very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views—and now I look like Nostradamus" [...] while speaking at a fund-raiser for the Susan B. Anthony List. A year later, in March 2011, Bachmann was asked on Meet the Press if she still believed that Obama held un-American views. She responded [...] "I believe that the actions of this government have, have been emblematic of ones that have not been based on true American values." [...] Pressed for clarification, she said [...] "I've already answered that question before. I said I had very serious concerns about the president's views." ...|$|E
