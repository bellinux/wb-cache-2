40|$|For {{coal mines}} the term bump should {{refer to a}} seismic event that is {{generated}} at {{some distance from the}} excavation and a burst should refer to a sudden uncontrolled fall of ground. There may be additional seismic noise generated at the excavation boundary directly associated with the fall of ground. The seismic sources for bumps {{are most likely to be}} the immediate or delayed failure of thick rock units in the overburden. For Australian coal mines, the sudden collapse of ribs should be considered to be either a strain burst in the context of the hard rock mining knowledge base or a gravity–driven kinematic failure (slump). As the depth of cover increases there is a greater thickness of <b>failed</b> <b>coal</b> at the excavation boundary and hence more material is available to be dislodged as a strain burst if the installed ground support is inadequate. Depending on the orientation of the roadway with respect to small-scale faults it is possible for wedges of coal to be defined, and these may be dislodged by a seismic bump. The dimensions of such wedges may be in excess of the maximum practical tendon length...|$|E
50|$|In 1924, Lewis a Republican, framed a {{plan for}} a three-year {{contract}} between the UMWA and the coal operators, providing for a pay rate of $7.50 per day (about $98.50 in 2015 dollars when adjusted for inflation). President Coolidge and then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover were impressed with the plan and Lewis was actually offered the post of Secretary of Labor in Coolidge's cabinet. Lewis declined, a move he later regretted. Without government support, the contract talks <b>failed</b> and <b>coal</b> operators hired non-union miners. The UMWA treasury was drained, but Lewis was able to maintain the union and his position within it. He was successful in winning the 1925 anthracite (hard coal) miners' strike by his oratorical skills.|$|R

30|$|An {{outburst}} of coal and gas is the rapid {{release of a}} large quantity of gas {{in conjunction with the}} ejection of coal and possibly associated rock, into the working face in underground coal mines. With an increase in depth of coal mining, outburst intensity and frequency tend to increase, posing more threats to lives of miners and facilities. Therefore in recent decades, the subject of outbursts has been a focus of interest in major coal-producing countries, particularly in China where some coal mines extract coal seams of greater than 1000  m depth. A number of hypothesis and theoretical models have been proposed to explain the outburst process, such as cavity theory (Briggs 1920), pocket theory (Farmer and Pooley 1967), dynamic theory (Shepherd et al. 1981) and spherical shell destabilization theory (Jiang 1998). However there is still no single theory or hypothesis that can explain the entire outburst process due to the wide variety of conditions under which outbursts occur. Field observations and laboratory studies reveal that the occurrence and development of an outburst is the result of combined effects of stress redistribution, coal gassiness and physical–mechanical properties of coal. It is generally recognized that for an outburst to occur coal must be deformed and failed under an effective stress and gas in coal must be able to desorb rapidly from the coal and eject the <b>failed</b> <b>coal</b> into a mining opening instantaneously (Lama and Bodziony 1998; Li 2001; Cao et al. 2003; Aguado and Nicieza 2007; Yuan et al. 2011; Torano et al. 2012).|$|E

30|$|The Huolinhe {{coalfield}} {{is part of}} the Bayinheshuo-Erenhot {{basin of}} Inner Mongolia (Mao and Xu 1999). Located in a graben structure of the southern section of the Daxinganling mountain ridge, it was formed in the Late Jurassic-early Cretaceous period. About 70 million tonnes of commercial coal were produced in 2015, mainly supplied to Northeast China for power generation. However, the Huolinhe <b>coal</b> <b>failed</b> to meet the requirements of long distance transportation (More than 600  km) when Interim Measures on Managements of Commercial Coal Quality has been put into act since 1 Jan. 2015 in China.

It is in great need for an industry coal preparation plant to lower the ash yield and sulfur content and increase the caloric value.|$|R
50|$|After his {{assault on}} the <b>Coaling</b> <b>failed,</b> Jackson ordered the rest of Ewell's division, {{primarily}} Trimble's brigade, to cross over the North River bridge and burn it behind them, keeping Frémont's men isolated {{to the north of}} the River. While he waited for these troops to arrive, Jackson reinforced his line with the 7th Louisiana Infantry of Taylor's brigade and ordered Taylor to make another attempt against the Union batteries. Winder perceived that the Federals were about to attack, so he ordered a preemptive charge, but in the face of point-blank volleys and running low on ammunition, the Stonewall Brigade was routed. At this point, Ewell arrived on the battlefield and ordered the 44th and 58th Virginia Infantry regiments to strike the left flank of the advancing Union battle line. Tyler's men fell back, but reorganized and drove Ewell's men into the forest south of the Coaling.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on self-developed “Triaxial Stress Thermal-hydrological-mechanical Coal Gas Permeameter”, the {{experiment}} {{of the influence}} of different unloading speeds on mechanism and gas seepage features of containing gas coal is carried out, with the condition of initial confining pressure 6 MPa and gas pressure 1. 0 MPa. It shows that: with the increasing of unloading speed of confining pressure, the time of coal maintaining at a stress plateau phase reduces, and it tends to 0, and the easier coal is to be fail After the start of unloading confining pressure, the time of coal maintaining in the stage of stress plateau showed a power function relation with unloading speed of confining pressure. In this study, the speed can be classified into three regions in text: the low speed region of unload confining pressure, the intermediate speed region and the high speed region. In the three speed regions, the confining pressure, when <b>coal</b> <b>fails,</b> is lowest in the low unloading speed of confining pressure, middle in the intermediate unloading speed region, and highest in the high unloading speed region...|$|R
30|$|Current {{knowledge}} about outbursts is drawn largely from field observations and laboratory studies (Yuan 2004, 2008). The rapid advance {{of computer technology}} has enabled the use of numerical simulations to gain useful insights on outbursts. A reliable numerical model permits certain factors to be varied such that their effect on outbursts can be studied. Along this strand of research, some {{attempts have been made}} to numerically model the process of an outburst, including mainly a phase transformation model (Litwiniszyn 1985), a gas desorption and flow model (Paterson 1986), a boundary element model (Barron and Kullmann 1990), an airway gas flow model (Otuonye and Sheng, 1994), a fracture mechanics model (Odintsev 1997), a finite element model (Xu et al. 2006), a plasticity model, and a coupled solid–fluid model (Xue et al. 2011). Despite these great efforts there is no single numerical model that can accurately simulate the entire process of an outburst because an outburst includes several interacting processes, including coal deformation and failure, coal fracture and fragmentation, gas desorption, mass transfer between adsorbed gas and free gas, flow of gas and water within coal cleats, gas dynamics and transport of <b>failed</b> and fragmented <b>coal</b> (Xue et al. 2014). While most of these models include deformation of the solid, desorption of gas, and Darcy flow of the fluid, however the fragmentation of the solid, which is a key process of an outburst, is either ignored or modeled with continuum damage mechanics which cannot naturally model the discrete nature of solid fragmentation and movement.|$|R
40|$|An all-solid-state continuous-wave (cw) {{laser system}} for {{ultraviolet}} absorption {{measurements of the}} nitric oxide (NO) molecule has been developed and demonstrated. For the NO sensor, 250 nW of tunable cw ultraviolet radiation is produced by sum-frequency-mixing of 532 -nm radiation from a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser and tunable 395 -nm radiation from an external cavity diode laser (ECDL). The sum-frequency-mixing process occurs in a beta-barium borate crystal. The nitric oxide absorption measurements are performed by tuning the ECDL and scanning the sum-frequency-mixed radiation over strong nitric oxide absorption lines near 226 nm. In Year 1 of the research, the nitric oxide sensor was used for measurements in the exhaust of a coal-fired laboratory combustion facility. The Texas A&M University boiler burner facility is a 30 kW (100, 000 Btu/hr) downward-fired furnace with a steel shell encasing ceramic insulation. Measurements of nitric oxide concentration in the exhaust stream were performed after modification of the facility for laser based NOx diagnostics. The diode-laser-based ultraviolet absorption measurements were successful even when the beam was severely attenuated by particulate in the exhaust stream and window fouling. Single-laser-sweep measurements were demonstrated with an effective time resolution of 100 msec, limited at this time by the scan rate of our mechanically tuned ECDL system. In Year 2 described in this progress report, the Toptica ECDL in the original system was replaced with a Sacher Lasers ECDL. The mode-hop-free tuning range and tuning rate of the Toptica ECDL were 25 GHz and a few Hz, respectively. The mode-hop-free tuning range and tuning rate of the Sacher Lasers ECDL were 90 GHz and a few hundred Hz, respectively. The Sacher Lasers ECDL thus allows us to scan over the entire NO absorption line and to determine the absorption baseline with increased accuracy and precision. The increased tuning rate is an advantage in that data can be acquired much more rapidly and the absorption measurements are less susceptible {{to the effects of}} transient fluctuations in the properties of the coal combustor exhaust stream. Gas cell measurements were performed using the NO sensor with the new ECDL, and a few spectra were acquired from the coal exhaust stream. However, the laser diode in the new ECDL <b>failed</b> during the <b>coal</b> combustor tests. A series of spectral simulations was performed using the HITRAN code to investigate the potential sensitivity of absorption measurements of ammonia in different spectral regions. It was concluded that ammonia absorption features in the 3000 -nm spectral region would be hard to measure due to water vapor interferences...|$|R
40|$|How to quantitatively {{evaluate}} the permeability change of coalbed subjected to liquid nitrogen cooling {{is a key}} issue of enhanced-permeability technology of coalbed. To analyze the evolution process of permeability of coupled coal deformation, failure and liquid introgen cooling, the coal is supposed as elastic, brittle and plastic material. Its deformation process includes elastic deformation stage, brittle strength degradation stage and residual plastic flow stage. Combined with strength degradation index, dilatancy index of the element and Mohr-Column strength criterion, the element scale constitutive model {{with the effects of}} confining pressure on peak-post mechanical behaviors is built. Based on the deformation process of coal rock, there exist two stages of permeability evolution of the element including decrease of permeability due to elastic contraction and increase due to coal rock element's failure. The relationships between the permeability and elastic deformation, shear failure and tension failure for coal are studied. The permeability will be influenced by the change of pore space due to elastic contraction or tension of element. Conjugate shear zones appear during the shear failure of the element, in which the flow follows so-called cubic law between smooth parallel plates. The calculation formulas of the permeability and the aperture of the fractures are given out based on the volumetric strain. When tension failure criterion is satisfied with the rock element fails and two orthogonal fractures appear. The calculation formulas of the permeability and the width of the fractures are given out based on the volumetric strain. Further, combined with the thermal conduction theory the permeability evolution model of coupled coal deformation, failure and liquid nitrogen cooling is presented. Then Fish function method in FLAC is employed to perform the model. The permeability's evolution process for coal bed cryogenically stimulated by flowing liquid nitrogen through gas production well in Wangyingzi mine, Liaoning province, is simulated and the results include: 1) When liquid nitrogen(LN 2) is injected into a rock at warm reservoir temperature, heat from the rock will quickly transfer to the liquid nitrogen resulting in rapid cooling and contraction of coal bed. The nearer the position is to bore hole, the bigger the shrinkage deformation and thermal stress and <b>coal</b> <b>fail</b> when tension stress sufficiently built up. In this paper the tension failure band after 10 days' LN 2 cooling is 0. 65 m. 2) In tension failure area the cracks from cooling stimulation lead to the significant growth of permeability. The maximum permeability for element is 1. 97 × 105 times more than that before cooling. 3) Apart from the bore hole, the thermal tensile stress leads to the growth of permeability at a rate of 1 %~ 14 %, far less than that in the tension failure area. 4) With increasing time the failure area gradually slowly grows up. It indicates that the longer cooling time does not mean better effects. 5) The cooling fracturing area is found to have a 1. 0 m band. In practical engineering the pressure in hole bore and phase transition of water also influences the deformation and failure of coal, which leads to much more failure zone of cooling. 6) The evolution process of permeability of coupled coal deformation, failure and liquid introgen cooling can be better reflected by the model in this paper. This study is hoped to provide a simple but reasonable description of the permeability evolution of rocks subject to liquid nitrogen cooling...|$|R
40|$|Coal fires {{cause severe}} {{environmental}} and economic problems. Although satellite remote sensing has been used successfully to detect coal fires, a satellite data based concept that can quantify {{the majority of the}} detected coal fires is still missing. Recently, the determination of fire radiative energy (FRE) has been introduced as a new remote sensing tool to quantify forest and grassland fires. This thesis tests the concept of remotely measured FRE, with a view to ascertaining its potential applicability to coal fires. It contains an investigation {{of a new generation of}} satellite instruments, including the operational Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) instrument, the experimental Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) satellite sensor and the experimental Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which explores the potential of these sensors to determine coal fire radiative energy (CFRE). Additionally, based on the results of this analysis, the thesis presents a new, automated ETM and ASTER data based algorithm, adapted to quantify coal fires in semi-arid to arid regions in northern China. Field observations carried out in September 2002 and 2003 in three coalfields in northern China (the Wuda, Gulaben and Ruqigou coalfields) demonstrate that coal fire related, surface anomalies are significantly cooler than forest and grassland fires. The theoretical investigation of the ASTER, ETM and BIRD instruments outlines the fact that the thermal infrared (TIR) or mid infrared (MIR) spectral channels of the ASTER, ETM and BIRD instrument are particularly effective in registering these ‘warm spots’, whilst the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range is, however, insufficiently sensitive to be able to register spectral coal fire radiances. The commonly used bi-spectral fire quantification method (Dozier, 1981) can be applied to BIRD data in order to quantify relatively large and / or hot coal fires. However, existing FRE retrieval approaches <b>fail</b> to quantify <b>coal</b> fires via ASTER and ETM instrument data. In this thesis, a new CFRE retrieval method is presented, which links the fire and background TIR spectral radiances to the CFRE through an empirical relationship. This newly developed TIR method is applied to visually detected fire clusters from night-time ASTER data, and from both day- and night-time ETM data, taken from the three study coalfields in northern China. The ASTER and ETM CFRE values, calculated via the TIR method, are compared to CFRE estimates from BIRD data, calculated via the existing bi-spectral method. Despite the different spatial resolution and spectral properties of the ETM, ASTER and BIRD instruments, CFRE computed from ASTER, ETM and BIRD data show good correlations with one another. However, CFRE retrievals from daytime data appear to be very undependable to background temperature variations, while CFRE, estimated from night-time data, appears to be relatively stable. A comparison between night-time ETM-derived CFRE and the figures given by local mining authorities for total coal fire induced, coal loss estimates in the Wuda coalfield gives a clear indication that the overall dimension of the coal fire problematic can in fact be approximated via satellite data CFRE retrievals. It is thus expected that CFRE derived from night-time satellite data will become a crucial tool in obtaining reliable, quantitative information for coal fires. A multi-temporal comparison of CFRE retrievals from night-time BIRD and ETM data, covering the Ruqigou and Wuda coalfields, indicates that only major shifts or activity changes in coal fire induced, surface anomalies can be observed by means of these data. These results, which could only partially be verified by field observations, indicate that ETM or BIRD data can be used to monitor major changes in coal fire related, surface anomalies. These data however cannot entirely replace detailed field observations, especially in case of smaller and / or cooler coal fire related, surface anomalies...|$|R
