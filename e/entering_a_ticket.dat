The video comes to an end as Gaga and her dancers hold their groins, gesturing towards the camera.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} entrances into the building. The {{ones on the}} left and right are of normal size, but the central entrance, called the [...] "mouse door" [...] (nezumi kido), is quite small and {{requires}} one to crouch in order to <b>enter.</b> This was <b>an</b> effective form of crowd control in the Edo period, and, along with armed guards, helped prevent anyone from <b>entering</b> without <b>a</b> <b>ticket.</b> While the average commoner playgoer had to use this small nezumi kido, those associated with the Kanemitsu-in used the goyō kido on the right. The large ōkido on the left was used by members of the samurai class, and others of importance.|$|R
2500|$|Not {{all the men}} condoned such behavior. The all-male {{editorial}} board of the Cornell Sun wrote that the boys were being cruel in <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> fake <b>ticket</b> to mock girls. They wrote that [...] "here is not the slightest reason ... to hold the ladies up to ridicule. They have neither sought nor do they aspire to class politics, but have left politics to the more experienced sex." [...] The abuse she suffered at Cornell emotionally scarred her, possibly coloring her view of Cornell men and revealing to her the taxing nature of a woman's forging her way through a world dominated by men.|$|R
50|$|There were {{different}} beliefs {{on how the}} riots started. Some believe they started {{when there was a}} dispute began when four policemen <b>entered</b> <b>a</b> carnival without <b>tickets.</b> Apparently the policemen were inebriated and proceeded to attack those who asked for tickets. The conflict escalated and the policemen were beaten up by the public and in retaliation the police opened fire.|$|R

The single was released in four versions: a regular edition (catalog number EPCE-5785), and limited editions A, B and C that include a bonus DVD; each edition also sports a different cover.

5000|$|In 2010, the Municipality of Zeytinburnu erected two mobile ice-rinks of each 400 m2 in {{the frame}} of a social {{responsibility}} project called [...] "Doğaya destek sizden, buz pateni biletiniz bizden" [...] (literally: You Support the Nature, We Award the Ticket for Ice Skating) to promote recycling. Citizens were awarded free tickets for ice skating session for the duration of half-an-hour under supervision of trainers in exchange for waste brought to recycle. Street children in the district, who are coming from poor families of mostly southeastern and eastern Anatolian origin with up to 10-12 children, collected waste paper to get free tickets. However, some of them tried to <b>enter</b> without <b>a</b> <b>ticket,</b> caused trouble around the venue, threatened the employees and damaged the ice rink. Noticing the youngsters' interest in ice skating, the municipality officials gave them in the beginning free-of-charge sessions instead of calling in for further security measures. The increasing interest of the street children induced the district mayor Murat Aydın to form an ice hockey team {{with the support of the}} Turkish Ice Hockey Federation (TBHF).|$|R

5000|$|Some {{promoters}} have ceased selling {{tickets in}} the traditional first-come-first-served manner, and require prospective <b>ticket</b> holders to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> [...] "ballot" [...] — a competition with random winners — with the prize being the opportunity to purchase {{a small number of}} tickets. The ballots are intended to discourage re-selling by making it harder to purchase large numbers of tickets because being {{at the front of the}} queue does not guarantee the holder <b>a</b> <b>ticket.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{there is}} the {{discount}} pass, for services such as those above: for a fee per unit time (or as a benefit on other grounds) one gets a discount on each purchase. Alternatively, <b>a</b> multi-use <b>ticket</b> (either valid <b>a</b> limited time, or indefinitely) may provide a discount. For example, <b>a</b> pass for <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> cinema 6 times within a year may cost the price of 4 or 5 <b>tickets.</b> <b>A</b> multi-use <b>ticket</b> {{may or may not}} be personal.

50|$|Abellio ScotRail, the {{franchise}} that operates {{most of the}} trains in Scotland, does not issue penalty fares.
