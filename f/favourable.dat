5|$|The film {{adaptation}} of the novel, released in 2002, became (at that time) the seventh highest-grossing film ever and received generally <b>favourable</b> reviews. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms, and most obtained <b>favourable</b> reviews.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opened in}} November 1967 to <b>favourable</b> reviews and remains {{generally}} well regarded.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually <b>favourable</b> balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a <b>favourable</b> balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a <b>favourable</b> balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
5|$|After its UK {{publication}} in March 2010 the book received {{a number of}} mostly <b>favourable</b> reviews in British newspapers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Favourable</b> {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less <b>favourable.</b> The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
5|$|Germanus {{is given}} a very <b>favourable</b> {{treatment}} {{in the work of}} Procopius, he openly praises him for his virtue, justice, and generosity, as well as for his energy and ability both as a soldier and an administrator.|$|E
5|$|Governments lacking sound {{financial}} policies {{would be forced}} to rely on traditional (national) governmental bonds with less <b>favourable</b> market rates.|$|E
5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of pollen {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more pollen (indicating {{that it may have}} had a more <b>favourable</b> climate), but the lack of pollen may be the product of a deeper lake. Polylepis may have thrived in <b>favourable</b> salinity and climatic conditions. Increased Polylepis and Acaena pollen is observed {{towards the end of the}} Tauca episode.|$|E
5|$|Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909. As {{the guest}} of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining <b>favourable</b> reviews and {{enhancing}} his growing international reputation.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 live double album A Night in San Francisco {{received}} <b>favourable</b> reviews as well {{as commercial}} success by reaching number eight on the UK charts. 1995's Days Like This also had large sales – though the critical reviews were not always <b>favourable.</b> This period also saw a number of side projects, including the live jazz performances of 1996's How Long Has This Been Going On, from the same year , and 2000's The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998, all of which found Morrison paying tribute to his early musical influences.|$|E
5|$|The Reluctant Tommy {{received}} largely <b>favourable</b> reviews by Richard Holmes in the Evening Standard and Jonathan Gibbs in the Financial Times, {{as well as}} {{coverage in}} the Daily Mail, Socialist Worker and the Sunday Express.|$|E
5|$|The red wattlebird breeds {{throughout}} its range, with nesting taking place between July and December, though occasionally outside these months if conditions are <b>favourable.</b> One or two broods are laid each year.|$|E
5|$|The region's tall {{grasses and}} {{extensive}} marshes make it <b>favourable</b> for birds, reptiles, and large mammals. Chad's major rivers—the Chari, Logone and their tributaries—flow through the southern savannas from the southeast into Lake Chad.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout Fusion {{received}} generally <b>favourable</b> reviews upon release. It {{holds an}} average score of 83 percent from Metacritic based on aggregate of 21 reviews.|$|E
5|$|According to the chronicle, the Byzantines {{attempted}} to poison Oleg, but the Rus' leader demonstrated his oracular powers {{by refusing to}} drink the cup of poisoned wine. Having fixed his shield to {{the gate of the}} imperial capital, Oleg won a <b>favourable</b> trade treaty, which eventually was of great benefit to both nations. Although Byzantine sources did not record these hostilities, the text of the treaty survives in the Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Although Mullum Malarum {{opened to}} a tepid box office {{reception}} at its 15 August 1978 (Independence Day) release, positive reviews from critics and <b>favourable</b> {{word of mouth}} helped make it a success. Rajinikanth's performance as Kali received unanimous praise, and it is widely considered the best performance of his career. The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Film– Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize (for Rajinikanth).|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for <b>favourable</b> winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previously}} <b>favourable</b> to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's {{wars and}} religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, {{in which he}} purported to suspend all penal laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal were paired {{up against}} Celta Vigo {{in the last}} 16 stage and the first leg {{was held at the}} Balaídos. Although they conceded two goals from set pieces, Arsenal scored three times to win the game which put the team in a <b>favourable</b> {{position}} given the away goals rule. Their passage was secured with a 2–0 win on 10 March 2004; Henry scored both goals for the team.|$|E
5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance <b>favourable,</b> although superficial and cautious. They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew <b>favourable</b> comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} was generally <b>favourable,</b> with reviewers being {{impressed by the}} beauty of the graphics and the thrilling depiction of speed. They were however, slightly disappointed with the shallow nature of the gameplay. A newer version of the arcade game was released in 2003, incorporating motion simulator technology into the arcade cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Daybreaker {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Some reviewers praised the band for texturing and progressing their sound, and for writing socio-political lyrics. The album was criticised for sounding forced or formulaic. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Daybreaker received an average score of 73, based on 8 reviews, which indicates generally <b>favourable</b> reviews.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need for the road to be {{constructed}} date back to the construction of Switch Island junction, with numerous public consultations held throughout the years to ascertain public support and opinion on the need for the road and the alignment it would take. The consultations have produced <b>favourable</b> responses from the majority of respondents, with several different alignment suggestions being proposed over the years.|$|E
5|$|During the 5th century, one of {{the last}} Emperors of the Western Roman Empire, Julius Nepos, ruled his small empire from the palace. The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions {{in the first half of}} the 7th century and {{destruction}} of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more <b>favourable</b> sites on the coast, islands and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} he joined an amateur theatre company, {{in which he}} acted and wrote plays. The {{manuscript}} {{of one of these}} early plays, Amoroso, King of Little Britain, was by chance seen by the comic actor John Pritt Harley, who, recognising its potential, brought about (and acted in) its performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Its <b>favourable</b> reception launched Planché on his theatrical career.|$|E
5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself. He had sought to both have a public persona <b>favourable</b> to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV. The zelanti faction and Flavio Chigi opposed him, which was enough to stop his victory.|$|E
5|$|Ferrier's {{performances}} in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her <b>favourable</b> reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses.|$|E
5|$|Finally, a {{delegation}} of about 27workers was sent to Warsaw around June23. On the night of June26, the delegation returned to Poznań, confident {{that some of their}} demands had been considered in a <b>favourable</b> light. The Minister of Machine Industry met with the workers next morning and withdrew several promises that their delegation was given in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|From Dust {{received}} generally <b>favourable</b> reviews. Metacritic ranks the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 {{versions of}} the game with scores of 76, 80, and 81, respectively. The creator of Populous, Peter Molyneux, also had a good impression of the game.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not suggest that every <b>favourable</b> variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In September 1913 a Ghadarite named Mathra Singh visited Shanghai {{to promote}} the {{nationalist}} cause amongst Indians there, followed by a visit to India in January 1914 when Singh circulated Ghadar literature amongst Indian soldiers through clandestine sources before leaving for Hong Kong. Singh reported that the situation in India as <b>favourable</b> for revolution.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more <b>favourable,</b> the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following drier glacial periods until the current more <b>favourable</b> climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap. This suggests the original split was only very recent as the forms had insufficient time to speciate. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Parchevich's efforts, {{conditions}} {{would not be}} <b>favourable</b> to a Bulgarian anti-Ottoman uprising until well after his death. While on a diplomatic mission to Pope Clement X, he died of illness in Rome {{in the summer of}} 1674 and was buried at the Sant'Andrea delle Fratte basilica in the city. Parchevich's letters and reports have been preserved and are an important source of information regarding his activities.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the government announcement, HSA persisted with work on the P.1154. By September 1964, the first full-scale mock-up meeting had been conducted. On 30 October 1964, a milestone in the development programme was attained when the first run of a BS100 engine was performed; around the same time, HSA received <b>favourable</b> reports that the P.1154 was competitive with the performance of other aircraft, including the F-4 Phantom II.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in <b>favourable</b> winds.|$|E
