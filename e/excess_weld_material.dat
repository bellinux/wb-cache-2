40|$|AbstractWhile {{regenerating}} damaged components, e. g. compressor blades, {{the removal}} of <b>excess</b> <b>weld</b> <b>material</b> called re-contouring often determines the surface integrity including the residual stress state. A load-specific residual stress state is beneficial for lifetime. This leads to the necessity to predict the resulting residual stress state after machining. The paper describes two models, which predict the principal stress direction as a residual stress characteristic for 5 -axis ball nose end milling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V.

40|$|Straight {{break or}} {{transverse}} fissure {{is one of}} the most common failure modes associated with aluminothermic welds in Australian heavy haul railways. Straight break as a fatigue failure mainly nucleates from stress concentration sites at the weld collar edge and propagates in a near vertical direction under mode I crack opening. The reduction of fatigue performance influenced by the collar features and harsh operational conditions has been investigated using multi-axial fatigue analysis and validated on the basis of in-service failures. Practical observations suggest that a major contributor to the occurrence of many straight breaks is a specific defect known as finning or cold lap. Cold lap is a condition where <b>excess</b> <b>weld</b> <b>material</b> leaks out of the welding mould forming an unfused appendix on the rail surface. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks associated with the cold lap defect through numerical analysis and fracture mechanics. A thermostructural finite element model of a track portion incorporating an aluminothermic weld with a cold lap defect is developed and the cold lap is treated as a planar crack. Sensitivity analysis is performed on cold lap geometric parameters and some operational conditions. The results show that the probability of crack initiation from a cold lap defect largely depends on the lap thickness, lap tip location and the wheel-rail contact conditions. In particular, contact patch eccentricity and lateral tractive forces as a result of curving and hunting behaviour can increase the risk of crack nucleation...|$|E

The {{rigorous}} {{stress conditions}} of active surfaces, from {{the components of}} magmatic rock processing equipment of surface pits, required finding new materials and system processes that achieve {{a major impact on}} wear processes, in the sense of decreasing them.

40|$|The {{chemical}} reactivity of oxide-free weld joints made of thermo-hardened carbon steel in different electrolytes was investigated by chronopotentiometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The objective was to identify the role of different electrolyte constituents on the electrochemical behaviour of the different <b>materials</b> constituting the <b>weld</b> joint, namely the <b>weld</b> <b>material,</b> the heat affected zone (HAZ) and the base carbon steel. Hardness measurements by Vickers and nano-indentation techniques indicated that the <b>weld</b> <b>material</b> is harder than the heat affected zone and the base carbon steel due to a Widmanstatten ferrite-type structure of the weld. Electrochemical measurements were performed on polished cross-sections on these weld joints in four electrolytes containing different additives.

40|$|Beryllium is {{difficult}} to weld because it is highly susceptible to cracking. The most commonly used filler metal in beryllium welds is Al- 12 wt. % Si. Beryllium has been successfully welded using Al-Si filler metal with more than 30 wt. % Al. This filler creates an aluminum-rich fusion zone with a low melting point that tends to backfill cracks. Drawbacks to adding a filler metal include a reduction in service temperature, a lowering of the tensile strength of the weld, and the possibility for galvanic corrosion to occur at the weld.
