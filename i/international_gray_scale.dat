30|$|According to the table, fitting {{residuals}} by the Gaussian {{model are}} smaller than the second-order polynomial model, so {{it is reasonable to}} use the Gaussian model to represent the <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> distribution of the light strip on the measured object. When the light strip is a straight line, the <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> distribution on each cross section is relatively uniform, and the <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> fitting residual variation on each cross section is small. When the shape of light strip is curve, the <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> fitting residual variation on each cross section is large. So the shape and material of the measured object have a great influence on the <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> distribution of the light strip.|$|R

In CT scan, Hounsfield Unit (HU) {{is proportional to}} the degree of x-ray attenuation by the tissue. In CBCT, the degree of x-ray attenuation is shown by <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> (voxel value). The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> in CBCT) and Hounsfield Unit (HU) in CT scan. Materials and methods. In this descriptive study, the head of a sheep was scanned with 3 CBCT and one medical CT scanner. <b>Gray</b> <b>scales</b> and HUs were detected on images.

A strong correlation between <b>gray</b> <b>scales</b> of CBCT and HUs of CT scan was determined. Conclusion.

40|$|Historically, <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> {{has been}} the {{standard}} method of displaying univariate medical images. A few color scales have been proposed and evaluated, but have had little acceptance by radiologists. It is possible that carefully desired scales might give lesion detection performance that equals <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> and improves performance of other tasks. We investigated 13 display scales including the physically linear <b>gray</b> <b>scale,</b> the popular rainbow scale and the other 1 1 perceptually linearized scales. One was the hot body (heated object) scale and the other 10 were spiral trajectories in the CIELAB uniform color space. The experiments were performed using signals added to white noise and a statistically defined (lumpy) background. In general, the best performance was obtained using the <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> and the hot body scale.

The bivariate pattern spectrum (BPS) is the generalization of the pattern spectrum that provides both shape and size distribution of the objects. However, the usual pattern spectrum and the BPS are not defined for application on <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> images. In this paper, we extend the idea of BPS to <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> images and thereby propose the concept of trivariate pattern spectrum (TPS).

The conventional theoretical concept of enhancing image has been extended from mathematical morphology to multiscale mathematical morphological approach. <b>Gray</b> <b>scale</b> images sometimes suffer from lack of contrast. So to enhance image efficiently a multiscale top hat transform based algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm multiscale structuring element of same shape and increasing size is used. By using multiscale top hat transform both white and black features at various <b>scales</b> of <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> image are extracted and these features are added together to find the final enhanced image.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{techniques for}} the construction of invariant <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> features. That are characteristics of <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> images which remain constant if the images are transformed according to the action of a transformation group. We first introduce a general method applicable to arbitrary transformation groups and specialize the results afterwards to the group of image rotations and translations, the affine group and the group of projective image transformations. It is shown that each of these three groups has specific characteristics which are decisive for the properties of the resulting features. It has to be emphasized that the invariant <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> features developed in this paper are not geometric invariants which rely on a parametric description of the object boundaries and on the calculation of appropriate derivatives. In fact, our algorithms only require the the associated gray values.

While attempting to explain the physics of highlight formation in terms of location on the surface of a seed defect, the thesis also extends to utilize this information from <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> images to accurately predict the parameters of seed defects including the height, size and position in real time. Since the primary highlight in a <b>gray</b> <b>scale</b> image is more defined, contrary to the past researches on diffuse angle images that use both primary / seed highlight and mirror highlight to estimate height of the seed, this thesis formulates a theory of highlight translation and estimates the height of seed based on primary / seed highlight.

The image of the optic disc was taken using Kowa digital disc photo-graphy, and the <b>gray</b> <b>scales</b> of the nasal rim (NR), brightest cupping center (BCC) and largest inferior retinal vein (IRV) were calculated using histogram in ImageJ. Three different observers calculated the <b>gray</b> <b>scales</b> three separate times. Reproducibility was assessed using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The mean age of the participants was 50. 6 years old (range, 11 to 82 years). The mean <b>gray</b> <b>scales</b> of the nasal rim were 91. 81, 94. 91, and 93. 24; those of the brightest cupping center were 174. 84, 179. 94, and 177. 76; and those of the largest inferior retinal vein were 61. 85, 53. 48, and 56. 73 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Inter-observer reproducibility for NR, BCC and IRV was considered good based upon ICC values of 0. 944, 0. 860, and 0. 789 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
