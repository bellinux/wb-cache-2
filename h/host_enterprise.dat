40|$|The {{interactions}} among service providers are {{represented as a}} social network to support service-oriented collaborations across multiple manufacturing enterprises. The combination of service-oriented computing and social network facilitates the connection and collaboration within enterprises. It is essential to identify a group of prosperous collaborative partners in a social network in a prompt and efficient way, especially {{when the number of}} alternative service providers is large. However, traditional exhaustive searching approaches are inapplicable in identifying a <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> and constitutive members due to the prohibitive computations. In this paper, a new and efficient approach has been proposed to identify service providers optimally based on existing social relations. Three innovations inthe proposal are (i) a set of new concepts has been defined to construct a social service provider network; (ii) based on remodeling the social graph, the betweenness centrality algorithm has been enhanced to efficiently find the leader who serves as the <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> of a given engineering project; (iii) to improve the efficiency of computation, an innovative algorithm is proposed to identify the collaborative partners by confining the searching space in the set of connector nodes. For the validation purpose, the experimental simulation is conducted and the results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms outperform several existing algorithms in terms of computation time in dealing with the increasing number of enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{provides an}} attractive solution to <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> applications {{due to its}} cost effectiveness, {{and its ability to}} seamlessly adjust to changing application workloads while providing the desired performance assurances using elastic and dynamic resource management. These benefits, however, do not yet readily carry over to distributed, real-time and embedded (DRE) systems, which are a class of systems that require stringent assurances on quality of service (QoS) properties including timeliness, reliability and security all at once. This doctoral research is investigating the sources of these limitations that make it hard to host DRE systems in the cloud, and developing solutions to overcome them. This paper makes three contributions in this regard. First, it outlines the key challenges that must be resolved in supporting DRE systems in the cloud and surveys related literature. Second, it presents ongoing work that addresses one key challenge stemming from the need for real-time and scalable resource monitoring in the cloud.

40|$|Abstract—The {{composition}} of services {{has been a}} useful approach to integrating business applications within and across organizational boundaries. In this approach, individual services are federated into composite services which are able to execute a given task subject to a service level agreement (SLA). An SLA is a contract agreed between a customer and a service provider who define a set of several quality of services (QoS). An SLA violation penalty {{is a way to}} ensure the credibility of an advertised SLA by a service provider. In this paper, we consider a set of computer resources used by a service broker who represents service providers to <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> applications for differentiated customer services subject to an SLA and its violation penalty. We present a novel framework for a QoS-constrained resource provisioning problem, and propose a capacity planning approach to optimizing computer resources for all service sites owned by service providers subject to multiple QoS metrics defined in the SLA and their violation penalties. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient for reliable resource planning in service composition. I...|$|E
40|$|With {{the number}} of e-Business {{applications}} dramatically increasing, a service level agreement (SLA) will play {{an important part in}} Web services. The SLA is a combination of several quality of services (QoS), such as security, performance, and availability, agreed between a customer and a service provider. Most existing research addresses only one of these QoS metrics. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} response time defined as one of QoS metrics for performance, only the average time to process and complete a job is typically used. Moreover, customer requests often need to be distinguished, with different request characteristics and customer’s different service requirements. In this paper, we consider a set of computer resources used by a service broker to <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> applications for two classes of differentiated customer services subject to a service level agreement. We study three QoS metrics, namely, trustworthiness, a percentile response time, and availability. The percentile response time metric defines a value below which the end-to-end response time has to be for a given percent of time. We present an approach for resource optimization in such an environment that minimizes the total cost of computer resources while satisfying all these three QoS metrics in a trust-based resource provisioning problem which typically arises in Web services. We formulate the trust-based resource provisioning problem as an optimization problem under SLA constraints, and then solve it using an efficient numerical procedure. ...|$|E

40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol {{could create}} a great chance for {{developing}} countries to profit from projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the economic and environmental situation in the host country. The project cycle for the CDM differs from a usual investment project due {{to the need to}} develop a baseline for the calculation of emission reductions, registration by a national CDM body and monitoring and verification of the emission reduction by an independent entity. Before a project can be registered, its eligibility has to be checked. This means that it has to fulfil the international and national CDM criteria. We suggest national criteria concerning the CDM component, adherence to national policy goals, technological aspects, attractiveness for investor and <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> as well as avoidance of negative externalities. A set of sustainable development indicators is proposed for Uzbekistan. We then look at each step of project preparation and concentrate on baseline determination, using small hydropower stations in the Uzbek irrigation system as case studies. Determination of system boundaries, leakage and the lifetime of the projects are assessed. Different benchmarks for the Uzbek electricity sector are calculated. We calculate the economic attractiveness of three hydro power stations to determine whether the investment is really additional, using different discount rates and electricity price scenarios. In all scenarios we find positive costs, making the projects additional. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs the United States continues to develop plans and policies {{to counter the}} threat of terrorism, it becomes increasingly more vital to understand the entire spectrum of the threat. Realistically assessing the capability of possible and probable terrorist groups helps federal and state agencies to establish potential methods and procedures for defense and maritime domain awareness. Yet, the avenues of attack and the varieties of terrorists far outnumber the available resources of most agencies concerned. Moreover, there have been no attacks on homeland U. S. targets since September 11. The red team concept provides an innovative method to examine these vulnerabilities from the terrorist perspective. The effectiveness of a red team can be measured in various ways and is dependent on key organizational and situational elements. In the end, the determination of effectiveness is based on the original intentions of the <b>host</b> <b>enterprise,</b> whether it is training, research, strategy, or analysis or a combination. We conducted a case study to utilize the red team concept as a tool for bringing a fresh awareness to a critical issue within the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. The red teams identified vulnerabilities of possible targets, raised the awareness on the nature of terrorists, researched potential tactics and tools, and examined existing assumptions about maritime security. In applying the red team concept, the case study used military officers as surrogate terrorists planning a campaign to attack port cities. The case study effectively demonstrated the anticipated functions, while the follow-on actions ensured that the results were distributed to the appropriate agencies. Furthermore, civilian officials and the agencies concerned valued the red team reports as positive insights into the current situation. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|In today’s buyer market, the key {{question}} for an enterprise is how to sell products rather than how to produce products. That is why the study on distribution part of a supply chain is attracting extensive attentions from both academics and industry. In this dissertation, an integrated methodology is developed to design a istribution chain. According to this methodology, a distribution chain is designed by following three phases: (1) Problem formulation phase. In this phase, the present situation for the <b>host</b> <b>enterprise</b> is analyzed, and the goal to design this distribution chain is set. By this analysis, the objective and constraints for designing the distribution chain are determined. (2) System design phase. In this phase, first, all possible istributors are evaluated through a trilogy: -Determine the factors needed to be considered when evaluating a possible distributor. - Collect data from geographically distributed distributors by a mobile agent based information acquisition system. - Evaluate possible distributors quantitatively by a FL (Fuzzy logic) -ABL (Array Based Logic) inference engine. After evaluation, a set of eligible distributors are selected as andidates for designing this distribution chain. With these candidates at hand, a set of models, formulae and lgorithms are developed to design a distribution chain. To determine the exact customer demand at each retailer (candidate), an ANN Artificial Neural Network) model is developed to estimate the retailer’s market share in its customer zone. By this estimated market share, the customer demands at retailers are determined, and the configuration of a distribution chain, including the number and location of distributors, is determined by MIP (Mixed Integer Programming) model. The inventory control parameters at each node of this distribution chain are optimized by probability theory, and routes for vehicles to deliver products between different nodes are optimized by genetic algorithm. After this, the designing process for a distribution chain is finished. (3) Performance evaluation phase. To verify the design result, {{a new form of}} Petri net, combinatorial Petri net, is developed, and the performance of the distribution chain designed above is evaluated by this newly developed Petri net form. If the performance is not satisfactory, the distribution chain needs to be re-designed. All models, algorithms and formulae used in this dissertation have been implemented by computer applications. This gives possibility to realize automatic design of a distribution chain. At last, a umerical example is given to illustrate how to apply this methodology in practice. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
