5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have}} to act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the finest actresses of her generation and one of Britain's best-known actresses, accepted in Hollywood. Early in her career, when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh, she was somewhat unpopular and considered a [...] "". The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s. Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience, and Mark Kermode said of her performances, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her which is— you just trust her. You just think 'I'm in proper hands here.' ... She's up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers".|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of the lead characters were generally praised, especially Basset's. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that [...] "Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow {{became the first woman}} to win the Best Director award.|$|E

I'm afraid he's in Grosvenor Square at this moment. Let me see;--Pickering! Wasn't there some question of a mortgage? I'm sure there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> a mortgage.' ...|$|R

500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, but there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's definitely more misterioso." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? <b>Is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E
500|$|Although Sakura is {{the most}} {{recurring}} female character in Naruto, Masashi Kishimoto did not originally intend for Sakura to be the heroine of the series. Kishimoto attributes this to his being unable to draw good heroine characters and fashioned Sakura as a girl who cannot understand men, {{the best example of}} a heroine he could come up with. Sakura's creation is a result of Kishimoto's desire to make a somewhat irritating character who was well-intentioned. Despite these elements, Kishimoto is fond of Sakura, as he feels that many of her personality traits are common among all people, thus giving her a sense of real humanity. When asked in an interview if there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Sakura's background that was never revealed, Kishimoto explains that he has never thought of Sakura as she is a [...] "normal girl." [...] Kishimoto has often been asked by readers about why he did not show Sakura's parents until the film [...] In response, he said this would not be entertaining as Sakura does not belong to any clan unlike other characters so her parents were civilians.|$|E

500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E

2500|$|In the 7th century, the Tang dynasty {{established}} hegemony in China. Their second Emperor Taizong esteemed Wang Xizhi's calligraphic {{texts and}} this popularity influenced Japanese calligraphers. All {{of the original}} texts written by Wang Xizhi have been lost, and copies such as Gakki-ron [...] written by the Empress Kōmyō are highly regarded as important sources for Wang Xizhi's style. However Wang's influence can barely be overstated, in particular for the wayō [...] style unique to Japan: [...] "Even today, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Japanese calligraphy that retains the unchanged flavour of Wang Xizhi's style".|$|E
2500|$|The show {{aired on}} Canadian airwaves {{for the first}} time on September 2, 1997 to CHOM in Montreal and CILQ in Toronto. Stern's {{comments}} about French people and their language caused a rift with some listeners. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the language that turns you into a pussy-assed jack off. Anybody who speaks French is a scum bag. It turns you into a coward. Just like in World War II, they would not stick up for us. Screw your culture and we're invading you all." [...] Ratings for the two stations increased nonetheless by 62% and 47% respectively. Following listener complaints and censorship enforced by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the show was cancelled in Montreal in 1998 and in Toronto in 2001.|$|E
2500|$|While {{critics were}} divided {{following}} the symphony's premiere, the public generally admired the piece as its grandiose finale was connected by some with {{the struggle for}} Finland's independence, {{so that it was}} even popularly dubbed the [...] "Symphony of Independence", as it was written at a time of Russian sanctions on Finnish language and culture. Sibelius's reaction to this has been widely debated; some claim that he had not intended any patriotic message and that the symphony was only identified by others as a nationalist composition, while others believe that he wrote the piece with an independent Finland in mind. Finnish composer Sulho Ranta said, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this music — at least for us — that leads us to ecstasy; almost like a shaman with his magic drum." ...|$|E

2500|$|From {{the next}} room, {{the sound of}} the {{orchestra}} is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: Un dì, felice, eterea – [...] "One day, happy and ethereal"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.|$|E
2500|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that beauty {{is in the eye}} of the beholder. [...] Sircello’s {{philosophy}} runs counter to this maxim. [...] He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way. [...] His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the object that is thought to be beautiful. [...] For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, this is due to the quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. [...] Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. [...] Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.|$|E
2500|$|Melman {{and other}} critics {{of the book and}} the film have said that the story's premise—that Israeli agents had second {{thoughts}} about their work—is not supported by interviews or public statements. In an interview with Reuters, a retired head of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence service and [...] former Internal Security Minister, Avi Dichter, likened Munich to a children's adventure story: [...] "There is no comparison between {{what you see in the}} movie and how it works in reality". [...] In a Time magazine cover story about the film on December 4, 2005, Spielberg said that the source of the film had second thoughts about his actions. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> killing people at close range that is excruciating," [...] Spielberg said. [...] "It's bound to try a man's soul." [...] Of the real Avner, Spielberg says, [...] "I don’t think he will ever find peace." ...|$|E

But I think--I think it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Granville. Mother, I never told you, but you know I love him! I think it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> HIM, though I can't quite make sure. Some secret about {{somebody}} not being properly married, or something of that sort. I didn't quite understand. You see, he was so discreetly vague and reticent." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hanson {{repeatedly}} accused President Barack Obama {{of engaging}} in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Russia. Hanson argues that Vladimir Putin is the embodiment of [...] "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled [...] "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: [...] "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> constitutional government and liberal rule that bothers Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, {{the more likely they}} are to bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much". Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people out of a sense of hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American [...] "reset" [...] diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine. Should Putin wish to absorb Estonia or other Baltic States, NATO probably would not stop him." ...|$|E
