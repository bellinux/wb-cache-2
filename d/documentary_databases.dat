40|$|Document Clustering is the {{peculiar}} application of cluster analysis methods on huge <b>documentary</b> <b>databases.</b> Document Clustering aims at organizing a large quantity of unlabelled documents into {{a smaller number}} of meaningful and coherent clusters, similar in content. One of the main unsolved problems in clustering literature is the lack of a reliable methodology to evaluate results, although a wide variety of validation measures has been proposed. If those measures are often unsatisfactory when dealing with numerical databases, they definitely underperform in Document Clustering. This paper proposes a new validation measure. After introducing the most common approaches to Document Clustering, our attention is focused on Spherical K-means, do to its strict connection with the Vector Space Model, typical of Information Retrieval. Since Spherical K-means adopts a cosine-based similarity measure, we propose a validation measure based on the same criterion. The new measure effectiveness is shown in the frame of a comparative study, by involving 13 different corpora (usually used in literature for comparing different proposals) and 15 validation measures...|$|E

They were among the millions of inhabitants from 60 nationalities, victims of Stalin's criminal plan for people's deportation in the USSR.

Therefore, "Romanians Survivors of the GULAG - A Video Testimony" is meant to fill this regrettable gap.

To do this we used the Haghia Sophia dome model. We have first investigated the problem of simplifying it quite a bit {{in order to make}} it compatible with the current transmission possibilities of the web and the workings of conventional personal computers. Even if we can confirm the validity of the overall approach, the results are nonetheless provisional, because we still have to improve the simplification procedure of the original model as well as making the transmitted data more compact (these are the two most important parameters at the moment). However we’ve been able to experiment a slightly different approach to the previous one. In this case, the software we used allowed us to create on a normal web page frame hosting an interactive model of the object capable as well of providing external links to <b>documentary</b> <b>databases.</b> There’s also another important possibility: stereoscopy. In fact, the frame in question can either be visualised monoscopically, if the client’s computer has the necessary hardware components, or in stereoscopy which obviously improves the immediate comprehension we talked about earlier and which is one of our main aims. Stereoscopic visualisation is, at the moment, a sort of “embellishment” of the traditional 3 D model, but it is not far from incorporating the characteristic features of photogrammetric stereoscopy, especially with regard to the metric exploration and survey of the model...|$|E
40|$|The "Simulation and Gaming Environments (SAGE) for Learning" Project, {{funded by}} the SSHRC-INE program, has {{assembled}} a network of research teams from across Canada to undertake projects in three applied research domains and three foundation research domains. The application domains are: • Games: activities in artificial settings that do not mimic reality, in which players compete to "win" using rules; • Simulation games: activities in simplified dynamic models of reality, in which players compete to win using rules; • Simulations: activities in simplified, dynamic but accurate models of reality, in which players explore and practice but do not compete. The foundation domains, which support all application domains, are: • Conceptual Foundations: systematic {{review of the literature}} on of the evolving terminology, concepts, and understanding of SAGE impacts on learning, as well as development of conceptual models to guide research in other domains; • Methodologies and Tools: identification, development, application, testing, and application of new research and evaluation methodologies and tools for technology-intensive SAGEs in all application domains; • Technologies: identification, development, application and evaluation of technologies that support learning in all SAGE application domains. These research projects are documenting current levels of knowledge and means for evaluating simulations and gaming environments for learning. In this paper which focuses on the Conceptual Foundations project, the research team initiated work based on the hypothesis that the reason research results on the impact of games and simulations on learning are generally vague and inconclusive is due to the absence of clear-cut definitions for these concepts. To correct this methodological weakness, an extensive literature review was undertaken covering the last five years which isolated the essential attributes of games, simulation and simulation games. This paper will present the research objectives, the <b>documentary</b> <b>databases</b> analyzed, the text analysis methodology used, the obtained results and the essential attributes of games, simulation and simulation games.

40|$|The {{engagement}} with documentary {{from its inception}} as a film form is frequently a set of references to documentary auteurs. The names of Flaherty, Grierson, Vertov and later Ivens, Leacock and Rouch are immediate signifiers of whole documentary film practices. These practices {{have given rise to}} histories and criticism that have dominated discussion of documentary and provided the foundation for more nuanced thinking about problems of the genre. One of the seminal texts in the field, Documentary by Erik Barnouw (1974) celebrates the auteur as the structuring principle for his historical review of documentary. It may be a reflection of the influence of this book, that so much of documentary criticism reflects the auteur approach {{as a starting point for}} analysis. The shift towards a new <b>documentary</b> format, the <b>Database</b> <b>Documentary,</b> challenges the concept of an auteur in its presentation of documentary materials. This format relies on a remediation technique that recalibrates documentary media within new distributive networks supported by the web and enhanced by converged and designed visual and sonic interfaces.

50|$|Since its {{foundation}} {{in the early}} 1990s, the Medici Archive Project (MAP) has been innovating new strategies for research in the Humanities. During {{the early stages of}} its existence, MAP’s mission was to merge archival research with technological innovations for data management. A pioneering group of scholars began to catalog in a rudimentary electronic database the letters {{of one of the most}} exhaustive and complete courtly archives of early modern Europe: the Medici Grand Ducal Archival Collection (Mediceo del Principato). This archival collection ― comprising over four-million letters distributed in 6,429 volumes and occupying a mile of shelf space ― covers a chronological span of two hundred years, from 1537 to 1743. It documents the political, diplomatic, gastronomic, economic, artistic, scientific, military and medical culture of early modern Tuscany and Europe.In the decade following its founding, graduate students, university professors, museum curators, and independent researchers paid regular visits to MAP’s workspace at the State Archive in Florence in order to have access to unpublished documentary material or to seek help with archival research strategies related to their scholarly endeavors. At the same time, thanks to the NEH Fellowship Program and other similar fellowships, generations of MAP researchers, experienced in archival and paleographic studies, have worked continuously to populate this database with new material gleaned from the Medici manuscripts. Initially collected in an in-house <b>database</b> (<b>Documentary</b> Sources for the Arts and Humanities, 1537 to 1743) accessible only in situ, this vast repository of transcribed and contextualized documents was published online in April 2006, free of charge, for the benefit of the entire scholarly community.|$|R
40|$|Postponement is an {{approach}} that helps to deliver more responsive supply chains. Form postponement involves the delay of final manufacturing until a customer order is received and is commonly regarded as {{an approach}} to mass customization. However, while much is written in the literature about the benefits and strategic impact of form postponement, little is still known about its application. This paper addresses how form postponement was applied {{in terms of its}} operational implications within a manufacturing facility through a retrospective study that tracked implementation of form postponement in a manufacturer of specialist high-voltage cabling equipment, called here 'ElectriCo'. The operational measures for products selected for form postponement were compared with those for products that continued to be made under make-to-order and make-to-stock regimes. Propositions were tested that addressed the operational implications of form postponement within the manufacturing facility, the impact of form postponement on selected performance metrics, and the demand profile for which form postponement was the preferred regime. Multiple data collection methods were used whereby <b>documentary,</b> archival and <b>database</b> evidence were used to measure operational characteristics across a broad front. The findings show that form postponement improved responsiveness but did not necessarily improve delivery reliability. The extent to which the order lead time can be reduced is dependent not only on the responsiveness of the postponed process, but also crucially on the responsiveness of the planning system. It was found that the problem of adapting the manufacturing planning and production scheduling systems at ElectriCo had been underestimated. This and other problems subsequently undermined the form postponement application and led to its eventual abandonment. The authors are undertaking further research of form postponement applications in different production contexts to provide further evidence for its operational implications...|$|R
40|$|What are the continuities {{and changes}} of student {{activism}} throughout twentieth-century China? How did students carry out contentious politics during political campaigns of the Maoist era? Scholarships on Chinese student activism {{have concentrated on}} two major events: the 1919 May Fourth Movement and the 1989 Tiananmen Protests. Others have also paid attention to student protests in the Republican era, {{as well as the}} Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution. However, studies of student activism in the 1950 s have been missing, a decade which was presumably dominated by Communist political campaigns, thus leaving little space for social dissent. There has been no short of research on elite politics regarding the Hundred Flowers and the Anti-Rightist Campaigns of 1956 - 57, though a bottom-up approach to the topic would reveal a different picture of the events. My dissertation fills the gap by investigating the spectrum of college student participation in the political campaigns of 1957, including activists, loyalists and those who stayed silent, from Peking University, Wuhan University and Yunnan University. My sources come from declassified archival documents, digital <b>database,</b> <b>documentary</b> films, student journals, official newspapers, memoirs and oral history interviews I conducted in 2014 - 15 with 65 college students from the late 1950 s. I use social movement theories to treat this episode of student activism as contentious politics, and look at student repertoire, organization and mobilization, framing technique, and political opportunity and constraint. Overall, my dissertation argues that Chinese students in 1957 carried out and passed on similar repertoire and framing technique in comparison to other episodes of student activism, but what made it distinctive was the ambiguous political opportunity and divisions among students that consumed the brief yet intense activism. My dissertation contributes to the ongoing scholarly challenge of the 1949 divide by connecting student activism in the Republic era and the Communist reign, and sheds light on grassroots contentious politics in the Maoist era. As 2017 commemorates the sixtieth anniversary of the Hundred Flowers and the Anti-Rightist Campaigns, student activism of 1957 deserves a bright spot because it has been forgotten for too long...|$|R
