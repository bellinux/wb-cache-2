HC degradation was found to be enhanced in SOG nonetchback structures rather than in SOG <b>etchback</b> structures. HC degradation i SOG <b>etchback</b> structures i almost he same as in a single layer of PETEOS even though SOG remains over the gate of the transistor measured. Next, the influence of water-related species in intermetal oxides on HC degradation was investigated. The PETEOS is blocking H 20 which diffuses from the SOG in the SOG <b>etchback</b> structure. However, H 20 diffuses through the PETEOS in the SOG nonetchback structure with a large amount of SOG.

For a special PMD (Pre-Metal Dielectric) poly-open-planarization, a new recessed three-step RIE (Reactive-Ion Etching) <b>etchback</b> process is developed in one process chamber.

40|$|Plasma-enhanced {{chemical}} vapor deposition (PECVD) is a cost-effective, performance-enhancing {{technique that}} can provide surface passivation and produce an effective antireflection coating layer at the same time. To gain the full benefit from improved emitter surface passivation on cell performance, {{it is necessary to}} tailor the emitter doping profile so that the emitter is lightly doped between the gridlines, but heavily doped under them. This selectively patterned emitter doping profile has historically been obtained by using expensive photolithographic or screen-printed alignment techniques and multiple high-temperature diffusion steps. We built on a self-aligned emitter <b>etchback</b> technique first described by Spectrolab. We included PECVD-nitride deposition because the low- recombination emitter produced by the <b>etchback</b> requires good surface passivation for improved cell performance. The nitride also provides a good antireflection coating. We studied whether plasma-etching techniques can use standard screen-printed gridlines at etch masks to form self-aligned, patterned-emitter profiles on multicrystalline (MC-Si) cells from Solarex Corp. This investigation determined that reactive ion etching (RIE) is compatible with using standard, commercial, screen printed gridlines as etch masks to form self- aligned, selectively-doped emitter profiles. This process results in reduced gridline contact resistance when followed by PECVD treatments, an undamaged emitter surface easily passivated by plasma-nitride, and a less heavily doped emitter between gridlines for reduced emitter recombination. This allows for heavier doping beneath the gridlines for even lower contact resistance, reduced contact recombination, and better bulk defect gettering.

40|$|Shallow trench {{isolation}} (STI) is the mainstream CMOS isolation technology. It uses {{chemical mechanical planarization}} (CMP) to remove excess of deposited oxide and attain a planar surface for successive process steps. Despite advances in STI CMP technology, pattern dependencies cause large post-CMP topography variation that can result in functional and parametric yield loss. Fill insertion is used to reduce pattern variation and consequently decrease post-CMP topography variation. Traditional fill insertion is rulebased and is used with reverse <b>etchback</b> to attain desired planarization quality. Due to extra costs associated with reverse <b>etchback,</b> “single-step ” STI CMP in which fill insertion suffices is desirable. To alleviate the failures caused by imperfect CMP, we focus on two objectives for fill insertion: oxide density variation minimization and nitride density maximization. A linear programming based optimization {{is used to calculate}} oxide densities that minimize oxide density variation. Next a fill insertion methodology is presented that attains the calculated oxide density while maximizing the nitride density. Averaged over the two large testcases, the oxide density variation is reduced by 63 % and minimum nitride density is increased by 79 % compared to tiling-based fill insertion. To assess post-CMP planarization, we run CMP simulation on the layout filled with our approach and find the planarization window (time window in which polishing can be stopped) to increase by 17 % and maximum final step height (maximum difference in post-CMP oxide thickness) to decrease by 9 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} for it to serve as a guide for understanding high density plasma induced damage during wafer fabrication and <b>etchback</b> for device debug, electron-beam, and failure analysis. A study of electrical degradation of packaged and fully processed transistors that were functionally etched back was carried out. Two high density plasma technologies, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP), from various vendors, were evaluated. Transconductance (gm), threshold voltage (Vt), subthreshold slope, and gate leakage (Ig) were measured before and after the functional etch. Degradation took place even without polysilicon being directly exposed to the plasma. It was found that there is a strong correlation between the threshold voltage shift, and gate current shift, and they exhibit a bimodal relationship. The gate edge intensive transistor was most susceptible to degradation. The design of the etchers seemed to be the key factor rather than the choice of technology (ECR or ICP) with regard to transistor degradation.

The field oxide was grown at 9758 C in H 2 /O 2 to a thickness of 500 nm. After LOCOS and PBL <b>etchback</b> removal of the active-region blocking layers, a sacrificial oxide of 50 nm was grown at 9508 C in H 2 /O 2. The p-well was made using boron with doses in the range 1012 to 1013 cm 22 implanted at several ener-gies. n 1 p diodes were formed using As 1 implantation at 75 keV with doses of about 1015 cm 22, {{followed by}} a furnace anneal (FA) at 9008 C or rapid thermal anneal (RTA) at 11008 C. Ramp-up and ramp-down rates for RTA are 508 C/s and have been kept constant. The carrier con-centration of the n 1 layer after activation is about 1020 cm 23. After FA the junctions are 0. 2 mm deep and after RTA the depth is 0. 17 mm, as obtained from spreading resistance profiling (SRP) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements. The diodes are directly con...|$|E
