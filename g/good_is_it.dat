[...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie <b>good?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E

No. Sorry, but I can't {{go so far}} as to call a glorified What If? series anything more than what it is; a well done re-imagination of the Marvel Universe." [...] Entertainment Weekly declared that the combination of writing and moody artwork meant [...] "the Marvel Universe hasn't been this engrossing in ages." [...] ShakingThrough.net noted that fans looking for elements of Gaiman's The Sandman would be disappointed; [...] "It's not a senses-shattering Marvel epic, but then it's not meant to be. It's nothing more or less than a chance to enjoy reinterpretations of some familiar characters." [...] UGO Networks concurred, stating [...] "there doesn't need to be a 'point' in re-imagining familiar icons — it's simply meant to be fun. [...] The result of 1602 is agreeable entertainment." [...] The series won several awards, including the Quill Book Award for Graphic Novels. The first issue was also awarded the 2003 Diamond Distributors Gem Award as [...] "Comic of the Year".|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie <b>good?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
