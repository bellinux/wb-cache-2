5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E
25|$|Since it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> so many {{events from}} His arrest to His crucifixion to be crammed into {{a short time}} span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning, some argued {{for more than one}} day Passion chronology, {{including}} Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965).|$|E
25|$|In some of {{the early}} manuscripts in which the pericope adulterae does not appear after John 7:52 (such as P66 and P75 and Codex N), the final page of the Gospel of John has not survived, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether or not the passage had been transplanted {{to the end of the}} book.|$|E

50|$|A {{more recent}} series by Lee, {{entitled}} Parts (2002-2005) features images of Lee posing in different settings {{with a male}} partner, cropped <b>to</b> make it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> directly <b>see</b> who she is with.|$|R
25|$|Far {{ultraviolet}} light is absorbed effectively by the neutral {{components of the}} ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, it is nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because {{most of it is}} absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|According to Henry, {{life can}} never {{be seen from the}} exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and {{experiences}} itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world we never see life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them. In the same way, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> another person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it {{at the end of a}} scalpel.|$|E
25|$|Visibility {{can vary}} from nearly {{unlimited}} to low, or non-existent, and can go from one extreme to {{the other in a}} single dive. While a less-intensive kind of diving called cavern diving does not take divers beyond the reach of natural light (and typically no deeper than 100ft, and penetration not further than 200ft), true cave diving can involve penetrations of many thousands of feet, well beyond the reach of sunlight. The level of darkness experienced creates an environment <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in without an artificial form of light. Caves often contain sand, mud, clay, silt, or other sediment that can further reduce underwater visibility in seconds when stirred up.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, one of {{the most}} {{important}} and consequential developments in biogeography has been to show how multiple organisms, including mammals like monkeys and reptiles like lizards, overcame barriers such as large oceans that many biogeographers formerly believed were <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> cross. <b>See</b> also Oceanic dispersal.|$|R

50|$|Todd Brown, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, notes that this film, {{looks to be}} a beautifully shot piece of work, and that, while it was <b>impossible</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an awful lot of Mel Brooks {{influence}} on writer-director's previous film G.O.R.A. this one sees Yilmaz in a much more restrained mode that I think plays a fair bit better.|$|R
25|$|A louvred door has {{fixed or}} movable wooden fins (often called slats or louvers) which permit open {{ventilation}} while preserving privacy and preventing {{the passage of}} light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for wardrobes and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form window shutters. Double louvred doors were introduced into Seagate, built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy {{in that it is}} <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through the fins in any direction.|$|E
25|$|Since the incident, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management has {{installed}} additional numerous large {{signs on the}} approaches to Bear Camp Road, warning that the road may be impassable during winter months. Also, the directional sign ("To Gold Beach and Coast") {{at the spot where}} the Kims turned onto the wrong road, has been moved and replaced. At the spot, the through road is narrow and steeply uphill while the side road is much wider and more level and appears to be the proper continuation. The location and arrow direction on the old sign was confusing and ambiguous, especially in snow when it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the narrow uphill road is the correct route while the wide level road is not.|$|E
25|$|The {{work on the}} pediments {{lasted from}} 438 to 432BC, and the sculptures of the Parthenon pediments {{are some of the}} finest {{examples}} of classical Greek art. The figures are sculpted in natural movement with bodies full of vital energy that bursts through their flesh, as the flesh in turn bursts through their thin clothing. The thin chitons reveal the body underneath as the focus of the composition. The distinction between gods and humans is blurred in the conceptual interplay between the idealism and naturalism bestowed on the stone by the sculptors. Every statue in the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.|$|E
5000|$|If telefinalism, by {{postulating}} {{the intervention}} of an Idea, a Will, a supreme Intelligence, throws a little light on the combined transformations leading through an uninterrupted line to Man, it seems <b>impossible</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the particular transformations limited to the species something more than the simple play of physico-chemical forces and chance.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{hold that}} there has been extensive editorial reshaping of the stories and statements within the Talmud. Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, and that we can say little for certain about their authorship. In this view, the questions above are <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> answer. <b>See,</b> for example, the works of Louis Jacobs and Shaye J.D. Cohen.|$|R
25|$|Utor {{made its}} {{landfall}} in Casiguran, Aurora at 3 AM (local time) on August 12. Power lines and telecommunications {{went down and}} many houses were destroyed. In Nueva Vizcaya, heavy rainfall had been recorded. Some residents in the said province were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Moreover, the Magat River in the province reached the critical level, resulting in the partial opening of four gates in a dam. Electricity was also out in the province. One man died on Baguio City {{after he had been}} buried alive after a mudslide hit his home. In Isabela, more than 100 families had been affected by Utor. About 200 million pesos in agriculture was blamed on Utor in Isabela alone. Around 1,000 residents in the central Bicol region spent the night in shelters, and 23 fishermen who were out at sea failed to return home in four towns in Catanduanes province. Some cars in North Luzon Expressway used hazard signals as roads were nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Intense rainfall throughout the day had been recorded in Zambales, which created flash flooding in low lying areas. The major river on the province then overflowed, flooding homes. The flood is expected to get higher as high tide is expected in the morning. At least 700 passengers were stranded in the ports of Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Samar. Additionally, 10 flights had also been canceled as Utor brought intense rainfall in many parts of Luzon.|$|E

500|$|I {{saw many}} signs in this campaign, {{some of them}} were not friendly; some were very friendly. But the one that touched me the most was one that I saw in Deshler, Ohio, {{at the end of a}} long day of whistle-stopping. A little town. I suppose five times the {{population}} was there in the dusk. It was almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> but a teenager held up a sign, [...] "Bring Us Together." [...] And that will be the great objective of this administration at the outset, to bring the American people together.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>impossible</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in {{the look}} of Trevelyan's face, and not to hear {{in the tone of}} his voice, that he was, at the moment, in an angry and unhappy frame of mind. He did not move as though he were willing to {{accompany}} his friend, and seemed almost to know beforehand that the approaching interview was to be an unpleasant one.|$|R

500|$|Most wartime optical sights {{like the}} Mk. XIV were useless for {{operations}} in jet aircraft. Flying at roughly twice the altitude {{and three times}} the speed of their wartime antecedents, the range, the distance the bombs travelled after being dropped, increased from perhaps [...] {{to as much as}} [...] This long range, plus the additional altitude, made the distance between the target and aircraft so great that it was often <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the target before the aircraft had already passed the drop point. Optical bombing quickly gave way to radar bombing, although the Mk. XIV remained in RAF service until 1965.|$|E
500|$|The critic Johan Henric Kellgren, in his {{introduction}} to the first edition, found that the songs could not be known fully only as poems. Never before, he stated, had the art of poetry and the art of music been more fraternally united. They were not, Kellgren argued, verse that had been set to music; not music, set to verse; but the two were so thoroughly melted together into One beauty that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> which would most miss the other for its fulfilment. Quoting this in the final paragraph of his thesis, the musicologist James Massengale commented [...] "That is how it ought to be said!" ...|$|E

It {{was described as}} being of a Chinese style, designed in the octagonal form of a lotus flower, with eight gates in the [...] Ðại Nam nhất thống chí, the official records of the Nguyen Dynasty. However, such records {{are believed to have}} been written metaphorically, rather than literally. Two French maps of the city, drawn by de Puymanel and Jean-Marie Dayot—another senior officer—in 1799 and 1815 respectively, show a square-shaped design, with four main towers at the corners, and six outer half-towers. Louis Malleret said that [...] "it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any octagonal design in this".|$|E

500|$|Finally, in mid-August, the Persian {{army was}} sighted across the Malian Gulf {{approaching}} Thermopylae. With the Persian army's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war. Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus. The Phocians and Locrians, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic {{and agreed to}} defend Thermopylae. According to Plutarch, {{when one of the}} soldiers complained that, [...] "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the sun", Leonidas replied, [...] "Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?"

They were now faced with the complex task of coordinating the lowering of 20boats carrying a possible total of 1,100people [...] down the sides of the ship. Thomas E. Bonsall, a historian of the disaster, has commented that the evacuation was so badly organised that [...] "even if they had the number [...] lifeboats they needed, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they could have launched them" [...] given the lack of time and poor leadership.|$|E
500|$|Among other {{information}} retrieved from the archives was {{the revelation that}} the remaining Italian stone mosaics {{were found in the}} burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: [...] "It is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed".|$|E
