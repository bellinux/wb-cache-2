40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the slaughter and carcass traits and the effects of sex on these traits of native <b>geese</b> <b>reared</b> in Muş. A total of 41 geese (17 male and 24 female) which were 8 - 10 months of age were used. The means of slaughter weight, cold carcass weight, head weight, feet weight, heart weight, liver weight, gizzard weight and spleen weight were 3968. 6, 2678. 7, 172. 1, 131. 4, 38. 6, 69. 3, 144. 3, 2. 28 g for males, and 3212. 2, 2047. 6, 138. 5, 113. 0, 24. 8, 76. 3, 142. 2, 2. 18 g for females respectively. Significant phenotypic correlation coefficients were calculated between slaughter weight and feather, head and feet weights in both sex groups and between carcass weight and feather and feet weight in only male geese. Slaughter weight was positively related with heart and gizzard weights in males, carcass weight was negatively related with liver weight in females (r= - 0. 45). In conclusion, the results of obtained in this study indicated that meat yield was low of the <b>geese</b> <b>reared</b> extensively in Muş province, the slaughter and carcass trait and the phenotypic correlations among of this traits were affected by sex...|$|R
6000|$|The Kea (Nestor notabilis) is {{a curious}} parrot inhabiting the {{mountain}} ranges of the Middle Island of New Zealand. It belongs {{to the family of}} Brush-tongued parrots, and naturally feeds on the honey of flowers and the insects which frequent them, together with such fruits or berries as are found in the region. Till quite recently this comprised its whole diet, but since the country it inhabits has become occupied by Europeans it has developed a taste for a carnivorous diet, with alarming results. It began by picking the sheepskins hung out to dry or the meat in process of being cured. About 1868 it was first observed to attack living sheep, which had frequently been found with raw and bleeding wounds on their backs. Since then it is stated that the bird actually burrows into the living sheep, eating its way down to the kidneys, which form its special delicacy. As a natural consequence, the bird is being destroyed as rapidly as possible, and one of the rare and curious members of the New Zealand fauna will no doubt shortly cease to exist. The case affords a remarkable instance of how the climbing feet and powerful hooked beak developed for one set of purposes can be applied to another altogether different purpose, and it also shows how little real stability there may be in what appear to us the most fixed habits of life. A somewhat similar change of diet has been recorded by the Duke of Argyll, in which a <b>goose,</b> <b>reared</b> by a golden eagle, was taught by its foster-parent to eat flesh, which it continued to do regularly and apparently with great relish.[26] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{environmental}} consequences of cereal choice and form of {{presentation of the}} diet given to <b>geese</b> <b>reared</b> for foie gras production. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of the production of 1 kg of foie gras {{was used to examine}} several feeding strategies for substituting maize by sorghum: during the growing–finishing and/or overfeeding period; in a complete pelleted diet or as whole grains. The data come from in-field management practices on representative French goose farms for the breeding, hatching and slaughtering stages of production, and in vivo experiments for the growing–finishing and overfeeding stages. The impact categories were calculated using the CML 2 baseline method. Our data showed that the effects of cereal type on the environmental impact of foie gras were dependent on feed level and stage of inclusion. Birds fed exclusively with sorghum during both the growing–finishing period and the overfeeding period had lower environmental impacts than birds fed with maize, for all the potential impacts calculated (e. g. − 17 % for global warming potential). A diet presented in a simplified form during the growing–finishing period had no effect on foie gras impacts when the cereal used was maize (difference between groups < 7 %), but increased them when it was sorghum (from + 16 % for water use to + 22 % eutrophication and acidification potential), due to higher bird mortality during the overfeeding period. These results suggest that changes in bird feeding practices could contribute to a more environmentally-friendly production system for foie gras if animal performance is note reduced. Hence, substitution of maize by sorghum can lessen the environmental impacts of foie gras production and thus offer a valuable alternative in response to water shortages in southern France, but its use in a simplified form hinges on prior improvement of rearing practices to limit subsequent mortality...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} rain on {{growth rates of}} {{individually}} marked shoots of a preferred food plant, Festuca rubra, was studied in a temperate barnacle <b>goose</b> brood <b>rearing</b> area during three consecutive years. We found that grass growth declined to zero well before fledging of the goslings during dry years, and that rain had an immediate short-term positive effect on grass growth, especially {{towards the end of}} the growing season. Experimentally we found some indication that water is limiting grass growth {{towards the end of the}} season. Besides that, there might have been an additional effect of adding droppings. Thus, rain is an important factor influencing grass growth rates, which in turn influence both quantity and quality of food plants. We propose such an effect as the mechanism explaining effects of rain on important life history parameters that have been documented earlier for this barnacle goose population, as well as in other herbivores...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed at}} {{examining}} {{the effect of}} overfeeding on {{the activity of the}} mTOR pathway in the liver and muscle tissues of Gang geese. Eighty healthy male Gang <b>geese</b> were <b>reared</b> under the same feeding conditions, and were divided at 14 weeks of age into a control group and an overfed group. All birds were slaughtered after three weeks of over feeding. Gene expression and protein content of several genes involved in the mTOR pathway were evaluated. The results showed that the gene expression of mTOR, raptor, and rictor, and the protein contents of mTOR and PI 3 K were higher in liver, breast muscle, and leg muscle of the overfed group than that of control group. However, the S 6 K expression level was clearly lower in the liver of the overfed group than that of control group, and there was no evident difference in both breast muscle and leg muscle between the control group and the overfed group. These results suggest that overfeeding induces the activity of raptor, rictor, and mTOR, and that mTOR signaling pathway was closely linked with PI 3 K pathway in the evaluated geese...|$|R
40|$|This study {{executed}} {{the economic}} return of naturally and artificially hatched geese in intensive and free-range production systems at different fattening periods. The animal material was consisted of 216 goslings which were naturally and artificially hatched from the eggs collected from back-yard. Goslings and feed {{was the highest}} share of variable expenses. Highest net profit from live and carcass sales was obtained from geese which were artificially hatched and reared in intensive (YK) and free-range (YSG) systems until 14, 16 and 18 weeks of age. Live sale relative profit was found higher at 14 weeks in YK and YSG groups. Relative profit of carcass sales in YSG and YK groups at 14 and 16 weeks; and YK group at 18 weeks. As a conclusion, when we consider feed consumption, feed conversion ratio and probable mortality at older ages-related to metabolic problems; 14 weeks seemed as the optimal slaughter age and economic return for the naturally and artificially hatched <b>geese</b> which were <b>reared</b> in intensive and free-range systems...|$|R
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} comparing fatty livers obtained from overfeeding or from an alternative method. Indeed, it {{has previously been}} shown that, under specific handling conditions and without overfeeding, {{it was possible to}} obtain in Greylag geese (Anser anser) a spontaneous liver steatosis. The livers were compared for chemical and lipid composition, quality indicators, sensory traits and acceptability by consumers. Two hundred and thirty male <b>geese</b> were <b>reared,</b> but for practical reasons only ninety five livers were analyzed in this experiment. From hatching, geese were subdivided in three groups, and each group followed different rearing treatments. Eighty five birds followed a standard overfeeding method, one hundred and twenty five birds followed an alternative one, based on the simulation of premigratory period, and a third group of twenty birds was used as control. After treatment all animals were slaughtered, respectively at 17 (overfed), 31 (stimulated) an 19 weeks (control) of age. During the treatment there was an increase in body and liver weight, for both treatments groups as compared to control. The average values of liver weight were strongly higher in overfed birds (1102 g) than in the stimulated (445 g). Lipid analysis shows that overfed birds’ livers have higher lipid content (56 %) than stimulated livers (53 %), whereas free glucose and glycogen are higher in stimulated birds’ livers. Neutral lipid profile, obtained by Gas Chromatography (GC), showed some differences between the two groups, mainly in term of diglycerides and cholesterol esters. Sensory analysis indicated that fatty livers obtained under standard overfeeding conditions were globally more appreciated than those obtained by stimulation. Results for an alternative production of fatty liver are encouraging, however the variability in the individual response remains very high. Further research is needed to better understand the origin of this variability...|$|R
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of <b>rearing</b> <b>geese</b> is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|R
40|$|The brood-rearing {{period in}} giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) {{is one of}} the least-studied areas of goose ecology. We {{monitored}} 32 broods in Putnam County, Tennessee, from the time of hatching through fledging (i. e., when the goslings gained the ability to fly) and from fledging until broods left the brood-rearing areas during {{the spring and summer of}} 2003. We conducted a fixed-kernel, home-range analysis for each brood using the Animal Movement Extension in ArcView® 3. 3 GIS (ESRI, Redlands, Calif.) software and calculated 95 % and 50 % utilization distributions (UD) for each brood. We classified 25 broods as sedentary (8 ha 95 % UD), three as shifters (84 ha 95 % UD), two as wanderers (110 ha 95 %UD); two were unclassified because of low sample size. We measured 5 habitat variables (i. e., percentage of water, percentage of pasture, percentage of development, number of ponds, and distance to nearest unused pond) within a 14. 5 -ha buffer at nesting locations. We used linear regression, using multi-model selection, information theoretic analysis, to determine which, if any, habitat variables influenced home-range size at a landscape level. The null model was the best information-theoretic model, and the global model was not significant, indicating that landscape level habitat variables selected in this study cannot be used to predict homerange size in the Upper Cumberland region goose flock. We analyzed associations among broods, using a coefficient of association of at least 0. 50, and determined association areas by overlaying individual home ranges. Overall gosling survival (Ŝ) during the brood-rearing period was 0. 84 (95 % CL = 0. 78, 0. 92), using a staggered-entry Kaplan-Meier survival curve. We believe that abundance of quality forage and pond habitat, high survivorship, and a lack of movement corridors (i. e., rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) were responsible for the relatively small home ranges of geese in the Upper Cumberland region. Associations formed during brood rearing may reduce predation risks and serve as a template for lifelong social bonds with family members and unrelated <b>geese</b> that are <b>reared</b> in the same locations...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of egg size and brood dispersal on gosling {{growth and survival}} was studied in Ross' and Lesser Snow Geese hatched at Karrak Lake, N. W. T. Variation in neonate composition can influence growth, energetics and, possibly, subsequent dispersal patterns of young. Therefore, the relative nutrient profile and physiological development level of neonates in these two dimorphic species were examined by analyzing egg and gosling composition for seasonal, egg size and species-specific effects. Late laid eggs had less yolk protein and, in Ross' Geese, produced goslings with smaller pectoralis muscles. Since skeletal muscles are important for thermogenesis, this seasonal variation in muscle tissue may influence thermoregulatory abilities of late-hatched young. Egg composition varied isometrically with egg size. However, goslings from larger eggs were relatively smaller for their egg size yet contained the same relative nutrient content as goslings from smaller eggs. Because of their higher lipid:body size ratio, goslings from larger eggs were in better condition. Thus larger egg size may give an initial energetic advantage to goslings during periods of nutritional or thermal stress. Although no interspecific variation was observed for egg components, Ross' Goose goslings hatched with more protein for their egg size and larger gizzards for their body size. In addition, Ross' Goose goslings had less water per gram of lean dry mass than did Snow Goose goslings which indicates a greater functional maturity of Ross' Goose neonate tissue. Digestive efficiency, thermoregulatory ability and locomotor capacity may be relatively better in Ross' Geese and these characteristics may represent adaptations to metabolic constraints associated with smaller neonate body size and foraging requirements. Resource depletion around large nesting colonies may influence brood movements and subsequent growth and survival of nidifugous young. If per capita food availability increased with distance from the colony, then I predicted that broods settling farther from natal colonies should produce structurally larger and/or relatively heavier goslings than those broods feeding locally. I used radio telemetry to recapture marked broods and found indirect evidence of a nutrient gradient around the Karrak Lake colony. Broods dispersed 8 - 59 km away from Karrak Lake with Ross' Geese travelling farther than Snow Geese (19 - 59 km vs 8 - 21 km, respectively). These dispersal patterns may {{be a function of}} parental behavior, body size, bill morphology and nutrient requirements. For known age Ross' <b>Goose</b> goslings, birds <b>reared</b> farther from the colony were heavier for their body size than were goslings raised nearer to Karrak Lake. Body size varied randomly with distance in this sample. Both body size and condition varied positively with distance for Ross' and Snow Goose goslings of unknown age which were measured at marked brood recapture sites. A similar pattern was observed for body size in unmarked adults and this similarity may reflect common environmental effects during the growth period of adults and goslings. Although I found no distance effect on gosling survival, egg size was a significant determinant of within- (Snow and, possibly, Ross' Geese) and among-brood survival (Ross' Geese). Because goslings raised closer to the colony may fledge in poorer condition and thus may have lower first year survival, female philopatry to brood-rearing areas could indirectly influence parental fitness...|$|R
