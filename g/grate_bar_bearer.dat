The paper discusses the conditions of the <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> of conveyor roasting and sintering machines wear, depending on the adopted loading schemes. The materials to be processed can be loaded directly from the hopper (direct download) or through the use of a feeder (drum-type feeder, roller, etc.). A simplified method to predict the <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> surface wear on the strength of a number of assumptions has been developed: normal reaction of the pallet surface to the impact of the batch is assumed constant, equal to the maximum of its value when the pallet is in horizontal position; a layer of the batch moves as a rigid body; surface batch layer sliding velocity as related to the pallet surface is taken medium during the relative motion of the layer and equal to the linear velocity of the pallets; the side faces of the <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> wear is related to related to the surface wear by linear dependence.

40|$|Abstract. The as-cast {{structure}} of <b>grate</b> <b>bar</b> used in sintering trolley is primarily comprised of austenite and eutectic (eutectic austenite and eutectic carbide). The austenite is dendrite, while the carbide is reticular and chrysanthemum-like. The <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> were {{quenched and tempered}} under various temperature (one set of samples: quenching (975 ~ 1050 °C); the other: quenching (1000 °C) + tempering (240 ~ 600 °C)). With rise in quenching temperature, the content of martensite increases and gradually stabilizes, and the hardness increases and then decreases (the maximum is 61. 5 HRC). For the tempered simple, the strip-like carbides gradually become smaller, shorter and homogenized; the resistance to temper softening is high and the maximum hardness is 58 HRC; the wear resistance gradually decreases and is {{lower than that of}} as-cast one when the temperature is higher than 480 °C. The heat treatment process to improve the service properties of <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> is: quenching (1000 °C, 2. 5 h, and air-cooling) + tempering (300 ~ 420 °C, 2. 5 h, and air-cooling) ...|$|R

50|$|Many inlets have {{gratings}} or grids {{to prevent}} people, vehicles, large objects or debris from {{falling into the}} storm drain. <b>Grate</b> <b>bars</b> are spaced so that {{the flow of water}} is not impeded, but sediment and many small objects can also fall through. However, if <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> are too far apart, the openings may present a risk to pedestrians, bicyclists, and others in the vicinity. Grates with long narrow slots parallel to traffic flow are of particular concern to cyclists, as the front tire of a bicycle may become stuck, causing the cyclist to go over the handlebars or lose control and fall. Storm drains in streets and parking areas must be strong enough to support the weight of vehicles, and are often made of cast iron or reinforced concrete.|$|R

50|$|Wangi 'A' Station {{consisted}} of three 50 MW Parsons turbo-alternators. Steam was supplied at 650PSI and 840degF from six spreader-stoker coal-fired Babcock & Wilcox (UK) (now Babcock International) cross drum boilers. The firing system {{consisted of}} the Spreader Stoker and Babcock & Wilcox Detroit Rotograte. Rapidly rotating blades of the spreader feeder unit flung coal of the required size onto the rotograte, with a large percentage igniting before landing on the grate. The amount of coal feed could be regulated by varying {{the length of the}} stroke of the pusher plate supplying fuel to the coal feeder. There were two rotogrates fitted which consisted of two endless chains carrying transverse <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> in a revolving action. Eight coal feeder units controlled through Reeves variable speed control drive. Each boiler had an output of 180,000 lb/h. It was a project of New South Wales Government Railways, but control was transferred before its completion to the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which was formed in 1950.|$|R

Each completely spanned his physiognomy; one extending in a line with his eyes, another crossing the face {{in the vicinity of the}} nose, and the third sweeping along his lips from ear to ear. His countenance thus triply hooped, as it were, with tattooing, always reminded me of those unhappy wretches whom I have sometimes observed gazing out sentimentally from behind the <b>grated</b> <b>bars</b> of a prison window; whilst the entire body of my savage valet, covered all over with representations of birds and fishes, and a variety of most unaccountable-looking creatures, suggested to me the idea of a pictorial museum of natural history, or an illustrated copy of Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.|$|R
30|$|Guard rails were {{installed}} over {{the length of}} the track bridge to prevent wheel derailment. The addition of the guard rails also had the effect of stiffening the frame made up of the rails and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars,</b> thereby limiting lateral movement of the rails under train passage. The guard rails were continuous across the CESuRa system, connected to the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> using machined pins, and connected to the guard rail of the adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution of the guard rails in order to promote distributed curvature of the track-rail frame under yaw movements while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R

30|$|Figure  6 b {{shows the}} ends of the {{floating}} and transition spans in the sagging curve deformed configuration, i.e., when the lake level is below the neutral position. If the rectangular planes (the floating and transition spans) rotate relative to each other along hinge line DD’, the ends B and B’ of the wings will rise and the wings will rotate about their longitudinal edges, namely axes AB* and A’B’*, in order to maintain contact with the spans at points C and C'. As the wing ABC rotates, the arc will rotate about the chord line AB* so that it is no longer in the horizontal plane. The bearings that are placed along the arc, and the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> that rest on them, will therefore move vertically. The <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> are free to slide transversely on the bearings through a limited distance, and the rails that rest on them adopt a vertically curved shape equal to the vertical component of the arc on the rotated wing. The bearings can be placed at any spacing on the wing, so any degree of support can be provided to the rails while forcing them to go through the desired vertical curvature. If the wings and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> were infinitely stiff, the rails would be supported rigidly at each <b>bearer</b> <b>bar</b> and the vertical curve of the track would be the one defined by the rotated arc. In practice, they will have some flexibility, so the shape of the track will differ slightly from the idealized shape computed in the following sections.|$|R
30|$|Two primary bearing {{types are}} needed: three wing support {{bearings}} per wing, {{and a number}} of multi-rotational bearings along the bearing yoke for the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> that support the rails. In each case, the bearings need to accommodate motion in several directions.|$|R
5000|$|... “The furnace is a {{cylinder}} {{about three feet}} in diameter and five feet long. It has <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> {{at the bottom and}} an under draft. Above it is a hopper into which wood is placed, a panel is withdrawn and the wood falls into the cylinder. A fire is started in this cylinder in the usual manner, and it is kept up until the furnace has attained the heat of from 1,200 to 1,400°F. The principal object is to heat the furnace, but the surplus heat is conducted into the oven or retort where the body is to be incinerated. Having gotten the furnace to the required heat the lower door is put up and hermetically sealed with fire clay. Wood is then put into the furnace through the hopper until it is quite full, when the top is also tightly closed. The heated furnace distills the wood, and the gas generated passes into the retort. The fire was started yesterday {{an hour and a half}} before the incineration was to begin. When the gas was ready it was lighted in the retort, and instantly the place was filled with a glow of orange flame. The retort was somewhat heated by the preliminary fire but when the gas began to combust, the temperature rapidly rose to the required 2,200°F.” ...|$|R
30|$|Where {{there is}} {{significant}} yaw movement, part of the yaw rotation is manifested as a distributed curvature along the track bridge and part as concentrated rotations at the ends. The extent of each is governed by the lateral bending stiffness of the frame {{made up of the}} (longitudinal) rails and the (transverse) <b>bearer</b> <b>bars.</b> The fasteners that connect the rails to the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> allow some rotation, and if fasteners with no longitudinal restraint are used, then the rotation is essentially free, so that system is flexible and promotes distributed curvature along the track bridge. Guard rails mounted rigidly in the track panel provide more frame action, make the track bridge stiffer, and thus force more of the total rotation into the concentrated rotations at the ends of the track bridge.|$|R
50|$|The cement floored {{basement}} {{is divided}} into two mechanical rooms and a workshop.

There is one office room and a long eaves room on the rear which is used for storage.|$|R
30|$|The <b>bearer</b> <b>bar</b> support {{bearings}} must allow for rotation about all three axes, {{with the largest}} motions likely about the longitudinal axis of the bridge. They must also accommodate some transverse displacement, which occurs as the wings rotate. Although this displacement is nominally a second-order effect, it is nonetheless large enough that provision must be made for it.|$|R
30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the support {{bearings}} introduces small discontinuities in {{the slope of the}} rails at the ends of the CESuRa assembly. The use of lower-profile wings and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> reduces those discontinuities, but their lower stiffness increases deflections due to the passage of rail vehicles. Therefore, there is a balance to be drawn.|$|R
30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the wing support {{bearings}} (due to the {{height of the}} wing girders, the FPS bearings, <b>bearer</b> <b>bars,</b> and rail fasteners) modifies the kinematics of the idealized system described previously. The twist of the wing girders leads to an additional vertical displacement of the yoke curves caused by the rigid body rotation of the wing girder, and the yoke curves translate toward or away from one another, depending on the direction of twist. A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces. These can both be considered second-order effects and were minimized in the floating bridge application by limiting {{the height of the}} components of the system. This was achieved by using a thin wing girder along the bearing yoke surface that was stiffened by an edge beam and coping the ends of the <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> where they connected to the friction pendulum bearings.|$|R
60|$|The Lords of Burgundy retired, much {{pleased with}} the grace of Louis's manner, and the artful {{distribution}} of his attentions; and the King was left with {{only one or two}} of his own personal followers, under the archway of the base court of the Castle of Peronne, looking on the huge tower which occupied one of the angles, being in fact the Donjon, or principal Keep, of the palace. This tall, dark, massive building was seen clearly by the same moon which was lighting Quentin Durward betwixt Charleroi and Peronne, which, as the reader is aware, shone with peculiar lustre. The great Keep was in form nearly resembling the White Tower in the Citadel of London, but still more ancient in its architecture, deriving its date, as was affirmed, from the days of Charlemagne.

25|$|A {{gridiron}} is a metal <b>grate</b> with parallel <b>bars</b> {{typically used}} for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It {{may also be}} two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely hold food while grilling over an open flame. Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut. U.S. Patent #78 was issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836. The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent #408,136 on July 30, 1889, for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.|$|R
30|$|In {{the absence}} of pitch and roll, the {{response}} of the CESuRa system to yaw consists simply of in-plane deformation of the system of rails and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars,</b> acting as a frame; the rotations of the wings about their own longitudinal axes play no part. As the floating section of the bridge moves laterally, the transition span rotates as a rigid body about a vertical axis, so the track and the CESuRa at either end of it must accommodate that rotation. If the track lies at mid-width of the bridge, this involves lengthening of one rail and shortening of the other, but if, the tracks are {{at the side of the}} bridge, both rails must elongate or shorten, although by different amounts. The changes in length are accommodated by the expansion joints, in the same way as for surge.|$|R
60|$|Up {{and down}} {{the height of the}} tower were {{scattered}} three or four windows, the lower ones <b>grated</b> with iron <b>bars,</b> the upper ones vacant both of window frames and glass. Besides these larger openings, there were several loopholes and little square apertures, which might be supposed to light the staircase, that doubtless climbed the interior towards the battlemented and machicolated summit. With this last-mentioned warlike garniture upon its stern old head and brow, the tower seemed evidently a stronghold of times long past. Many a crossbowman had shot his shafts from those windows and loop-holes, and from the vantage height of those gray battlements; many a flight of arrows, too, had hit all round about the embrasures above, or the apertures below, where the helmet of a defender had momentarily glimmered. On festal nights, moreover, a hundred lamps had often gleamed afar over the valley, suspended from the iron hooks that were ranged for the purpose beneath the battlements and every window.|$|R
30|$|The {{floating}} bridge project included {{evaluation of the}} CESuRa system using numerical simulations [13], preliminary proof-of-concept tests at the University of Washington [14, 15], and full-scale tests of the system under dynamic LRV loads [16, 17]. These studies showed that the system could accommodate joint rotations {{in excess of the}} project requirements with LRV travel at 88.5  kph (55  mph) [16]. Stresses in the rails and <b>bearer</b> <b>bars</b> were found to be less than 138  MPa (20  ksi) under these conditions [14, 17], the lateral displacements under LRV loading were less than 6  mm (0.25 in.) [17], and the vertical and lateral accelerations were found to be well within acceptable limits [13, 16, 17]. These studies investigated one potential geometry of a CESuRa system and showed that it could meet the project requirements. In new applications, the system can be used to achieve similar levels of performance; however, the geometry of the system must be designed to meet the specific project requirements. How this should be done is explained in the following sections.|$|R

[...] 12 15 22 5~The tourism has been a mixed blessing for the historic center as commercial establishments open, helping the economy, but also push residents out. In the historic center, there are over 860 retail businesses, mostly restaurants, about 200 of which were established in the last five years. Residents attribute the growth to Mexico City’s promotion of the area tourism in general as well as the opening of commercial centers in the borough. While the growing business helps the economy, resident groups fear that the area will lose its current character, as many businesses are opening in formerly residential buildings, with questionable legal basis. Currently, most of the borough, especially in historic center, is residential with older adults. Property prices are high, leading to sales not to new families but rather to larger commercial interests, squeezing out smaller businesses along with residents. Neighborhood groups have formed to confront the changes and preserve the historic value of the area. Another serious problem for the area is the traffic jams and serious lack of parking in the historic center. The quantity of cars and the lack of traffic patrols have meant the proliferation of “franeleros” or people who illegally take possession of public areas such as streets to charge for parking.The historic area is centered on two large plazas filled with Indian laurel trees called the Jardin del Centenario and the Jardín Hidalgo. [...] These plazas cover an area of 24,000m2, which were renovated, along with the areas around them in 2008. The green areas were rehabilitated, and areas were paved with red and black volcanic stone. [...] Renovation of the two plazas and the streets around them cost 88.3 million pesos. For over twenty five years, these plazas, especially Plaza Hidalgo, and the streets around them were filled with vendors (wandering and with stalls). When renovation efforts began, 150 vendors were removed from the plazas proper with about 500 total including the surrounding streets. While the practice was illegal, it had been tolerated by authorities, even though it caused damage to the plazas and caused traffic problems. [...] One of the main goals of the renovation work in 2008 was to remove these vendors and move them to a new crafts bazaar built nearby. Initially, opposition to the removal of the vendors came not only from the vendors themselves, but also from some neighborhood groups and local businesses who feared their removal would hurt tourism. When renovation work finished in 2009, police were assigned to the plazas to keep vendors from returning, leading to confrontations, both physically in the plazas and legally in the courts. The borough began to issue some permits for vendors, but there was opposition. Eventually, a group representing the vendors obtained a court order to allow forty vendors to return to the plazas, citing the history of tolerating such activity in the past. This order is still opposed by some neighborhood groups, but as of 2010, there are still a limited number of these vendors selling in the plazas.|$|R
