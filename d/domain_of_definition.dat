2500|$|There are two {{distinct}} meanings in current mathematical usage {{for the notion}} of the domain of a partial function. Most mathematicians, including recursion theorists, use the term [...] "domain of f" [...] for the set of all values x such that f(x) is defined (X above). But some, particularly category theorists, consider the domain of a partial function f:X→Y to be X, and refer to X as the <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> <b>definition.</b> [...] Similarly, the term range can refer to either the codomain or the image of a function.|$|E
