25|$|The first module of the ISS, Zarya, was {{launched}} on 20 November 1998 on an autonomous Russian Proton rocket. It provided propulsion, attitude control, communications, electrical power, but lacked long-term life support functions. Two weeks later, a passive NASA module Unity {{was launched}} aboard Space Shuttle flight STS-88 {{and attached to}} Zarya by astronauts during EVAs. This module has two Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs), one connects permanently to Zarya, the other allows the Space Shuttle to dock to the space station. At that time, the Russian station Mir was still inhabited. The ISS remained unmanned for two years, while Mir was de-orbited. On 12 July 2000, Zvezda was launched into orbit. Preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna. It then became the passive target for a rendezvous with Zarya and Unity: it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the Zarya-Unity vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the Russian automated rendezvous and docking system. Zarya computer transferred control of the station to Zvezda computer soon after docking. Zvezda added sleeping quarters, a toilet, kitchen, CO2 scrubbers, <b>dehumidifier,</b> oxygen generators, exercise equipment, plus data, voice and television communications with mission control. This enabled permanent habitation of the station.|$|E

50|$|A {{conventional}} {{air conditioner}} {{is very similar}} to a mechanical/refrigeration <b>dehumidifier</b> and inherently acts as a <b>dehumidifier</b> when chilling the air. In an air conditioner, however, the air passes over the cold evaporator coils and then directly into the room. It is not re-heated by passing over the condenser, as in a refrigeration <b>dehumidifier.</b> Instead, the refrigerant is pumped by the compressor to a condenser which is located outside the room to be conditioned, and the heat is then released to the outside air. Conventional air conditioners use additional energy exhausting air outside, and new air can have more moisture than the room needs, such as a pool room that already holds a high amount of moisture in the air.|$|E

In this paper, algebraic equations for relevant mean heat and mass transfer driving forces are developed for improved modeling of bubble column <b>dehumidifiers.</b> Because mixing in the column ensures a uniform liquid temperature, the bubble column can be modeled as two single stream heat exchangers {{in contact with the}} column liquid: the seawater side, for which a log-mean temperature difference is appropriate, and the gas side, which has a varying heat capacity and mass exchange. Under typical conditions, a log-mean mass fraction difference is shown to drive latent heat transfer, and an expression for the mean temperature difference of the moist gas stream is presented. These expressions will facilitate modeling of bubble column heat and mass exchangers. National Science Foundation (U. S.)
