Moreover, in equilibrium it does not matter whether the buyer is compensated for the lost profits accruing from the rejected good or not.

PI 3 K-C 2 α knockdown also impaired endothelial cell signaling, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor internalization and endosomal RhoA activation. Together, the effects of PI 3 K-C 2 α knockdown led to defective endothelial cell migration, proliferation, tube formation and barrier integrity. Endothelial PI 3 K-C 2 α deficiency in vivo suppressed postischemic and tumor angiogenesis and diminished vascular barrier function with a greatly augmented susceptibility to anaphylaxis and a higher incidence of dissecting aortic aneurysm formation in response to angiotensin II infusion.

Most inbred mouse strains are restrictive to L. pneumophila infection {{except for the}} A/J, Nlrc 42 / 2 (Ipaf 2 / 2), and caspase- 12 / 2 derived macrophages. Particularly, caspase- 1 activation is detected during L. pneumophila infection of murine macrophages while absent in human cells. Recent in vitro experiments demonstrate that caspase- 7 is cleaved by caspase- 1. However, the biological role for caspase- 7 activation downstream of caspase- 1 is not known. Furthermore, whether this reaction is pertinent to the apoptosis or to the inflammation pathway or whether it mediates a yet unidentified effect is unclear. Using the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila, we show that, upon infection of murine macrophages, caspase- 7 was activated downstream of the Nlrc 4 inflammasome and required caspase- 1 activation. Such activation of caspase- 7 was mediated by flagellin and required a functional Naip 5. Remarkably, mice lacking caspase- 7 and its macrophages allowed substantial L. pneumophila replication. Permissiveness of caspase- 72 / 2 macrophages to the intracellular pathogen was due to <b>defective</b> <b>delivery</b> of the organism to the lysosome and to delayed cell death during early stages of infection.

The heparin releasable lipoprotein lipase (LpL) pool in both models is greatly reduced, suggesting reduced LpL {{is related to}} low albumin or π and not proteinuria. To {{determine the cause of}} endothelial LpL reduction, we studied effectors of endothelial LpL (eLpL) levels from gene expression, to delivery and endothelial binding. eLpL was measured as heparin releasable activity. eLpL and secretion rate was measured in isolated hearts perfused with heparin. mRNA levels were measured in rat hearts by kinetic RT-PCR. Finally, binding of 125 I-LpL by competition assays rat endothelial cells measured serum-induced changes in affinity. eLpL in vivo was reduced in nephrotic and Analb rats. While the eLpL pool was reduced in isolated perfused hearts, neither LpL secretion by isolated hearts nor myocardial mRNA was reduced in NS or Analb. Binding of LpL to RAEC preincubated with serum from either NS or Analb was reduced compared to control. LpL mRNA levels and release rate was not altered in hearts from NS rats, while eLpL is depleted, suggesting that reduced eLpL in NS is not the result of reduced delivery. The finding that NS serum alters LpL binding to RAEC suggests LpL depletion results from decreased binding rather than <b>defective</b> <b>delivery.</b> This in turn is a consequence of reduced serum albumin or π but does not require proteinuria...|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a membrane glycoprotein that forms Cl- channels. Previous work has shown that when some CF- associated mutants of CFTR are expressed in heterologous cells, their glycosylation is incomplete. That observation led to the hypothesis that such mutants are not delivered to the plasma membrane where they can mediate Cl- transport. Testing this hypothesis requires localization of CFTR in nonrecombinant cells and a specific determination of whether CFTR is in the apical membrane of normal and CF epithelia. To test the hypothesis, we used primary cultures of airway epithelia grown on permeable supports because they polarize and express the CF defect in apical Cl- permeability. Moreover, their dysfunction contributes to disease. We developed a semiquantitative assay, using nonpermeabilized epithelia, an antibody directed against an extracellular epitope of CFTR, and large (1 microns) fluorescent beads which bound to secondary antibodies. We observed specific binding to airway epithelia from non-CF subjects, indicating that CFTR {{is located in the}} apical membrane. In contrast, there was no specific binding to the apical membrane of CF airway epithelia. These data were supported by qualitative studies using confocal microscopy: the most prominent immunostaining was in the apical region of non-CF cells and in cytoplasmic regions of CF cells. The results indicate that CFTR is either missing from the apical membrane of these CF cells or it is present at a much reduced level. The data support the proposed <b>defective</b> <b>delivery</b> of some CF-associated mutants to the plasma membrane and explain the lack of apical Cl- permeability in most CF airway epithelia...|$|E

To avoid redundant cell binding activities, we initiated the screen with a strain deleted for two known adhesins, pH 6 antigen and the autotransporter, YapC, as well as the Caf 1 capsule, which is known to obscure some adhesins. The mutants that emerged contained insertions within the ail (attachment and invasion locus) gene of Y. pestis.

Mice infected with the Δail mutant also had 1, 000 -fold fewer bacteria in their spleens, livers, and lungs 3 days after infection than did those infected with the parental strain, KIM 5.

In vivo gp 4 exists in two molecular weight forms, a 56 -kDa form and the full-length 63 -kDa form.

40|$|European {{publishing}} {{companies are}} quickly digitizing their businesses to achieve cost savings, and increased market reach and penetration. IT is increasingly affecting {{the ways in}} which the whole value chain operates. Interaction and collaboration costs have been slashed. Physical assets are no longer the cornerstone of competitive success and value propositions. This situation became more critical mainly due to continuous increase in consumer expectations, longer demand chain, conventional mechanism for information flow resulting into poor information visibility, and use of traditional demand forecasting methods. All above issues increase marketing and distribution costs significantly resulting into under performance of firms in the hyper-competitive scenario. Electronic markets are still far from reaching a state of maturity resulting in a difficult task to safely predict the possible transformation in the distribution system structure in the IT environment. This research is an attempt to develop a strategic IT enabled demand chain management model for European publishing companies to enhance efficiency for longterm performance and gaining sustainable competitive advantage. Major results of the study are as follow: • Brand management is the most important function of marketing for the present followed by distribution channel management, advertising, sales promotion, logistics, sales administration and management, and demand forecasting and management. • Main objectives behind the growing importance of distribution are higher growth and long-term performance of business, greater market dominance and coverage, sustainable competitive advantage, cost containment, and partnering channel 7 relationships. It is because of the fact that product, price and promotion no more bring long-term competitive advantage. Distribution channel strategy is always a wellstructured system, meant for long-term and based on the philosophy of relationships, which is very difficult to copy by competitors. • Traditionally, advertising was used for brand building and management. But in the prevailing new emerging environment, emphasis is more on sales promotion and trade promotion instead of advertising. In other words, focus of promotion is more on point-of-sale brand building and management. • Information technology (IT) further complicates the whole gamut of distribution. It provides an additional channel of distribution as well as increases the magnitude of competition. It is also a new and powerful information medium for producers, wholesalers and retailers to conduct business among each other enhancing interactivity, productivity, transaction efficiency, and relationships facilitating firms in optimization of resources and containment of total cost. • Marketing intermediaries add two types of values namely, logistical and marketing values addition. Intermediaries closer to the firm add high logistical value and less marketing value. Whereas, intermediaries closer to consumers add high logistical as well as marketing values to prevent stock-out. • Multi-tier distribution system is prevailing in most of the industrial sectors barring publishing industry. In the new environment, there is every possibility of transformation in the distribution channel structure. These changes may be in the form of disintermediation and/or reintermediation. Disintermediation can be partial or complete (cybermediation). Whereas, reintermediation can be in the form of infomediary and intermediary empowerment. • European publishing firms do not prefer cybermediary for mass marketing. Some firms have Internet distribution system but only for niche markets like, institutional markets, highly premium products/brands. In the situation of partial disintermediation, most of the firms would like to prefer C&F agents in the case of publisihing companies. In no case, they have chosen retailers/dealers. The concept of infomediary is not prevailing in Europe at present but consumer respondents prefer to collect information from the Internet and then physically verify books at stores before 8 making purchase decisions. Hence, there is a bright future of infomediary in Europe. Most of the European publishing companies are in the process of integrating their demand chain members (C&F agents and stockiest) on the web for their empowerment. The overwhelming highlights of this system include containment of costs, working methodology, transparency and real-time availability of information regarding order-status, shipment schedules, replies of inquiries, credit status, stockstatus, etc. making them feel significant and committed to achieve predetermined objectives, team spirited, and excited about their work. • Partnering channel relationships is an important issue of demand chain management. It is essential to keep channel members happy, loyal and well motivated for higher growth and long-term performance of business. Furthermore, all publishing firms under study have integrating by negotiation strategy for resolution of channel conflicts. Altogether 21 factors have been identified for partnering relationships. These factors have been grouped in nine key relationship factors (KRF) on the basis of nature and characteristics. Accordingly, 5. 76 is the maximum value assigned to various aspects related to availability of products and minimum value 4. 36 given to zero-defect delivery. Out of nine factors, two factors (prompt information sharing about changes in product profile, sales policy and promotional schemes, and point-topoint information about order status, shipment/delivery schedule and tracking of movement of shipment) are having information components solely. Whereas, the efficiency of remaining seven factors can be significantly improved by the extensive use of information technology. These factors include quick responsiveness for regular availability of products as per normal and unforeseen requirements, no stock-out and fulfillment of delivery commitment, consistency in trade related service quality, prompt logistics system for recovery from <b>defective</b> <b>delivery,</b> reasonable return on investment and infrastructure, fixed and smaller replenishment cycle time, commitment for long-term association, and zero-defect delivery. IT enabled Demand Chain Management Business Model On the basis of above results, a new business model has been proposed for demand chain management taking into consideration existing issues and challenges in the new 9 environment. Value proposition of the model has been redefined in terms of “RESPECT” (Reasonable return, Efficiency, Speed, Economy of Scale, Collaboration, and Trust). For the fulfillment of above value proposition, the requirement of information will be comprehensive and its speedy flow across the demand chain, which also needs interface with firm’s ERP and SCM systems. Hence, proposed business model is an IT enabled demand chain management. The highlights of this model are hyper-responsive, partnering relationships, shared value and knowledge, and value-added service. This model also addresses the scope of disintermediation and reintermediation, prevention of unnecessary stockpiles across the demand chain, and cost reduction. The proposed IT enabled demand chain management solutions are based on certain underlying philosophical principles. It includes minimize the number of layers, adopt pull based push strategy, provide a common view of demand, have business intelligence for optimization, develop multiple supply network, continuous replenishment in small quantity, and information transparency and visibility across the demand chain. The proposed model is being validated for its feasibility, scope for use and successful implementation in the European publishing sector. On the basis of opinion of experts (top corporate executives heading distribution function), various strategic initiatives have been proposed for successful implementation of new demand chain management system. It includes collaborative planning and scheduling, training and education to demand chain members, demand chain partnering relationships, pro-active demand-driven breakthrough culture, vendor managed inventory system, and customer portfolio management. It is uniquely hyper-responsive linkage between major demand chain partners. To transcend this, however, it requires a broad understanding of marketing and distribution, sharing of information between parties and the development of personal rapport between mangers at a number of levels in all organizations of demand chain for real time quick response. Information technology can support internal operations and collaboration between demand chain members. By the use of high-speed data networks and databases, firms can share data with its business partners to better manage the whole value chain. That is why, the effective use of this technology is a key aspect of firm’s success. All information systems are composed of technology that performs three main functions namely, data capture and communication, data storage and retrieval, and data manipulation and reporting. Various IT enabled managerial processes have been proposed for the optimization of the value of the new model. It include order management, demand planning and forecasting system, inventory management system, transportation planning and scheduling system, leveraging relationship system, advance planning and scheduling system, ERP system, and SCM system. For the evaluation and control purposes, a performance scorecard has also been proposed addressing various strategic and functional aspects. Strategic factors include return on assets to firm, return to channel members, order/replenishment cycle time, demand forecast accuracy, profit margin, on-time shipment, inventory turns, cash conversion cycle, sales growth, and marketing and distribution costs. Functional factors deal with frequency of stock-out, <b>defective</b> <b>delivery,</b> real-time information sharing and quality of decision, transparency of system, shared value and customer loyalty, frequency of channel conflict, effectiveness of promotional policies, collaborative planning, scheduling and innovation, resource pooling and risk sharing, and customer support for excellence...|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, as expressed, {{one of the}} most {{essential}} relationships between members of the supply chain is coordinating manufacturer (buyer) and suppliers in the supply chain, including the CLSC. So, with coordination among the members can be achieved an efficient supply chain. In the meantime, selecting suppliers based on the perspective of the buyer and allocating orders to their suppliers are one of the main issues to optimize the supply chain in various aspects such as reducing costs in the various policies available on the market that each member considers it. The aim of this study is modeling selection of suppliers in the CLSC considering various dimensions of the real world and using mathematical methods. So in this study, in addition to the maximization of profit and minimization of <b>defective</b> and <b>delivery</b> delay rates (using multi-objective programing), the concept of efficiency and competition, utilizing integrated DEA and Nash bargaining game approach has been added. Also, in this study for consideration the available policies between members of the chain, it is assumed that external suppliers—to increase their sales—perform the quantity discount policy. Also, the buyer to produce final products, to increase customer satisfaction, consider a policy based on controlling the supplier evaluation criteria such as safety and green packaging in the form of efficiency. Likewise, the external suppliers try to achieve the minimum efficiency interested by buyers per each needed part due to the competitive environment. This competition so that suppliers competing with others to sell their parts and improve the supply parts criteria {{from the perspective of the}} buyer’s (green supply criteria) and on the other hand, buyer is trying to select a supplier that have necessary efficiency as green choice score and had a higher score in competition with others. Therefore, in this study in addition to purchase price, criteria such as efficiency (according to the CLSC criteria), <b>defective,</b> and <b>delivery</b> delay rates are of great importance in supplier selection and order allocation. Because, coordination and cooperation between the two resources of manufacturer namely refurbishing site and suppliers can affect the production rate and finally change the products cost. Moreover, lack of returned parts and new parts lead to an increase in the inventory maintenance costs. Therefore, another strategic decision is choosing the refurbishing site location. When there are several alternatives for parts refurbishing site, manufacturer prefers to select the one with the lowest cost. In the following, the proposed model based on the problem is presented so the results demonstrate selection of suppliers in the competitive environment, with selecting the refurbishing sites, and determine the number of products and parts in each sector of the CLSC network.|$|R

While it forms a major pillar to a nation’s socio-economic development, past {{studies have found that}} this industry, with particular reference to the building materials resources, were not sufficiently managed, leading to a waste of bad material management with time and cost overrun. Problems in the inaccuracy of data, unplanned <b>deliveries,</b> wrong and <b>defective</b> <b>deliveries</b> for instance, require the supply chain members to be coordinated. In view of this, {{there is a need to}} investigate the procurement process coordination (PPC) between the contractor and his building materials suppliers, focusing on the opportunities of the improvement in operational and customer performance. Thus, the present study looked into the coordination between the construction firm and its main building materials suppliers to allow for greater understanding in the field of supply chain management (SCM). Drawing upon two theories namely Resource Based View (RBV) and Coordination Theory (CT), it also analysed the relationship of the three critical constructs; marketing resources, PPC and firm performance. This study intended to shed light into the potential implication of the link in a more coherent and integrated approach particularly from the lens of construction supply chain. With this backdrop, the objective of the study was formulated to establish a link between these constructs (marketing resources, PPC and firm performance) and their dimensions as well as to examine the mediating role of PPC on this link. This study contributes to the new knowledge by detailing the activities involved in PPC instead of testing it in a general setting. Data for this study was gathered through a survey questionnaire. The analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique by examining two competing models that represent full and partial mediation. The findings revealed that marketing resources have positive and significant effects on PPC dimensions. It was also found that PPC fully mediates the relationship between marketing resources and firm performance. Result from the Sobel test provides evidence that joint operational planning and supplier relationship development appeared to confirm their role as mediating factor in the relationship between marketing resources and firm performance. In other words these two dimensions of PPC facilitate the conversion of marketing resources into firm performance. This finding was consistent with the movement of the industry players towards ‘best practices’ which emphasised on SCM, client orientation and innovativeness. Following these findings, a number of implications are offered for the {{construction industry}}. First, construction industry players should adopt and emphasis on such orientations in order to enhance their performance particularly with the operational and customer performance. Second, PPC, in particular join decision planning and supplier relationship development provided greater room for understanding on the impact of marketing resources on the effectiveness and efficiency of the construction supply chain. Finally, the industry players must act upon the importance of marketing resources in order to optimise their supply chain coordination capability...|$|R
30|$|The {{application}} of DEA has been integrated with other mathematical approaches to further {{its ability to}} measure efficiency. For instance, Stackelberg approach is used in a mixed integer bi-level DEA model for bank branch performance evaluation (Shafiee et al. 2016). This approach involves a bi-level programming motivated by Von Stackelberg’s game theory (1952) which aim is to obtain a solution that optimizes the objective functions of a leader and a follower. Another approach {{is that of a}} multilayer artificial neural network which has been applied to forecast the decision variables of each DMU for a specified period (Shokrollahpour et al. 2016). On the other hand, a slack-based measure of efficiency that involves constant inputs is used to calculate the perceived service quality index of the multiple-item service quality construct. DEA is further used to evaluate the service quality within a pre-determined framework (Najafi et al. 2015). Another index, that is, Malmquist DEA-based productivity index is used to evaluate the changes in productivity in the technical efficiency and technology frontier (Abri and Mahmoudzadeh 2015). In another case, the efficiency scores obtained in DEA model is then applied to a mixed integer scenario-based stochastic programming model for a supplier selection problem (Zarindast et al. 2017). The objective functions include minimizing the total purchasing cost over the planning horizon and maximizing the rank of suppliers. A Nash bargaining game theory is integrated to DEA to tackle efficiency of suppliers in the presence of competition at the same time (Rezaee et al. 2017). The programming model focused on four objective functions defining total profit, <b>defective</b> rate, <b>delivery</b> delay rate, and efficiency in a competitive environment.|$|R

The objectives of our studies were not only to directly compare and contrast the clinical features of Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease but also to determine the reasons(s) for the varied phenotype expression of acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase deficiency. Although both diseases manifest a type II hyperlipoproteinemic phenotype and hepatomegaly secondary to lipid accumulation, a more malignant clinical course with more significant hepatic and adrenal manifestations was observed in the patient with Wolman disease. However, the acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in cultured fibroblasts in both diseases was virtually absent. In addition, fibroblasts from both Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease were able to utilize exogenously supplied enzyme, suggesting that neither disease was due to <b>defective</b> enzyme <b>delivery</b> by the mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor pathway. Coculture and cell fusion of fibroblasts from Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease subjects did not lead to correction of the enzyme deficiency, indicating that these disorders are allelic. However, the activities of the hepatic acid and neutral lipase in these two clinical variants were quite different. Hepatic acid lipase activity was only 4 % normal in Wolman disease, but the activity was 23 % normal in cholesteryl ester storage disease. The hepatic neutral lipase activity was normal in Wolman disease but increased more than twofold in cholesteryl ester storage disease. These combined results indicate that the clinical heterogeneity in acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase deficiency can be explained by a varied hepatic metabolic response to an allelic mutation...|$|R

In addition, supplier selection and optimal order allocation are the most important process in a close-looped supply chain. So that in the real world, in the competitive environment, suppliers provide incentives to the buyer such as discount and guarantee of production parts efficiency. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model for designing a CLSC considering efficiency in competitive environments, as well as external suppliers’ quantity discount policies. In other words, the aim of this study is adding both efficiency and competition concepts to dimensions of supplier selection problem in the CLSC. Therefore, an integrated model was proposed using multi-objective programming based on DEA–Nash bargaining game to cover the circumstances. This model was consisted four objectives including total profit, <b>defective</b> rate, <b>delivery</b> delay rate, and efficiency that then were put together into one objective using global criteria method. In addition to supplier selection, the proposed model adopts decisions related to refurbishing and disassembly site set-up, as well as part and product amounts in existing in closed-loop network’s ties including manufacturer and sites for disassembly, refurbishing, and disposal. So that, in a CLSC, to produce its productions, the manufacturer purchases its needed parts from external efficient suppliers and/or set-up refurbishing sites. The proposed model can be used in industries such as household electrical appliances, accessories and electronic components, automobile parts and similar cases. The results of simulated example show that increasing efficiency objective function is synonymous with decreasing organization (buyer) profit, because buyer pays more prices for selling parts from efficient suppliers. The results demonstrated that the criteria considered in the evaluation of suppliers’ efficiency are in conflict with the defective rate. It is specified the importance of taking the efficiency objective function. This study is expandable considering uncertainty of other model’s certain parameters or fuzzy demand. More expandable issues resulted from this study including simultaneous competition between manufacturers and suppliers, as well as studying the pricing process between them may be considered in future researches.|$|R

In this study we have used an irreversible TG-inhibitor to ‘block –and-track’ enzyme(s) targeted during osteoblast differentiation. We show that the irreversible TG-inhibitor is highly potent in inhibiting osteoblast differentiation and mineralization and reduces secretion of both fibronectin and type I collagen and their release from the cell surface. Tracking of the dansyl probe by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the inhibitor targets plasma membrane-associated FXIIIA. TG 2 appears not to contribute to crosslinking activity on the osteoblast surface. Inhibition of FXIIIA with NC 9 resulted in <b>defective</b> secretory vesicle <b>delivery</b> to the plasma membrane which was attributable to a disorganized microtubule network and decreased microtubule association with the plasma membrane. NC 9 inhibition of FXIIIA resulted in destabilization of microtubules as assessed by cellular Glu-tubulin levels. Furthermore, NC 9 blocked modification of Glu-tubulin into 150 kDa high-molecular weight Glu-tubulin form which was specifically localized to the plasma membrane. FXIIIA enzyme and its crosslinking activity were colocalized with plasma membrane-associated tubulin, and thus, it appears that FXIIIA crosslinking activity is directed towards stabilizing the interaction of microtubules with the plasma membrane.

In agreement with a model whereby STE 6 is routed to the vacuole via endocytosis from the plasma membrane, we show that degradation of STE 6 is substantially reduced at nonpermissive temperature in mutants <b>defective</b> in <b>delivery</b> of proteins to the plasma membrane (sec 6) or in endocytosis (end 3 and end 4). Whereas STE 6 appears to undergo constitutive internalization from the plasma membrane, as do the pheromone receptors STE 2 and STE 3, we show that two other proteins, the plasma membrane ATPase (PMA 1) and the general amino acid permease (GAP 1), are significantly more stable than STE 6, indicating that rapid turnover in the vacuole is not a fate common to all plasma membrane proteins in yeast. Investigation of STE 6 partial molecules (half- and quarter-molecules) indicates that both halves of STE 6 contain sufficient information to mediate internalization. Examination of STE 6 localization by indirect immunofluorescence indicates that STE 6 is found in a punctate, possibly vesicular, intracellular pattern, distinct from the rim-staining pattern characteristic of PMA 1. The punctate pattern is consistent with the view that most of the STE 6 molecules present in a cell at any given moment could be en route either to or from the plasma membrane. In a pep 4 mutant, STE 6 is concentrated in the vacuole, providing further evidence that the vacuole is the site of STE 6 degradation, while in an end 4 mutant STE 6 exhibits rim-staining, indicating that it can accumulate in the plasma membrane when internalization is blocked. Taken together, the results presented here suggest that STE 6 first travels to the plasma membrane and subsequently undergoes endocytosis and degradation in the vacuole, with perhaps only a transient residence at the plasma membrane; an alternative model, in which STE 6 circumvents the plasma membrane, is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The yeast vps mutants are <b>defective</b> in the <b>delivery</b> of {{proteins}} to the vacuole. The {{products of the}} VPS 15 and VPS 34 genes encode homologs of a serine/threonine protein kinase and a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (Ptdlns 3 -kinase), respectively, that are required for the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins. Mutations altering highly conserved residues in the catalytic domain of either protein result in the missorting and secretion of vacuolar hydrolases such as carboxypeptidase Y, suggesting that protein and lipid phosphorylation reactions are required for the vesicular transport of vacuolar proteins. Biochemical characterization of Vps 34 p has shown that, in addition to possessing Ptdlns 3 -kinase activity, Vps 34 p undergoes an autophosphorylation reaction, indicating {{that it is a}} novel multiple specificity kinase able to phosphorylate both lipid and protein substrates. The Vps 15 protein kinase both functionally and physically interacts with the Vps 34 PtdIns 3 -kinase and the two proteins form a complex associated with the cytoplasmic face of an intracellular membrane fraction most likely corresponding to a late Golgi compartment. In addition to recruiting Vps 34 p to the membrane site of its phospholipid substrate, we have found that Vpsl 5 p is also required for the activation of Vps 34 p as Vps 34 p Ptdlns 3 -kinase activity is extremely defective in vps 15 mutant strains. Vpsl 5 p protein kinase activity appears to be responsible for the association with and subsequent activation of Vps 34 p because vpsl 5 kinase domain mutations result in defects in Ptdlns 3 -kinase activity and the mutant Vps 15 proteins are unable to associate with Vps 34 p. Together, these results have demonstrated that a functional and stable complex between Vpsl 5 p and Vps 34 p is absolutely required for vacuolar protein sorting. Use of a temperature-conditional allele of VPS 34 that is for both protein sorting and Ptdlns 3 -kinase activity has allowed us to demonstrate the direct involvement of Ptdlns 3 -kinase in vacuolar protein sorting. Our findings with Vps 34 p suggest that the functions of mammalian phosphoinositide 3 -kinase may include the regulation of membrane trafficking and have led us to propose that Ptdlns(3) P is involved in regulating intracellular protein sorting reactions in all eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|In plants, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} responses to the recognition of conserved microbe- and damage associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/DAMPs) by specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a dramatic Ca 2 + influx from the apoplast or internal stores into the cell. This event activates further downstream signaling components like Ca 2 +-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. The genes encoding for the channels facilitating MAMP-induced Ca 2 + influx are not yet identified. The major goal of this project was to identify Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) proteins that {{play a role in the}} generation of MAMP-induced Ca 2 + signatures and to test the role of these proteins in plant immunity. Candidates for this function are the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) -like channels, which function as Ca 2 + channels in other eukaryotic organisms. Further, pharmacological assays demonstrated that Arabidopsis glutamate receptor-like (GLR) proteins likely allow apoplastic Ca 2 + influx induced by e. g. flg 22 epitope of bacterial flagellin and chitin stress. I performed a candidate-based reverse genetic screen in which Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines for several GLR genes were tested regarding their elicitor-triggered Ca 2 + signatures and transcriptional responses to pathogen-related stress. Several of the glr single mutants and almost all of the glr double and triple mutants displayed an aberrant Ca 2 + response as well as altered flg 22 -induced expression levels of defense related genes compared to wild type. Moreover, one glr double mutant displayed reduced levels of MAMP-induced MAPK activation. Taken together, the data obtained in this study support a role for GLRs in MAMP-induced Ca 2 + signaling and several MAMP-induced immune responses. MAMP-induced Ca 2 + influxes are further observed during infection with bacterial pathogens. Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC 3000 (Pst DC 3000) causes bacterial blight in Arabidopsis and releases MAMPs, which elicit prototypical defense reactions. To overcome host innate immunity, Pst DC 3000 secretes protein effectors into host cells via the type-III secretion system (T 3 SS). Meanwhile, several targets of effector proteins and the corresponding manipulation of associated host cellular processes have been identified. However, the potential of Pst DC 3000 to impact the MAMP-triggered Ca 2 + influx in the model plant Arabidopsis is not well studied. Hydroponically grown plants inoculated with Pst DC 3000 showed strong suppression of cytosolic Ca 2 + influx upon subsequent stimulation with various MAMPs. In addition, MAMP-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transcript accumulation of the defense-related gene FLG 22 -INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (FRK 1) were also strongly reduced following Pst DC 3000 infection. The near-complete bacterial inhibition of MAMP-triggered Ca 2 + influx was only partially relieved in Pst DC 3000 mutants <b>defective</b> in the <b>delivery</b> of type-III effector proteins. Detailed analysis on the basis of mutants in single effectors with known immune-suppressive activity (AvrPto, AvrPtoB) or deletion of entire effector clusters revealed a combinatorial contribution of type-III effectors to this phenomenon. Furthermore, the data obtained in this study suggest that suppression of plant defense by Pst DC 3000 relies in part on mechanisms that are independent of the type-III secretion machinery...|$|R
