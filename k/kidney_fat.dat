50|$|The Iberian ibex is {{generally}} a mixed feeder between a browser and a grazer, {{depending on the}} plant availability in their home range. Thus, the percentage of each type of resource that is consumed will vary altitudinally, geographically, and seasonally. The ibex also has a special mechanism in the kidney that stores fat {{in order to be}} used as energy during the cold winter times. The highest body storage of <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> can be found during the productive warm seasons and the lowest during the cold period. The body storage is characterized by limited the food resources. Foraging in ibexes is also different depending on the season. When food resources are low during the winter, ibexes would reduce their rates of movement when foraging. However, during the spring season, when food is more available, they would increase their rate of movement and become more mobile in finding food. This would be the ideal trend of movement since the spring season is more abundant in food resources meaning that there is more competition for food resources forcing some to trek farther in order to obtain food.|$|E

5000|$|The larb from {{northern}} Thailand - larb Lanna - {{is very different}} from the internationally more well-known Lao style larb. The northern Thai larb of the Tai Nyuan/Khon Muang (Northern Thai people) does not contain fish sauce and is not sour, as neither lime juice nor any other souring agent is used. Instead, the northern Thai version uses an elaborate mix of dried spices as flavoring and seasoning which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon amongst others, derived from the location of northern Thailand's Lanna Kingdom on one of the spice routes to China, in addition to ground dried chillies, and, in the case of larb made with pork or chicken, also the blood of the animal used. The dish can be eaten raw (larb dip), but also after it has been stir-fried for a short time (larb suk). If blood is omitted from the preparation of the stir-fried version, the dish is called larb khua. There is also a kind of larb called larb luat (ເລືອດ) or lu (ลู่). This dish is made with minced raw pork or beef, raw blood, <b>kidney,</b> <b>fat</b> and bile, and mixed with spices, crispy fried onions, fresh herbs and other ingredients. Larb and its other variations are served with an assortment of fresh vegetables and herbs, and eaten with glutinous rice.

40|$|White-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) {{populations in}} the Northern Plains {{have been in a}} general decline for the past decade or longer.

We removed and weighed kidneys and all perirenal fat associated with the kidneys from collected jackrabbits.

Body condition was assessed by measuring the amount of <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> within each collected jackrabbit. Seasonal fluctuations were evident in average kidney weight and <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> for both sexes of white-tailed jackrabbits.

40|$|Objective-To {{evaluate}} local tissue compatibility of doxycycline hyclate (DOX) in antebrachiocarpal joints of calves. Animals- 10 healthy calves between 80 and 110 kg. Procedures-Calves {{were assigned}} to 2 treatment groups. Calves in groups DOX(low) and DOX(high) were administered 5 and 10 mg of DOX, respectively, locally in 1 antebrachiocarpal joint. The contralateral joint served as a control joint and was injected with 0. 9 % NaCl solution. General and local clinical findings were scored. Several variables were assessed in blood and synovial fluid for 9 days. Calves were euthanatized and pathologic changes and drug residues evaluated. Results-Throughout the study, none of the calves had clinical changes or abnormal hematologic values. Significant differences between treatment and control joints were evident only for matrix metalloproteinases at 0. 5 hours after injection, with less activity for the DOX-treated joints in both treatment groups. Values for all synovial fluid variables, except nitric oxide, increased significantly during the first 12 to 72 hours after arthrocentesis in control and DOX-treated joints. Histologic examination revealed minimal infiltration of inflammatory cells independent of the treatment. No drug residues were detected 9 days after arthrocentesis in any tissues obtained from the liver, <b>kidneys,</b> <b>fat,</b> and skeletal muscles. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-DOX had excellent intra-articular compatibility in healthy calves. Arthrocentesis induced a mild transient increase of inflammatory mediators in the synovial fluid. Significant decreases in matrix metalloproteinase activity in DOX-treated joints may indicate a potential chondroprotective effect of DOX...|$|R
