5000|$|On 16 May 1864 {{there was}} a {{derailment}} at Guardbridge. An afternoon train from Leuchars to St Andrews hauled by an 0-4-2 locomotive running tender first and <b>hauling</b> four <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles,</b> derailed at a rail joint that had become displaced. The tender and locomotive left the track, {{but there were no}} injuries. Captain Rich of the Board of Trade reported on the accident, and he was extremely critical of the state of maintenance of the track; he concluded: [...] "The accident ... was caused by the bad state of the St Andrews Railway." [...] He said that, [...] "The line is of very light and poor construction," [...] and that the chairs [...] "are weak, too narrow in the throat to admit a good key, and reported to be continually breaking". He added [...] "I consider that the whole permanent way wants renewing." [...] He was also critical of the strength of the river bridges, and of the signals on the line.|$|R
25|$|When not <b>hauling</b> <b>passenger</b> trains, the {{electric}} locomotives {{were used for}} shunting and for hauling departmental trains. Some locomotives, as on the MR, were retained just for these duties. Rather than buy additional locomotive for this work, as was required with the battery-electric locomotives, makeshift locomotives were created from withdrawn <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{of at least three}} types, which were modified to haul trains over any part of the system or shunt rolling stock at Acton Works.|$|R

40|$|The {{domestic}} passenger car market has witnessed substantial growth in South Africa. At the same time, bank repossessions and black-listing of defaulting borrowers {{have increased in}} sympathy. This paper empirically examines the link between interest rates and the borrowers’ decision to purchase a <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> in South Africa. We use monthly time series data of <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> purchased, household income, fuel prices, prime interest rates and producer price index for manufacturers from January 1995 to December 2011. With <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> unit purchases as the dependent variable, we obtain OLS estimates of the <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> purchase function. Results {{show that there is}} a negative, but insignificant, relationship between interest rates and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> purchases in South Africa. Holding other factors constant, a 1 % increase in interest rate results in a 0. 9 % decrease in <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> purchases. Household income, fuel price and producer price index are observed to have a positive and insignificant impact on the decision to purchase a <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Our results have policy and decision making implications to lenders and borrowers, respectively.

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} emit emissions {{at different}} rates than <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles.</b> They may behave differently on the road as well, yet they are often treated similarly to <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> in emissions modeling. Although not frequently considered in calculating emission rates, differences in the operating speeds of <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> and heavy trucks may influence emissions. The main goal of this research project was to evaluate whether heavy trucks typically travel at significantly different operating speeds than <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> and what impact differences in on-road speeds would have on emissions. Average speeds and spot speeds were collected for heavy trucks and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> for four arterial segments and spot speeds were collected for two freeway segments in Des Moines, Iowa. Average and spot speeds were collected for four arterial segments and three freeway segments in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. The results of this research show that heavy trucks and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> operate differently on the road. Average and spot speeds were compared for heavy trucks and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> by facility. Average and spot speeds for heavy-duty trucks were lower than for <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> for all locations. Differences could have consequences for project level and regional emissions modeling particularly since the ability to demonstrate conformity {{is based on the}} ability to correctly estimate and model vehicle activity...|$|R
40|$|The presenft paper {{develops}} a structural decomposition analysis with cumulative product lifetime distributions {{to estimate the}} effects of both product lifetime shifts and energy efficiency changes on the embodied energy consumptions. The empirical analysis focuses on automobile use (ordinary <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles,</b> small <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and light <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles)</b> in Japan during the period 1990 - 2000. It reveals that the lifetime extension of existing old vehicles {{during the study period}} was more beneficial to the environment than purchasing new <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> with a relatively high fuel economy, because the lifetime extension empirically contributed to reducing the embodied energy consumption at the production and end-use stages. We also found that the energy-saving impact of a one-year lifetime extension was approximately 1. 3 times larger than that of the most significant technological improvement in the electric power generation sector. <b>Passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> use, gasoline consumption, <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> lifetime, fuel economy, rebound effect, technological change,...|$|R
