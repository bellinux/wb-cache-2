5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> saga writers had {{accurate}} information on {{details of the}} battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems. Nevertheless, starting with Oddr Snorrason, they present an elaborate literary account, depicting the main participants through their words and deeds.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|According to Tough, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{avoidance}} of immediate dangers {{and prevention of}} future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves {{could be used to}} communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
50|$|ECJ held <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{justifications}} {{offered by}} the Hamburg council could be valid.|$|R
50|$|In April 1940, the British sank eight German destroyers in Norway. <b>The</b> Germans {{concluded}} <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British <b>were</b> reading Enigma.|$|R
5000|$|By {{now it was}} {{apparent}} <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Welfreighter would <b>be</b> needed in Europe, therefore consideration was given to its use in the Far East.|$|R
5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money. It <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players, {{including}} Keogh, {{would have had}} much recourse over disputes with the tour organisers; they would struggle to access the funds to necessary for passage back to New Zealand without them.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final report}} was {{published}} in April 2013, and concluded <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Reasonable prospects: The {{chance of}} success must be {{reasonably}} high, and it must <b>be</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> consequences of the military intervention would be worse than the consequences without the intervention.|$|R
50|$|US 4 only {{runs through}} a small section of {{southern}} Dover (mostly along the Spaulding Turnpike) which is several miles from downtown, meaning it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two highways would be easily confused.|$|R
5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar {{to some of the}} larger Orcadian broch villages it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|The name Bruce Castle {{is derived}} from the House of Bruce, who had {{historically}} owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family lived nearby. Upon his accession to the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham, ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe.|$|E
500|$|Ring {{and fellow}} fringe {{members of the}} squad, Ron Hamence and Colin McCool, would refer {{themselves}} as the [...] "ground-staff" [...] as it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tour selectors would include them in the Test team on the 1948 tour.|$|R
50|$|A National Sanitation Strategy 2010-15 {{estimated}} {{that it would}} cost N$1.64 {{billion over five years}} to reach the strategy's goal through 186 individual initiatives. The strategy also noted <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government would <b>be</b> able to afford these costs.|$|R
50|$|Another troubling {{issue was}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> patents had {{two years to}} run, so <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final {{judgment}} could occur during {{the life of the}} patents. Some justices wondered whether it was worthwhile to decide the case in light of this factor.|$|R
5|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate on the {{development}} of a new public transport structure, with monorails and light rail both being considered. A light rail link to Gosport was authorised in 2002 with completion expected in 2005, but it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project will be completed following the refusal of funding by the Department for Transport in November 2005. In April 2011, an article appeared in Portsmouth News suggesting a new scheme could be in the offing by running a light rapid transit system over the line to Southampton via Fareham, Bursledon, and Sholing, thus replacing the existing heavy rail services.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that {{it was not possible to}} produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E
50|$|In {{unanimously}} adopting resolution 1748 (2007), the Council noted <b>the</b> Commission’s conclusion <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Commission would {{complete its}} work before its current mandate expired. However, the Council declared its readiness {{to terminate the}} mandate earlier, if the Commission would report that it had completed its mandated tasks.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011-2012 the AEI {{adopted a}} new, {{long-range}} policy regarding digitization, for several reasons. First, <b>the</b> AEI learned <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EU would perform more large-scale digitization. Consequently, the AEI could develop a true [...] "archive" [...] where the goal {{would be to}} digitize as many documents as resources allowed.|$|R
500|$|Ring {{and fellow}} fringe {{members of the}} squad McCool and Ron Hamence, would refer {{themselves}} as the [...] "ground-staff", as it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tour selectors would include them in the Test team during the tour. The trio were known to sing ironic songs about the paucity of their on-field duties during the tour.|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{allegedly}} remarried, {{this time}} to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s, but, as with Harris, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson—undoubtedly Blind Willie—operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, in Beaumont. In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued {{to live in the}} ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his visual impairment, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he was black. Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{means and}} speed {{by which the}} Picts {{converted}} to Christianity is uncertain. Bede gives {{the credit for the}} conversion to Ninian, probably because in the eighth century, when Bede was writing, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria was in control of the south-west of Scotland and an English bishop was in possession of the see that theoretically had been Ninians. Bede may have been reminding the Pictish church of its allegiance. Adomnan stresses the role of Columba in Pictland, and although the saint may have visited the region, since Adomnan does not make any claims for conversion, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> saint had any major impact. A separate mission, that may have been an attempt to evangalise the north-east, was undertaken by Columba's younger contemporary, another Irish priest, Donnán of Eigg, who had a large number of churches dedicated in his name in the region.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} small finds of Roman coins {{throughout}} the Sheffield area, for example 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins {{were found at}} a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along {{with the name of}} the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation {{that there may have been}} a Roman camp at this site. It <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield.|$|E
5000|$|Rutte said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) {{party was}} a group that [...] "the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy could do {{business}} with". He had also stated <b>that</b> with <b>the</b> social security ideas of the Labour Party, which he called too socialist, it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> VVD would cooperate or form a coalition after the elections.|$|R
50|$|Fonzi {{concluded}} it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CIA would legitimately {{not be able}} {{to produce}} a single photograph of the real Oswald as part of the documentation of his trip to Mexico City, given that Oswald had made five separate visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassy and the CIA maintained surveillance cameras at both places.|$|R
40|$|Segregation {{analysis}} was conducted to detect major genes affecting tick and worm counts for tropical beef cattle. For both traits, a model in which a sign ficant proportion of the genetic variation was due to a major gene {{was found to be}} feasible. It <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same gene had a significant effect on both traits...|$|R
5|$|While on course, JG 6 {{approached}} the airfield of Heesch {{and some of}} its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield. It <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Heesch strip, built in October 1944, was known to the Luftwaffe. No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on recce missions early that morning so the majority of its units were airborne. Its 401 Squadron was readying for takeoff when JG 6 appeared at 09:15. Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield, concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude. 401 Squadron scrambled. Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage, while the main body continued to search for Volkel. Stab., and II./JG 6 stumbled on another strip at Helmond, which contained no aircraft. Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked, losing several of their number to ground fire. II./JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond. Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely {{to be one of the}} last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E
25|$|Without further {{efforts to}} improve protection, it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> forest will remain viable long into the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the Area 51 name is unclear. The most {{accepted}} comes from a grid numbering system of the area by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC); while Area 51 {{is not part of}} this system, it is adjacent to Area 15. Another explanation is that 51 was used because it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AEC would use the number.|$|R
50|$|Emmer trailed his Democratic {{opponent}} Mark Dayton by 9,000 {{votes in}} the initial general election results, a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount. Most analysts felt it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Emmer campaign could overcome such a deficit in a recount. After the recount made little difference in the results, Emmer conceded the election on December 8, 2010.|$|R
