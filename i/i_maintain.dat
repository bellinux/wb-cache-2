The critical failure of both [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] and [...] "Tamerlane" [...] convinced Poe that long poems are inherently flawed because they cannot sustain a proper mood or a high quality poetic form. Because of this, he never again experimented with long poetry. He would later write of his theory on short poetry in [...] "The Poetic Principle" [...] in 1848. In that essay, he wrote [...] "A long poem does not exist. <b>I</b> <b>maintain</b> that the phrase, 'a long poem,' is simply a flat contradiction in terms." [...] Instead, he says, epic poetry and other long poems are actually a series of short poems strung together. Critics have suggested that this theory was written so that Poe could justify why [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] was unpopular.|$|E
500|$|When Irataba {{returned}} {{he informed}} Ives {{that he would}} not venture any deeper into the territory of the Hualapais, but agreed to help them locate friendly guides in the region before parting company. Irataba was reluctant to venture into the canyon because he feared the party would be ambushed by Paiutes aligned with Mormons. After enlisting three Hualapai guides, Irataba prepared to take his leave from the expedition and return to the Mohave community. On April 4, the Mohave received payment for their services; Möllhausen described the exchange: [...] "Lieutenant Ives informed Irataba that he had been authorized by the 'Great Grandfather in Washington' to give him two mules... for his loyalty and his trustworthiness so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley." [...] The next morning, as they were preparing to leave: [...] "Irataba was visibly moved... and in his sincere eyes expressed so much honesty and loyalty as can only be found in an unspoiled nature... <b>I</b> <b>maintain</b> that there was not one in our expedition who did not feel a certain sadness to see this huge man with... a harmless soul leave." ...|$|E

[...] Who denies them the right? [...] Standing with the principles of '76 behind us, who can deny them the right? ... <b>I</b> <b>maintain</b> on the principles of '76 that Abraham Lincoln has no right to a soldier in Fort Sumter. ...

2500|$|When south-central Los Angeles {{erupted in}} riots—in which 58 were killed—after the Rodney King verdict in 1992, Waters gained {{national}} attention [...] "when she helped deliver relief supplies in Watts and demanded {{the resumption of}} vital services". Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying [...] "If you call it a riot {{it sounds like it}} was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. <b>I</b> <b>maintain</b> it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable." [...] In her view, the violence was “a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice.” [...] In regards to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said: “There were mothers who took {{this as an opportunity to}} take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes... They are not crooks.” ...|$|E
2500|$|If I suspend {{judgement}} when I don't {{clearly and}} distinctly grasp what is true, I obviously do right and am not deceived. [...] But, if I either affirm or deny {{in a case}} of this sort, I misuse my freedom of choice. [...] If I affirm what is false, I clearly err, and, if I stumble onto the truth, I'm still blameworthy since the light of nature reveals that a perception of the understanding should always precede a decision of the will. [...] In these misuses of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error. [...] And this deprivation, <b>I</b> <b>maintain,</b> lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes from me — not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will's operation insofar as it derives from Him. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E

They have wanted to prosecute me in order to take as much money as possible from me. They have wanted to ruin me. They have wanted to convince Ecuadorians that I am just one more heir, however what I own, I have through my own labors of more than 40 years. [...] They have wanted to accuse me be unfair economically to my siblings when those family members are all very well off and I have never affected them. They have wanted to damage my image with slander of all kinds. [...] They have attacked my sense of honor. [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Jan Wong {{declined}} {{the invitation of}} host Guy A. Lepage to explain herself at the popular Québécois talk show Tout le monde en parle. She has declared: [...] "I brought forward {{a point of view}} [...] and <b>I</b> <b>maintain</b> it." [...] She has claimed that, during the controversy, she was the target of sexist and racist attacks, citing a Le Devoir cartoon that caricatured Wong with thick glasses and buck teeth opening a fortune cookie that said [...] "Beware of Bill 101". The newspaper claimed that it was a reference to the Chinese restaurants of her well-known father, Bill Wong, not her ethnicity. Jan Wong wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and Yes, Happiness. In it, Jan Wong described in detail the backlash she received immediately after her article published, how the Globe and Mail management, in her view, abandoned her in front of the torrent of negative reactions from all sides, and how she spiraled down into depression. [...] She described when she found the ‘exact moment I began my descent into depression’ when she was shattered by racial attack. This book was self-published after Doubleday, the publisher of her previous books, pulled out mere days before print although Doubleday denied any legal interference from The Globe. [...] It was released on May 5, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|This theodicy of Cousin {{laid him}} open {{obviously}} {{enough to the}} charge of pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the deification of the law of phenomena, the universe God. But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as with Spinoza,--they are free forces having" [...] their power or spring of action in themselves, and this is sufficient for our idea of independent finite reality. I hold this, and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for is neither the deity of Pantheism, nor the absolute unity of the Eleatics, a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality, a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity <b>I</b> <b>maintain</b> is creative, and necessarily creative. The deity of Spinoza and the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating, this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity, activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily, and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of necessity.|$|E
