5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>child</b> needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

The commission issued its final report in July 2006, and in March 2008 Bachelet signed the bill into law. The new legislation established a Basic Solidarity Pension (PBS) and a Solidarity Pension Contribution (APS), guaranteeing a minimum pension for the 60% poorest segment of the population, regardless of their contribution history. The reform also grants a bonus to female pensioners <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>child</b> born alive.|$|E

However, education authorities largely ignored the provision of free medical treatment for school children. A tax allowance for children was introduced in 1909 to help families on low incomes. This allowance of £10 a year was introduced <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>child</b> below the age of 16 in the case of income tax payers whose income fell below £500 per annum (this rebate was later doubled in the 1914 budget).|$|E

25|$|The Lililwan Project had two {{distinct}} stages.

Stage 2 commenced in May 2011, and involved conducting child health and development tests, and making opportunistic medical treatments and referrals. This stage included examinations by doctors and other health professionals of all children in the study born in 2003 and 2003 to determine the prevalence of FASD.

Liz Davies of London Metropolitan University {{argued that}} 'ContactPoint, the new {{database}} <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>child</b> in the country, {{is in effect}} a population-surveillance tool' and that 'for five years, the system to prevent child abuse has been vanishing before our eyes'. Fiona Nicholson of Education Otherwise, a home-education support group, agreed with this assessment and said that 'frontline staff working to protect vulnerable children have also expressed disbelief that investing hundreds of millions in IT can {{be the best way}} to safeguard children'. Laming, however, said that Davies' assertion was a 'gross distortion of what is an intelligent application of technology aimed at ensuring every child benefits from the universal services'. Privacy International awarded Hodge the 2004 Big Brother Award for 'Worst Public Servant', partly due to her backing of the database.|$|E
