40|$|The {{availability}} of nitrogen {{is one of}} the major limiting factors to crop growth. In the developed world, farmers use unsustainable levels of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> to promote crop production.

Finding alternatives to <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> is critical for sustainable and secure food production. Bacteria and Archaea have evolved the capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, a form readily usable in biological processes. This capability presents an opportunity to improve the nutrition of crop plants, through the introduction into cereal crops of either the nitrogen fixing bacteria or the nitrogenase enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation. While both approaches are challenging, recent advances have laid the groundwork to initiate these biotechnological solutions to the nitrogen problem...|$|R

However organic materials {{may not be}} available on mine sites in sufficient quantities and are bulky to handle. In the present study, the opportunities for substituting inorganic fertilisers in place of organic materials (poultry manure, and straw) were investigated for three alkaline, variably saline residues: Bauxite residue (mixed sand and clay fractions), Bauxite Residue sand, and Gold oxide residue. On gypsum-amended, leached Residue sand and Bauxite residue N, P, and Mn were potentially deficient for plant growth. On the Residue sand, complete <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was effective in stimulating plant growth because it corrected the deficiencies of N and P and partially corrected Mn deficiency. By contrast, on bauxite residue and gold oxide residue which remained saline, sodic and alkaline even with gypsum amendment and leaching, <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> alone was not effective in correcting nutrient deficiencies on these residues and plant growth was strongly limited by excessive CI uptake.

40|$|Low mineral {{fertiliser}} use received much attention in Africa {{over the last}} decades. As fertiliser sales have exponentially grown in Ethiopia, and evidence exists of a supply that is beyond the demand in the drier northern parts of the country, we investigated the geographical determinants of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> sales and its resale prices in north Ethiopia. Quantitative data on fertiliser provision and prices {{on the black market}} in 2016 were obtained from official statistics and from key informants in each of the 35 studied districts and in all municipalities of the Raya area. Environmental variables were collected from spatial databases. To promote <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> agricultural experts use incentives, and also barter the purchase of fertiliser by a farmer against food aid or other advantages from the authorities. The high application rate that is aimed at (200 kg ha(- 1)) contrasts with the dominance of less-responsive soils in the study area, for which <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application does not result in higher crop yields, or even leads to root burn. The quantitative analysis shows that 40. 7 10 (3) Mg of fertiliser were officially sold in the study area in 2016, which corresponds to 52 kg ha(- 1). This is notably different from the application rate, as reselling widely occurs, at 50 % of the official price for diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 54 % for urea, mostly to users outside the community. By accepting the opportunity offered by agricultural companies and traders, smallholders save themselves from greatei losses. The black market rate is strongly and positively correlated to monthly rainfall at sowing time (July 2016) (R- 2 = 0. 44; n = 31; p < 0. 01). In the four districts with spate irrigation, black market prices for <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> are low (35 % of the official rate) and small quantities are sold officially (32 kg ha(- 1)). This corresponds to the farmers' saying that there "nobody needs <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> since the spate irrigation adds organic and inorganic nutrients yearly". We found similarities to the 'Green Revolution' in Mexico: the forced delivery of high-cost fertiliser, and the reselling at half price in the black market. Inorganic fertilisers are one of the elements that have allowed boosting agricultural production in Ethiopia; our findings indicate however that in the study area, the fertiliser policy needs to be much fine-tuned so that it is led by agronomic needs, rather than by statistics of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> consumption, that hide complex environmental variability and socio-political relations...|$|E

In addition, one rate of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> at district practice was applied, containing 72 kg N ha- 1 and 20 kg P ha- 1, this was reapplied in the second year. The <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatment yielded 44 - 58 % higher than the nil fertiliser treatment at final grain harvest, demonstrating the requirement for applied N and P on this site for crop production. Alum sludge was an adequate source of nitrogen (N) for crop growth as indicated by plant tissue N content, and supplied sufficient residual N to meet crop requirements in the second year. However, grain yield in alum sludge treatments was reduced to 62 % (year 1) and 69 % (year 2) of the yield in the <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatment, though greater than the nil fertiliser treatment in both years.

40|$|Disposal of {{concentrated}} beet-vinasse, a high-density syrupy {{waste from}} the sugar industry, constituted an environmental problem.

However, the direct application of vinasse is constrained by its high salinity (EC 250 - 300 dS m- 1; Na 28 g kg- 1) and high density (1. 3 g cm- 3). These problems can be overcome by co-composting the vinasse with other solid wastes. A {{study was conducted in}} the Guadalquivir river valley, SW Spain, in Coria del RÃ­o, Seville. Three mixtures of a concentrated depotassified vinasse and solid wastes were co-composted in static windrows. The composts obtained were used in field experiments to study the effect of their application as deep fertiliser on three crops: corn (Zea mays L.); sugar-beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The effect on chemical properties of a Xerochrept (Cambisol) soil after 2 years of compost application and after a further year of residual effect was also studied. A treatment with traditional <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (applied as deep fertilisation) and an unamended soil (Control) were used for comparison purposes. Generally, the application of composts or <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> significantly increased crop yield when compared with the Control treatment. At the end of the experimental period, soil oxidizable-C, total humic extract-C and humic acids-C contents significantly increased in soils treated with composts when compared with Control and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments. Organic fertilisation also increased the Kjeldahl-N content of the soil. A slight increase of soil salinity was observed both in the composts and in the <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments.

We also investigated whether differences in microbial community composition under different fertiliser regimes arose from differences in underlying soil properties, changes in soil properties resulting indirectly from fertilisation, or directly from fertilisation. Reduced fertiliser application significantly reduced topsoil organic carbon and N, as well as plant-available R This significantly reduced sugar beet yields but had less impact on winter wheat. The different fertiliser regimes had no significant effect on microbial community composition. Differences in soil properties as a result of fertilisation were less than differences between sites, and differences in microbial community composition were mainly explained by site. The results show that long-term <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> practices have little impact on microbial community composition, and lend support to research showing that microbial community composition is more influenced by organic matter inputs and underlying soil properties.

The thesis aimed to gain insights into the sustainability (in terms of nutrient supply) of the local agricultural system, acquire an understanding {{of past and present}} fertiliser practices and the rationale behind them, provide an appreciation of the role played by urban waste ash and the risks attached to its use, and place the problem of soil fertility in a wider context of farming problems. An inter-disciplinary approach was adopted so the methods used are: chemical analysis of soil and inputs (i. e. refuse ash), questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews (with farmers and PADP, JMDB, FUA etc.) and participant observation. The thesis observed that farmers have in-depth, but informal, empirically-derived knowledge about fertiliser application, which explains their past success in soil fertility maintenance. The tremendous increase in DSIVP in the last decade, though, has brought about a scarcity of organic amendments; farmers are increasingly reliant on <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> probably over-applying them.

Farmers no longer require the traditional services of the Fulani pastoralists, but the Fulani pastoralists are still dependent on their goodwill for access to natural resources (Waters-Bayer and Bayer 1994; Blench 2004).|$|E
30|$|From {{the current}} field experiment, it is {{observed}} that magnesium sulphate blended with NPK can serve as an alternative to sole NPK amendment to decrease methane emission significantly in the flooded rice paddy soil at 0.5 Â t/ha application level. The present study demonstrates that the application of leaves of neem-mixed NPK, tea leaves mixed with NPK and karanj-mixed NPK in rainfed rice fields is the key in promoting physical attributes of soil quality as well as yield in agricultural systems in comparison with the exclusive application of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> NPK. It is suggested that the rice productivity can be improved with significant increase in soil organic matter without intensifying methane emission when fresh leaves of karanj at 1 Â t/ha blended with NPK are applied on the rainfed rice fields in an acidic soil before transplantation. Long-term studies might be needed to ensure blending of fresh karanj with <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> NPK to be established as an alternative to inorganic fertilisation which can sustainably improve rice productivity in paddy rice fields, consequently reducing the emission of methane and minimising its global warming potential in the environment.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the factors}} that {{constrains}} animal draft power in livestock-rich countries like Ethiopia is the inadequate supply of livestock feed both in quantitative and qualitative terms. This problem in Ethiopia is aggravated by poor soil conditions across the highland areas. Inter-cropping of forage legumes with cereal crops can restore soil fertility, reduce the need for imported inputs, alleviate the problem of shortfalls in the quality and quantity supply of livestock feed, and enhance the draft power efficiency of oxen. Nitrogen (N) input from forage legumes can help maintain the soil N reserve as well as substituting for <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> to attain large crop yields. Using a linear programming model, this article examines the economic impacts of the inter-cropping system that combines forage and food crop cultivation, based on resources available to farmers and on prevailing agricultural practices in the Ethiopian highlands...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of increasing nutrient concentrations in Irish water bodies, this study set out to gain information on the potential of agricultural grassland to lose nutrients to water. Overland flow, flow from artificial subsurface drains and stream flow were gauged and sampled during heavy rainfall events. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), potassium (K), total ammonia (TA), and total oxidised nitrogen (TON) were measured in water samples. When the nutrient concentrations in water were examined {{in relation to the}} grassland management practices of the study catchments it emerged that soil P levels, the application of organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> before heavy rainfall and the presence of grazing animals could all influence nutrient concentrations in surface and subsurface drainage water. Overall, the drainage characteristics of soil were found to have a considerable influence on the potential of land to lose nutrients to water...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} culture of penaeus indicus and p. semisulcatus carried out in two coastal ponds at the fish farm of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute at Mandapam Camp {{for a period of}} 158 days during 1978 and 1979. Sea water was pumped into the culture pond daily to maintain water level at 0. 75 m. Two experiments were carried out to study the growth rate of p. indicus at a stocking rate of five numbers per sq. M, one with supplementary food and the other with natural food elements produced by application of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> In the third experiment, p. semisulcatus stocked at the rate of three per sq. M were fed with pelletised supplementary food. Results of the above experiments are presented and discussed in the background of experimental culture operations carried out earlier...|$|R
