Nader who at this point was all to eager to leave the slow-going siege and take to the field where he would be <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>element</b> once more, welcomed this opportunity to seek out the Ottoman relief force and crush it. Having invested his troops round Tiflis and Yerevan also Nader took the remainder of his men and marched west. An Ottoman army of perhaps 130,000 men (according to Astarabadi, Nader's court historian) under Koprulu Pasha was decimated by Nader's advance guard of only 15,000 or so men.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} these, Gowen {{proposed}} his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates {{and his ability}} to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. We have all combined {{to get him out of}} railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, and there will be no peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting all the time. When he was after the Molly Maguires he was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>element,</b> but as a railroad manager he is a failure.|$|E

He began work on his translation of Sophocles's Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release.

In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>element,</b> as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E

Raicu adds: [...] "The sense of abundant, diverse, life, of a fascinating materiality, endlessly harasses the habits of the bookish man, who lives among models and masterpieces as if <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>element,</b> and eventually fuses with them". Georgescu's works, alongside those of Norman Manea, were also case studies for literary historian Liviu Petrescu, who documented the extent of self-referential and intransitive prose in Romanian postmodernism. Manea cites Ion Simuţ in discussing the main topic of Georgescu's narratives: [...] "A dynamic rationale facing a world lacking in dynamism, [...] almost inert." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1833 and 1836, American {{painter and}} {{putative}} [...] "founder" [...] of The Hudson River School, Thomas Cole, {{had been hard}} at work on his series of paintings The Course of Empire. The work was commissioned by New York patron Luman Reed, who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested The Course of Empire to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in by the end of 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on The Course of Empire and paint something that was more <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>element</b> for the April 1836 opening of the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, The Pastoral State. This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought [...] "no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season." [...] Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing: ...|$|E
