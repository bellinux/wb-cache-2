30|$|To achieve flexibility, {{reconfigurability}} and scalability, {{several requirements}} must be met. First, the workflow {{of a company}} in supply chains must be described and specified by a standard format. Second, the multi-agent system platform used for implementation must also support information infrastructure and interaction protocols/mechanism defined by industrial standard organization to attain interoperability between agents. Third, the scheduling algorithm must be developed based on dynamic publication and discovery of services. Fourth, the scheduling method must be scalable {{by taking advantage of}} distributed computing architecture based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. Fifth, to achieve interoperability, all information in the negotiation processes, including call for proposals, proposals, awarding <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> must be described based on a standard format such as XML.|$|R

40|$|We study an {{incomplete}} contract model where both contracting parties can invest, and the investments have both self- and cross effects. We analyze the performance <b>of</b> non-contingent <b>contracts,</b> <b>message</b> games, option <b>contracts</b> and property rights. We {{find that the}} first best is implemented if (i) the cross effects are negative or weaker than self-effects; (ii) the strength of cross-effects relative to self-effects is symmetric across parties. If either of these conditions is violated, even message contingent revelation mechanisms fail to provide efficient incentives. For this case, we obtain a number of results characterizing the second best. We find that property rights outperform contracts and partially relax the symmetry constraint. In either first best or second best, the stronger the cross-effects, the lower the value <b>of</b> <b>contracting.</b> The optimal allocation of property rights assigns ownership to the party with stronger cross-effects...|$|R

40|$|Since the 80 ’s {{with the}} {{experience}} of Chile, the electric sector has suffered, in many counties, a process of deregulation and liberalization. In almost of the countries, that process originated the appearance of a Pool where the participants of the market trade the electrical energy on a basis of half-hour or one hour of the next day. However, like the traditional markets, the agents of electricity markets are now exposed to the volatility of market price, so far inexistent in those markets. In some countries, to face that problem and to turn the market more liquid have been introduced derivatives markets – futures and options, to negotiate products with underlying active the electrical energy. In this context, there is a need of decision-support tools that allow those agents to use derivatives markets with the objective of practicing the hedge and simultaneously increase their results. In this paper, we present a decision model that supports producers in the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> with the objective to maximize the profit expected utility.

40|$|Many {{optimization}} {{techniques have}} been proposed {{over the years to}} improve the performance of supply chains. Although these approaches {{have been shown to be}} effective, most of them were developed without considering uncertainties in supply chains to simplify the analysis. In fact, uncertainties can deteriorate the performance of supply chains, such as increase in total cost, or drop in fill rate, of the whole system. In distributed supply chains, participating members are not under a sole control by a central authority, the problem is even more stringent due to incomplete information sharing, or so called asymmetrical information sharing. One way to improve the system performance is to achieve coordination among participating parties through <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> The objectives <b>of</b> this paper are i) to evaluate the effects of demand uncertainty in a distributed supply chain, which is modelled as an agent-based system; ii) to propose a coordination mechanism with early order completion contract to minimize the negative impacts of demand uncertainty; and iii) to present associated simulation results. Performance of the system is measured in terms of costs and fill rate.

Nevertheless, because of asymmetric information, suppliers can not observe the real behaviors of retailer.

40|$|The present paper {{develops}} {{variants of}} a system of social targets departing from principal-agent models incorporating different possibilities of renegotiation across time periods, as well as the presence of shocks. This system acts as a way {{for the federal government to}} increase efficiency in the use of its social budget transferred to municipalities. We demonstrate in a dynamic context with complete contracts that the best way to increase allocative efficiency in funds transfers would be to create institutional mechanisms denying the possibility of bilateral renegotiations. This optimum contract reproduces sequence targets and transfers found in the solution of the static model for various periods. However, this result disappears when we incorporate incomplete contracts. In this case, ex-ante inefficiencies created by the possibility of renegotiation must be weighted against ex-post inefficiencies created by not using the disclosed new information along of process. In the second part of the paper we incorporate the incidence of random shocks. We show that, when the social results do not depend only on the investments carried through by the municipality, but also random factors, the contract established between federal government and municipalities, must stipulate higher social targets to compensate the occurrence of bad states of the nature. Moreover, in this kind <b>of</b> situation, linear <b>contracts</b> are pro-cyclical, reducing governmental transfers exactly when the municipality suffers a negative shock. To avoid this type of situation, we show that the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> that use mechanisms of comparison of performance between the municipalities eliminates the pro-cyclical effect. ...|$|R
