2500|$|Another {{reason for}} varying {{notation}} {{is due to}} the theory of point processes, which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation , implying that [...] is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process [...] Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure, [...] so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process [...] being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region [...] as , which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.|$|E
