5|$|Chastain's {{final two}} {{roles of the}} year were in Wilde Salomé, a {{documentary}} based on her 2006 production of Salome, and the critically panned crime-thriller Texas <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b> The latter, co-starring Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, was a partly fictionalized version of {{the events in the}} <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> of Texas, in which she played a homicide detective. Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey praised Chastain's polished Texas drawl, but criticized the film. Chastain's work in 2011, especially in The Help, Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, gained her awards from several critics' organizations, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.|$|E
5|$|Young Earth creationist Kent Hovind blames communism, socialism, World War I, World War II, racism, the Holocaust, Stalin's war crimes, the Vietnam War, and Pol Pot's <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields</b> on evolution, {{as well as}} the {{increase}} in crime, unwed mothers, and other social ills. Hovind's son Eric Hovind claims that evolution is responsible for tattoos, body piercing, premarital sex, unwed births, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), divorce, and child abuse.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 Waterston's {{portrayal}} of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer {{in the television}} miniseries Oppenheimer saw him earn another Golden Globe nomination. Two years later, Waterston played American journalist Sydney Schanberg in the 1984 British drama The <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields,</b> opposite Haing S. Ngor and John Malkovich – for his performance Waterston received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. His other biographical roles include Heaven's Gate as Old West figure Frank Canton (1980) and as President Abraham Lincoln in the miniseries Lincoln (1988), the 1990 documentary miniseries The Civil War, and the play Abe Lincoln in Illinois. His performance {{in the last of}} these garnered him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.|$|E
5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b> Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E
25|$|Dith Pran (1942-2008), {{his life}} was portrayed in the movie The <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b> He was a photojournalist with The New York Times, a human rights activist and a {{survivor}} of the <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> of Cambodia.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997 a <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> {{and burial}} place for NKVD executions during Stalin's Great Purges was {{uncovered}} in Krasny Bor by two locals, and then thoroughly investigated {{in the summer}} of 1998 by the historian Yury A. Dmitriev, the head of Memorial in Karelia.|$|R
50|$|Shuvalov's gun had an unusual, oval bore, {{which was}} {{designed}} to facilitate shot dispersal while firing canisters and therefore to increase the <b>killing</b> <b>field.</b> A special canister round produced for the cannon contained 168 balls; a grapeshot version, with 48 larger balls, was also provided for shooting at 300-600 yards distance.|$|R
5000|$|Rumors of the {{massacre}} began to reach California in early October.

25|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, numerous mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered. Some, such as the <b>killing</b> <b>fields</b> at Kurapaty near Minsk and Bykivnia near Kiev, are believed to contain up to 200,000 corpses.|$|E
25|$|Some of the sites, such as {{the mass}} graves in Maribor, include {{some of the largest}} mass graves in Europe. Nearly 600 such sites have been {{registered}} by the Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia, containing the remains of up to 100,000 victims.

25|$|When the Communist Party of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge (1951–81), {{established}} their regime as Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979) in Cambodia, their anti-intellectualism which idealised {{the country and}} demonised the cities was immediately imposed on the country {{in order to establish}} agrarian socialism, thus, they emptied cities in order to purge the Khmer nation of every traitor, enemy of the state, and intellectual, often symbolised by eyeglasses (see the <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields).</b>|$|E
5000|$|International media {{monitor the}} Committee to Protect Journalists made a {{statement}} that wrote, [...] "President-Elect Rodrigo Duterte's shocking remarks apparently excusing extrajudicial killings threaten to make the Philippines into a <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> for journalists, we strongly urge him to retract his comments and to signal {{that he intends to}} protect, not target the press." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Sandarmokh <b>killing</b> <b>field</b> {{was only}} found in July 1997 after lengthy {{searches}} {{and at first}} it was not known how many thousands had been shot and buried there.

25|$|Totalitarian governments {{manipulate}} {{and apply}} anti-intellectualism to repress political dissent. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) {{and the following}} right-wing dictatorship (1939–1975) of General Francisco Franco, the reactionary repression of the White Terror (1936–1945) was notably anti-intellectual, {{with most of the}} 200,000 civilians killed being the Spanish intelligentsia, the politically active teachers and academics, artists and writers of the deposed Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). In the Communist state of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), the Khmer Rouge régime of Pol Pot condemned most of the non–Communist intelligentsia to death in the <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields.</b>|$|E

The regiment suffered heavy losses at the Battles of Neuve Chapelle, Festubert, Givenchy and the Second Ypres. In 1915, they arrived in Mesopotamia, where Sepoy Chatta Singh was awarded the Victoria Cross for exceptional valour. By the time they returned home, only fifteen men remained of those who had sailed for France in 1914.|$|E
25|$|In Cambodia, a {{genocide}} {{was carried}} out by the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime led by Pol Pot between 1975 and 1979 in which an estimated one and a half to three million people died. The KR group had planned to create a form of agrarian socialism which was founded on the ideals of Stalinism and Maoism. The KR policies of forced relocation of the population from urban centers, torture, mass executions, use of forced labor, malnutrition, and disease led to the death of an estimated 25 {{percent of the total population}} (around 2 million people). The genocide ended following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. At least 20,000 mass graves, known as the <b>Killing</b> <b>Fields,</b> have since been uncovered.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July the Twenty-Eighth Army, {{despite the}} mistiming of the Thirty-third Army's attack, began their {{break-out}} attempt, {{unaware that the}} British knew of their plans. The monsoon had begun and the British created two <b>killing</b> <b>fields,</b> the first for artillery (targeting twelve Japanese crossing points along the highway) and the second using aircraft (which were able to fly even in poor weather conditions) to attack those who managed to cross the road, especially between the Sittang and the Salween rivers. FOOs {{were used in the}} air and the ground. Tanks and infantry motorised and on foot, covered the gaps between the positions despite the monsoon. The Allied Patriotic Burma Forces would deal with any survivors on the east bank of the Sittang.|$|E
