This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center.

40|$|Measurements of pulse {{spreading}} in three graded index fibers {{have been performed}} over an extensive range of wavelengths, including regions in which the <b>index</b> <b>profiles</b> become optimal and the bandwidths correspondingly high. The refractive <b>index</b> distributions and <b>profile</b> dispersion parameter have been measured and used in a ray-tracing algorithm in order to predict bandwidths. Comparison reveals that averaging processes on the index data are usually necessary to account for noncircularity of the fiber and small variations in the deduced profile caused by the wavelength dependence of the near-field intensity distribution. Results obtained by this means usually tend to slightly underestimate the true fiber bandwidth, while alpha-profile predictions always result in overestimates by about one order of magnitude. Remaining discrepancies between measured and predicted bandwidths are attributed to small variations of the <b>index</b> <b>profiles</b> along the fiber length...|$|R

50|$|Dispersion Shifted Fiber {{is a type}} of {{single-mode}} {{optical fiber}} with a core-clad <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> tailored to shift the zero-dispersion wavelength from the natural 1300 nm in silica-glass fibers to the minimum-loss window at 1550 nm. The group velocity or intramodal dispersion which dominates in single-mode fibers includes both material and waveguide dispersion. Waveguide dispersion can be made more negative by changing the <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> and thus be used to offset the fixed material dispersion, shifting or flattening the overall intramodal dispersion. This is advantageous because it allows a communication system to possess both low dispersion and low attenuation. However, when used in wavelength division multiplexing systems, dispersion-shifted fibers can suffer from four-wave mixing which causes intermodulation of the independent signals. As a result, nonzero dispersion shifted fiber is often used.|$|E
