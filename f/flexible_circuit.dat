50|$|The base {{material}} is the flexible polymer film which provides {{the foundation for}} the laminate. Under normal circumstances, the flex circuit {{base material}} provides most primary physical and electrical properties of the <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit.</b> In the case of adhesiveless circuit constructions, the base material provides all of the characteristic properties.While a wide range of thickness is possible, most flexible films are provided in a narrow range of relatively thin dimension from 12 Âµm to 125 Âµm (1/2 mil to 5 mils) but thinner and thicker material are possible. Thinner materials are of course more flexible and for most material, stiffness increase is proportional to the cube of thickness. Thus for example, means that if the thickness is doubled, the material becomes eight times stiffer and will only deflect 1/8 as much under the same load.There are a number of different materials used as base films including: polyester (PET), polyimide (PI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyetherimide (PEI), along with various fluropolymers (FEP) and copolymers. Polyimide films are most prevalent owing to their blend of advantageous electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties.|$|E
50|$|A {{metal foil}} is most {{commonly}} used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> applications. Copperâ€™s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
50|$|Drivers {{for this}} type of {{electric}} load are power HF-generators that in many cases contain a transformer for high voltage generation. They resemble the control gear used to operate compact fluorescent lamps or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The operation mode and the topologies of circuits to operate DBD lamps with continuous sine or square waves are similar to those standard drivers. In these cases, the energy that is stored in the DBD's capacitance {{does not have to be}} recovered to the intermediate supply after each ignition. Instead, it stays within the circuit (oscillates between the DBD's capacitance and at least one inductive component of the circuit) and only the real power, that is consumed by the lamp, has to be provided by the power supply. Differently, drivers for pulsed operation suffer from rather low power factor and in many cases must fully recover the DBD's energy. Since pulsed operation of DBD lamps can lead to increased lamp efficiency, international research led to suiting circuit concepts. Basic topologies are resonant flyback and resonant half bridge. A <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit,</b> that combines the two topologies is given in and and may be used to adaptively drive DBDs with varying capacitance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>circuits</b> (also {{variously}} {{referred to}} {{around the globe}} as flex <b>circuits,</b> <b>flexible</b> printed <b>circuit</b> boards, flex print, flexi-circuits) are members of electronic and interconnection family. They consist of a thin insulating polymer film having conductive circuit patterns affixed thereto and typically supplied with a thin polymer coating to protect the conductor circuits. The technology {{has been used for}} interconnecting electronic devices since the 1950s in one form or another. It {{is now one of the}} most important interconnection technologies in use for the manufacture of many of today's most advanced electronic products.|$|R

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> {{boards are}} being {{widely used in}} the {{electronic}} packages. Solders are often used to assemble chip resistors and other components on them. In practice, solder alloys work in high homologous temperatures and experience cyclic temperature loadings. As a result, damage may accumulate in solder materials quickly and this will eventually lead {{to the failure of}} the solder joints. In this work, computer modelling technique has been used to predict such damage accumulations in chip resistor solder joints under a range of thermal cycling conditions. It has been documented that the higher and the lower dwell temperatures of a thermal cycle dominate the damages in solder joints. Both the ramp time and the cycle duration have strong influence on the damage accumulation. In general, faster ramp time and longer cycle duration cause more damages. The types of materials used to produce <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> board have also significant impact on the damage accumulation. Polyimide (PI), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) and Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) based <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> boards have been compared for their effect on damage in solder joints and the results show that the highest damage could be found in the chip resistor solder joint on the PI-based <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> boards and least damage could be found for the LCP based <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. The results also show that the thicknesses of the constituent layers of different materials in <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> boards are linearly proportional to the damage accumulation in solder joints...|$|E
