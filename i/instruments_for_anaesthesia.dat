40|$|Anaesthesiology is a {{specialty}} {{which is less}} well known and the public usually have little knowledge regarding anaesthesia and the roles of Anaesthesiologist. Many hospitals now use a single dedicated consent <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} compare the effectiveness of a single consent <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> with the combined surgical and anaesthetic consent. A total of 109 patients, scheduled for elective surgery requiring anaesthesia were interviewed with a standardised questionnaire. Patients were divided into two groups, where one group used a single anaesthetic consent while the other used a combined surgical and anaesthetic consent. A single consent <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was found to be more effective than the current combined surgical and anaesthetic consent (p< 0. 05). Regarding information about anaesthesia, 89. 91 % respondents agreed that the Anaesthesiologist should tell them all material risks of anaesthesia, no matter how serious it is and 81. 65 % respondents would like to meet Anaesthesiologist every time prior to the operation. In terms of knowledge, 94. 5 % patients recognized that Anaesthesiologist is the one who delivers anaesthesia during surgery. However, patients had little knowledge regarding the extended roles of Anaesthesiologist. The present study confirmed that a single consent <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was better than the current combined surgical and anaesthetic consent...|$|R

With the improvement in anaesthetic techniques and intensive care facilities, many cardiac patients {{who in the past}} would have been considered as being at too great a risk are now being considered for non-cardiac surgery. Smaller centres must still practice strict selection of patients if they do not possess an intensive care unit with facilities for full haemodynamic monitoring. We present a review of the recent literature and current practice at our hospital to assist clinicians in assessing these patients <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> However, the final decision whether the patients is fit <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> still rests with the anaesthetist.

40|$|Laparoscopy for {{urological surgery}} is a {{relatively}} recent surgical innovation. Some centres have substantial experience of single operations, but very few have experience with a comprehensive range. Our programme began with nephrectomy and pyeloplasty, and has expanded to provide for a living related kidney donor programme and for other procedures usually conducted open. Recently, it has included prostate and bladder cancer surgery. The learning curve and implications <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> are described {{on the basis of}} the experience of one anaesthetist with 124 patients. Perioperative care issues, in common with other abdominal laparoscopic procedures, relate to operating positions, the consequences of carbon dioxide under pressure in the abdomen and postoperative analgesia. There is only a small requirement <b>for</b> regional <b>anaesthesia</b> supplementa-tion and invasive analgesia. The corporate laparoscopic cholecystectomy experience was used as the foundation <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and to delineate specific organ system issues and any interventions. Significant differences were found in the spectrum of the urological patient population and comorbidity, notably renal function or dysfunction, and complications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Time {{information}} {{is an important}} aspect of a health information system. Health information cannot be represented and queried correctly without time in medical research, auditing, and medicolegal cases. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is being used in health information systems and has been formerly proposed as a data model <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> information systems. In this paper, we propose incorporating time into an XML model <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> information systems. A new storage structure and a temporal index structure are proposed in order to store temporal XML data and process time queries efficiently. In our proposed model, time has 4 dimensions: valid time, transaction time, event time, and availability time. We discuss the advantages of attaching the time information to the data in anaesthesia records. We implemented and tested the proposed model and the storage structures...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a nine-year-old boy afflicted with Ondine's curse, who {{developed}} complete atrioventricular heart block after a single bolus of propofol <b>for</b> induction of <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>for</b> strabismus surgery. Ondine's curse, the other name for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, is characterized by a generalized disorder of autonomic function. Propofol has no effect on the normal atrioventricular conduction system in humans but it reduces sympathetic activity and can highly potentiate other vagal stimulation factors. Heart block has been documented after propofol bolus use in adults but, to our knowledge, not in children. It would appear that propofol is not a good choice <b>for</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
