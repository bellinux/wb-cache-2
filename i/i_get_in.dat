500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Bow Wow explained how the video relates getting a driver's license {{to being able to}} attract women: [...] "The concept of the video is that I go to the DMV to get my license. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the car and Baby’s my instructor. We’re in Atlanta taking a tour [...] Baby is like, ‘Bow, pull over. Tell this to shorty.’ He tests me on my speaking game with the ladies. A normal DMV person would be testing you on your right turn, [...] ‘check your mirrors.’ Me, I was tested on did I spit game to the girl correctly." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Frith had {{a passion for}} tape {{manipulation}} and [...] "sound malfunctions". In a 1982 interview with Down Beat magazine Frith said that so much more {{can be done with}} tape: [...] "I'm interested in using the studio for things that you couldn't possibly do in a performance, to use the medium of tape {{in a way that is}} intrinsic to it." [...] He added that hardware malfunctions often result in more interesting sounds than was originally intended: [...] " [...] lot of the sounds that <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the studio have been specifically the result of overloading or causing to malfunction various pieces of technology, like harmonizers or digital delays." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Confederate charge {{struck the}} Union position, {{a gap in}} the Union line opened in front of the 19th Massachusetts between their brigade and the {{adjacent}} brigade commanded by Brig. Gen. Webb. [...] Seeing the break, Devereux turned to the colonel of the 42nd New York and, gesturing to the gap said, [...] "Mallon, we must move!" [...] At that moment, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock rode by and Devereux called out to Hancock, [...] "They have broken through! [...] Shall <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> there?" [...] To which Hancock replied, [...] "Go at them!" [...] The 19th Massachusetts and the 42nd New York together filled the gap, entering a pandemonium of hand-to-hand combat. [...] In the brutal fighting, the 19th Massachusetts captured four Confederate regimental flags which Devereux personally delivered to his brigade commander after the battle.|$|E

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must blame them and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people to accept responsibility for failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> trouble, you go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2015, Lucas {{recorded}} {{an hour-long}} interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose {{in which he}} said Disney had not been [...] "keen" [...] to involve him and conceded: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up." [...] He also stated: [...] "They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different… I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new." [...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going to love it, It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for." [...] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film had [...] "needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain" [...] and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.|$|E
