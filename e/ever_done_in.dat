The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E

5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss to Minnesota since 1977 and the largest to Minnesota at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a concussion during the game but still played after showing signs of a concussion. This revelation sparked calls for Brandon to be fired, including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or concussion) to Morris.|$|E

Following the project's completion, NY590 was truncated to Titus Avenue and ownership and maintenance of Sea Breeze Drive {{was transferred to the}} town of Irondequoit. According to New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) official Rick Papaj, the state turned Sea Breeze Drive over to the town because the portion of NY590 north of Titus Avenue had low traffic volumes and was situated in a residential area.

500|$|For his {{portrayal}} of Charles Lane in Shattered Glass, Sarsgaard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for the 2004 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sarsgaard has appeared in an eclectic range of films, including the 2004 comedy-drama Garden State, the biographical film Kinsey (2004), the drama The Dying Gaul (2005) and big-budget films such as Flightplan (2005), Jarhead (2005), Orphan (2009), An Education (2009), Knight and Day (2010), and the superhero film [...] Green Lantern (2011), Lovelace (2013), Kelly Reichardt's Night Moves (2013), Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine (2013), and Black Mass (2015). Sarsgaard also appeared in the U.S. TV series The Killing (2013) as a man on death row perhaps wrongfully convicted for the brutal murder of his wife—a performance which he says included [...] "some of the best acting I have <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> my life."

500|$|Prior to the American {{entry into}} the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a [...] "peace of {{reconciliation}} with Germany", what he dubbed a [...] "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|E
500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song is the driving guitar rhythmic figure {{centered}} on one chord, with [...] "accents that fell fractionally ahead of the beat". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray describes it as a [...] "rocking dance piece... its structure is utterly free-form, its basic beat is the jumping, polyrhythmic groove which he [...] learned in the Delta". [...] In an interview with B.B. King, Hooker confirmed that he used an open G guitar tuning technique for his guitar, although he usually used a capo, raising the pitch to B (1948), A (1959), or A (1970). [...] He also employed hammer-on and pull-off techniques, which are described as [...] "a slurred ascending bass line played on the fifth string [...] " [...] by music writer Lenny Carlson. [...] Although it is titled a [...] "boogie", it does not resemble the earlier boogie-woogie style. [...] Boogie-woogie {{is based on a}} left-hand piano ostinato or walking-bass line and, as performed on guitar, forms the popular 1940s instrumental [...] "Guitar Boogie". [...] Rather than being derivative, Hooker's boogie becomes [...] "as overwhelmingly personal a piece as anything <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the blues".|$|E

500|$|Charlotte's {{discovery}} of a polar bear with a Dharma Initiative collar caused fan speculation about her connection with the island. Mader herself was unaware of Charlotte's backstory beyond the flashback in [...] "Confirmed Dead"she noted [...] "I feel like I'm almost in the same seat as the audience, like 'What {{the hell is going}} on?' and 'What the hell is going to happen next?', it's really exciting actually". She found it freeing to not know her character's history, and felt it made her give a natural performance. Mader felt Charlotte's relationship with Faraday allowed her character to develop and show a softer, more human side, and thought their relationship resonated with the audience as she and Jeremy Davies had good chemistry. Eight episodes of season four were written before production stopped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Once the strike was resolved, a further six episodes were written, two less than originally planned for the season, and as a result Charlotte's role continued into season five. She enjoyed speaking Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and wished the full scene had been aired. Mader was excited when she discovered that Charlotte grew up on the island, and hoped to have scenes with Nestor Carbonell who plays Richard Alpert, as his character also has a history on the island. However when negotiating contracts in June 2008 she found out that her character would die during season five; Mader summed up Charlotte's season five arc as her demise. Charlotte's death scene was written by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and was amongst their favourite scenes they wrote during season five. Horowitz loved the emotion in the scene due to the audience only just learning Charlotte's backstory, and Kitsis thought Mader's performance [...] "elevate the words to a whole other level". Mader called it [...] "the best thing [...] ha <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> [...] entire career" [...] and enjoyed playing a significant role within the episode.|$|E
