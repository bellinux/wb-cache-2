40|$|Development {{of white}} clover cultivars with {{increased}} vegetative persistence, particularly in dryland farming systems {{has been a}} major goal within breeding programmes, however little useful genetic variation for survival and growth in these environments has been found. Consequently, it has become necessary to look towards white clovers wild relatives as sources of genetic variation. T. repens x (T. ambiguum x T. occidentale) tri-species hybrids have been developed, however, their morphologies have not been evaluated, and little is known about optimal breeding strategies in these populations. An experiment was designed to characterise the magnitude of phenotypic variation for a range of root, shoot, and floral traits, and to ascertain optimal breeding strategies within a T. repens x (T. ambiguum x T. occidentale) BC 1 F 2 hybrid plant population. The experiment was designed such that it could be analysed in two ways; a) Investigated levels of phenotypic variation occurring among hybrid families, compared to representatives of their F 1 parents b) Investigated levels of phenotypic variation among individual hybrid genotypes, again compared to representatives of their F 1 parents. Analysis (a) found a relative lack of among hybrid family variation. With significant (P< 0. 05) family variance components for 11 of the 18 traits measured, and generally only occurring between the upper and lower extremes. Repeatability estimates on a family mean basis were low (less than 0. 51 for all traits). Analysis (b) found significant (P< 0. 05) genotypic variance components for all of the traits measured. Repeatability estimates ranged from 0. 47 - 0. 88, indicating a relatively high level of genetic determination for the majority of traits. Pattern analysis allowed the identification of hybrid genotypes showing the combined expression of key shoot, and root traits. These genotypes may provide a route to <b>hybrid</b> <b>clover</b> cultivars showing increased vegetative persistence via increased nodal and tap-root size, combined with good dry matter production...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of hybridisation with Trifolium uniflorumL. on drought resistance of Trifolium repens L. (white clover). Shoot dry weight of backcross 1 (BC 1) hybrids was reduced less by water stress than for backcross 2 (BC 2) <b>hybrids</b> and white <b>clover,</b> as were key morphological traits such as leaf area. Under water stress, important differences for the BC 1 generation compared to white clover also included lower senescence, higher stolon density, increased root dry weight, and a higher maximum nodal root diameter. Drought decreased the net photosynthetic rate by up to 48 % in BC 2 and white clover, but there was no significant effect on the BC 1 generation. BC 1 hybrids were therefore more resistant to water stress than white clover. Smaller effects on stolon morphology suggest BC 1 hybrids were better able to maintain cell turgor and growth, and maintenance of photosynthesis under drought may have contributed to smaller reductions in productivity.

Journal of Agricultural Science, 143 (2 - 3), 117 - 135 White clover (Trifolium repens L.) and {{red clover}} (T. pratense L.) {{are the most}} important legumes of temperate pastures. The former is used largely in systems based around sheep or cattle grazing and is grown together with a companion grass. Breeding aims to optimize the white clover contribution to the sward. This means that yield per se is not the aim but rather {{to take full advantage of}} the benefits of white clover; in particular, nitrogen fixation, high protein content, digestibility, mineral content and high intake. The objective is an agronomically and, as far as possible, nutritionally balanced sward, thus persistence of white clover and yield stability over a number of years are key goals. A considerable focus of germplasm improvement has therefore been overcoming biotic and abiotic stresses to clover performance. The former include not only pests and diseases but also the impact of the ruminant animal and the competitive interaction with the companion grass, while abiotic stress could be loosely defined as ?winter hardiness? and ?summer survival? depending on the site. In recent years the focus of many breeding efforts has shifted to give more consideration to the effects of variation within white clover germplasm on animal performance and the environment. Beneficial effects on productivity have been known for many years, but recent studies of the impact of forage diets on meat and milk quality have opened up new opportunities for improvement. Diffuse pollution of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural sources is high on the environmental protection agenda of many governments. Breeding efforts are now being made to reduce the contribution of clovers to both direct (leaching) and indirect (through animal returns) pollution. In particular, recent insights into mechanisms affecting protein breakdown in the rumen and silo offer new prospects for breeding interventions to reduce environmental impacts. Molecular marker methods are being developed in white clover and the transfer and use of resources and information accumulating in the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus is likely to be a major route by which the power of genomic approaches is translated into forage legume improvement. <b>Hybrids</b> of white <b>clover</b> and related species have been developed to introgress key traits; namely, drought tolerance, grazing tolerance of large leaf types and enhanced seed yield, for which only limited genetic variation is present within the white clover gene pool. Red clover is less persistent than white clover, is typically cut three or more times in a season and is used to make silage for winter feed. Although it is often grown with a companion grass, monocultures are common and yield per se as well as persistency and pest and disease resistance are major breeding aims. Fewer agronomic studies and less germplasm improvement have been carried out in this species and molecular studies are not as well advanced although, as with white clover, future developments are likely to benefit greatly from a close relationship to model legumes. Red clover brings considerable benefits in terms of animal production and meat and milk quality. These aspects, alongside approaches to reduce nitrogenous pollution from the silo, represent considerable opportunities for variety development. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of hybridisation with Trifolium uniflorum L. on root and shoot characteristics of Trifolium repens L. (white clover). In a grazing experiment, dry matter (DM) yield scores combined over the experimental period were higher for white clover (5. 3) than for BC₁ (backcross 1) (4. 4) and BC₂ (backcross 2) (4. 3) hybrid generations. The proportion of nitrogen from fixation (85 – 96 %) was not affected by hybridisation, and there were generally no differences among clover types in shoot %N. In 13 month old plants, tap root survival was higher for T. uniflorum (50 %), and BC₁ (31 %) than for BC₂ (13 %) and white clover (11 %). Some tap roots of T. uniflorum and the BC₁ generation survived up to 19 – 20 months, but those of BC₂ and white clover did not. In contrast to the field experiment, shoot dry weight (DW) of BC₁ hybrids was 2 – 24 times higher than white clover over four harvest times in a glasshouse root tube experiment using sand culture with a low ionic strength (LIS) nutrient solution. Shoot P concentrations (925 – 1716 mg kg⁻¹) were below critical levels for white clover growth. In a pot experiment with the same LIS treatment, these effects were confirmed. Over a range of nutrient treatments, some hybrid families were less affected by decreases in nutrient solution strength than others. In all treatments combined, shoot DW of Kopu II x 900 - 4 was 2. 8 times higher than that of the Kopu II parent, and Kopu II x 487 - 9 was 1. 5 times higher. Crusader hybrids did not differ to the Crusader parent. In some treatments, P- and Pi-use efficiency of Kopu II x 900 - 4 was higher than the other clover types. Some root characteristics of T. uniflorum, inherited by BC₁ hybrids, may affect water and nutrient interception. In a glasshouse tube experiment, BC₁ hybrids and T. uniflorum had more root mass in {{the upper part of the}} profile than white clover. In a hydroponics experiment, the roots of T. uniflorum were thicker than BC₁ <b>hybrids</b> and white <b>clover,</b> which may contribute to drought resistance. Topological indices of T. uniflorum (0. 91 – 0. 94) were higher than for white <b>clover</b> and some <b>hybrid</b> families (0. 76 – 0. 92), as were those of Kopu II x 900 - 4 (0. 85 – 0. 98). This herringbone root architecture may be adaptive to low soil fertility. In a rain shelter experiment, shoot DWs of white clover and BC₂ were 95 % and 26 % higher, respectively, than that of BC₁ in the Watered treatment. However, shoot DW decreased less under water stress for the BC₁ generation (47 %) compared with BC₂ and white clover (nearly 70 %). There were no differences in shoot DW among clover types in the Stressed treatment. Stolon morphological characteristics of BC₁ (- 31 – 68 %) also decreased less under water stress than those of BC₂ (- 44 – 73 %) and white clover (- 38 – 74 %). Kopu II BC₁ was able to maintain photosynthesis and transpiration under lower leaf water potentials than Kopu II BC₂ and Kopu II. Net photosynthesis of Kopu II BC₁ did not change under water stress, but in Kopu II BC₂and Kopu II it decreased by 48 % and 44 %, respectively. There was also no change in transpiration with water stress for Kopu II BC₁, but in Kopu II BC₂ and Kopu II it decreased by 60 %, resulting in a higher mean transpiration rate for Kopu II BC₁ in the Stressed treatment. Under water stress, the leaf water potential of Kopu BC₁ decreased more (- 47 %) than that of Kopu II BC₂ (- 28 %) and Kopu II (- 31 %). Root DW of Kopu II BC₁ increased by 59 % under water stress, but that of Kopu II BC₂ and white clover did not change significantly. In the Stressed treatment, root DW of Kopu II BC₁ was 72 % higher than that of Kopu II BC₂, and mean cross-sectional area of the thickest nodal root of Kopu II BC₁ was 2. 6 times higher than Kopu II. In addition to improvements for some traits in broad hybrid generations, there was also evidence of differences among hybrid families for many parameters, which should enable selection of superior families and identification of segregating populations...|$|R
