40|$|Abstract. For {{avoiding}} false-alarm and diagnosing <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault,</b> {{based on}} the relationship analysis between <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> and false-alarm, the <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis model of power system based on HMM (Hidden Markov Model) -SVM (Support Vector Machine) characteristics was constructed in this paper. By means of this model, the <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis procedure of power system based on HMM-SVM characteristics was built. Finally, the <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis simulation system of power system based on HMM-SVM characteristics was demonstrated and validated by QUEST software. The result showed that the proposed method was available, and can provided guidance for avoiding false-alarm and diagnosing <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault,</b> and support for stable performance in power system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> under extreme {{vibration}} environment {{is an important}} cause to affect the function of mechatronics system. A new <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostic technique based on EMD and neural network methods is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the essential characteristics of <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> under extreme {{vibration environment}} are summarized. Then {{in view of the}} extreme vibration analysis of electromechanical systems, a new <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostic technique is put forward by combining EMD and neural network approach. Lastly, the technique is verified by conducting in the heading attitude system of helicopter...|$|R
50|$|If an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> occurs {{for long}} enough during troubleshooting, it can be {{identified}} and resolved in the usual way.|$|R
50|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> are {{notoriously}} {{difficult to identify}} and repair ("troubleshoot") because each individual factor does not create the problem alone, so the factors can only be identified while the malfunction is actually occurring. The person capable of identifying and solving the problem is seldom the usual operator. Because {{the timing of the}} malfunction is unpredictable, and both device or system downtime and engineers' time incur cost, the fault is often simply tolerated if not too frequent unless it causes unacceptable problems or dangers. For example, some <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> in critical equipment such as medical life support equipment could result in killing a patient or in aeronautics causes a flight to be aborted or in some cases crash.|$|E
50|$|One of the LEO III's quirkier {{features}} was {{a loudspeaker}} {{connected to the}} central processor which enabled operators to tell whether a program was looping by the distinctive sound it made. Another quirk was that many <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> were due to faulty connectors and could be temporarily fixed by briskly strumming the card handles.|$|E
50|$|Variations of TDR exist. For example, {{spread-spectrum}} time-domain reflectometry (SSTDR) is used {{to detect}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> in complex and high-noise systems such as aircraft wiring. Coherent optical time domain reflectometry (COTDR) is another variant, used in optical systems, in which the returned signal is mixed with a local oscillator and then filtered to reduce noise.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> detection problem for a class of discrete-time linear systems with output dead-zone. Dead-zone phenomenon exists in many real practical systems due to the employment of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf sensors. Two Bernoulli random variables are utilized to model the dead-zone effect and a variant formation of Tobit Kalman filter is brought forward to generate a residual that can indicate the occurrence of an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault.</b> A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed technique. The statistical performance of the technique is illustrated as well...|$|R
50|$|Since the warping of {{the circuit}} board or {{integrated}} circuit may disappear when the board cools, an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> may be created. Diagnosis of head-in-pillow defects may require use of X-rays or EOTPR (Electro Optical Terahertz Pulse Reflectometry), since the solder joints are hidden between the integrated circuit package and the printed circuit board.|$|R
50|$|This {{method has}} been shown to be useful to {{locating}} <b>intermittent</b> electrical <b>faults.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} {{systems and}} cable systems, {{time domain reflectometry}} techniques can be used: pulses are sent down electric wiring and the pulses reflected back are examined for anomalies, for example intermittent leakage during the stresses of aircraft operation; this can only be done for one test channel at time and is generally limited to <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> >100milliseconds.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} cause of fires in airplanes is wiring problems that involve <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults,</b> such as wires with breached insulation touching each other, having water dripping on them, or short circuits. These {{are difficult to}} detect once the aircraft is on the ground. However, there are methods, such as spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry, that can feasibly test live wires on aircraft during flight.|$|E
50|$|The Motronic 1.1 and 1.3 {{systems are}} largely similar, the main {{improvement}} being the increased diagnostic capabilities of Motronic 1.3. The 1.3 ECM can store many more detailed fault codes than 1.1, {{and has a}} permanent 12-volt feed from the vehicle's battery which allows it to log <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> in memory across several trips. Motronic 1.1 can only advise of a few currently-occurring faults.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{volcanism}} {{also occurred}} during the middle to late Cambrian, contributing further to the uplift of the area. This also contributed to {{a second round of}} block faulting, in which conglomerates, ash flows, and tuffs accumulated in the Snake Range.Both continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> movements also occurred, with individual fault surfaces {{on both sides of the}} Snake Range thinning and stretching.|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{to diagnose}} <b>intermittent</b> scan chain <b>fault</b> in scan-based designs is proposed in this paper. An <b>intermittent</b> scan chain <b>fault</b> sometimes is triggered and sometimes is not triggered during scan chain shifting, {{which makes it}} very difficult to locate the fault sites. In this paper, we provide answers to three questions: (1) Why <b>intermittent</b> scan chain <b>faults</b> happen? (2) Why diagnosis of this type of faults is necessary? (3) How to diagnose this type of faults? The experimental results presented demonstrate that the proposed diagnosis algorithm is effective for large industrial designs with multiple <b>intermittent</b> scan chain <b>faults.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> {{detection}} {{problem for}} a class of networked systems with multiple state delays and unknown input. Polytopic-type parameter uncertainty in the state-space model matrices is considered. A novel measurement model is employed to account for both the random measurement delays and the stochastic data missing (package dropout) phenomenon, which are typically resulted from the limited capacity of the communication networks. We aim to design an uncertainty-dependent fault detection filter such that, for all unknown input, all possible parameter uncertainties, and all incomplete measurements, the error between residual and weighted fault is made as small as possible. By converting the addressed robust fault detection problem into an alternative robust H∞ filtering problem of a certain Markovian jumping system (MJS), a sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} the desired robust fault detection filter is derived. A residual evaluation within an incremental form is brought forward to make the whole method suitable for <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> detection. A numerical example is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|Transient and <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> can {{typically}} {{be handled}} by detection and correction by e.g., ECC codes or instruction replay (see below). Permanent faults will lead to uncorrectable errors which can {{be handled by}} replacement by duplicate hardware, e.g., processor sparing, or by {{the passing of the}} uncorrectable error to high level recovery mechanisms. A successfully corrected intermittent fault can also be reported to the operating system (OS) to provide information for predictive failure analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Spread-spectrum {{time domain}} {{reflectometry}} is used in detecting <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> in live wires. From buildings and homes to aircraft and naval ships, this technology can discover irregular shorts on live wire running 400&thinsp;Hz, 115&thinsp;V. For accurate location of a wiring system's fault the SSTDR associates the PN code with the signal on the line then stores {{the exact location of}} the correlation before the arc dissipates. Present SSTDR can collect a complete data set in under 5&thinsp;ms.|$|E
5000|$|An {{intermittent}} fault, {{often called}} simply an [...] "intermittent", is a malfunction of a device or system that occurs at intervals, usually irregular, in a device or system that functions normally at other times. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> {{are common to}} all branches of technology, including computer software. An intermittent fault is caused by several contributing factors, {{some of which may}} be effectively random, which occur simultaneously. The more complex the system or mechanism involved, the greater the likelihood of an intermittent fault.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntermittent faults are {{regarded}} as the most difficult class of faults to diagnose and are cited {{as one of the}} main root causes of No Fault Found. There are a variety of technical issues relating {{to the nature of the}} fault which make identifying intermittent. This paper discusses some of these issues by introducing the concept of <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> dynamics, modelling approaches and a selection of the state-of-the-art testing and diagnostic techniques and technologies...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{survey and}} {{correspondence}} with industrial sector shows that No-Fault-Found (NFF) {{is a major}} concern in through life engineering services, especially for defence, aerospace, and other transport industry. There are various occurrences and root causes that result in NFF events but intermittent interconnections are the most frustrating. This is because it disappears while testing, and missed out by diagnostic equipment. This thesis describes the challenging and most important area of <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> detection and health monitoring that focuses towards NFF situation in electronics interconnections. After introduction, this thesis starts with literature survey and describes financial impact on aerospace and other transport industry. It highlights NFF technologies and discuss different facts and their impact on NFF. Then It goes into experimental study that how repeatedly <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> could be replicated. It describes a novel fault replicator that can generate repeatedly IFs for further experimental study on diagnosis techniques/algorithms. The novel IF replicator provide for single and multipoint intermittent connection. The experimental work focuses on mechanically induced intermittent conditions in connectors. This work illustrates a test regime {{that can be used to}} repeatedly reproduce intermittency in electronic connectors whilst subjected to vibration [...] . [cont. ]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntermittent faults in electrical/electronic {{interconnections}} are recognised {{as one of}} {{the major}} sources of No Fault Found (NFF) events. These can be caused due to surface corrosion (e. g. oxidation of pins or fretting wear), bent pins, debris within the female connector, or incorrect installation during initial manufacture and assembly. Unless such issues are narrowed down to a specific root cause, any corrective actions or troubleshooting will be difficult to carry out, and hence its resolution may not make its way into future designs of the system. This leads to further susceptibility to NFF. Intermittent behaviour is often a clear sign of a partially damaged connector, or a connector undergoing a particular degradation mechanism, with the level of intermittency being further aggravated through process variation of harsh environments and parametric faults. In order to further our understanding of the relationship between degradation, operating conditions, intermittent behaviour within the subject, an experimental investigations have been carried out. This paper {{is a work in progress}} paper that illustrates a test regime that has been used to stimulate intermittence in electronic connectors whilst subjected to vibration, using both a traditional oscilloscope and bespoke <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> detection equipment, in order to capture an intermittent signature. The results of these experiments provide an insight into the limitations of test equipment and requirements for future <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> detection techniques...|$|R
5000|$|The Hydractive {{system was}} {{somewhat}} [...] "ahead of the curve" [...] {{when the car}} was launched and early versions were sometimes unreliable. Many problems stemmed from the sensitive electronics controlling the car's hydraulic system, often caused by the poor quality of the multipoint grounding blocks - one on each front inner wing, one at the rear, and one under the dashboard. These tended to corrode (especially {{the ones in the}} engine compartment), causing all manner of <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> which were hard to diagnose. On later cars, these were changed to screw terminals bolted through the bodywork, and most of the older cars have been modified in a similar way.|$|E
5000|$|In complex, {{multiple}} channel systems, where the fault/s {{might be in}} an interconnection, the ideal method of finding an intermittent fault {{is to be able}} to monitor, detect and isolate all channels or electrical paths continuously and simultaneously. This methodology allows the system under test to benefit from continuous and complete test coverage while any environmental stressing of the system is performed. This type cannot be performed by scanning testing technology but needs to have some form of electronic neural-network which can perform these test without the need for any scanning and/or digital averaging; this testing regime is covered by the DoD's MIL-PRF-32516 published in March 2015 and it calls for testing technology to operate in the Class 1 category in order to combat <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> effectively.|$|E
5000|$|Spread Spectrum Time Domain Vernier Method or SSTDV, is a {{time domain}} {{reflectometry}} method that uses a spread spectrum time domain reflectometry signal to locate <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> in wires (such as aircraft wires) by measuring time delay between incident and reflected signals. SSTDR uses a pseudo noise (PN) code as the test signal. This code travels {{down the length of}} the wire, where it is reflected off of impedance discontinuities such as open or short circuits. The reflected signal is correlated with the incident signal to identify the locations of these discontinuities. In the case of SSTDV, the correlation is accomplished by adding one bit to the PN code each cycle, thus creating a vernier sequence that can be used to resolve the time delay between incident and reflected signals.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} the on-load exciting current Park's Vector Approach for diagnosing permanent and <b>intermittent</b> turn-to-turn winding <b>faults</b> in operating power transformers. First, an experimental investigation of the behaviour of the transformer under the occurrence of both permanent and <b>intermittent</b> winding <b>faults</b> is presented. Finally, experimental test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic technique, which is based on the on-line monitoring of the on-load exciting current Park's Vector patterns...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> {{localization}} approaches {{account for}} the fact that faulty components may fail intermittently by considering a parameter (known as goodness) that quantifies the probability that faulty components may still exhibit correct behavior. Current, state-of-the-art approaches (1) assume that this goodness probability is context independent and (2) do not provide means for integrating past diagnosis experience in the diagnostic mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel approach, coined Non-linear Feedback-based Goodness Estimate (NFGE), that uses kernel density estimations (KDE) to address such limitations. We evaluated the approach with both synthetic and real data, yielding lower estimation errors, thus increasing the diagnosis performance...|$|R
40|$|Design methodologies for realizing future high {{authority}} autoflight control systems are being investigated, {{taking into account}} also the study of distributed microcomputer architectures. Attention {{is given to the}} redundant asynchronous microprocessor (RAMP) structure. RAMP comprises a connected network of microcomputers which has as input command and sensor information, and which generates servo information to drive actuators, and thrust linkages. Tolerance to hardware failures is achieved by static redundancy. Results of a failed microcomputer are simply rejected. This is done in lieu of dynamic redundancy wherein the distributed computer system performs real time fault detection and reconfiguration of the system. Attention is given to the RAMP network structure and operation, flight control with parallel asynchronous computers, and <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance...|$|R
50|$|Driver Verifier {{is a tool}} {{included}} in Microsoft Windows that replaces the default operating system subroutines with ones that are specifically developed to catch device driver bugs. Once enabled, it monitors and stresses drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that may be causing system corruption. It acts within the kernel mode and can target specific device drivers for continual checking or make driver verifier functionality multithreaded, so that several device drivers can be stressed at the same time. It can simulate certain conditions such as low memory, I/O verification, pool tracking, IRQL checking, deadlock detection, DMA checks, IRP logging, etc. The verifier works by forcing drivers to work with minimal resources, making potential errors that might happen only rarely in a working system manifest immediately. Typically fatal system errors are generated by the stressed drivers in the test environment, producing core dumps that can be analysed and debugged immediately; without stressing, <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> would occur in the field, without proper troubleshooting facilities or personnel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the past}} several decades, the most popular fault model used in {{practice}} is the single stuck-at fault model. In this model, one of the signal lines in a circuit {{is assumed to be}} stuck at a fixed logic value, regardless of what inputs are supplied to the circuit. Hence, if a circuit has n signal lines, there are potentially 2n stuck-at faults defined on the circuit, of which some can be viewed as being equivalent to others. The stuck-at fault model is a logical fault model because no delay information is associated with the fault definition. It is also called a permanent fault model because the faulty effect is assumed to be permanent, in contrast to <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults</b> which occur (seemingly) at random and transient faults which occur sporadically, perhaps depending on operating conditions (e.g. temperature, power supply voltage) or on the data values (high or low voltage states) on surrounding signal lines. The single stuck-at fault model is structural because it is defined based on a structural gate-level circuit model.|$|E
5000|$|Patch cords were expensive, {{could be}} damaged by use (creating hard-to-find <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults),</b> and made complex patches {{difficult}} and time-consuming to recreate. Thus, later analog synthesizers {{used the same}} building blocks, but integrated them into single units, eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems. The most popular of these was the Minimoog. In 1970, Moog designed an innovative synthesizer with a built-in keyboard and without modular design - the analog circuits were retained, but made interconnectable with switches in a simplified arrangement called [...] "normalization". Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. This first pre-patched synthesizer, the Minimoog, became highly popular, with over 12,000 units sold. [...] The Minimoog also influenced the design of nearly all subsequent synthesizers, with integrated keyboard, pitch wheel and modulation wheel, and a VCO->VCF->VCA signal flow. In the 1970s, miniaturized solid-state components let manufacturers produce self-contained, portable instruments, which musicians soon began to use in live performances. Electronic synthesizers quickly become a standard part of the popular-music repertoire. The first movie to use music made with a (Moog) synthesizer was the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969. After {{the release of the}} film, composers produced a large number of movie soundtracks that featured synthesizers.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The use of Totally Self-Checking Checkers in {{the design}} of highly {{reliable}} systems has significant advantages. It allows errors to be detected upon occurance without testing whether the error is caused by a permanent or an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault.</b> The TSC circuit provides an error indication whenever the input is not a code word or a fault occurs within a checker itself. TSC checkers have already been designed for m-out of-n codes and Berger codes. Bose Lin Code is a separable and efficient code for the detection of t-unidirectional errors. The purpose of this thesis is to describe the basis for the design of a self-checking checker and design a TSC checker for Bose Lin Code...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} logic im-plication checkers for the online detection of errors. A logic implication, or invariant relationship must hold for all valid input conditions. Therefore, any violation of this implication will indicate an error due to an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault.</b> These implication checkers are included as a separate hardware component on chip and are used in parallel with the regular logic. We present techniques to efficiently identify the most useful logic implications {{to include in the}} checker hardware such that the probability of error detection is maximized while minimizing the additional hardware and delay overhead. Our results show that significant error detection is possible—even with only a 10 % area overhead—while minimizing impact on delay and power...|$|R
50|$|The only mystery, Peter says, {{is exactly}} what pseudo-Brinklow's mission in Paggleham was. This mystery is solved by, of all people, Peter's ten-year-old nephew, Charlie Parker, and his friend from the village, Sam Bateson. Charlie got a crystal radio set from Lord St. George as a present, but was {{frustrated}} because it had an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault.</b> Now he realises it was working perfectly, but intercepting signals from a transmitter in the village: the last of which occurred just before pseudo-Brinklow was killed. Charlie and Sam borrowed a book on Morse code and wrote down their intercepts, even though they cannot decipher them. Peter delivers the intercepts to Bungo, {{and a few days}} later a secret air base near Paggleham is closed and relocated.|$|R
