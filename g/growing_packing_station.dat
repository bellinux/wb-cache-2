30|$|Regarding {{the first}} disadvantage, {{the demand for}} {{packages}} varies every day in quantity and receiver’s addresses and the distance between <b>pack</b> <b>stations</b> and customers may result quite high in some cases; moreover {{in some cases the}} available <b>pack</b> <b>stations</b> may result not sufficient to satisfy the demand, or one or more <b>pack</b> <b>station</b> may be empty.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934, he interviewed the {{operators}} of dozens of <b>pack</b> <b>stations</b> throughout the Sierra Nevada, questioning them in depth about their business operations. He {{compiled a list of}} 71 <b>pack</b> <b>stations</b> operating in California's wilderness areas. This formed the basis for his MBA thesis at Stanford.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, {{he bought}} an {{interest}} in the Mineral King <b>Pack</b> <b>Station,</b> and in 1946, bought two <b>pack</b> <b>stations</b> in the eastern Sierra that he merged to form the Mount Whitney Pack Trains. He was the largest wilderness outfitter in the Sierra Nevada {{for a number of years}} in the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Adams' <b>Pack</b> <b>Station</b> is a {{permitted}} outfitter {{and general}} store that has operated at Chantry Flat since 1936. It sells the National Forest Adventure Pass, and also offers food and gear {{as well as}} additional parking for visitors.

5000|$|In either case, {{the process}} and {{techniques}} used {{are very similar to}} those developed prior to the era of motor vehicles. Customers arrange for a meeting time or a delivery time and drop their goods and supplies at the <b>pack</b> <b>station.</b> <b>Packing</b> services are charged by the pound or by the animal, typically with a minimum price depending on the distance from the <b>pack</b> <b>station.</b> Everything is weighed, sorted for each animal, then split 50/50 to get a balanced load {{on each side of the}} animal; an unbalanced load will cause the saddle to slide to the heavy side, causing discomfort to the animal, and potentially inviting disaster. The average mule can carry as much as 300 lb. A mammoth donkey can carry up to 200 lb and standard donkey limit is 125 lb. However, most <b>pack</b> <b>station</b> mule loads are limited to 150 lb ...|$|R

50|$|In 1929, Livermore rode a {{motorcycle}} {{up and down}} the Sierra Nevada, searching for a summer job. On the advice of a park ranger in Sequoia National Park, he was hired at a <b>pack</b> <b>station</b> in Mineral King because of his experience with horses and mules. That first summer, he shod mules, helped the camp cook, and did various chores. The following summer, he began leading mule trains into the wilderness of the High Sierra. The Great Depression hit the <b>pack</b> <b>station</b> business hard, and work was negligible the next two summers. He worked a bit in the summer of 1933, and business picked up for the summer of 1934.|$|R

30|$|The BentoBox, {{designed}} {{within the}} project CityLog [21], {{with the participation}} of TNT Express, has been developed {{with the aim of}} resolving the second disadvantage of <b>pack</b> <b>stations.</b> It is composed of a fixed docking station, and six removable modular trolleys. Trolleys are consolidated at the UDC. A new small container has been proposed within the project CityLog to accommodate the trolleys: BentoBox trolleys are loaded into the small container in the UDC and unloaded at the docking station. The unloading of the BentoBox container is again automatic but the BentoBox trolleys should be manually moved from the unloading unit to the docking station. Therefore the unloading time at the docking station is reduced to the minimum and operative costs are minimized. However, as for <b>Pack</b> <b>stations,</b> the number and the localizations of the BentoBox docking stations are fixed for a given urban area and do not depend on the current freight demand.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{consider}} a pick-and-sort order picking system, in which batches of orders are picked simultaneously from different (work) zones {{by a group of}} order pickers. After picking, the orders are transported by a conveyor to a next station for consolidation and packing. Packing can only occur when an order has been picked completely. For a given number of workers, each assigned to a single zone, a larger number of zones reduces pick time (since travel time reduces), but increases waiting time for completion at the <b>packing</b> <b>stations,</b> because more partial batches needing assembly arrive at the <b>packing</b> <b>stations.</b> Our aim is to determine the optimal number of zones such that the total (picking and packing) time to complete a batch is minimized. We solve this problem by optimally assigning items to pick routes in each zone. We illustrate the method with data taken from a distribution center of one of the largest online retailers in the Netherlands...|$|R

This {{can be a}} simple shed, providing shade and running water, or a large-scale, sophisticated, mechanised facility, with conveyor belts, automated sorting and <b>packing</b> <b>stations,</b> walk-in coolers and the like. In mechanised harvesting, processing may also begin {{as part of the}} actual harvest process, with initial cleaning and sorting performed by the harvesting machinery.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{epidemiological}} study among workers exposed to flour total dust and flour aeroallergen concentrations were measured with personal samplers over a workshift in three large bakeries and four flour mills and <b>packing</b> <b>stations.</b> In the bakeries geometric means for total dust concentrations ranged from 0. 4 mg/m 3 in the bread wrapping area up to 6. 4 mg/m 3 at the dough brake. The flour aeroallergen concentrations ranged from 45. 5 micrograms/m 3 in the bread wrapping area up to 252. 0 micrograms/m 3 in the confectionary area. In the flour mills and <b>packing</b> <b>stations</b> the concentrations were higher with geometric means for total dust ranging from 0. 5 mg/m 3 in the office up to 16. 9 mg/m 3 for hygiene workers in an old mill. The flour aeroallergen concentrations ranged from 101. 5 micrograms/m 3 for transport workers up to 1728. 2 micrograms/m 3 for hygiene workers.

40|$|Background As low {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses can mutate into high pathogenic viruses the Dutch poultry sector implemented a surveillance system for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) based on blood samples. It {{has been suggested}} that egg yolk samples could be sampled instead of blood samples to survey egg layer farms. To support future decision making about AI surveillance economic criteria are important. Therefore a cost analysis is performed on systems that use either blood or eggs as sampled material. Methodology/Principal Findings The effectiveness of surveillance using egg or blood samples was evaluated using scenario tree models. Then an economic model was developed that calculates the total costs for eight surveillance systems that have equal effectiveness. The model considers costs for sampling, sample preparation, sample transport, testing, communication of test results and for the confirmation test on false positive results. The surveillance systems varied in sampled material (eggs or blood), sampling location (farm or <b>packing</b> <b>station)</b> and location of sample preparation (laboratory or <b>packing</b> <b>station).</b> It is shown that a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the <b>packing</b> <b>station</b> and samples prepared in a laboratory had the lowest total costs (i. e. € 273, 393) a year. Compared to this a hypothetical system in which eggs are sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory, and the currently implemented system in which blood is sampled at the farm and samples prepared at a laboratory have 6 % and 39 % higher costs respectively. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that surveillance for avian influenza on egg yolk samples can be done at lower costs than surveillance based on blood samples. The model can be used in future comparison of surveillance systems for different pathogens and hazard...|$|R
