25|$|Human {{rights groups}} and foreign governments have heavily criticised China's {{use of the}} death penalty for a variety of reasons, {{including}} its application for non-violent offences, allegations of the use of torture to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions,</b> legal proceedings that do not meet international standards, and the government's failure to publish statistics on the death penalty.

25|$|Ordinaries {{were often}} accused on the {{newspapers}} by competing writers of criminal lives of fabricating the last dying speeches of the condemned and of manipulating their position to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions</b> from them. Paul Lorrain {{was accused of}} confessing the criminals for his economical profit and Purney was attacked for literary incompetence. Accusations of withholding the sacrament under the pretense of the criminals not being prepared but in reality with the goal to get an account {{of their lives and}} transactions were common. Even if some of the condemned were really compelled to confess sins which laid heavily on their conscience, most of them did so only to qualify for the sacrament, acknowledging a catalogue of general misdeeds and stopping short of admitting to more serious crimes, especially the one of which they were accused of for fear of jeopardising their chances of a reprieve.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{shows that}} the British Army in the Troubles {{subjected}} prisoners in Northern Ireland to torture and waterboarding during interrogations in the 1970s. Liam Holden was wrongfully arrested by British forces {{for the murder of}} a British soldier and became the last person in the United Kingdom to be sentenced to hang after being convicted in 1973, largely on the basis of an unsigned confession produced by torture. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he spent 17 years behind bars. On 21 June 2012, in the light of CCRC investigations which confirmed that the methods used to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions</b> were unlawful, Holden had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in Belfast, at the age of 58. Former Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) interrogators during the Troubles admitted that beatings, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, and the other tortures were systematic, and were, at times, sanctioned at a very high level within the force.|$|E
25|$|During the {{following}} Kamakura period, capital punishment was widely used {{and methods of}} execution became increasingly cruel, and included burning, boiling and crucifixion, among many others. During the Muromachi period, even harsher methods of execution came into use, such as upside down crucifixion, impalement by spear, sawing, and dismemberment with oxen or carts. Even minor offenses could be punished by death, and family members and even neighbors could be punished along with the offender. These harsh methods, and liberal use of the death penalty, continued throughout the Edo period and into the early Meiji period, but due {{to the influence of}} Confucianism, offenses against masters and elders were increasingly punished much more harshly than offenses against those of lower rank. Torture was used to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions.</b> In 1871, {{as the result of a}} major reform of the penal code, the number of crimes punishable by death was decreased and excessively cruel torture and flogging were abolished. In 1873, another revision resulted in a further reduction in the number of crimes punishable by death, and methods of execution were restricted to beheading or hanging.|$|E
25|$|The Litauische Bau-Bataillonen is {{a poorly}} {{researched}} subject. Lithuanian researcher Rimantas Zizas {{was the first}} to publish a more comprehensive study of the battalions in 2000. The main obstacle to academic research is the lack of reliable sources. Lithuanian archives provide an incomplete picture as they mostly have documents on mobilization and formation of the battalions. Documents related to battalion activities are most likely spread among various Russian and German archives and await further examination. The contemporary press wrote quite extensively about the battalions, but those articles were vague to protect military secrets and with a clear bias, either pro- or anti-German. Post war documents, produced by various Soviet authorities, have a clear anti-German bias. Those are mostly KGB interrogation protocols of former battalion soldiers; the prisoners were often tortured to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions.</b> The Soviets were not interested in comprehensive histories and instead focused on battalions' engagements with Soviet partisans and repressions against civilians. Former soldiers did not produce extensive memoirs; Zizas identified only memoirs of Pranas Nagys as valuable.|$|E

The Wall Street Journal reported estimates that $11 billion was seized through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, told The Financial Times that Chongqing security forces seized his $700 million real estate business and tortured him as retaliation for attempting to purchase land that was also sought by the government.

2500|$|Suspected informers {{and those}} who cooperated with the RUC and British Army (sometimes {{referred}} to as collaborators) were generally dealt with by a counter-intelligence unit titled the Internal Security Unit (ISU), {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "nutting squad". Typically, the ISU would abduct and interrogate suspects frequently using torture to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions.</b> The interrogations would often be recorded and played back to senior Provisional IRA members at a secretly held board of inquiry. This board would then pronounce judgement, usually a fatal gunshot to the head. A judgement as severe as death was frequently made public {{in the form of a}} communique released to the media but in some cases, for reasons of political expediency, the Provisional IRA did not announce responsibility. The bodies of killed informers were usually found shot dead by roadsides in isolated areas. On occasion recordings of their confessions were released to the media.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{criminal}} justice, {{the proceedings}} were markedly archaic. [...] Judges could order suspects to be tortured {{in order to}} <b>extract</b> <b>confessions</b> or induce them to reveal {{the names of their}} accomplices: there were the question ordinaire ("ordinary questioning"), the ordinary form of torture, and the question extraordinaire ("extraordinary questioning"), with increased brutality. There was little presumption of innocence if the suspect was a mere poor commoner. The death sentence could be pronounced for a variety of crimes including mere theft; depending on the crime and the social class of the victim, death could be by decapitation with a sword (for nobles), hanging (for most of the secondary crimes by commoners), the breaking wheel (for some heinous crimes by commoners), and even burning at the stake (for heresy, or advocacy of atheism). Some crimes, such as regicide, exacted even more horrific punishment. With the spread of enlightenment ideas throughout France, most forms of judicial torture had fallen out of favor, and while they remained on the books, were rarely applied after 1750.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for {{organised}} crime and corruption.

In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for [...] "coaching his client to make false claims of torture" [...] and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail.

2500|$|Relatives of {{the missing}} 43 {{students}} toured the United States in April 2015 {{to raise awareness of}} the events that took place in Iguala. Known as the Caravana 43, the tour was organized in conjunction with a national coalition of social activist groups seeking justice for Ayotzinapa. The tour of 14 parents, students, and advocates was split into three groups that covered eastern, middle, and western regions of the United States, stopping in a total of 43 cities over 19 states before convening for a march to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. Caravana 43 claimed no connection to any official political party or national organization. Instead, its organization was completely voluntary with transportation and accommodations for the relatives covered entirely by donations from individuals in host cities. Local groups [...] "committed themselves to support the fundamental goal of providing a platform for the parents in the United States and assumed the organizational and financial responsibility for the Caravan." [...] By creating the opportunity for the relatives to travel throughout the United States, organizers hoped to better inform the American public and new media about the attacks and disappearances. In each of the host cities, relatives spoke not only of their loss, but also of the systematic violence and impunity committed by the Mexican government and its police. Official statements from the tour affirm [...] "The problem is Mexico has a long history documented by Mexican and foreign human rights organizations, other governments, and international organizations of using torture to <b>extract</b> <b>confessions</b> which are then used to construct narratives to protect criminals, the police, military officers, government officials, and politicians … Consequently, many people have no faith in the government's account and have demanded that the investigations continue." [...] Relatives met with students, teachers, and laborers, pleading for the United States to intervene in the crisis. Moreover, the relatives asked elected officials to rethink U.S. foreign policy as it pertains to Mexico, specifically in regards to the Mérida Initiative. Many believe that these funds are being used to suppress the people, rather than fight the drug cartels. Caravana 43 achieved relative success in the United States. After meeting with the groups, several legislators voiced public support for their effort. Cristina Garcia, a California Assembly member stated, [...] "It's a human rights violation that's been going on and it affects {{a lot more than just}} these students… [...] has the responsibility to affect change with our border country." [...] Crowds were gathered at each stop and thousands of people joined in social media platforms to promote the tour. The project served as a unifying mechanism not only across international borders, but also for Latino communities within the United States. Following the end of Caravana 43 in the U.S., the parents, students, and advocates hope to continue in their search for truth by organizing similar tours across South America and Europe.|$|E
