The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel.

40|$|ABSTRACT There {{has been}} a modest {{interest}} in pharmacoepidemiologic research in Norway, especially when considering that drugs are comprising the most common medical treatment and the health care segment with the most rapidly increasing costs in health care. There may be several explanation for the relatively low research output. One may be the generally poor access to information from issued drug prescriptions. Comprehensive population based <b>health</b> <b>surveys</b> {{have been carried out}} in Norway for many years. The <b>health</b> <b>surveys</b> have also been used as a basis for studies of drug use, and they have made it possible to collect important background information associated with drug use. However, <b>health</b> <b>surveys</b> have primarily had their origin in etiological research and the charting of major diseases in the population. Information on drug use has primarily been included as indicators of morbidity. The questions about drug use have therefore been general and covered the use of most drug groups. They have usually included both prescription and non-prescription drugs. The more recent <b>health</b> <b>surveys</b> include questions on drugs with a more focused approach. More questions are now directed towards more defined health problems and drugs. Access to individual based drug information from issued prescriptions, with the possibility of doing record linkage studies combining data from the <b>health</b> <b>surveys</b> and prescription information, may contribute significantly to the quality of pharmacoepidemiologic research in Norway. </span...|$|R

5|$|In the 2005 National Family <b>Health</b> <b>Survey,</b> it was {{reported}} that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8, which is below the replacement rate. Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut. The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are underweight, while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.|$|E

For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 17.6 hospital beds, 9 specialist doctors, 14 nurses and 6 physicians. The city also has about 4,000 individual clinics and 500 medical diagnostic centres. Private clinics are preferred by many residents because of the distance to, poor quality of care at and long waiting times in government facilities, despite the high proportion of the city's residents being covered by government health insurance: 24% according to a National Family <b>Health</b> <b>Survey</b> in 2005.|$|E

In 1951, a state Department of <b>Health</b> <b>survey</b> reported pH between 7.25 and 9.1.

Similarly, a 2007 Manhattan College study done for the New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7.36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7.81 near Torre Road in Yonkers, with a drop to 7.67 at the tunnel, for a total median for the river of 7.59. The lowest recorded pH in the year-long study was 7.1 at Chappaqua with the highest reading, 8.17, at Torre Road. All results were between 6.5 and 8.5, the range required by state regulations.|$|E
