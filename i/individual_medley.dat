5|$|After high school, McKee {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for coach Bill Harlan's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 1972 to 1974. He followed his older brother Mark to Gainesville, where Mark McKee was an All-American swimmer for the Florida Gators from 1969 to 1971. As a freshman in 1972, he finish fourth in the 200-yard backstroke, and fifth in the 400-yard <b>individual</b> <b>medley,</b> as the Florida Gators finished seventh overall at the NCAA men's swimming championships. In his three years as a Gator swimmer, McKee was recognized as the SEC Swimmer of the Year in 1972, won six SEC individual titles, and received four All-American honors.|$|E
5|$|Then 22-year-old Nicholas Bovell participated on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf at Beijing in the men's 200meters <b>individual</b> <b>medley.</b> He {{is the son}} of Barbara Bishop, a Barbadian {{athlete and}} {{sprinter}} in the 1972 Summer Olympics, and brother of fellow Beijing swimmer George Bovell.

5|$|Liechtenstein {{received}} a universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics. Christoph Meier made his Olympic debut by {{competing in the}} men's 400m <b>individual</b> <b>medley</b> event while Julia Hassler made her second appearance, with the first being in London 2012. At the 2012 Olympics, {{she was one of}} three athletes to compete for Liechtenstein. She swam the 400 and 800 freestyles, finishing twenty-seventh in the 400 and 17th in the 800. Meier finished eighth in his heat and twenty-second overall with a time of 4:19.19 seconds, which set a national record but did not qualify him for the finals. Hassler started in the second lane. She came second in her heat and twenty-first overall with a time of 8:38.19 seconds. Hassler was eight seconds off the slowest qualifying time of 8:25.55 seconds by Mireia Belmonte of Spain.|$|E
5|$|Lochte {{competed in}} his sixth World Championships in Kazan in 2015. He made history upon his {{win in the}} 200-meter <b>individual</b> <b>medley</b> by {{becoming}} the only person other than Grant Hackett to successfully win an event in four consecutive world championships. However, he finished a disappointing fourth in the 200-meter freestyle in 1:45.83, just off the podium. In addition, Lochte also won three relay medals. Lochte led off the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 1:45.71, but the US team could not hold on as Great Britain pulled off a great upset and beat the US team 7:04.33 to 7:04.75. Alongside Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel, and Missy Franklin, he was {{also part of the}} winning and world record-breaking 4×100-meter mixed freestyle relay. Lochte also anchored the prelim team for the 4×100-meter medley relay and received a gold medal for his efforts since the finals team won.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe competed at the 1996 Australian Age Championships in Brisbane, winning five gold, two {{silver and}} two bronze medals. His {{times in the}} 400m {{freestyle}} and 200m backstroke qualified him for the Australian Championships, which doubled as selection trials for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic chance of making the top two in any event, which would have meant Olympic selection at only 13 years and six months. He sent Thorpe to Sydney merely to gain competition experience at senior national level. As expected, Thorpe missed selection; he finished 23rd in the 400m freestyle and 36th in the 200m backstroke. At {{the end of the}} year, Thorpe qualified for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance to gain national selection, as the event served as the selection trials for the 1997 FINA World Swimming Championships. Thorpe qualified in second place in the heats of the 400m <b>individual</b> <b>medley</b> and reached his first national final. However, he swam more slowly in the final and missed selection.|$|E
5|$|Wayte {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1983 to 1987. As a Gator swimmer, she won two individual NCAA national titles in the 100-yard freestyle and the 400-yard <b>individual</b> <b>medley</b> in 1985. With Gator teammates Laureeen Welting, Kathy Treible, Tracy Caulkins, Dara Torres and Paige Zemina, {{she was a member}} of the Gators' NCAA championship relay teams in the 400-yard and 800-yard freestyle relays for three consecutive years (1984, 1985, 1986), anchoring five of the six relays. In total, she won eight NCAA championships in those three years. She also won eleven individual Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships and was a member of ten SEC championship relay teams. Wayte was the SEC Swimmer of the Year in 1985, and received a total of twenty-six All-American honors in her four years as a collegiate swimmer.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Haislett {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Mitch Ivey and coach Chris Martin's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1991 to 1994. As a Gator swimmer, she won NCAA national titles in the 200-yard freestyle for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994, the 200-yard <b>individual</b> <b>medley</b> in 1993, and the 500-yard freestyle in 1994, {{and was a member}} of the Gators' NCAA-winning relay teams in the 4×100-yard freestyle in 1993 and the 4×100-yard medley relay in 1994. She received twenty-eight All-American honors in four years—the maximum number possible. In four years of swimming, she was undefeated in Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition, and was recognized as the SEC Female Swimmer of the Year for four consecutive years from 1991 to 1994, and the SEC Female Athlete of the Year (all sports) in 1993 and 1994. She was the 1993–94 recipient of the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, when Seoul, South Korea {{hosted the}} 1988 Summer Olympics, she swam the {{freestyle}} leg for the silver medal-winning U.S. {{team in the}} women's 4×100-meter medley relay with teammates Beth Barr (backstroke), Tracey McFarlane (breaststroke), and Janel Jorgensen (butterfly). The U.S. women's medley relay team was fraught with last-minute drama, as several previously selected swimmers dropped out to focus on individual events, or were replaced because they had performed below expectations, only hours before the event final. In the event final, the U.S. medley relay team included women with no history of competing together, no relay exchange practice, and no coach; the East German favorites taunted the Americans before the race. Wayte would later characterize the race {{as one of her}} proudest moments. She also captured a bronze medal with the third-place U.S. women's 4×100-meter freestyle relay team that included Mitzi Kremer, Dara Torres and Laura Walker. Individually, she finished fourth in the women's 200-meter freestyle; she was also a medal contender in the women's 200-meter <b>individual</b> <b>medley,</b> but was disqualified when the judges ruled she used an illegal butterfly kick on the breaststroke leg of the medley.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter <b>individual</b> <b>medley</b> in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{event at the}} 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Lochte {{combined}} with Nathan Adrian, Anthony Ervin, and Jimmy Feigen in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, with the team finishing behind France. Swimming the second leg, Lochte recorded a split of 47.80, and the team finished with a final time of 3:11.44. In his first individual event, the 200-meter freestyle, Lochte was unsuccessful in defending his title and placed fourth in the final {{with a time of}} 1:45.64. Lochte won his first individual medal of the competition, a gold, by defending his title in the 200-meter <b>individual</b> <b>medley,</b> recording a time of 1:54.98. The day following his 200 medley gold, Lochte also defended his title in the 200-meter backstroke, recording a time of 1:53.79 in the final. On the same day of winning the 200-meter backstroke (and swimming in the 100-meter butterfly semifinals where he set a personal best and qualified for the final), Lochte combined with Conor Dwyer, Charlie Houchin, and Ricky Berens, to win the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Swimming the second leg, Lochte recorded a split of 1:44.98, and the team finished with a final time of 7:01.72. In winning the 4×200 relay, Lochte became the first swimmer to win 5 consecutive gold medals at the World Championships in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay (while also being the first swimmer, along with compatriot Michael Phelps, to win the 4×200-meter freestyle relay Olympic Gold Medal on 3 successive occasions).|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{arrived for}} the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona {{for his first}} major {{international}} competition since Menzies' appointment under heavy media scrutiny following his non-improvement at the Australian Championships. On {{the first night of}} competition Thorpe defeated Hackett in the 400m freestyle in a time 2.5s outside his world record, making him the first to win three world titles in the same event. After his relatively slow 400m, he was again under pressure in the 200m freestyle after van den Hoogenband led at the 100m mark ahead of world record pace. Thorpe managed to respond and retain his world title, and gained some relief after his sprint training yielded his first medal in the 100m freestyle at a global competition; he finished third in 48.77s. In all three freestyle events however, he had swum slower than his times under Frost. He ended his individual campaign on a promising note with his experiment with the 200m <b>individual</b> <b>medley,</b> setting a new personal best of 1min 59.66s to claim silver. Thorpe again anchored the 4×200m freestyle team to retain the world title along with Hackett, Nicholas Sprenger and Craig Stevens, with a reduced margin over the Americans, who finished less than two seconds in arrears. Michael Klim's injuries left the relay teams weakened, with Thorpe anchoring the 4×100m freestyle team to fourth, At the end of a difficult year in the water, his standing had fallen in the eyes of Swimming World, who rated him fourth in the world. He was again named as Australian Swimmer of the Year, jointly with Hackett.|$|E
