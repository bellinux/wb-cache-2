To promote <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> awareness at district levels, the Division works closely with local fire stations in organising <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> talks, seminars, exhibitions, fire drills and training of <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> Ambassadors, who are volunteers from various sectors of the community to raise awareness of <b>fire</b> <b>safety.</b> The Commercial Buildings and Premises Division enforces the <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> (Commercial Premises) Ordinance for upgrading <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> measures in prescribed commercial premises (i.e. supermarkets, department stores, shopping arcades, banks, jewelry or goldsmith premises and off-course betting centres) and specified commercial buildings (i.e. commercial buildings constructed or the plans of building works of which first submitted to the Building Authority for approval on or before March 1, 1987). A Building Safety Loan Scheme has also been established to provide financial assistance to owners of such premises and buildings to upgrade the <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> measures where necessary. Pending implementation of the <b>Fire</b> <b>Safety</b> (Buildings) Ordinance, the Building Improvement and Support Division continues to inspect old private composite and domestic buildings with a view to enhancing <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> and advising owners and occupiers concerned on the improved standards to be required. The Fire Service Installation Task Force inspects fire service installations in buildings, handles complaints regarding building fire service installations and monitors the performance of registered fire service installation contractors.

40|$|Due to {{historic}} {{background of the}} Hong Kong Special Administration Region, the types of historic buildings are varied including traditional Chinese ancestral halls, Western styled residences and functional buildings (e. g.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{building}} designs contribute greatly to the magnitude of fire in building with severe consequences on safety of life and property. Hence, <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> is an important consideration in building design which architects seek to fulfil at the early stage of design.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditionally, <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> {{approaches}} have been reactive rather than proactive.
