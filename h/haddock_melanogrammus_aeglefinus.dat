40|$|Alterations in {{the protein}} and lipid {{components}} of lean fish species were studied to elucidate {{the nature of}} protein denaturation in Gadus morhua and <b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> during frozen storage. Frozen storage of lean fish, Gadus morhua and <b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> {{led to the formation}} of ice crystals, which contributed to protein denaturation. Ice crystals were larger in fish fillets stored at - 10 °C compared to matching fillets stored at - 30 °C as studied by light microscopy at - 20 °C, which indicated damaged muscle fibre by compression. Protein denaturation was also attributed to the effect of lipid oxidation products. The presence of oxygen in the muscle system and high, hydrolytic enzyme and lipoxygenase activity led to increased free fatty acids and lipid oxidation respectively. The peroxide value (PV), conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TEARS) and olefinic to aliphatic protons ratio by 1 H NMR spectroscopy was indicative of oxidative deterioration of the lipid components of Gadus morhua and Melanogarmmus aeglefinus during frozen storage especially at - 10 °C. The ratio of the C=C to the aliphatic groups as assessed by FT-Raman spectroscopy also decreased progressively over the frozen storage period. The 1 H NMR, conjugated diene and FT-Raman spectroscopic measurements were found to be effective and less labour intensive techniques for finger printing lipid oxidation than traditional methods. Intact muscle analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that protein components of the muscle were denatured resulting in altered Tm and DeltaH values. FT-Raman spectroscopy of fish tissue confirmed changes in the proteins and showed decreased levels of alpha-helix and increased ?beta-sheet content (%) as well as changes in hydrophobic groups after frozen storage. These changes were pronounced in samples stored at - 10 °C compared to samples stored at - 30 °C. Model systems of protein-lipid complexes were studied using DSC, FT-Raman spectroscopy and ELISA. The effect of lipids and the primary and secondary oxidation products altered the conformation of myosin, collagen and water soluble proteins during freezing and frozen storage. DSC parameters namely Tm and DeltaH values indicated the degree of denaturation of fish proteins, when frozen in the presence and absence of lipids. It is proposed that ice crystal formation resulted in the removal of the hydration shell of the proteins and the overall rearrangement of the stabilising forces; this allowed protein-lipid interaction to take place and induced further protein denaturation. Reduced immune affinity of the myosin-lipid systems towards the myosin antibody compared to the control native myosin indicated conformational changes of the myosin molecule. The addition of lipids (DHA, EPA, extracted fish oil and hexanal) induced secondary structure changes in myosin over and above those caused by freezing. This was evidenced by decreased alpha-helix content with a concomitant increase of beta-sheet structure, indicating myosin polymerisation. A decrease in the tryptophan band, and increase in the ratio of the dityrosine bands indicated changes in hydrophobic groups. The model studies and the analysis of intact fish muscle of Gadus morhua and <b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> suggest that protein denaturation occurred due to the concerted action of ice crystals, supercooled water molecules (unfrozen), high solute concentration, free fatty acids, and primary and secondary lipid oxidation products on the fish muscle proteins. Possible intervention schemes include, the addition of appropriate antifreeze glycoproteins, cryoprotectants and antioxidants...|$|R

40|$|A multinomial {{logistic}} model {{is presented as}} a tool for comparing two or more age–length keys. The model provides an objective way to fill in missing values and can be used for estimating uncertainty and visualizing age–length keys (ALKs). An example of <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> L.) in ICES Division VIa (West of Scotland) is used to illustrate that significant regional differences in the proportions of age classes-at-length can exist on a small spatial scale. These differences are caused by regional variation in both length-at-age and relative abundance at age. As the length-at-age data are normally not weighted by the local catch rate (abundance), the ALK of the combined age data can result in strongly biased estimates of numbers-at-age. In the present case, the use of unweighted age data would have resulted in an overestimate of recruitment of nearly 200 % and an underestimate of spawning stock biomass of 15 %. Comparing ALKs using this method has several practical applications in fisheries science.

As most prior mitogenomic studies have addressed resolving basal or very divergent relationships, this study uses mitochondrial genomes among a closely related group of taxa to address taxonomic relationships {{with a focus on}} the biogeography of recently diverged species. Maximum parsimony, neighbour-joining and maximum likelihood all produced the same relationships when using mtDNA genomic sequences representing 14036 base pairs and consistently supported at least 8 of 10 nodes. Of these nodes, at least 6 were supported with 95 % or greater bootstrap support. [...] Among the individual mtDNA protein-coding genes, subunits of the ND complex included both the most successful (e. g. ND 1 and ND 5) and some of the least successful (e. g. ND 6) genes for resolving phylogenetic relationships among these taxa. Amino acid sequences supported at least 6 of the nodes in common with nucleotide data and even suggested a functional evolutionary difference for ND 5 among Theragra, relative to Gadus. [...] The phylogenetic analysis identified the following relationships: Melanogrammus and Merlangius as sister taxa, a clade composed of Boreogadus, Arctogadus, Theragra and Gadus with Theragra and G. morhua as sister taxa, and a close relationship between one of two G. macrocephalus individuals and the two G. ogac individuals. Microgadus proximus was used to root the tree, and Pollachius was resolved as the outgroup to the other above mentioned species. These results suggest that Theragra chalcogramma should now be included as Gadus chalcogrammus, and that G. ogac represents a northward and eastward extension of the Pacific G. macrocephalus and should be included as a subspecies, G. macrocephalus ogac. The close evolutionary relationship between Theragra and G. morhua may therefore explain their common ability to have sustained the two largest fisheries in the world. The data also supports separate invasions of the Pacific basin by species endemic to these waters, and suggests that there has been at least one occurrence of secondary Atlantic Ocean contact with the introduction of G. macrocephalus ogac.

The first mechanism was the inversion of the open reading frame within the transcript. The second mechanism was the linking of the MH Class I transcript with the transcript of another gene.

Among the 404 eggs tested, 80 % of positive amplification was obtained for rocklings eggs and 86. 36 % for Gadidae eggs. Eggs from Enchelyopus cimbrius, Ciliata mustela and Ciliata septentrionalis, and Gadus morhua, Merlangius merlangus and <b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> were distinguished. with this method. Based on morphological characters, the percentage of misidentification was less for cod than whiting...|$|R

[...] Eight {{species of}} {{protozoan}} parasites are reported - three each of Trypanosoma and Haemogregarina, {{and two of}} Haemohormidium. [...] Trypanosoma rajae Laveran & Mesnil is recorded from Raja radiata. Undetermined trypanosomes are reported from Glyptocephalus cynoglossus and Gadus morhua respectively. [...] Haemogregarina myoxocephali Fantham et al. was found in Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus. The occurrence of haemogregarine sporozoites (perhaps of this species) in the gut of a piscicolid leech (Malmiana nuda) from Myoxocephalus scorpius represents the first discovery of a potential vector of any fish haemogregarine. New hosts are listed for H. delagei Laveran & Mesnil and H. platessae Lebailly. [...] Haemohormidium terraenovae n. sp. Is described from six hosts:- Ammodytes americanus, Urophycis tenuis, <b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus,</b> Limanda ferruginea, Glyptocephalus cynoglossus and Hippoglossoides platessoides; and Haemohormidium beckeri n. sp. from Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus. [...] Intraerythrocytic inclusions of unknown origin were common in Clupea harengus and Argentina silus, and myxosporidans occurred as blood film contaminants in Raja radiata and Gadus morhua (in the latter case the parasite was referable to Kudoa sp.). Other artifacts reported were bacterial contaminants from Squalus acanthias and Limanda ferruginea...|$|R
40|$|Escapement of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> aegle nus) and saithe (Pollachius virens) {{beneath a}} {{commercial}} bottom trawl, rigged with a 60 cm diameter rockhopper gear, was {{studied in the}} Barents Sea. The study was performed {{off the coast of}} north Norway in March/April 2003. In order to collect the escapees, three sampling bags were attached behind the rockhopper gear. Approximately one third of the cod and a quarter of the haddock available to the trawl escaped. Cod escape rates were highly length dependent, following a sigmoid curve with an estimated length at 50 % escape of 38. 5 cm and interquartile width of 34. 1 cm. Length dependence was less pronounced in haddock. The escape rate of saithe was not length dependent, and on average seven percent passed under the trawl's shing line. Fish abundance had no observable effects on escape rates. Both video observations and scale abrasions on the fi sh caught in the collecting bags showed that some of the escaped fish had been overrun by the gear...|$|R
