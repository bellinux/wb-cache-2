We hypothesized that rate-dependent LAP(peak) response differs depending on E/Em in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and results A total of 331 patients (68. 0 % male, 59. 8 +/- 10. 8 years old) undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for AF were included, and their LAP(peak) in sinus rhythm was recorded {{at the beginning of the}} procedure and at the HRs of 90, 100, 110, and 120 b. p. m. during right atrial pacing and isoproterenol (<b>ISO-stress)</b> infusion. We compared LAP(peak) changes between patients with E/Em ?= 15 (n = 58) and those with ? 15 (n = 273). (i) The patterns of pacing rate-dependent LAP(peak) increase were similar in both the E/Em ? 15 (P? 0. 001) and E/Em ?= 15 groups (P = 0. 002). (ii) The <b>ISO-stress</b> reduced LAP(peak) in patients with E/Em? 15 (P = 0. 015), but not in those with E/Em ?= 15 (P = 0. 582). (iii) Paradoxical <b>ISO-stress</b> LAP elevation in patients with E/Em ?= 15 was independently associated with 1 -year follow-up E/Em reduction (B = - 4. 07, 95 % CI - 5. 41 to - 2. 72, P? 0. 001). Coexistence of E/Em ?= 15 and <b>ISO-stress</b> LAP elevation increased specificity in predicting 1 -year follow-up E/Em reduction after AF ablation than E/Em alone. Conclusion Isoproterenol LAP(peak) reduction was blunted in patients with impaired LV diastolic function estimated by E/Em ?= 15. The improvement of LV diastolic dysfunction 1 year after AF ablation was independently associated with both paradoxical <b>ISO-stress</b> LAP elevation and E/Em ?= 15 at the time of procedure.

Friction-stir-welded specimens with a butt joint configuration were prepared, and quasi-static tensile tests were conducted, to evaluate the tensile properties of DP 980 dual-phase steels. The friction-stir welding {{led to the formation}} of martensite and a significant hardness rise in the stir zone (SZ), but the presence of a soft zone in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) was caused by tempering of the pre-existing martensite. Owing to the appearance of severe soft zone, DP 980 FSW joint showed almost 93 % joint efficiency with the view-point of ultimate tensile strength and relatively low ductility than the base metal (BM). The local tensile deformation characteristic of the FSW joints was also examined using the digital image correlation (DIC) methodology by mapping the global and local strain distribution, and was subsequently analyzed by mechanics calculation. It is found that the tensile deformation of the FSW joints is highly heterogeneous, leading to a significant decrease in global ductility. The HAZ of the joints is the weakest region where the strain localizes early, and this localization extends until fracture with a strain near 30 %, while the strain in the SZ and BM is only 1 % and 4 %, respectively. Local constitutive properties in different heterogeneous regions through the friction-stir-welded joint was also briefly evaluated by assuming <b>iso-stress</b> conditions.

Producing thermonuclear fusion {{in the laboratory}} requires a detailed understanding of material properties {{beyond the scope of}} condensed matter or classical plasma physics, requiring experimental data to improve models describing matter in these extreme states. This thesis reports the development of two improved methods to probe highly compressed matter using x-ray diagnostics. The first method uses time-resolved x-ray diffraction to infer the stresses in compressed polycrystalline materials. X-ray diffraction is capable of measuring strain states and densities in shock-compressed materials with significantly higher accurately than existing shock timing and velocimetry diagnostics. The analysis discussed in this thesis calculates Debye-Scherrer diffraction patterns from highly stressed polycrystalline samples in the Reuss (<b>iso-stress)</b> limit. In this limit, elastic anisotropy and sample texture effects are directly modeled using elastic constants to calculate lattice strains for all initial crystallite orientations. Example diffraction patterns showing the effects of probing geometry, deviatoric stresses, and sample texture are presented to highlight the versatility of the technique. Finally, I present the design of a recent experiment conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source to measure the strength of polycrystalline diamond whose data can be analyzed using this technique. The second method uses x-ray fluorescence (XRF) to measure density, ionization state populations, and electron temperature in shocked materials. Spatially resolved K-alpha intensity measurements enable measurements of ion density profiles. Ionization state distributions and electron temperatures are constrained by comparing K-alpha spectra to spectra from atomic-physics simulations using the computer code CRETIN.

Until now, sensorless position estimation of SMA actuators under dynamic unknown applied stresses has not been feasible due to the complexity of the system and the number of unknown parameters which the proposed extra information obtained from the embedded sensor solves. In this thesis, a novel laser processed NiTi Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator is proposed containing two di erent material compositions in one monolithic piece of actuator wire. Each of these compositions behaves di erently at room temperature, one exhibits a shape memory e ect (SME) for actuation, and the other is pseudo-elastic (PE) which is used to enable an embedded sensor. Fabrication of the wire included laser processing, heat-treatment, and cold-working procedures. The actuator wire was subsequently trained to stabilize its properties using <b>iso-stress</b> thermal cycling.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach to}} model the elasto-plastic and tensile damage response of tri-axially braided carbon-fiber polymeric-matrix composites is developed. It is micromechanically based and consists of a simplified unit cell geometry, a plane-stress tow-level constitutive relationship, a one-dimensional undulation constitutive law, and a non-traditional shell element integration rule. The braided composite lamina is idealized as periodic in the plane, and a simplified three-layer representative volume (RV) is assembled from axial and braider tows and pure resin regions. The constituents in each layer are homogenized with an iso-strain assumption in the fiber-direction and an <b>iso-stress</b> condition in the other directions. In {{the upper and lower}} layers, the fiber-direction strain is additively decomposed into an undulation and a tow portion. A finite-deformation tow model predicts the plane-stress tow response and is coupled to the undulation constitutive relationship. The overall braid model is implemented in DYNA 3 D and works with traditional shell elements. The finite-deformation tow constitutive relationship is derived from the fiber elasticity and the isotropic elasto-plastic power-law hardening matrix response using a thermodynamic framework and simple homogenization assumptions. The model replicates tensile damage evolution, in a smeared sense, parallel and perpendicular to the fiber axis and is regularized to yield mesh independent results. The tow-level model demonstrates reasonable agreement, prior to damage, with detailed three-dimensional FE (finite element) elasto-plastic simulations of aligned, periodically arranged, uni-directional composites. The 3 -layer braid model response is compared with predictions obtained from detailed micromechanical simulations of the braid's unit cell in uni-axial extension, shear, and flexure for three braid angles. The elastic properties show good agreement as does the non-linear response for loadings dominated by the axial tows. In loadings dominated by the braider tow response, the absence of a non-linear undulation model deteriorates the agreement. Nonetheless, the present approach is applicable to a broad range of tri-axially braided composites as well as for unidirectional composites, but presently lacks any compressive failure mechanisms and an adequate non-linear undulation model...|$|E
30|$|Mesoscopic {{structures}} of braided composites {{can be represented}} by various methods. A pioneering work was done by Lomov et al. (2001) who developed a software tool, WiseTex, for geometry modelling of internal structure of textile reinforcement, such as 2 D/ 3 D woven, bi-axial/tri-axial braided and knitted etc., transferring data into general FE codes. A similar work {{was carried out by}} a Textile Composites Research Group at the University of Nottingham in UK (Wong et al. 2006). A Python-based open-source software, TexGen, combined geometry building with volume-meshing algorithms. In addition, a well-known mosaic model and a sub-cell model (Aitharaju and Averill 1999) were developed. In the former, a composite structure was discretised into a mosaic assemblage, with each mosaic brick element having distinct material properties. Global displacement or stress could be applied to the macro level model and then transferred to mosaic blocks using <b>iso-stress</b> or iso-strain conditions (Bogdanovich 2009). Sub-cell FE models considered a meso-structure of textile composites in terms of simplified RUC representations. However, instead of being homogenized, the RUC was decomposed into three or four sub-cells, and their effective elastic constants were obtained by micromechanical analysis (Aitharaju and Averill 1999) employing equivalent (Zhou et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014 a) or idealized laminate (Xiao et al. 2007). FE models for the RUCs were subsequently constructed using solid elements of each set of property according to their locations in the RUC. Based on this approach, a generalized method of cells (GMC) was developed (Qi et al. 2014; Bednarcyk et al. 2015). GMC considers a periodic repeating unit cell and is limited to four sub-cells (one for fibre and three for matrix). This theory was firstly generalised by Paley and Aboudi (1992) to consider an arbitrary number of sub-cells and constituent phases. The resulting GMC enables analysis of repeating unit cells containing more than two constituent materials, a more refined fibre shape, and various fibre architectures. Using GMC, Liu et al. (2011) built a framework for a three-scale analysis of tri-axially braided composites, and effective properties of the RUC at each scale were determined. The advantages and shortcomings of these topological meso-geometry models were pointed out by Fang and Liang (2011). The main advantage was that the meso-scale models obtained with these methods could be meshed easily. However, this scheme faced the challenges of internal continuity and stress-singularity problems, which were caused by distinctive elastic properties of two adjacent mosaic blocks (Dai and Cunningham, 2016). Also, realistic meso-geometrical configurations were ignored in the topological methods. Recently, virtual descriptions of the geometries of braided textiles were developed using 3 D SolidWorks and CATIA (Ji et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2016 b). These versatile geometric unit cells were highly flexible and dynamic in nature, capable of simulating textile tightening, accommodated by yarn deformation and spatial constraint. The unit-cell geometries were then fed into FE analysis packages to determine their individual and continuum-mechanical characteristics (Ji et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of {{dual phase}} titanium alloys {{has been investigated}} using experimental and modelling methods. The motivation for conducting this investigation was to improve understanding of the deformation behaviour of dual phase titanium alloys in order {{to contribute to the}} long term goal of reducing manufacturing cost and improving production efficiency. Dual phase titanium alloys have been studied under two deformation conditions: high speed machining and uniaxial compression, which represent respectively high rate and low rate deformation. The microstructure and texture of the serrated chips obtained during high speed cutting of the dual phase Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy have been studied. The cutting speed, depth of cut and the orientation of the sample were found to have a significant influence on the deformation of serrated chips. Adiabatic shear bands were found in the serrated chips due to non-uniform deformation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy and deformation heating. In addition, there is reasonable agreement between the predicted texture using the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model and the measured texture using the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique indicating that the deformation in an adiabatic shear band is due to shear. The deformation behaviour of dual phase Ti-Mn alloys has been characterised with uniaxial compression at different temperatures and strain rates. The flow stress plateau phenomenon was observed in all the Ti-Mn alloys in the low to medium temperature range (27 ~ 500 °C), which is attributed to the occurrence of dynamic strain aging (DSA). The flow softening behaviour was observed in dual phase Ti-Mn alloys in the high to sub-transus temperature range (600 ~ 800 °C), which is attributed to the change in volume fraction of β phase during deformation due to the rise in temperature caused by deformation heating. The yield point phenomenon was observed when the Ti-Mn alloys are above their β transus temperatures. This phenomenon has been attributed to the multiplication of dislocations at the beginning of plastic deformation and dynamic recovery in the following plastic deformation. The strain rate sensitivity of Ti-Mn alloys was low in the low to medium temperature range and thus the effect of strain rate on deformation is not obvious. However, it was high in the high to sub-transus temperature range and thus the effect of strain rate on the deformation is significant. The 0. 2 % proof stress was found to increase with the volume fraction of β phase. The strain rate sensitivity was found to decrease with the volume fraction of β phase in the low to medium temperature range because the strain rate sensitivity of the α phase is higher than the β phase. However, the strain rate sensitivity was found to increase with the volume fraction of β phase at high temperatures because the strain rate sensitivity of the β phase becomes larger than the α phase. A considerable temperature rise was observed during compression of the Ti-Mn alloys and this indicates that the effect of deformation heating on deformation is not negligible. A composite model has been constructed to predict the plastic stress-strain curves of the dual phase Ti-Mn alloys using the in-situ behaviour of the component phases. The partition of stress and strain between the component phases has been accounted for by using three partitioning assumptions: iso-strain, <b>iso-stress</b> and iso-work. There was good agreement between the predicted curves and the experimental curves. It was found that the in-situ behaviour of the α phase is different in different dual phase Ti-Mn alloys and it exhibits a linear relationship with the volume fraction of β phase when the dominant matrix is the same. The modelling results in the low to medium temperature range indicate that most of the plastic deformation occurs in the localised shear band, which is consistent with the experimental observation that the dual phase Ti-Mn alloys were more susceptible to the formation of localised shear bands. In addition, it was found that a change in the dominant matrix in dual phase Ti-Mn alloys significantly influences the in-situ behaviour of the α phase. The modelling results in the high to sub-transus temperature range indicate that the flow softening behaviour observed in dual phase Ti-Mn alloys is related to the change in volume fraction of the β phase and the diffusion of Mn during the deformation...|$|E
