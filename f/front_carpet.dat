60|$|He had no {{ground for}} {{thinking}} Daly noticed {{him during the}} meal, and {{did not see the}} man for an hour afterwards. Then finding that he wanted a railway guide he had left in his room, he went up the stairs and along a corridor.

2500|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} Safavid carpets {{can be attributed}} to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure: Seven different types of carpets were identified: Garden carpets (depicting formal gardens and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medaillon designs with offset medaillons and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. The first and third weft are made of wool, and lie hidden in the center of the carpet. The middle weft is of silk or cotton, and passes from the back to the <b>front.</b> When the <b>carpets</b> are worn, this third weft evokes a characteristic, [...] "tram line" [...] effect.|$|R
