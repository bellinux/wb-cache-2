25|$|The 1900 {{portrait}} depicts Williams {{from the}} left side. She is wearing a black dress with red stripes, a pair of red ribbon bowties, and a red ribbon around her neck. Williams's hair is worn down, set against a dark brown background. Her cheek is slightly sunken. Her expression is much softer, virtually inscrutable. The portrait was originally painted on a 24 x 20inch canvas. Eakins cut two <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> the right side, and tacked it to a new stretcher. This {{had the effect of}} re-centering the work on Williams's face.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells were}} {{extremely}} small, with three concrete walls with no windows, {{and a solid}} steel door with a five-inch square window facing the corridor. The cells contained only a wash basin/toilet combination (cold water only), and a radio selector (there were two channels), and a concrete pad covered with a sheet of plywood four <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> the floor on which the inmates slept. Inmates could not control {{the volume of the}} radio nor the temperature of the cell. The lights in the cell remained on 24 hours a day, but were dimmed to 25 watts at night.|$|E

25|$|After King Drupada and King Virata were slain by Drona, Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna fought him on {{the fifteenth}} day. Because Drona was very {{powerful}} and inconquerable having the irresistible Brahmanda astra, Krishna hinted to Yudhishthira that Drona would give up his arms if his son Ashwatthama was dead. Bhima proceeded to kill an elephant named Ashwatthama and loudly proclaimed that Ashwatthama was dead. Drona approached Yudhishthira to seek the truth of his son's death. Yudhishthira proclaimed Ashwathama Hatahath, Naro Va Kunjaro Va, implying Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure {{whether it was a}} Drona's son or an elephant, The latter part of his proclamation (Naro va Kunjaro va) were drowned out by sound of the conch blown by Krishna intentionally (a different version of the story is that Yudhishthira pronounced the last words so feebly that Drona could not hear the word elephant). Prior to this incident, the chariot of Yudhishthira, proclaimed as Dharma raja (King of righteousness), hovered a few <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> the ground. After the event, the chariot landed on the ground as he lied.|$|E
25|$|Research by Creationist Geology Professor Steven A. Austin {{and colleagues}} {{published}} in 2000 suggested that widely separated archaeological excavations {{in the countries}} of Israel and Jordan contain late Iron Age (Iron IIb) architecture bearing damage from a great earthquake. Earthquake debris at six sites (Hazor, Deir 'Alla, Gezer, Lachish, Tell Judeideh, and 'En Haseva), is tightly confined stratigraphically {{to the middle of}} the 8th century BC, with dating errors of ~30 years. Excavations by archaeologist Yigael Yadin in Hazor's Stratum VI revealed southward tilted walls, inclined pillars, and collapsed houses, in even some of the strongest architecture, arguing that the earthquake waves were propagated from the north. The excavation in the city of Gezer revealed severe earthquake damage. The outer wall of the city shows hewn stones weighing tons that have been cracked and displaced several <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> their foundation. The lower part of the wall was displaced outward (away from the city), whereas the upper part of the wall fell inward (toward the city) still lying course-on-course, indicating the sudden collapse of the wall.|$|E

2500|$|The shells were {{propelled}} {{at such a}} {{high velocity}} that each successive shot wore away {{a considerable amount of}} steel from the rifled bore. Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore, and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of [...] with a new set of shells.|$|E
2500|$|Following a rough outing in long {{relief for}} Jacob Turner the {{previous}} day, the Nationals designated him for assignment on July 1. Left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was activated off the 60-day disabled list. The Nationals rallied {{in the ninth}} inning of their July 1 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, scoring a run and loading the bases against closer Trevor Rosenthal. St. Louis brought in reliever Matt Bowman to try to nail down his first career save, while Nationals manager Dusty Baker sent infielder Adrián Sánchez to the plate to pinch-hit in his first MLB at-bat. Sánchez worked the count full before taking a pitch roughly six <b>inches</b> <b>off</b> the plate away for what would have been ball four and a game-tying walk, but home plate umpire Manny Gonzalez called him out on strikes to end the game at 2–1 in the Cardinals' favor. Baker praised Sánchez after the game, saying the call [...] "just wasn't fair to him" [...] and remarking, [...] "You hate to have an at-bat like that and have it settled on apparently a bad call." [...] In the following game, on July 2, minutes after being named to play in the 2017 All-Star Game as the top overall National League vote-getter, right fielder Bryce Harper hit two home runs off fellow All-Star Carlos Martínez. Starting pitcher Max Scherzer, also named to the All-Star roster, struck out 12 Cardinals while allowing no runs in seven innings to earn the 7–2 win.|$|E
2500|$|Beak {{trimming}} {{was developed}} at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s. [...] The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6mm (1/4 <b>inch)</b> <b>off</b> the beak. It was thought that {{the tip of the}} beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.|$|R
