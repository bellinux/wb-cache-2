5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity {{from right to}} left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it would have killed Voss {{in less than a}} minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's <b>firing</b> <b>angle.</b> Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E
5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum <b>firing</b> <b>angle</b> for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Proportional- Integral (PI) {{controllers}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular controllers in industry. In this paper, this controller is applied to control the <b>fire</b> <b>angle</b> of synchronous VAR compensator (SVC). The SVC is member of FACTS device that have excellent properties in reactive power control and real power loss reduction. In synchronous VAR compensator, the <b>fire</b> <b>angle</b> controls the level of injected reactive power to power network. Therefore the value of the <b>fire</b> <b>angle</b> must be controlled based on power network condition. In this paper the usage of PI controller is proposed for this purpose. In PI controller, the parameters of this controller have vital role in performance of controller. If these parameters don’t tuned properly, the controller will has poor performance. Therefore in this study, a novel method is proposed for selecting of these free parameters. In the proposed, genetic algorithm is used to tune the free parameters of PI controller. The proposed method is tested on power network and the computer simulation results show that the proposed method has good accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{unbalanced}} three-phase load may {{be transformed}} into balanced load by {{the implementation of the}} reactive compensator. The balanced operation of the three-phase load requires an unbalanced reactive compensator, by that more amount of harmonics are generated. A three- phase reactive compensator includes thyristor- controlled reactors and switched capacitors is developed in this paper to evaluate the optimum values of reactive volt- amperes generated by the compensator. The calculations of reactive volt- amperes are {{based on the fact that}} the addition or subtraction of the same volt-amperes for three brunches of unbalanced TCR does not change the balanced operation of the load, but can modulate the amount of harmonics generated by the reactive compensator. This balanced-change in volt-amperes of TCR can be equalized by the three-phase thyristor-switched capacitor (TSC). Different sets of <b>firing</b> <b>angles</b> for thyistors are determined. All sets of <b>firing</b> <b>angles</b> balance the load and generate different amount of harmonics.

The British tanks were between [...] and [...] away from the German line of advance, whereas the Canadian squadron was around [...] away. Reid argues that due to the Canadians' proximity to the Germans, and the <b>firing</b> <b>angle,</b> their troops more than likely can be credited with the destruction of Wittmann's tank.

Ekin's crew was credited with the destruction of 3 Tigers, at 12h40, 12h47 and 12h52, Wittmann's tank being probably the one destroyed at 12h47.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elementary {{analysis on the}} difference and similarity between upslope fire and jump fire, {{by a series of}} experiments performed in laboratory. The rate of spread (ROS), <b>fire</b> line <b>angle</b> (separation angle of the two fire lines), angular velocity of fire line, flame residence time and non-dimensional radiant heat transfer for the two kinds of phenomena are investigated. For upslope fire, it is found that ROS remains almost steady for line ignition, while it increases with time for point ignition. For upslope fires with line ignition, the <b>fire</b> line <b>angle</b> decreases with time from the initial 180 o to a steady small value, while for point ignition, the initially generated <b>fire</b> line <b>angle</b> remains steady. The angular velocity of fire line does not depend on slope angle in an upslope fire with line ignition. For jump fire, the ROS first increases sharply and then decreases gradually, and it depends on slope angle more significantly than the initial <b>fire</b> line <b>angle.</b> The <b>fire</b> line <b>angle</b> increases with time, and the angular velocity of fire line varies with slope <b>angle.</b> For upslope <b>fires</b> with line ignition, the flame residence time increases with slope angle, while it remains almost constant for upslope tests with point ignition.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new approach}} to maximize the amount of power generated by the switched reluctance generator (SRG) in the low and medium speed operations. There are many control variables which affect the power generated such as: <b>firing</b> <b>angles,</b> reference current, speed and voltage. It will incur high costs and time consuming to modify the variables using experimental set up. Hence, to minimize time, cost and aid in the manufacturing industry, a simulation model of the overall SRG drive is developed. The objective of the work is to identify the optimal parameters and characterize them under closed loop control. The study indicates that there is an optimal voltage, <b>firing</b> <b>angles</b> and reference current at each speed range. Also, the percentage of the power generated can be categorized as a function of dwell angle and speed at optimal voltage level. The optimal dwell angle is determined using the least square method. Within the closed loop system, the high percentage of power generated can be maintained by adjusting the voltage level. It allows operation in single pulse mode as opposed to the conventional current chopping during the low and medium speed. 13 page(s...|$|R
