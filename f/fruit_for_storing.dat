40|$|Storage and {{transport}} of litchi fruit at low temperature is widely practiced commercially. In this study, no pericarp browning was evident at out-turn on litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 10 and 20 days at cold temperature of 3 – 5 °C, but <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 10 days at 3 – 5 °C gradually browned after 12 h of shelf time {{at ambient temperature}} of 25 °C, with the browning index (BI) being elevated to 2. 5 at 24 h of shelf life. Furthermore, <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 30 days began to rot and had a decay incidence of about 30 % after 24 h on the shelf. The temperature increment from 3 – 5 to 25 °C induced marked increases in activities of lipase, phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX). Litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 10 days at 3 – 5 °C followed by the shelf time at 25 °C had lower activities of lipase, PLD and LOX, and also lower levels of membrane permeability, than did <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 20 and 30 days. Energy level of the pericarp tissue of cold-stored litchi fruit was similarly dependent on storage time at 3 – 5 °C plus shelf time at 25 °C. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and adenylate energy charge (AEC) level in pericarp tissues decreased as cold storage progressed. However, ATP and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) contents, and the AEC levels, in cold-stored litchi fruit increased during shelf time at 25 °C, reaching a peak after 6 h, and then decreasing. <b>Fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 30 days at 3 – 5 °C had much lower ATP content and AEC level than <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 10 and 20 days. Increased activities of lipase, PLD and LOX, and energy shortage in cold-stored pericarp tissues during subsequent shelf time at 25 °C suggest that the deterioration of membrane integrity and loss of compartmentation gives rise to accelerated browning and fruit quality deterioration...|$|R
40|$|After harvest, {{macaw palm}} fruits show high {{deterioration}} rates when improperly preserved. A possible cause {{is the high}} fruit water content favoring enzymatic and microbiological degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of drying on the mesocarp oil quality during storage and to set the drying curve of macaw palm <b>fruits.</b> <b>For</b> that, two experiments were carried out. In the first, the drying curve of macaw palm fruits was determined at 60 °C, and mathematical models were defined for the process. Drying was performed with freshly harvested fruits (S 0) and with <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 20 days after harvest (S 20). <b>Fruits</b> were <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 20 days after harvested and then went through drying. The fruits were dried in a prototype dryer at 60 °C. After drying, the <b>fruits</b> were <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> different periods (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 days) and evaluated for oil physicochemical parameters. When compared to S 0, drying of macaw palm fruits in the S 20 treatment showed a lower drying time until equilibrium moisture was reached. In general, all the mathematical models tested were adequate to describe the drying process. Fruits dried at 60 °C controlled mesocarp oil acidification for up to 90 days in storage. On the other hand, drying impaired the mesocarp oil oxidative stability. We may conclude that the drying process is efficient to maintain acidity during the storage of macaw palm fruits...|$|R

40|$|Wide-angle x-ray {{diffraction}} {{has provided evidence}} for lipid phase separations in microsomal membranes from chill-injured tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv Caruso) <b>fruit.</b> Mature-green <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 20 d at 5 [deg]C had not begun to ripen and were essentially free of chilling injury symptoms. Within 4 d of being returned to 25 [deg]C, however, the fruit displayed characteristic symptoms of chilling injury, including translucent water-soaked patches, surface pitting, and irregular pigmentation. Membrane damage measured as electrolyte leakage from pericarp discs intensified after the fruit were returned to ambient temperature. Wide-angle {{x-ray diffraction}} patterns recorded at 25 [deg]C for microsomal membranes isolated from untreated, mature-green fruit indicated that the membrane bilayers were exclusively liquid-crystalline. Diffraction patterns for microsomal membranes from <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 20 d at 5 [deg]C showed only trace amounts of gel phase lipid, but within 4 d of subsequent exposure of the fruit to ambient temperature, there was evidence for a pronounced lateral phase separation of lipids within the membranes that would render them leaky. Inas-much as the phase separations were detectable at 25 [deg]C and became pronounced only subsequent to the chilling episode, {{they appear to be}} an indirect rather than direct effect of exposure to low temperature.

The up-regulated proteins were mainly associated with cell wall degradation, lipid degradation, protein degradation, senescence-related transcription factors, and transcription-related proteins. In contrast, most proteins associated with ATP synthesis and scavenging of reactive oxygen species were significantly down-regulated during peel senescence. Three thioredoxin proteins and three Ca 2 + signaling-related proteins were significantly up-regulated during peel senescence. It is suggested that mandarin peel senescence is associated with energy supply efficiency, decreased antioxidant capability, and increased protein and lipid degradation.

40|$|In {{eggplant}} cultivars Black Beauty, Emi, Long Negro and Tsakoniki cultivated for seed, {{flower induction}} and flower weight decreased {{in the presence}} of developing fruit on the plant. Harvesting prior to maturity (25 - 35 days after anthesis), aimed at increasing flower induction and fruit set, resulted in small seeds that failed to germinate or germinated poorly. When these <b>fruit</b> were <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 20 days at 25 ± 30 C before seed extraction, seed size and germination increased indicating seed filling and maturation (‘after-ripening’) within the harvested fruit. In year 1, a single application of ethylene before storage increased the germination of Black Beauty and Long Negro harvested 25 - 35 days after anthesis, but reduced that of Emi and Tsakoniki. In year 2, ethylene application once before the storage of fruits harvested 35 days after anthesis promoted the germination of Tsakoniki and Emi, and when ethylene was applied three times germination was increased further.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{importance}} of ethylene in avocado ripening {{has been extensively}} studied. In contrast, {{little is known about}} the possible role of abscisic acid (ABA). The present work studied the effect of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) (0. 3 μL L− 1), e+® Ethylene Remover and the combination thereof on the quality of imported avocado cv. Hass <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 7 days at 12 °C. Ethylene production, respiration, firmness, colour, heptose (C 7) sugars and ABA concentrations in mesocarp tissue were measured throughout storage. RESULTS Treatment with e+® Ethylene Remover reduced ethylene production, respiration rate and physiological ripening compared with controls. Fruit treated with 1 -MCP + e+® Ethylene Remover and, to a lesser extent 1 -MCP alone, had the lowest ethylene production and respiration rate and hence the best quality. Major sugars measured in mesocarp tissue were mannoheptulose and perseitol, and their content was not correlated with ripening parameters. Mesocarp ABA concentration, as determined by mass spectrometry, increased as fruit ripened and was negatively correlated with fruit firmness. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest a relationship between ABA and ethylene metabolism since blocking ethylene, and to a larger extent blocking and removing ethylene, resulted in lower ABA concentrations. Whether ABA influences avocado fruit ripening needs to be determined in future research. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
40|$|Banana fruit {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to chilling injury during low temperature storage. Experiments {{were conducted to}} compare ethylene binding during storage at chilling (3 and 8 degreesC) versus optimum (13 degreesC) temperatures. The skins of fruit stored at 3 and 8 degreesC gradually darkened as storage duration increased. This chilling effect was reflected in increasing membrane permeability as shown by increased relative electrolyte leakage from skin tissue. In contrast, banana <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 8 days at 13 degreesC showed no chilling injury symptoms. Exposure of banana fruit to the ethylene binding inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 mul l(- 1) 1 -MCP) prevented ripening. However, this treatment also enhanced the chilling injury accelerated the occurrence of chilling injury-associated increased membrane permeability. C- 14 -ethylene release assay showed that ethylene binding by banana fruit stored at low temperature decreased with reduced storage temperature and/or prolonged storage time. Fruit exposed to 1 -MCP for 12 h and then stored at 3 or 8 degreesC exhibited lower ethylene binding than those stored at 13 degreesC. Thus, chilling injury of banana fruit stored at low temperature {{is associated with a}} decrease in ethylene binding. The ability of tissue to respond to ethylene is evidently reduced, thereby resulting in failure to ripen...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} had the {{objective}} of evaluating the post-harvest conservation of ‘Tommy Atkins’ mangoes, treated with different concentrations of 1 -MCP, stored under refrigeration. The treatments were several concentrations of 1 -MCP, 0, 100, 300 and 600 nL L- 1, for 12 hours in isolated chambers at temperature of 25 °C. After opening the chambers, fruits were stored at temperatures of 25 ° C, 75 ± 5 % of RH and 10 ° C, 70 ± 5 % of RH for 28 days. The experimental design was a completely randomized in a factorial 4 x 6 x 2. Four repetitions were used per treatment, with five fruits per plot. The analyzed variables were the loss of mass, the firmness, the vitamin C, the total and reducer sugars and the carotenoids contents. Under {{the conditions in which}} the experiment was carried out, it can be concluded that: post-harvest applications of 1 -MCP on ‘Tommy Atkins’ mangoes were effective in reducing the physiological metabolism of fruits maturation; 1 -MCP and refrigeration associated were effective in keeping <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> 28 days after harvesting; the 1 -MCP concentration of 600 nL L - 1 was considered the most efficient in reducing the ripening of fruits at 10 °C and 25 °C...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Degreening is a postharvest {{technique}} {{that consists of}} applying ethylene to oranges fresh fruits to improve skin color. In Brazil, this technique is still not widely applied {{due to a lack}} of specific research, resulting in poor fruit coloration, which limits the oranges&# 8217; exportation. The objective of this study was to investigate the de-greening effect of ethylene application after cold storage in &# 8216;Valencia&# 8217; oranges. The ethylene treatments (0; 5 and 10 µL L- 1 for 96 h at 22 °C) were applied after storage for 30 days at 5 °C. After ethylene application, the <b>fruit</b> were <b>stored</b> <b>for</b> three days at 22 °C to simulate a shelf life. The skin color rate enhanced after ethylene treatment due to increased chlorophyllase activity. The content of carotenoids did not change, nor did the soluble solids, titratable acidity, ratio, percentage of juice and ascorbic acid content. The levels of acetaldehyde and ethanol in the juice were also assessed, and unpleasant odors or flavors did not occur despite a small increase in the acetaldehyde content. Therefore, the ethylene application after cold storage is efficient to improve the skin color of &# 8216;Valencia&# 8217; orange without changing the internal quality...|$|R

40|$|Postharvest wastes of horticultural produce are {{enormous}} in Nigeria, requiring increasing {{efforts to reduce}} this spate. Therefore, colourless, blue, red and yellow polyethylene bags impregnated with or without sawdust were used <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> green mature plantain fruits. Control treatment was fruits lined on laboratory bench. Sample fruits enclosed in polyethylene were sealed under ambient laboratory conditions and thereafter opened weekly to assess postharvest changes. Inclusion of sawdust was {{not in any way}} more beneficial than without it. Relative light transmission through the four colours was expectedly different. Light intensity reduction by the colourless polyethylene was 3. 6 %, compared to 30 - 35 % reductions by blue and yellow polyethylene. Variation in light intensity transmitted explained about 90 % of weight loss in fruits. After three weeks of storage, weight loss from fruit stored in blue polyethylene was about 7 % compared to about 45 % in the control. Colour of polyethylene also significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced ripening pattern. Whereas 67 % of fruits stored in colourless, yellow and red polyethylene were still green after two weeks of storage, only 8 % of the control samples was still green. Organoleptic assessment of steamed boiled fruits after two weeks of storage revealed that fruits stored in blue and red polyethylene combined relatively high textural and general acceptability ratings, while fruits stored in yellow polyethylene had the highest textural rating. The general acceptability rating of fruits stored in yellow, red and blue polyethylene had highest relationship with flavour, but with taste - <b>for</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> in colourless polyethylene. Evidences from the study revealed that blue and yellow polyethylene transmitting lower light intensity ensured lowest fruit weight loss, delayed ripening and enhanced culinary quality traits, and are therefore suggested for further evaluation and use under high temperature environment...|$|R
