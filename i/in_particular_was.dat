5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>was</b> reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E
5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E

5|$|Barris {{remained}} {{heavily involved}} in production {{in an attempt to}} portray the film from his point of view. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts to lower their salaries.

The Gentleman's Magazine account <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> prominent, and contained the oldest known drawing of the figure. In 1774, the antiquarian John Hutchins reviewed various previous accounts in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset. In it, he wrote that the carving had only been done the previous century.|$|E

5|$|Each side {{considered}} {{how best}} to eliminate {{the threat posed by}} its opponent, and after Virginia returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under unfavorable circumstances. Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing; Jeffers <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing. Not only did the two ships not fight each other, neither ship ever fought again after March 9.|$|E
5|$|In Marchâ€“April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> opposed to it.

The system <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> flagged as one of five systems that appeared to have held more than one transiting exoplanet. Kepler-9b's discovery was announced on August 26, 2010.

5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

5|$|The French army {{of around}} 69,000 {{consisted}} of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns.

His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor.

5|$|The {{seventeenth century}} saw a {{second wave of}} {{building}} at Brasenose, started under the Principalship of Samuel Radcliffe. Under his leadership an attic story was added to Old Quad in the 1630s, and the current chapel and library both constructed between 1656 and 1666. The chapel, <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>was</b> a mix of architectural stylesâ€“ Gothic revival and baroqueâ€“ and thus not without criticism. The work totalled some Â£4,000, achieved eventually despite Brasenose's previous money problems; by 1680, college income was a sustainable Â£600 a year. A Senior Common Room, believed to be Staircase 2, Room 3, had been added by 1682.|$|E

5|$|Although other British {{forces were}} {{deployed}} during the year, most were engaged on other operations incidental {{to the main}} Atlantic campaign, such as the expeditionary force to the Cape of Good Hope under Commodore Home Riggs Popham. In addition, a number of blockade squadrons were deployed to the major ports of the French Atlantic coast. These forces contained the French warships still at anchor in the ports and restricted the return of French warships from service at sea during the campaign. These forces included a Channel squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis, whose ships intercepted and captured a frigate of Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite's squadron on 27 September, and blockade forces off Cadiz under the distant command of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood and Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis. Cornwallis <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>was</b> particularly effective: under his watch, only one French ship of the line successfully entered or departed Brest harbour during the year.|$|E
